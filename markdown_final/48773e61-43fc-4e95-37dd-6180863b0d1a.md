## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pair of terms best completes the sentence about factors that influence ethical decision-making, distinguishing person-related characteristics from environment- or issue-related features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core distinction being made in the stem. Then, I should verify which answer choices map cleanly to that distinction. Next, I will check whether the literature consistently uses the same terminology. Finally, I will confirm the correct pairing and briefly justify it with examples from the sources.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual split. The stem contrasts factors tied to the unique characteristics of a person with factors tied to the environment or the particular issue, which aligns with a classic individual versus situational (or contextual) dichotomy used across clinical ethics and decision science literature [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology. I initially thought "tailored" might fit because clinicians tailor decisions to individuals, but hold on, "tailored" is a descriptor of the process rather than a category of factors; the standard categories are individual (person-related) and situational/contextual (environment- or issue-related), which are repeatedly used in studies of ethical and clinical decision-making [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

> I will now examine the options against this framework. Options A and C place "tailored" first, which mislabels the category; "tailored" is not a factor class like individual or situational, so those are off. Option B reverses the order and puts "situational" first, which doesn't match the stem's sequence of person-related then environment-related. Option D preserves the intended order with "individual" followed by "situational", which matches the stem's logic and the literature's usage [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

> Let me consider concrete examples to ensure this maps correctly. Individual factors include clinician characteristics (age, experience, religion, risk attitude), patient values and preferences, and cognitive biases, whereas situational/contextual factors include resource constraints, institutional culture, time pressure, and the specific clinical scenario or environment; this is precisely how these terms are used in studies of end-of-life variability, ICU decision-making, and cognitive debiasing frameworks [^2d57e982] [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that no authoritative source in the packet contradicts this pairing. The documents consistently distinguish individual from situational or contextual influences on decisions, reinforcing that the correct completion is "individual" followed by "situational" to mirror the stem's sequence and meaning [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

> Final answer: D. Individual, Situational.

---

The correct answer is **D. Individual, Situational**. Ethical decision-making is shaped by **individual factors** (personal values, beliefs, personality, and cognitive biases) and **situational factors** (environmental context, social norms, organizational culture, and external pressures). This distinction is supported by psychological and ethical frameworks that separate person-level traits from context-level influences on moral judgment and behavior [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

---

## Individual factors

Individual factors are **person-specific traits and internal processes** that shape ethical decisions. These include:

- **Personal values and beliefs**: Core moral principles and worldviews guide judgments about right and wrong [^352d9a3e].

- **Personality traits**: Traits such as conscientiousness, empathy, and moral reasoning ability influence ethical behavior [^2d57e982].

- **Cognitive biases**: Systematic errors in thinking (e.g. confirmation bias, anchoring) can distort ethical judgment [^469338c0].

- **Emotional state**: Emotions like fear, guilt, or compassion can sway decisions and moral reasoning [^4be49db3].

- **Demographic characteristics**: Age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status shape ethical perspectives and decisions [^fb32cbda].

---

## Situational factors

Situational factors are **external influences and contextual elements** that impact ethical decisions. These include:

- **Environmental context**: Physical and social settings, including organizational culture and institutional norms, shape behavior [^4e389871].

- **Social norms and peer influence**: Group dynamics and societal expectations can pressure individuals toward certain decisions [^9865d7d0].

- **Organizational culture**: Workplace values, policies, and leadership styles influence ethical conduct [^9d8c0538].

- **External pressures**: Time constraints, resource limitations, and external demands can compromise ethical judgment [^2418c81b].

- **Legal and regulatory frameworks**: Laws and professional standards constrain and guide ethical choices [^d1cc71c1].

---

## Interaction between individual and situational factors

Individual and situational factors **interact dynamically**; for example, a person with strong moral values may still act unethically under extreme situational pressure, whereas a supportive environment can reinforce ethical behavior even in those with weaker moral inclinations. This interaction is well documented in studies of moral behavior and ethical decision-making [^469338c0] [^4e389871].

---

## Conclusion

Ethical decision-making is shaped by both **individual and situational factors**. Recognizing and balancing these influences is essential for ethical behavior in personal and professional contexts.

### Ethical? Toward whom? [^1146b9fa]. The American Psychologist (2012). Low credibility.

Comments on the original article, "Nonrational processes in ethical decision making" by M. D. Rogerson et al (see record 2011-19198-001). Among the many insightful points made by Rogerson, Gottlieb, Handelsman, Knapp, and Younggren (October 2011) regarding nonrational processes in ethical decision making, one deserves further explication: Many of psychologists' ethical decisions lead to actions done to someone. Unfortunately, frameworks and models of ethical decision making frequently neglect this fact by implying that the decisions happen in the abstract, but in truth, these decisions often affect a specific recipient. Importantly, the characteristics of that specific recipient, especially as perceived by the psychologist, can have a powerful impact on the process of ethical decision making (Caughron et al., 2011). It would be wise to add such a hypothetical to the list of specific questions that Rogerson et al recommended psychologists ask themselves: Would I make the same ethical decision if the person(s) toward whom the decision is directed had different characteristics?

### Real-world evidence to inform regulatory decision making: a scoping review [^165abf8a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Real-world evidence (RWE) is increasingly considered in regulatory decision making. When, and to which extent, RWE is considered relevant by regulators likely depends on many factors. This review aimed to identify factors that make RWE necessary or desirable to inform regulatory decision making. A scoping review was conducted using literature databases (PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) and websites of regulatory agencies, health technology assessment agencies, research institutes, and professional organizations involved with RWE. Articles were included if: (1) they discussed factors or contexts that impact whether RWE could be necessary or desirable in regulatory decision making; (2) focused on pharmacological or biological interventions in humans; and (3) considered decision making in Europe or North America, or without a focus on a specific region. We included 118 articles in the scoping review. Two major themes and six subthemes were identified. The first theme concerns questions addressable with RWE, with subthemes epidemiology and benefit-risk assessment. The second theme concerns contextual factors, with subthemes feasibility, ethical considerations, limitations of available evidence, and disease and treatment-specific aspects. Collectively, these themes encompassed 43 factors influencing the need for RWE in regulatory decisions. Although single factors may not make RWE fully necessary, their cumulative influence could make RWE essential and pivotal in regulatory decision making. This overview contributes to ongoing discussions emphasizing the nuanced interplay of factors influencing the necessity or desirability of RWE to inform regulatory decision making.

### Contextualizing medical decisions to individualize care: lessons from the qualitative sciences [^a8abff50]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical decision making can be described as answering one question: "What is the best next thing for this patient at this time?" In addition to incorporating clinical information, research evidence, and patient preferences, the process requires considering contextual factors that are unique to each patient and relevant to their care. The failure to do so, thereby compromising that care, can be called a "contextual error". Although proponents of evidence-based clinical decision making and many scholars of the medical interview emphasize the importance of individualizing care, no operational definition is provided for the concept, nor is any methodology proposed for the interpretation of clinically relevant patient-specific variables. By conceptualizing the physician-patient encounter as a participant-observer case study with an N of 1, this essay describes how existing approaches to studying social systems can provide clinicians with a systematic approach to individualizing their clinical decision making.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^ef97acca]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 3. The context of prevention with persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — essential considerations for providers — states that several broad, contextual issues shape the lives of persons with HIV and their ability to use HIV prevention and care services and adopt HIV prevention strategies, including individual, social, structural, ethical, legal, and policy issues that influence access to, use of, and delivery of HIV prevention and care services. Service providers who understand these contextual issues are described as better prepared to share responsibility and decision making for HIV prevention with persons with HIV, communicate in a sensitive, respectful, and culturally appropriate manner, motivate persons with HIV to adopt realistic, evidence-based prevention strategies, help persons with HIV obtain essential medical and social services, endorse the strategy of "treatment as prevention", recognize how contextual factors influence HIV transmission in their communities, and promote the development of community resources that offer prevention and care services. The section notes that it makes general recommendations about these contextual issues and that "Quality improvement and program monitoring and evaluation can determine if the interventions described in this section are implemented as intended, yield the expected outcomes, or warrant changes in delivery methods"; it defines quality improvement as "an approach to the continuous study and improvement of the processes of providing services that meet or exceed established professional standards and user expectations" and monitoring and evaluation as "a process that involves the repeated, ongoing collection and review of information about program activities, characteristics, and outcomes in order to assess program implementation, coverage, acceptability, cost, and effectiveness".

### Taking account of context in systematic reviews and guidelines considering a complexity perspective [^4e389871]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

How is context defined and understood?

A plethora of definitions exists for 'context', each varying in the extent to which they adopt an 'intervention perspective' or a 'system perspective'; making it problematic to privilege a single frame of reference.UK Medical Research Council guidance defines context as 'factors external to the intervention which may influence its implementation, or whether its mechanisms of impact act as intended'. Further guidance defines context as 'any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention is conceived, developed, implemented and evaluated'. Methodologically, a tension exists between the technical advantages of deciding on a single standardised definition of context and the conceptual richness of diverse and competing definitions. A systematic review should clearly articulate its internal definition of context, justify its selection and apply this definition consistently through the review process.

Context and setting, although used interchangeably, are not synonymous. The former typically carries an overarching sense while the latter is often locally bounded (eg, an acute hospital setting in a low-income or middle-income development context). Research and evaluation, broadly speaking, seek either to ignore, control, document or explore contextual variation. Many intervention and evaluation designs seek to ensure that the context for the intervention group is the same as that in the control group, so that the intervention is the only meaningful difference between groups. Certain contexts are more easily explored by randomised controlled trials (eg, secondary or tertiary care)but become less amenable to controlled studies on implementation. Current design and statistical approaches do not adequately deal with contextual variations within source studies and imperfectly represent 'real world' conditions within the target context. Demarcation between the outer setting (the economic, political and social context within which an organisation resides) and the inner setting (features of structural, political and cultural contexts through which an implementation process will proceed) are 'not always clear', given that the interface is 'dynamic and sometimes precarious'. One concept analysis states: 'Context reflects a set of characteristics and circumstances that consist of active and unique factors, within which the implementation is embedded'. Subsequently, the concept analysis unpacks context into eight domains (ie, locational, geographical, epidemiological, sociocultural, socioeconomic, ethical, legal and political). Context typically incorporates the institutional context (setting), the wider environment (eg, epidemiological, genetic, geographical, sociocultural, health system specific, political and others) or a composite of both.

### Informed consent and the capacity for voluntarism [^352d9a3e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Informed consent is built upon the elements of information, decisional capacity, and volunteerism. Of these elements, voluntarism in clinical and research consent is the least well understood. This has interfered with the ability to resolve key ethical problems faced by the field of psychiatry.

Method

The author suggests that voluntarism encompasses an individual's ability to act in accordance with one's authentic sense of what is good, right, and best in light of one's situation, values, and prior history. Voluntarism further entails the capacity to make this choice freely and in the absence of coercion. Deliberateness, purposefulness of intent, clarity, genuineness, and coherence with prior life decisions are implicitly emphasized in this construction.

Results

The author offers and illustrates a framework for voluntarism in clinical and research consent decisions, focusing on four domains of potential influence: 1) developmental factors, 2) illness-related considerations, 3) psychological issues and cultural and religious values, and 4) external features and pressures.

Conclusions

It is hoped that improved understanding of voluntarism will help in our efforts to fulfill the principle of respect for persons in clinical care and research.

### The complexity of nutritional problems in persons with dementia: expanding a theoretical model [^1f02818c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Proposed model of nutritional problems in persons with dementia applicable in daily nursing home practice. It includes the two new themes interprofessional collaboration and ethical factors, and a bidirectional link between the themes.

Behavioral problems such as food refusal (functioning of the person with dementia) leads to limited or no intake (observing and analyzing nutritional problems). This may result in weight loss and subsequent malnutrition (consequences of nutritional problems), which makes the person with dementia feel sick or weak (functioning of the person with dementia), further leading to increased weight loss (consequences of nutritional problems) or difficulty swallowing (requiring reobserving- and analyzing problems) that may increase the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia (consequences of nutritional problems) when taking action is delayed.

Further, ethical and environmental factors influence nutritional problems more indirectly in comparison to the other themes. Moral dilemmas may occur in decision-making on diagnostics and treatment in advanced dementia, when a vicious circle and subsequent deterioration appears. In these situations, decision making can be difficult. Environmental factors, such as the position of a person and the social environment during mealtimes influence nutritional problems as well, but are more distantly related to the themes in the middle of the model which relate directly to what can be seen and to the persons involved.

### Shaping patients' decisions [^f88a3e91]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Many physicians struggle to strike an acceptable balance between respecting patient autonomy and guiding patients' decisions toward what is in their best interests based on their expressed values and long-term goals. Over the past 40 years, the ethical principle of respect for autonomy has gained primacy in Western medicine, but judgments about the appropriate dose of influence on patient decisions have been clouded by misconceptions about patient autonomy. In this article, we consider three such misconceptions with the goal of helping physicians to optimally promote their patients' interests.

### The limits of shared decision making [^11c5f068]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The foundation of shared decision making (SDM) is the view that people should be aware of relevant choices, and that their personal views, priorities and preferences are relevant factors when determining action. The degree to which people wish to engage in decisions will vary, as will the level to which they will be made aware that decisions exist, or become informed about the relevant information. There is increasing interest in SDM, an ethical imperative, and supporting evidence that well-designed tools help people compare options and make more informed choices. We as authors, are strong advocates of SDM, and think the approach can be applied widely, perhaps more widely than many health professionals think possible.

Nevertheless we have identified situations where we consider there to be clear limits to SDM, where wider interests can override the priority given to individual preferences. While we think individual priorities and preferences should be respected where possible, there are situations where other factors determine decisions.

We feel it is essential to make these situations clear. SDM can be too easily dismissed as an impossible ideal if we do not acknowledge that the approach has limitations. In addition, delineating exceptions will serve to illustrate the demarcation between what can be thought of as the pinnacle of patient-centred care and situations where the approach is rightly constrained by ethical, professional or societal factors.

First, let's agree that decisions come in different forms: some are conscious and episodic, as in 'Shall I have this procedure?'. Some are the result of commitment decisions, such as when agreeing to take medication for a long-term illness. Others go unnoticed in conversations, such as when a clinician suggests a solution and results in assumed acceptance. Such subtle decisions may well occur because of deference to an expert or an unwillingness to disagree.SDM makes the process of determining decisions more explicit, and in healthcare the skills of supporting people to become aware, consciously deliberate, and arrive at better-considered decisions, whether for irreversible or continuous actions, are of utmost value. The steps suggested to achieve SDM have been extensively described elsewhere.

### When time is of the essence: ethical reconsideration of XAI in time-sensitive environments [^2418c81b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Time-sensitive environments affect clinical decision-making

In clinical decision-making, time is a critical factor. In psychological terms, healthcare professionals facing complex medical questions require sufficient time to predict potential outcomes and weigh the importance of those outcomes to make informed decisions. Research has demonstrated that time pressure can lead to faster performance rates, but lower performance quality. Such an increase in heuristic information processing favours efficiency over complexity. Therefore, a shortage of time may result in patterns of intuitive decision-making, woven into the psychological traits of decision-makers. Although intuitive decision-making is often sustained by previous experience and pattern recognition, it is more prone to cognitive biases due to its heuristic foundation. Situations of time pressure can negatively influence the quality of the decision reached. Therefore, the time-sensitivity factor of a given medical environment can have a tremendous impact on professional judgement and patient safety, in addition to other psychological factors.

Notably, many physicians regularly encounter situations of time pressure in their daily decision-making. Shortage of time and reliance on intuition seems to constitute an inherent aspect of the medical profession, often associated with emergency diagnostics, specific surgical interventions or inadequate resource management within the healthcare sector. While several of these factors can be mitigated through organisational measures, for example, by investing additional financial resources, others remain inherently and unchangeably time-critical, such as neuroradiological emergency diagnostics, myocardial infarction therapy or cardiac surgery. As XAI-CDSS promise to provide accurate and transparent decision recommendations that augment human judgement, it is important to assess the ethical implications of XAI-CDSS deployment in inherently time-sensitive interventional circumstances that are faced with heuristic decision-making.

### Genomics and justice: mitigating the potential harms and inequities that arise from the implementation of genomics in medicine [^ba409ee6]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Advances in human genetics raise many social and ethical issues. The application of genomic technologies to healthcare has raised many questions at the level of the individual and the family, about conflicts of interest among professionals, and about the limitations of genomic testing. In this paper, we attend to broader questions of social justice, such as how the implementation of genomics within healthcare could exacerbate pre-existing inequities or the discrimination against social groups. By anticipating these potential problems, we hope to minimise their impact. We group the issues to address into six categories: (i) access to healthcare in general, not specific to genetics. This ranges from healthcare insurance to personal behaviours. (ii) data management and societal discrimination against groups on the basis of genetics. (iii) epigenetics research recognises how early life exposure to stress, including malnutrition and social deprivation, can lead to ill health in adult life and further social disadvantage. (iv) psychiatric genomics and the genetics of IQ may address important questions of therapeutics but could also be used to disadvantage specific social or ethnic groups. (v) complex diseases are influenced by many factors, including genetic polymorphisms of individually small effect. A focus on these polygenic influences distracts from environmental factors that are more open to effective interventions. (vi) population genomic screening aims to support couples making decisions about reproduction. However, this remains a highly contentious area. We need to maintain a careful balance of the competing social and ethical tensions as the technology continues to develop.

### Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement [^37fa6fdc]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical utility

Conceptually, clinical utility refers to the usefulness, benefits and harms of an intervention. Clinical utility is a multidimensional construct covering effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as the psychosocial, ethical and legal implications of an intervention. Risk assessment per se does not have inherent clinical utility; the subsequent adoption of a risk-based intervention based on the results of the assessment is what influences the health outcomes. The use of such a strategy depends on whether the risk-based intervention is appropriate, accessible, practicable and acceptable. The interactions of these factors and challenges in assessing them are discussed in more detail in later sections of this article (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Risk-stratified early detection and prevention programmes as complex adaptive systems.

Various questions will define the risk-stratified programme, including which risk factors to include in risk assessments, what risk threshold to use for risk stratification, how many risk groups to have, when to do risk assessments, how often to screen and to whom screening should be offered, as well as which interventions should be used in individuals deemed to be at high risk. Decision-making regarding these questions will be influenced by the research evidence, the available resources, the health-care setting and societal values, preferences and social norms. The choices made in addressing each of these questions will determine whether the programme will be effective in reducing cancer-specific death and improving the benefit–harm balance of screening and be cost-effective, acceptable, accessible and feasible to implement. Dynamic interactions exist between each of these factors, and thus a change in one factor affects all others. Hence, the importance of a holistic, 'systems thinking' approach.

### The luck of the draw: physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care [^2d57e982]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To critically analyze physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care.

Methods

An ethical analysis of factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making.

Results

There is variability in decision-making about life support, both within and between intensive care units. Physician age, race, religion, attitude to risk, and personality factors have been associated with decisions to provide or limit life-sustaining treatment, though it is unclear how much these factors affect patient outcome. Inconsistency in decision-making appears worryingly arbitrary, and may mean that patients' values are sometimes being ignored or overridden. However, physician influence on decisions may also sometimes be appropriate and unavoidable, particularly where patient values are unclear.

Conclusions

We argue that, although physician-related variability in end-of-life care can never be eliminated entirely, it is potentially ethically problematic. We outline four potential strategies for reducing the "roster lottery".

### The factors that influence care home residents' and families' engagement with decision-making about their care and support: an integrative review of the literature [^1a6670a5]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A systematic search of the databases retrieved 913 results. Duplicates were removed. The initial screening process was undertaken by one researcher (BL) who identified a total 559 articles which were reviewed by title and abstract and 495 found not to be relevant. A total of 64 articles were reviewed fully to assess if they met the inclusion criteria for the review. Further discussion between two researchers enabled consensus to be reached (AR and SP), and finally 21 met our inclusion criteria. Following a manual screening of the reference list of these articles, one additional article was included. A total of 22 papers were deemed eligible for inclusion as they met inclusion criteria previously outline in Table 1. A flow chart showing the number of citations at each stage is described in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
PRISMA flow-chart depicting the main stages of the review process

Synthesis of the included studies

This integrative review included 22 studies conducted in 9 countries, namely, Australia (n = 6), Norway (n = 4), USA (n = 3), Canada (n = 2), Northern Ireland (n = 1), Belgium (n = 2), Spain (n = 1), England (n = 1) and Switzerland (n = 1), with one international study conducted in Italy and the Netherlands. Most of the studies included in the review used qualitative research designs (n = 15), with a combination of in-depth interviews (n = 10) and focus groups (n = 5). The total population for this review, based on the primary studies, was (n = 2,566) and comprised: residents (n = 764), families of residents (n = 1,151), and staff (n = 651). Table 2 below illustrates a summary of the included studies.

Table 2
Summary of included studies

A comprehensive review of each study was undertaken to determine enablers and inhibitors to shared decision-making in care homes from the perspectives of staff, residents, and families, alongside environmental issues. The thematic analysis identified six key factors that enable shared decision-making, four key factors that inhibit shared decision-making and four key environmental issues. These were subsequently categorised into three main themes that illustrate the complexities of shared decision-making in care homes (Table 3).

Table 3
Overview of Themes

SDM shared decision making

The three themes are:

A positive culture of collaborative and reciprocal relationships.
A willingness to engage and a willingness to become engaged.
Communicating with intent to share and support rather than inform and direct.

### Systematic review of factors influencing decisions to limit treatment in the emergency department [^17503a3a]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians are frequently faced with making decisions regarding how aggressive to be in caring for critically ill patients. We aimed to identify factors that influence decisions to limit treatment in the Emergency Department (ED) through a systematic search of the available literature.

Design

Prospectively registered systematic review of studies employing any methodology to investigate factors influencing decisions to limit treatment in the ED. Medline and EMBASE were searched from their inception until January 2019. Methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, but no studies were excluded based on quality. Findings were summarised by narrative analysis.

Results

10 studies published between 1998 and 2016 were identified for inclusion in this review, including seven cross-sectional studies investigating factors associated with treatment-limiting decisions, two surveys of physicians making treatment-limiting decisions and one qualitative study of physicians making treatment-limiting decisions. There was significant heterogeneity in patient groups, outcome measures, methodology and quality. Only three studies received a methodology-specific rating of 'high quality'. Important limitations of the literature include the use of small single-centre retrospective cohorts often lacking a comparison group, and survey studies with low response rates employing closed-response questionnaires. Factors influencing treatment-limiting decisions were categorised into 'patient and disease factors' (age, chronic disease, functional limitation, patient and family wishes, comorbidity, quality of life, acute presenting disorder type, severity and reversibility), 'hospital factors' (colleague opinion, resource availability) and 'non-patient healthcare factors' (moral, ethical, social and cost factors).

Conclusions

Several factors influence decisions to limit treatment in the ED. Many factors are objective and quantifiable, but some are subjective and open to individual interpretation. This review highlights the complexity of the subject and the need for more robust research in this field.

### Uncertainty and decision-making in critical care: lessons from managing COVID-19 ARDS in preparation for the next pandemic [^77ebc2ec]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Team factors, for example, are an important and leverageable positive influence on decision-making, which we found to be understudied in our review of the literature. In general, meta-analyses of team-training interventions indicate a positive impact on team performance, including decision-making, both in healthcare and in other industries. Given the success of the WHO/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) C19 SPACE training programme on preparing clinicians for pandemic-related work, we suggest consideration of adding a specific, practical team-training element to this.

Our study also highlighted the importance of considering the unique context in which clinicians had to make decisions during the pandemic (contextual factors). Limited resources may be a key barrier to address early on in any future pandemic to improve decision-making. The need for more critical care beds is not new, but COVID-19 has offered an acute lens through which to view this issue. While the influence of limited critical care capacity on triage/admitting decision-making (including ethical implications) is obvious, it is less clear for decision-making for patients already on the ICU and specifically ventilation therapy decisions. A small body of research exists that explores how healthcare environments, including resources such as equipment and disposable items, enabled and constrained modes of care during the pandemic, although none focused specifically on decision-making. However, the link between distraction and decreased decisional ability is well established; it may be that the stressors related to resource limitations in general created a suboptimal context for decision-making. Again, the WHO/ESICM C19 SPACE training is an ideal platform to add a module for hospital logisticians and administrators to enhance performance in the vital role of pandemic preparedness. Innovative solutions, such as triaging and transferring patients between hospitals within an existing critical care network, could also be used to maximise limited resources.

### Ethics and high-value care [^851e545e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

So understood, the ethical case for HVC may be both stronger and weaker than ordinarily assumed. It is stronger because, when ethically obligatory, HVC is more than a good idea; rather, failure to abide by obligatory HVC may breach professionalism. Thus, some Choosing Wisely recommendations ought to go further than they presently do. Instead of motivating conversations, those that qualify as ethically obligatory should truly guide, if not determine, action. It is weaker because, when only permissible, adherence to HVC recommendations is not ethically required. In some rare circumstances, HVC may even be suspect for an individual physician.

From the standpoint of ethics, it is not enough to show that following a particular value-based recommendation is good for both patients and society. Because individual patients and society can benefit in different ways and to different degrees, only in cases where all ethically relevant factors align should a particular action become obligatory. These factors include, but may not be limited to, the ones presented: that is, attention to the HVC evidence base, the effect on individual patient well-being, the impact of recommendations on population health and costs, and the decision-making processes behind determinations of 'value'. At present, most HVC recommendations would fall in the permissible category. Being merely permissible does not make their pursuit unimportant. It simply suggests that other values rightfully take priority (notably, the individual patient's best interest and values).

This typology also intersects contemporary efforts related to performance measurement, incentives and value-based payments. When following particular HVC recommendations is ethically permissible but not obligatory, overemphasis on HVC metrics as outcomes for individual physician performance measurement or determinants of compensation may be rightly questioned. Emphasis should more properly rest on the physician–patient shared decision-making process related to value, not its outcome. Again, being permissible does not make these recommendations unimportant. It implies that incentives (whether financial, such as performance bonuses, or non-financial, such as praise among peers) should aim largely at encouraging shared decision making. This could encourage practice changes without the attendant risk of introducing bias towards a singular, predetermined outcome into the physician–patient discussion. When physicians correctly believe that a recommendation is permissible, they should resist biased measurement and incentives towards only that outcome.

### Factors that impact on recruitment to randomised trials in health care: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^84ef9d78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomised trials (also referred to as 'randomised controlled trials' or 'trials') are the optimal way to minimise bias in evaluating the effects of competing treatments, therapies and innovations in health care. It is important to achieve the required sample size for a trial, otherwise trialists may not be able to draw conclusive results leading to research waste and raising ethical questions about trial participation. The reasons why potential participants may accept or decline participation are multifaceted. Yet, the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to improve recruitment to trials is not substantial and fails to recognise these individual decision-making processes. It is important to synthesise the experiences and perceptions of those invited to participate in randomised trials to better inform recruitment strategies.

Objectives

To explore potential trial participants' views and experiences of the recruitment process for participation. The specific objectives are to describe potential participants' perceptions and experiences of accepting or declining to participate in trials, to explore barriers and facilitators to trial participation, and to explore to what extent barriers and facilitators identified are addressed by strategies to improve recruitment evaluated in previous reviews of the effects of interventions including a Cochrane Methodology Review.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos, LILACS, PsycINFO, ORRCA, and grey literature sources. We ran the most recent set of searches for which the results were incorporated into the review in July 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with an identifiable qualitative component) that explored potential trial participants' experiences and perceptions of being invited to participate in a trial. We excluded studies that focused only on recruiters' perspectives, and trials solely involving children under 18 years, or adults who were assessed as having impaired mental capacity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by the search. We used the CART (completeness, accuracy, relevance, timeliness) criteria to exclude studies that had limited focus on the phenomenon of interest. We used QSR NVivo to extract and manage the data. We assessed methodological limitations using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used thematic synthesis to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided analytical themes and a conceptual model. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. Our findings were integrated with two previous intervention effectiveness reviews by juxtaposing the quantitative and qualitative findings in a matrix.

Main Results

We included 29 studies (published in 30 papers) in our synthesis. Twenty-two key findings were produced under three broad themes (with six subthemes) to capture the experience of being invited to participate in a trial and making the decision whether to participate. Most of these findings had moderate to high confidence. We identified factors from the trial itself that influenced participation. These included how trial information was communicated, and elements of the trial such as the time commitment that might be considered burdensome. The second theme related to personal factors such as how other people can influence the individual's decision; and how a personal understanding of potential harms and benefits could impact on the decision. Finally, the potential benefits of participation were found to be key to the decision to participate, namely personal benefits such as access to new treatments, but also the chance to make a difference and help others. The conceptual model we developed presents the decision-making process as a gauge and the factors that influence whether the person will, or will not, take part.

Authors' Conclusions

This qualitative evidence synthesis has provided comprehensive insight into the complexity of factors that influence a person's decision whether to participate in a trial. We developed key questions that trialists can ask when developing their recruitment strategy. In addition, our conceptual model emphasises the need for participant-centred approaches to recruitment. We demonstrated moderate to high level confidence in our findings, which in some way can be attributed to the large volume of highly relevant studies in this field. We recommend that these insights be used to direct or influence or underpin future recruitment strategies that are developed in a participant-driven way that ultimately improves trial conduct and reduces research waste.

### Ethical challenges in conducting maternal-fetal surgery trials. A systematic review [^0ff4b420]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Contextualization of ethical reflection

Taking a broader perspective, all these specific practical issues demonstrate that ethical reflection should be contextualized. Ethical reflection does not occur in a vacuum; rather, contextual factors hugely influence our ethical decision-making. For example, included publications elicited how contextual factors such as parents' emotional status, practical difficulties in participation (e.g. lack of accommodation), and physicians' attitudes toward the experimental surgery greatly influence whether parents will opt for trial, abortion, or standard of treatment. Contextual factors can also lead people to perceive and evaluate the same facts differently and, consequently, to reach different decisions. For example, while some emphasized that MFS trials benefit mainly the fetus and that counselors must stress the alternative to the trial, a study on parents' decision-making found that many parents saw the trial as the only option.

The fact that we reach different ethical evaluations based on contextual factors is not an issue per se, but it can become an issue if it is not acknowledged and addressed appropriately. For example, the fact that extra trial-related costs like travel and accommodation are not always covered might affect parents' ability to participate and, in some cases, hinder sample diversity. We agree with Lyerly et al. that this issues should be acknowledged and addressed in future trials. To make another example, as previously mentioned, it is important to acknowledge that parents' decisions are influenced by several factors. Hence, it is important to address these factors in the counseling and to leave parents enough time and space to reflect and decide, similar to what Bartlett and Bliton described as "ethical review". A crucial part of this process is to empower the pregnant person to decide whether to participate in a trial that, as any trial, will inevitably entail risks and uncertainty. We believe that to achieve that counselors should be honestly and openly acknowledge the uncertainties related to the trial. Clinicians also need to help the pregnant person understand if participating the trial is the best option for them personally. Counselors should help the pregnant person to identify the most important values for them and their pregnancy rather than imposing their own values onto the pregnant person and develop a care plan that reflects the patient's values. For example, if the person is extremely risk-averse a trial might not be the best option for them. To the opposite, if they want to ensure that they did "everything possible" than the trial might be the right option.

### Clinical, technical, and environmental biases influencing equitable access to clinical genetics / genomics testing: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^4b54cd96]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG Statement — diversity, equity, and social constructs — defines diversity (population) as a nonhomogeneous group of people from varied backgrounds or beliefs and focuses on increasing underrepresented populations; characterizes inclusion as more than simple diversity, involving authentic and empowered participation with a true sense of belonging and full access to opportunities; defines equity as an ethical concept based on fairness and justice that focuses on outcomes most appropriate for a given group, recognizing different challenges, needs, and histories; describes justice as a future state in which the root causes of inequity have been dismantled and barriers removed; explains exploitation as the systematic transfer of the power of some persons or groups to others and a structural relation between social groups; describes social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born and live shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources and mostly responsible for avoidable differences in health status; and clarifies race as a social and power construct not rooted in biology and ethnicity as social characteristics such as language, religion, regional background, traditions, and culture not rooted in biology.

### Beyond costs and benefits: understanding how patients make health care decisions [^6c9e4ec0]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Many medical decisions are "preference sensitive", where the best choice depends on the values a specific patient places on relevant outcomes. For example, a decision may require a patient to make a trade-off between a small increase in chance for survival and a large out-of-pocket expense. In such situations, patients need to understand the costs and benefits of the health care alternative, in order to decide the best course of action. However, findings from decision science research have demonstrated that people's decisions are often influenced not only by their perceptions of these costs and benefits, but also by subtle contextual factors that trigger intuitive and emotional decision processes. In this article, I describe some of these contextual factors, and lay out the challenges these factors raise for clinicians' efforts to help their patients make informed decisions.

### Can medical algorithms be fair? Three ethical quandaries and one dilemma [^fa4585a2]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Machine learning (ML) refers to algorithms that improve their performance independent of human designers. Several biases are involved in developing and applying ML, such as data biases (eg, historical and representation biases), modelling/design biases (eg, evaluation and aggregation biases) and human review biases (behavioural and social biases). Biases affect the fairness of the ML process's outcome and deployment by wrongly skewing the outcome. 'Fairness' can be understood in different ways, but is usefully defined in the context of ML-based decision making as 'the absence of any prejudice or favouritism towards an individual or a group based on their inherent or acquired characteristics'. Thus, when operationalising fairness into ML systems applied in health, the goal should be to eradicate biases in the processes of data sampling, modelling and human review so that the ML process does not promote health advantages or disadvantages for any individuals or groups based on their inherent or acquired characteristics. Assessing what kind of characteristics are assumed relevant for a fairness approach relies on normative ideas about justice. In healthcare, the World Medical Association's Declaration of Geneva identifies 'age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, nationality, political affiliation, race, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor' as examples of factors that should not impact the doctors' duty towards their patients. Thus, ML failing to perform adequately to certain patients with such characteristics can be judged unfair.

In parallel, a more comprehensive and ambitious conceptualisation of fairness in health is discussed in the literature addressing how to distribute healthcare justly. Fairness is here understood in terms of how healthcare needs are unequally distributed within and across populations in the first place, which calls for justly allocated healthcare to reduce historically and socially conditioned inequalities. Theoretically, this aim is captured by egalitarian approaches to ensure, for example, equal opportunitiesor capabilities, or social justice. Politically, it is reflected in empirically informed reports on observed health inequalities (eg, WHO's report on closing the gap of inequalities in a generationand in the Sustainable Development Goal of promoting health equality). In clinical settings, work has been carried out to clarify the appropriateness of considering socioeconomic factors to circumvent their adverse impact on patients' ability to benefit from treatment. This work has been translated into a call for revising and clarifying the way 'social standing' requires clinical attention in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Geneva.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of cockroaches: a practice parameter [^c0d0dd7e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Classification of recommendations and evidence — Recommendation rating scale defines four categories with clinician implications as follows: Strong recommendation (StrRec) is defined as "A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms… and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent"; Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec) is defined as "A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms… but the quality of evidence is not as strong"; Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt) is defined as "An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect… or that well-done studies… show little clear advantage to one approach versus another"; Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they might set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) is defined as "No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence… and an unclear balance between benefits and harms"; Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision-making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### A scoping review of professional identity formation in undergraduate medical education [^ee8e2952]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Affirming the importance of professional attitudes, ethical conduct, reflective practice and supportive relationships, PIF thus captures the nuanced process by which a medical student personally and professionally transforms into a doctor.
2 Socialization in PIF

Socialization is the process of becoming a part of the medical community, and developing a sense of professional identity through shared knowledge and skills. This process is individualized, non-linear and heavily influenced by formal, informal and hidden curricula. As students move from early peripheral involvement, to assuming a more central role in the community of practice with increasing seniority, intrinsic characteristics, values, beliefs, behaviours and biases are re-examined. refined, re-aligned and integrated. Socialization is facilitated by formal ceremonies and seminal experiences such as White Coat Ceremony and cadaveric dissections, and promoted when experiencing patient care, managing clinical responsibilities, working long hoursand reflecting upon experiences and clinical identities. This evolving process, which continues along the continuum of medical education, sees individuals advance progressively from "doing" toward a way of "being".
3 PIF influencing factors

A series of influencing factors promote or hinder professional identity formation as enablers or barriers that are intrinsic or extrinsic to the student. These are presented in Table 1 through the person-centric lens of RToP and its Individual, Relational and Societal Rings. Limited data on the Innate Ring prevented further evaluation of the impact of PIF on this aspect.

Table 1
Enablers and barriers to professional identity formation in medical school viewed through the RToP lens

Table 2
Strategies adopted by Medical Schools to support Professional Identity Formation

Intrinsic factors refer to the medical student's attitudes, values, beliefs, moral and philosophical leanings and decision-making processes. Extrinsic factors relate to the clinical environment. Many factors influence how medical students reconcile their experiences, and reflections within the Individual Ring of ideals, values, beliefs, and personal and professional self-concepts, while interactions,– impact Relational and Societal Rings. These rings are further affected by how experiences and reflections take shape in medical school. In the absence of effective, appropriate or adequate support, enabling factors such as reflection, or socialization, may become barriers that impede the merging of students' personal and professional identities.

### Shared decision making: a model for clinical practice [^1642ee51]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

WHY SHARE DECISIONS: BEYOND THE ETHICAL IMPERATIVE

SDM is supported by evidence from 86 randomized trials showing knowledge gain by patients, more confidence in decisions, more active patient involvement, and, in many situations, informed patients elect for more conservative treatment options. We illustrate the arguments in favor of SDM by providing two hypothetical cases where more than one reasonable treatment option exist — see cases 1 and 2. They illustrate that informed preferences are an optimal goal because the decisions made will be better understood, based on more accurate expectations about the negative and positive consequencesand more consistent with personal preferences.

### Capacity and decision making [^cbe53a71]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Pickering et al 's paper argues that the capacity of the decision-maker is the sole consideration in whether a decision should stand, and that the risk of the decision should not be considered. This argument ignores the existence of the player who is of the view that a decision is not wise. This paper argues that patient autonomy is not the sole determinant of whether a person is able to make an unwise decision, particularly in healthcare where there are always others affected by the patient decision. Rather than asserting that patients have an unfettered autonomous choice on clinical decisions this paper argues that these decisions should be looked at through the lens of quality in health care that has proposed four parameters to be balanced; the patient experience, wise use of resources, the effect on public health and the clinician experience.

### Personalizing decision-making for persons with Parkinson's disease: where do we stand and what to improve? [^661ae495]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The large variety in symptoms and treatment effects across different persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) warrants a personalized approach, ensuring that the best decision is made for each individual. We aimed to further clarify this process of personalized decision-making, from the perspective of medical professionals.

Methods

We audio-taped 52 consultations with PD patients and their neurologist or PD nurse-specialist, in 6 outpatient clinics. We focused coding of the transcripts on which decisions were made and on if and how decisions were personalized. We subsequently interviewed professionals to elaborate on how and why decisions were personalized, and which decisions would benefit most from a more personalized approach.

Results

Most decisions were related to medication, referral or lifestyle. Professionals balanced clinical factors, including individual (disease-) characteristics, and non-clinical factors, including patients' preference, for each type of decision. These factors were often not explicitly discussed with the patient. Professionals experienced difficulties in personalizing decisions, mostly because evidence on the impact of characteristics of an individual patient on the outcome of the decision is unavailable. Categories of decisions for which professionals emphasized the importance of a more personalized perspective include choices not only for medication and advanced treatments, but also for referrals, lifestyle and diagnosis.

Conclusions

Clinical decision-making is a complex process, influenced by many different factors that differ for each decision and for each individual. In daily practice, it proves difficult to tailor decisions to individual (disease-) characteristics, probably because sufficient evidence on the impact of these individual characteristics on outcomes is lacking.

### AI in the hands of imperfect users [^d831af73]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Trust in the eye of the (imperfect) beholder

At this stage in the history of human-machine relations, nearly everyone is an imperfect user of AI. By this, we mean imperfectly rational: our interpretations and integration of information into decision making, including insights derived from AI, are susceptible to well-documented forms of bias. Not all biases, however, are equally salient or relevant to the safe, effective, and responsible use of AI. From both legal and ethical perspectives, the most important cognitive biases are those that impact the extent to which humans rely on AI in their decision making in ways that introduce risk. Reliance falls along a spectrum of utter rejection or skepticism of AI on one end to "blind" overreliance or acceptance of AI-derived conclusions on the other. Both types of error can have negative impacts on patient outcomes, with underreliance potentially leading to errors of omission and overreliance on errors of commission.

Where clinical decision makers fall along this spectrum depends on how much they trust an AI system. Literature from anthropology and developmental psychology documents findings that human trust is influenced by how other people behave in contexts of reciprocity and exchange, not only of goods and services but also attachment behaviors, (e.g. affection, nurturance). Loyalty, integrity, and competenceplay important roles in human-human trust, increasingly conceptualized as an evolved capacity to help us navigate complex social dynamics and to mitigate personal risk by understanding which entities and objects can be trusted under which contingencies –. While we know a great deal about trust in human relationships, we are just beginning to understand how and in what circumstances humans trust machines. Literature on human-machine interactions, or "human factors" research, has existed for decades in other domains, including military, aerospace, and robotics; but only within the last decade have questions surrounding human interactions with autonomous systems (e.g. automation bias) begun to animate the field of AI broadly, and AI ethics in particular.

### Promoting networks between evidence-based medicine and values-based medicine in continuing medical education [^ac1280ad]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

As stated earlier, one of the ways to create a novel ethical environment is through education in clinical ethics. The first step is to carry out a situational diagnosis of what the ends of healthcare are considered to be, along with the values linked to these ends. It is thought that when healthcare professionals are aware of these values, they will be guided by more careful reflection to adequately approach the dilemmas that arise. Such reasoning has led us to pursue concurrent triangulation approaches that use quantitative methods to assess expressed values in medical practice and the decisions made when facing three clinical vignettes that pose ethical dilemmas. While capturing what health workers claim to be their values, we use qualitative anthropological methods and ethnography to define the values they display in their daily activities. Thus, we are able to analyze the concordance of such factors as life history, the doctor-patient relationship and ethical judgements regarding dilemmas that arise in the clinical practice.

The study's central hypothesis is that a cross-functional clinical ethics course is able to amalgamate EBM and VBM. Therefore, we seek to address the following questions: (1) What are the values of a group of healthcare professionals participating in CME in clinical ethics? (2) Why and how do participants respond to values in their clinical practice? (3) How does CME in clinical ethics impact the pairing of EBM-VBM? Here, we describe the successful use of CME to engineer networks between EBM and VBM.

### Adopting an ethical approach to migration health policy, practice and research [^86ae9b29]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Adopting an ethical approach to advancing migration health

Migration health is affected by decisions made at levels ranging from global to local, both within and beyond the health sector. These decisions impact issues such as healthcare seeking, entitlements, service delivery, policy making and knowledge production on migration health. It is key that ethical questions faced by decision makers are recognised and addressed in efforts to tackle the persisting challenges in migration health (exemplified in table 1).

Table 1
Ethical questions faced by decision makers on migration health

An ethical approach can provide methods to identify ethical issues, frameworks for systematising information and suggesting ethically acceptable solutions, and guidance on procedural concerns and legitimate decision making processe s. By unpacking dilemmas, conflicts of interests and values at stake, an ethical approach is relevant for all who make decisions about migration health policy and practice. In seeking transparent justification towards the best alternatives, ethics can assist in holding decision makers to account. Based on the ethical question that is at stake, the most relevant ethical guidance and tools should be used. Ongoing debates around the 'right' ethical approach demonstrate that decision makers should critically reflect on their choice of framework or method. For instance, principles used in clinical reasoning at a healthcare centremay differ from those emphasised by policy makers during a public health emergency. When facing real-life dilemmas on migration health decision makers should use various sources and frameworks.

In examining the dilemmas decision makers face on migration health (table 1), one may ask what the added value of an ethics approach is relative to the existing rights-based, public health and economic arguments. These approaches have different strengths and limitations; they put forward both intrinsic and instrumental arguments for mainstreaming migration health issues. Like human rights, ethics are concerned with dignity, equality and concern for vulnerable groups. Historically, human rights conventions have evolved as a framework for regulating the actions of governments, whereas ethics concerns 'specific actions, values, interests and relationships of individual health workers, researchers and organisations'. Human rights are formulated in broad, somewhat abstract terms, leaving open the precise way in which they should be implemented in the complex reality of practice 'on the ground'. An ethical approach, which explicitly recognises and discusses the values and norms at stake, equips its users with analytic tools and guidance on dealing with challenging dilemmas. Ethical and human rights approaches overlap in the sense that they both proceed from fundamental moral values, but they differ in the uses to which they are typically put.

### The socio-ecology of zoonotic infections [^6087453d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

The resurgence of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin observed in recent years imposes a major morbidity/mortality burden worldwide, and also a major economic burden that extends beyond pure medical costs. The resurgence and epidemiology of zoonoses are complex and dynamic, being influenced by varying parameters that can roughly be categorized as human-related, pathogen-related, and climate/environment-related; however, there is significant interplay between these factors. Human-related factors include modern life trends such as ecotourism, increased exposure through hunting or pet owning, and culinary habits, industrialization sequelae such as farming/food chain intensification, globalization of trade, human intrusion into ecosystems and urbanization, significant alterations in political regimes, conflict with accompanying breakdown of public health and surveillance infrastructure, voluntary or involuntary immigration, loosening of border controls, and hierarchy issues in related decision-making, and scientific advances that allow easier detection of zoonotic infections and evolution of novel susceptible immunocompromised populations. Pathogen-related factors include alterations in ecosystems and biodiversity that influence local fauna synthesis, favouring expansion of disease hosts or vectors, pressure for virulence/resistance selection, and genomic variability. Climate/environment-related factors, either localized or extended, such as El Niño southern oscillation or global warming, may affect host-vector life cycles through varying mechanisms. Emerging issues needing clarification include the development of predictive models for the infectious disease impact of environmental projects, awareness of the risk imposed on immunocompromised populations, recognition of the chronicity burden for certain zoonoses, and the development of different evaluations of the overall stress imposed by a zoonotic infection on a household, and not strictly a person.

### The limits of shared decision making [^4a859be1]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Absence of or insufficient evidence of benefit

Scientific evidence for or against a course of action is a key determinant of how clinicians frame decisions in discussions with patients, although the influence of peers and accepted norms are arguably just as important. In some situations, for a range of reasons, increased attention is frequently given to the absence of evidence of net benefit, especially when the evidence is of low quality or contradictory.

There are three common situations where this may be the case.

When there is no evidence

For many options there is little to no research available to allow comparison. However, it is not unusual for patients to have strong prior beliefs about the need for a specific treatment or a test. The clinician may need to become better informed, or may already be aware that insufficient evidence exists, or that there is likely harm, and that acquiescing risks the prospect of delaying effective treatment. Both these scenarios require skilful negotiation for either more time to search for information or to provide reasons why the request for the option may be declined, especially if the option likely brings harm or an unjustified use of resources. Such discussions are made more complex when patients are exposed to media that promote novel healthcare developments. Honesty and transparency can guide communication, however, a consensus is often difficult to achieve. This situation is often one where clinical equipoise does not exist, and therefore places limits on SDM.

Scientific evidence of inferiority

Clinicians may also be unwilling to consider SDM when evidence exists in favour of some options compared with others, or where situations have high stakes and the use of effective treatment is considered imperative or is widely viewed as a standard of care, even if individual patient preferences vary. Clinicians report feeling a moral and professional obligation to recommend superior versus inferior options in such situations. They may feel the need to follow clinical guidelines and harbour concerns that they will be viewed as either incompetent or negligent for not adhering to professionally held norms. There is evidence that the willingness of clinicians to practice SDM varies, especially in the face of strong clinical practice recommendations.

### The complexity of nutritional problems in persons with dementia: expanding a theoretical model [^2a0160e0]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We adapted an existing model comprising four themes regarding nutritional problems, adding two new aspects: interprofessional collaboration and ethical factors. As such, this study builds a bridge between the theory around nutritional problems in persons with dementia and daily clinical practice in nursing homes. The other four themes were confirmed in our study by professionals from clinical practice; observing and analyzing nutritional problems, consequences of nutritional problems, functioning of the person with dementia, and environmental factors. Beyond these aspects, connections within each theme, between themes, and a bidirectional connection between the themes were identified. This differs from previous models, which describe a more linear connection. Environmental factors influence mealtimes and are therefore most strongly related to functioning of the person with dementia. Interprofessional collaboration and ethical factors are related to the other themes in the model, but mainly to observing and analyzing nutritional problems and minimizing consequences of nutritional problems. The relation between these two themes and functioning of the person with dementia and environmental factors is more indirect, which explains the position in the model. Ethical factors, such as norms and values of healthcare professionals, influence interprofessional collaboration. Additionally, collaboration of the multidisciplinary team influences the timing of observation and analysis. In case of late timing, for example, a person may have lost a lot of weight and therefore experience more severe consequences. These new findings underline the complexity of nutritional problems in daily clinical practice.

The newly added theme of ethical factors was found before to influence the way nutritional problems are handled, not only by healthcare professionals, but by relatives of persons with dementia as well. Norms and values are known to differ per person and are of influence on situations around eating and drinking. Persons with advanced dementia depend on decisions taken by healthcare professionals and relatives, because their own decision making capacity is impaired. Decision making is considered a struggle for relatives and professionals involved when nutritional intake becomes (nearly) impossible or unsafe, especially when norms and values regarding end-of-life-decisions differ. Such end-of-life decisions can be difficult and complex, and should be made as a team and family together with respect towards each other despite possible differences. In these situations, artificial nutrition and hydration may be considered. However, because observational studies indicate that enteral feeding does not prolong life or improve a person with dementia's quality of life, this is rarely applied in the Netherlands.

### Factors that influence parents' assessments of the risks and benefits of research involving their children [^718589a3]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The ability to assess accurately the risks and benefits of a study are important to ensure that the subject can make an informed decision regarding his or her own or his or her surrogate's participation. This study was designed to examine factors that influence parents' assessments of the risks and benefits of anesthesia and surgery research involving their children.

Methods

The study population consisted of parents of 505 children who had been approached to participate in 1 of several ongoing clinical studies. Regardless of their decision to allow or decline their child's participation in a study, parents completed a questionnaire that elicited information regarding their perceptions of the risks and benefits of the study and factors that had influenced their decision.

Results

Factors that influenced positive risk/benefit assessments by the parents included use of a placebo, the designated risk category of the study, the clarity of information given, the parents' perceptions of the amount of time provided to make a decision, and the amount of privacy afforded them in making a decision. Furthermore, positive risk/benefit assessments were associated with low decisional uncertainty and greater trust in the medical system.

Conclusions

Identification of factors that influence parents' perceptions of the risks and benefits of a research study is important as a means to optimize the manner in which consent information is disclosed and to ensure that parents and subjects can assess accurately the relative importance of the risks and benefits.

2 Establish Sustainable Community Partnerships

2.1 Role of Community in GxE Research

Establishing authentic and sustainable community‐empowering partnerships, where communities are equitable partners in the research enterprise, is key to conducting innovative and impactful GxE research. Communities are uniquely equipped to define research priorities and inform the research process as they have the lived experience of factors impacting their health and often have intimate knowledge of the resources needed to address environmental injustices (Van Horne et al.). As such, community members should be integral members of the research team, meaningfully engaged in each step from research planning to implementation. Researchers should take steps to build trust and cultivate transparency. Expectations for the ways in which community members, individually and collectively, will benefit from participating in the study should be discussed early and clearly communicated to everyone on the research team. Communities that have been underserved are impacted by health disparities that both result from and perpetuate social and environmental injustices (Senier et al.) (See Table 1 for detailed definitions/references surrounding health disparities). Researchers should be responsive to and collaborate with communities in ways that center the knowledge and voices of the community and are sensitive to these environmental injustices. This starts with researchers and communities forming meaningful relationships before the study to gain a deep understanding of communities' experiences, priorities, and concerns, as well as the researchers' scientific areas and proposed hypotheses of interest.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^348fb248]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and Legal Aspects of Care — IDT ethics infrastructure emphasizes that IDT protocols are developed to ensure patient and family access to ethics resources and support in all care settings. IDT members maintain professional boundaries with clear role expectations while balancing objectivity with caring compassion, and attention is paid to patient and family cultural and spiritual values that impact care preferences and potentially conflict with clinicians' values; the IDT is aware that cultural factors can influence decision-making and autonomy. Guidance is provided to surrogate decision-makers about the legal and ethical basis for surrogate decision-making including honoring the patient's known preferences, substituted judgment, and best-interest criteria, and social justice principles and costs of care are considered in the allocation of resources across all populations to improve the health outcomes of seriously ill people and address healthcare disparities. IDTs without ready access to ethics consultation identify avenues to access consultations and resources (eg, consult with specialty palliative care experts or establish a collaborative relationship with a medical center ethics program), and ensuring IDT sustainability and avoiding clinician burnout is considered an ethical obligation in all care settings to preserve team members' health and ability to remain engaged in palliative care.

### Ethics, EBM, and hospital management [^945933f5]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

Matters of hospital management do not figure prominently on the medical ethics agenda. However, management decisions that have to be taken in the area of hospital care are in fact riddled with ethical questions and do have significant impact on patients, staff members, and the community being served. In this decision making process evidence based medicine (EBM) plays an increasingly important role as a tool for rationalising as well as rationing health care resources. In this article, ethical issues of hospital management and the role of EBM will be explored, with particular reference to disease management programs, diagnosis related groups, and clinical pathways as recent developments in the German health care system.

In daily practice, it proves difficult to tailor decisions to individual (disease-) characteristics, probably because sufficient evidence on the impact of these individual characteristics on outcomes is lacking.

### Impact of home care versus alternative locations of care on elder health outcomes: an overview of systematic reviews [^0fd38792]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Location of care (LOC) for the elderly has become an increasingly important societal issue. With a demographic shift towards an aging population with complex healthcare needs, healthcare systems face challenges in providing long-term care for elders. One such challenge is matching the elders' health and wellbeing needs to the environment. The ecological theory of aging suggests that the environment influences elders' functional status. Promoting optimal outcomes requires a goodness of fit between the elders and the environment. For example, the person-environment fit can positively or negatively influence health outcomes if personal competencies are well-suited, or alternatively, poorly matched to environmental demands. The World Health Organization's report on Aging and Health highlighted the importance of environmental influence on functioning and research has shown that elders' opportunity to build and maintain functional ability is enhanced when they live in an environment that addresses their needs. As such, decision makers (e.g. policy makers, patients, family members, and healthcare providers) are challenged to better consider the impact of the environment, or LOC, on elders' health and wellbeing outcomes.

To make a well-informed decision, stakeholders need to know their options (i.e. available LOCs), the benefits and harms of each option, and how these benefits and harms relate to their personal situation. Common long-term LOC options include home care and institutional care. Home care typically includes independent living at home or living at home with supports and/or modifications to enhance health and independence. Institutional LOCs typically refer to nursing home care or skilled nursing care facilities. Elders and caregivers have identified deciding about moving from home to an alternative LOC as one of the most difficult decisions they face. This decision is complicated by the evolving contextual factors relating to the care situation such as elder health status, characteristics of the caregivers, and physical environment. Access to evidence describing the impact of home care versus an alternative LOC on elder health and wellbeing could help inform decision making.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^dbd73950]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 6. Antiretroviral treatment adherence — policy, legal, and ethical considerations emphasize that providers should discourage sharing ART because it may impair adherence and pose other problems, and that concerns about confidentiality, stigma, social disapproval, and nondisclosure of HIV infection status are associated with low adherence. Some persons may be reluctant to carry or display their ART in public or to seek adherence support from others if they fear legal consequences or deportation, and a study found lower adherence among those living in areas where transmitting or exposing others to HIV was a crime compared with other areas. Providers can assess adherence in a nonjudgmental manner, stress that adherence information is confidential, explain the relation between adherence and viral load, and help persons with HIV find practical adherence strategies, which may encourage patients to honestly disclose their adherence levels, admit adherence challenges, and set realistic adherence goals. Several studies have also shown that persons who share decision making about ART adherence goals with their clinical providers have higher adherence, and other factors that influence adherence are described elsewhere: retention in HIV medical care and sustained access to affordable ART.

### Perspectives of healthcare professionals and older patients on shared decision-making for treatment escalation planning in the acute hospital setting: a systematic review and qualitative thematic synthesis [^161e61d5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

External factors also informed decision-making approaches. Organisational culture, resources, workflows and clinician-training influence SDM. The surrogate role in TEP is complex and important in several cultural contexts. Although not our focus, family involvement was highlighted by both clinicians and patients: clinicians anticipated conflict about treatment limitations; patients were highly aware of their families but the nature of influence on decision-making was not clear. Clinicians were influenced by organisational expectations and environmental pressures, consistent with existing research. There was some reference to lack of societal awareness on planning for ill-health.

The main limitation is paucity of studies examining patient perspectives. Researchers may anticipate concerns about gaining ethical approval for studies involving patients in potentially distressing discussion around TEP, even though patients are often eager to share their experiences. Reflecting the importance of representing patients while acknowledging limited data, we include patient-orientated themes but with low and moderate confidence.

The weight of evidence derived from two research groups meaning our conclusions may be biased towards a narrower range of experience. The studies included all took place in European or North American settings, which may reflect different terminology around TEP not captured in our search strategy, limiting transferability to other settings. We recognise that our findings are unlikely to reflect approaches in settings with different expectations of the doctor–patient relationship or resource constraints. In keeping with many other qualitative studies, we decided only to include English language studies so that the interpretation and analysis by authors whose first language is English could reflect the nuance of direct participant quotations which might be lost through translation. Although we did not intend to focus on doctor-patient decision-making, the views of wider professional groups appear underrepresented in this literature.

There were methodological quality concerns in several included qualitative studies around adequate discussion of reflexivity, recruitment and data saturation. As is usual practice for thematic syntheses, we have used available data from primary studies, but note that these are selected and may be considered distinct from the original data.

None of the studies identified were specifically designed to explore the 'shared' element of decision making, which is the focus of this review. This may reflect a recent shift in emphasis whereby SDM is increasingly explored in emergency as well primary care settings. However, much of the data and analysis presented in these primary studies focussed on the interplay between clinician and patient and family views, and were thus adequate to address our research questions. Nonetheless, expectations for TEP decision-making continue to evolve, so the studies included may not represent most recent local practice.

### Adopting an ethical approach to migration health policy, practice and research [^b500ad13]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Migration health is affected by decision making at levels ranging from global to local, both within and beyond the health sector. These decisions impact seeking, entitlements, service delivery, policy making and knowledge production on migration health. It is key that ethical challenges faced by decision makers are recognised and addressed in research and data, clinical practice and policy making on migration health. An ethical approach can provide methods to identify ethical issues, frameworks for systematising information and suggesting ethically acceptable solutions, and guidance on procedural concerns and legitimate decision making processes. By unpacking dilemmas, conflicts of interests and values at stake, an ethical approach is relevant for all who make decisions about migration health policy and practice. Adopting an ethical approach to migration health benefits governments, organisations, policy makers, health workers, data managers, researchers and migrants themselves. First, it highlights the inherent normative questions and trade-offs at stake in migration health. Second, it assists decision makers in deciding what is the ethically justifiable thing to do through an 'all things considered' approach. Third, ethical frameworks and technical guidance set normative and practical standards for decision makers facing ethical questions - from 'bedside rationing' to collection of big data or in policy making - that can ensure that migrants' interests are considered. Fourth, there is a need for greater transparency and accountability in decision making, as well as meaningful participation of migrant groups. An ethical approach connects to public health, economic and human rights arguments and highlights the urgent need to mainstream concerns for migrants in global and national health responses.

### Role of the ethics committee: helping to address value conflicts or uncertainties [^64aa027f]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article addresses two basic questions about ethics committees: why we have them, and how they might be helpful to clinicians. Our answer to the first question is twofold. First, we suggest that legal, regulatory, and professional forces drove the development of ethics committees, particularly as an alternative to litigation. Second, we argue that ethics committees arose in response to a clinical need for a formal mechanism to address some of the value conflicts and uncertainties that arise in contemporary health-care settings. We argue that this need, reflected in early high-profile legal cases, stems partly from the complex value-laden nature of clinical decision making, a pluralistic societal context, a growing recognition of the rights of individuals to live by their values, and the relevance of those values for medical decision making. In answer to the second question, we draw out three ways ethics committees might be helpful to clinicians: education, policy formation or review, and consultation. We devote the majority of our discussion to ethics consultation and its relation to the emerging area of palliative care. In so doing, we highlight three important differences: (1) the scope or range of cases for which they may be appropriate, (2) focus in any particular case, and (3) general orientation-between ethics consultation and palliative care that clinicians should take into account in deciding to seek the assistance of either or both.

### Relative importance and interactions of factors influencing low-value care provision: a factorial survey experiment among Swedish primary care physicians [^35e2dfd8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this research include the use of experimental design, where multiple factors were tested to isolate and juxtapose their effects. Clinicians were consulted on the vignettes, which were designed to reflect the real-world scenarios in a controlled way; by presenting the same story to different participants, we ensured a level of standardisation that is hard to achieve in observational studies and makes the responses more appropriate for comparisons across the scenarios. Another strength is the fact that taking an experiment approach allowed us to examine the decisions without putting patients at risk or facing other ethical complexities.

The study has limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the physicians took their decisions in imaginary scenarios and not actual cases. Thus, we capture their perceptions of what they would do rather than actual decisions that they make in their consulting rooms. Yet, factorial survey experiments have been particularly suitable for investigating complex or sensitive situations with multiple factors affecting judgements. Professionals' decision-making is challenging to study using conventional methods (interviews, observations), which could be prone to social desirability. Second, because the scenarios in the vignettes should not contain an excessive number of factors, we limited our investigations to the most prominent determinants. This means that some relevant factorshave not been included. Third, while the physicians who took part in this study were employed in all 21 regions in Sweden, the recruitment method did not ensure a representative sample when it comes to region, gender, age or work experience. In addition, the focus was by design on physicians in primary care to achieve high validity of the scenario and factors; however, it also limits the generalisability to other medical specialties and settings.

### Factors that influence the provision of intrapartum and postnatal care by skilled birth attendants in low-and middle-income countries: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^1839b888]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Methodological limitations of the included studies

Most of the included studies did not report in detail the sampling or data analysis methods used, or researcher reflexivity (see Table 3). In addition, some studies did not report ethical considerations.

Confidence in the review findings

Out of 51 findings, we graded two as high confidence, 16 as moderate confidence, and the remaining findings as low or very low confidence using the CERQual approach. (See Table 1). Our explanation for each CERQual assessment is shown in the Evidence Profiles (See Table 4 to Table 53).

CERQual evidence profile: finding 1

Synthesis findings

In this section we have reported the categories identified in the synthesis and the findings from the synthesis that belong in each category.

As described above, our analysis was guided by Graham's conceptual framework for skilled birth attendance at delivery (Graham 2001). We did not make major changes to the categories in Graham's framework. However, while Graham grouped these categories as either "structure", "inputs", "outputs", or "outcomes", we chose not to group the categories in this way. This was because we experienced overlap of some categories (e.g. referral processes and mechanisms could be categorised as inputs or outputs), and because grouping the categories in this way downplayed the interrelationships between the categories. We instead chose to group the categories according to the level at which they operate; namely, the macro‐environment or the meso‐ or microenvironment. We did not use two of Graham's categories. We did not find any studies that reported data on the "financing" category. We did not consider the second category, "technical quality of care", to be a separate category, as it is relevant to all other categories as an immediate outcome of the process of providing care. Figure 3 represents our adaptation of Graham's conceptual framework for skilled birth attendance at delivery (Graham 2001), and reflects the findings from this synthesis as well as the categories for which we had no data. Factors tied to the macro‐, meso‐, and microenvironment may influence available quality of care and health worker performance and motivation; maternal experiences of care; as well as health facility functionality or capability. Some of the maternal experiences of care included satisfaction and participation in decision‐making. These factors are discussed further in the section below.

### Without' informed consent'? Ethics and ancient mummy research [^824580ea]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Ethical issues are of foremost importance in modern bio-medical science. Ethical guidelines and socio-cultural public awareness exist for modern samples, whereas for ancient mummy studies both are de facto lacking. This is particularly striking considering the fact that examinations are done without informed consent or that the investigations are invasive due to technological aspects and that it affects personality traits. The aim of this study is to show the pro and contra arguments of ancient mummy research from an ethical point of view with a particular focus on the various stakeholders involved in this research. Relevant stakeholders in addition to the examined individual are, for example, a particular researcher, and the science community in general, likely descendents of the mummy or any future generation. Our broad discussion of the moral dilemma of mummy research should help to extract relevant decision-making criteria for any such study in future. We specifically do not make any recommendations about how to rate these decision-factors, since this is highly dependent on temporal and cultural affiliations of the involved researcher. The sustainability of modern mummy research is dependent on ethical orientation, which can only be given and eventually settled in an interdisciplinary approach such as the one we attempt to present here.

### Best interests versus resource allocation: could COVID-19 cloud decision-making for the cognitively impaired? [^85ae4e39]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic is necessitating difficult decisions, and expecting any part of the NHS to operate as it usually does is unrealistic. Nonetheless, there are certain values which should not be easily side-lined, including the protection of the right of patients lacking decision-making capacity to have decisions about their care made in their best interests. Early responses to the pandemic have demonstrated a devaluing of the more vulnerable in society. Coupled with the practical difficulties facing the best interests process, we suggest that there is a very real risk of decisions being made which are not in the best interests of cognitively impaired patients — especially if such patients become infected with the virus and require invasive respiratory support.

This is not an assault on doctors. Doctors are under immense pressure handling the pandemic and have spoken out about how uncomfortable they are with some of the decisions they are being forced to make, especially given the lack of national guidance to ensure consistency in the decision-making process. However, it is important for them to uphold the principles of the MCA 2005 even under this pressure. In particular, doctors must consider the reasons behind decisions they are making about the care of patients who lack decision-making capacity — are they being made in the best interests of that patient, or are other factors influencing them? Of course, doctors retain a right not to provide care that they consider futile or harmful, but this must be carefully navigated. Further, supporting patients in making decisions where possible and the involvement of consultees in decisions remains both a requirement under the MCA 2005 and an ethical imperative, so efforts must be made to minimise the impact of practical barriers on broad involvement in treatment decisions.

Efforts to uphold the principles of the MCA 2005 during the pandemic and not devalue the lives of those who cannot make decisions about their own care will also help to minimise the risk of COVID-19 having a lasting, negative impact on the rights of cognitively impaired patients. Undoubtedly, there will be lasting changes to the NHS following the pandemic, but it is important to reduce the likelihood of ethically problematic lasting changes. To protect the rights of the cognitively impaired at a time like this is necessary to ensure that they are not brought into question when life begins to return to normal.

### Shared decision making in endocrinology: present and future directions [^7e7d7149]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

In medicine and endocrinology, there are few clinical circumstances in which clinicians can accurately predict what is best for their patients. As a result, patients and clinicians frequently have to make decisions about which there is uncertainty. Uncertainty results from limitations in the research evidence, unclear patient preferences, or an inability to predict how treatments will fit into patients' daily lives. The work that patients and clinicians do together to address the patient's situation and engage in a deliberative dialogue about reasonable treatment options is often called shared decision making. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that facilitate this process. Shared decision making is a patient-centred approach in which clinicians share information about the benefits, harms, and burden of different reasonable diagnostic and treatment options, and patients explain what matters to them in view of their particular values, preferences, and personal context. Beyond the ethical argument in support of this approach, decision aids have been shown to improve patients' knowledge about the available options, accuracy of risk estimates, and decisional comfort. Decision aids also promote patient participation in the decision-making process. Despite accumulating evidence from clinical trials, policy support, and expert recommendations in endocrinology practice guidelines, shared decision making is still not routinely implemented in endocrine practice. Additional work is needed to enrich the number of available tools and to implement them in practice workflows. Also, although the evidence from randomised controlled trials favours the use of this shared decision making in other settings, populations, and illnesses, the effect of this approach has been studied in a few endocrine disorders. Future pragmatic trials are needed to explore the effect and feasibility of shared decision making implementation into routine endocrinology and primary care practice. With the available evidence, however, endocrinologists can now start to practice shared decision making, partner with their patients, and use their expertise to formulate treatment plans that reflect patient preferences and are more likely to fit into the context of patients' lives. In this Personal View, we describe shared decision making, the evidence behind the approach, and why and how both endocrinologists and their patients could benefit from this approach.

### A universal decision support system. addressing the decision-making needs of patients, families, and clinicians in the setting of critical illness [^185a2d4c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In the setting of a complex critical illness, preference-sensitive decision making-choosing between two or more reasonable treatment options-can be difficult for patients, families, and clinicians alike. A common challenge to making high-quality decisions in this setting is a lack of critical information access and sharing among participants. Decision aids-brochures, web applications, and videos-are a major focus of current research because mounting evidence suggests they can improve decision-making quality and enhance collaborative shared decision making. However, many decision aids have important limitations, including a relatively narrow capacity for personalization, an inability to gather and generate clinical data, a focus on only a single disease or treatment, and high developmental costs. To address these issues and to help guide future research, we propose a model of "universal" electronic decision support that can be easily adapted by clinicians and patients/families for whatever decision is at hand. In this scalable web-based platform, a general shared decision-making core structure would accommodate simple, interchangeable disease and treatment information modules. The format and content of the system could be adapted to decisional participants' unique characteristics, abilities, and needs. Universal decision support can better standardize a decisional approach and also allow a unique degree of personalization within a framework of shared decision making. We also discuss potential criticisms of this approach as well as strategies that can overcome them in a critical illness setting.

### Patient and healthcare professional factors influencing end-of-life decision-making during critical illness: a systematic review [^fb32cbda]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The need for better understanding of end-of-life care has never been greater. Debate about recent U.S. healthcare system reforms has highlighted that end-of-life decision-making is contentious. Providing compassionate end-of-life care that is appropriate and in accordance with patient wishes is an essential component of critical care. Because discord can undermine optimal end-of-life care, knowledge of factors that influence decision-making is important. We performed a systematic review to determine which factors are known to influence end-of-life decision-making among patients and healthcare providers. DATA SOURCES, SELECTION, AND ABSTRACTION: We conducted a structured search of Ovid Medline for interventional and observational research articles incorporating critical care and end-of-life decision-making terms.

Data Synthesis

Of 6259 publications, 102 were relevant to our review question. Patient factors predicting less intensive end-of-life care include increasing age, comorbidity, and limited functional status; these factors appear to be influential for both clinicians and patients. Patient and clinician race, ethnicity, and nationality also appear to influence the technological intensity of end-of-life care. In general, white patients and those in North America and Northern Europe may be less likely to desire intensive end-of-life care than others. Physicians of similar geo-ethnic origin to patients appear less likely to prescribe such therapy. Physicians with more clinical experience and those routinely working in the intensive care unit are less likely than other physicians to recommend technologically intense care for critically ill patients at the end-of-life.

Conclusions

Patients and clinicians may approach end-of-life discussions with different expectations and preferences, influenced by religion, race, culture, and geography. Appreciation of those factors associated with more and less technologically intense care may raise awareness, aid communication, and guide clinicians in end-of-life discussions.

### Value of choice [^a46af2af]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Accounts of the value of patient choice in contemporary medical ethics typically focus on the act of choosing. Being the one to choose, it is argued, can be valuable either because it enables one to bring about desired outcomes, or because it is a way of enacting one's autonomy. This paper argues that all such accounts miss something important. In some circumstances, it is having the opportunity to choose, not the act of choosing, that is valuable. That is because in many situations whether one has, or is denied, that opportunity conveys how one is seen. In particular, it conveys whether or not one is seen as an equal and competent member of society. Adequately recognising this fact has implications for what healthcare professionals should do, ones that require a move away from the current focus on autonomy. The paper draws out these implications by focusing on patients who may struggle to be recognised as competent and equal members of society, and whose autonomy may thus itself sometimes be in question.

### A person-centred and thriving-promoting intervention in nursing homes-study protocol for the U-age nursing home multi-centre, non-equivalent controlled group before-after trial [^24e3d829]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Person-centredness/person-centred care

Person-centredness is described as an ethical approach to human interaction, grounded in a fundamental understanding of humans as autonomous reflective persons with capacity and freedom to be the person that they want to be. Implying recognition, respect and trust, person-centredness honours the absolute freedom, value and decision making capacity of each person, regardless of age and physical and cognitive functioning, and emphasises that personhood and dignity needs protection in severe frailty. The ethics of person-centredness is increasingly being operationalised into person-centred care in clinical settings by taking the perspective of the person in need of care as well as the family members as constant point of reference, facilitating shared decision-making, personal authority and choice. In relation to care staff, person-centredredness involves valuing them as individuals by recognising and allowing for the person behind the role to emerge and to draw upon the unique contribution their personalities, experiences, skills and histories can bring to the work. Some models exists that conceptualises the concept of person-centred care, for example Dementia Care Mapping (DCM), the VIPS framework, and the Person-Centred Nursing framework (PCN). These models conceptualises person-centred care as working actively with the older person's lifestory, personalising care and environment, establishing partnerships and shared decision-making, and prioritising social relations and interactions through the involvement of relatives in the care process.

Thriving

Thriving refers to a person's well-being in relation to the place of stay, and can be understood as a result of an effective mobilisation of both individual and social resources, with the aim to support older people's possibilities to adjust well into their current life situation and the place of stay. As described by Bergland & Kirkevold, thriving involves two core and five additional dimensions. The core dimensions represent resident attitudes towards living in a nursing home, and the quality of care and caregivers. The additional dimensions involve qualities in the physical environment, positive relationships with other residents, participation in meaningful activities, opportunities to go outdoors, and relationships with family. Thus, experiences of thriving seem to depend upon how people perceive their present situation in relation to different physical and psychosocial environment factors, i.e. the person-environment interaction and fit.

### Ethical case interventions for adult patients [^9110082b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Decisions in clinical medicine can be associated with ethical challenges. Ethical case interventions (e.g. ethics committee, moral case deliberation) identify and analyse ethical conflicts which occur within the context of care for patients. Ethical case interventions involve ethical experts, different health professionals as well as the patient and his/her family. The aim is to support decision-making in clinical practice. This systematic review gathered and critically appraised the available evidence of controlled studies on the effectiveness of ethical case interventions.

Objectives

To determine whether ethical case interventions result in reduced decisional conflict or moral distress of those affected by an ethical conflict in clinical practice; improved patient involvement in decision-making and a higher quality of life in adult patients. To determine the most effective models of ethical case interventions and to analyse the use and appropriateness of the outcomes in experimental studies.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies to September 2018: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We also searched CDSR and DARE for related reviews. Furthermore, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and conducted a cited reference search for all included studies in ISI WEB of Science. We also searched the references of the included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies which compared ethical case interventions with usual care or an active control in any language. The included population were adult patients. However, studies with mixed populations consisting of adults and children were included, if a subgroup or sensitivity analysis (or both) was performed for the adult population.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care review group. We used meta-analysis based on a random-effects model for treatment costs and structured analysis for the remaining outcomes, because these were heterogeneously reported. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included four randomised trials published in six articles. The publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2014. Three studies were conducted in the USA, and one study in Taiwan. All studies were conducted on intensive care units and included 1165 patients. We judged the included studies to be of moderate or high risk of bias. It was not possible to compare different models of the intervention regarding effectiveness due to the diverse character of the interventions and the small number of studies. Included studies did not directly measure the main outcomes. All studies received public funding and one received additional funding from private sources. We identified two models of ethical case interventions: proactive and request-based ethics consultation. Three studies evaluated proactive ethics consultation (n = 1103) of which one study reported findings on one key outcome criterion. The studies did not report data on decisional conflict, moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision-making, quality of life or ethical competency for proactive ethics consultation. One study assessed satisfaction with care on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = lowest rating, 5 = highest rating). The healthcare providers (nurses and physicians, n = 365) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 81.4% in the control group and 86.1% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). The patients or their surrogates (n = 275) scored a value of 4 or 5 for 83.6% in the control group and for 74.8% in the intervention group (P > 0.05). It was uncertain whether proactive ethics consultation led to high satisfaction with care, because the certainty of evidence was very low. One study evaluated request-based ethics consultation (n = 62). The study indirectly measured decisional conflict by assessing consensus regarding patient care. The risk (increase in consensus, reduction in decisional conflict) increased by 80% as a result of the intervention. The risk ratio was 0.20 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.46; P < 0.01). It was uncertain whether request-based ethics consultation reduced decisional conflict, because the certainty of evidence was very low. The study did not report data on moral distress of participants of ethical case interventions, patient involvement in decision-making, quality of life, or ethical competency or satisfaction with care for request-based ethics consultation.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not possible to determine the effectiveness of ethical case interventions with certainty due to the low certainty of the evidence of included studies in this review. The effectiveness of ethical case interventions should be investigated in light of the outcomes reported in this systematic review. In addition, there is need for further research to identify and measure outcomes which reflect the goals of different types of ethical case intervention.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^f3b3467e]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) — tools and system support — states that tools designed to support formal SDM should be designed with multistakeholder input, including both clinicians and patients, and that payers and healthcare systems must support policies and infrastructure that facilitate patient-centered care, including formal SDM when appropriate. Patient decision aids are evidence-based tools designed to support SDM between a clinician and a patient, not replace it, and the evidence base for rigorous decision aids is robust, including numerous trials demonstrating that patient decision aids improve knowledge, satisfaction, and patient and clinician communication; increase patient involvement in decision making; and reduce patient decisional conflict and regret.

### Committee opinion no. 617: end-of-life decision making [^583e5953]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ethical principles and ethics resources — Adherence to basic ethical principles is critical in care for the dying, with beneficence requiring that the patient not be abandoned and that desired attempts at a good quality of life be supported, and nonmaleficence asking physicians to be conscious when the burdens of technological support outweigh the hoped-for benefits. Justice aims to provide access to excellent end-of-life services to all patients regardless of payment abilities, with timely referral to palliative care and hospice services, and calls for physicians to consider the cost of recommended interventions and whether they are efficacious. Respect for autonomy dictates that the choices of the patient with decision-making capacity be respected, and respect for culture allows varied spiritual or religious traditions to be understood and respected; when patients lack capacity, conflicts may arise between surrogate decision makers and cultural expectations, for which religious or spiritual advisers and the hospital or local ethics committee may be helpful, and the physician needs to balance respect for culture with the opinion that informed consent from the patient herself is a vital component of health care. The Joint Commission requires all U.S. hospitals to have a process that allows staff, patients, and families to address ethical issues or issues prone to conflict, commonly via an ethics committee or ethics consultant/consultation service that is readily accessible; some facilities offer moral distress consults, and assistance of trained palliative care clinicians and religious or spiritual advisers can help physicians and patients work through an agreed-upon plan of care.

### Demographic and prosocial intrapersonal characteristics of biobank participants and refusers: the findings of a survey in the Netherlands [^e4d3f62e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Research in genetics relies heavily on voluntary contributions of personal data. We aimed to acquire insights into the differences between participants and refusers of participation in a Dutch population-based biobank. Accordingly, we assessed the demographic and prosocial intrapersonal characteristics of respondents who participated (n = 2615) or refused to participate (n = 404) in the Lifelines biobank and databank. Our results indicated that health-related values critically influence participation decisions. The participation threshold for Lifelines was determined by an absence of health-related values and of trust in government. Therefore, considering these factors in communication and recruitment strategies could enhance participation in biomedical research. No indications were found of a stronger general prosociality of participants or their trust in researchers beyond the context of biobanking. This emphasizes the contextual understanding of the decision of participation in biobanking. Our findings may contribute to improving recruitment strategies by incorporating relevant values and/or highlighting prosocial benefits. Moreover, they foreground the need to address trust issues in collaborations between data repositories and commercial companies. Future research should explore how prosocial intrapersonal characteristics drive participation and withdrawal decisions and relate to contextual attributes.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^d168cddb]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Dementia evaluations — informed consent in older adults with cognitive impairment — require special attention, as psychologists recognize that informed consent can be a special challenge in dementia evaluations and the presence of dementia alone does not imply that the person lacks decision-making capacity. Questions of capacity are addressed with focused capacity evaluations that address specific capacity domains and may include supportive decision-making, which enables older adults with cognitive impairment to make decisions about their life and care while receiving help and guidance from a trusted network of people. The ABA and APA handbook notes that a person may have capacity to consent and either agrees or refuses; if the person agrees without capacity they are generally said to have "assented" and the assessment process goes forward, whereas if the person disagrees the psychologist must document why the person is believed to lack the capacity to refuse the evaluation, and in some situations the capacity evaluation stops there, though in other situations where a capacity evaluation is court ordered a psychologist may be asked to provide an opinion based on his or her observations of the person. When describing the purpose, nature, and procedures of the evaluation, the psychologist uses terms in a manner that will foster optimal understanding and considers factors that may impact decision-making, tailoring language accordingly. In securing informed consent, psychologists explain to individuals and their legal proxies issues including what to expect in the evaluation, the financial costs of an evaluation, the benefits and risks for the person being assessed, limitations to confidentiality including reporting suspected elder abuse, constraints on release of raw test data, and mandatory reporting requirements. Psychologists also recognize that exploitation of older adults does occur and evaluate the possibility that an assessment may be requested for reasons that may not be in the best interest of the client.

### The philosophical moment of the medical decision: revisiting emotions felt, to improve ethics of future decisions [^4be49db3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

The present investigation looks for a solution to the problem of the influence of feelings and emotions on our ethical decisions. This problem can be formulated in the following way. On the one hand, emotions (fear, pity and so on) can alter our sense of discrimination and lead us to make our wrong decisions. On the other hand, it is known that lack of sensitivity can alter our judgment and lead us to sacrifice basic ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Only emotions can turn a decision into an ethical one, but they can also turn it into an unreasonable one. To avoid this contradiction, suggest integrating emotions with the decisional factors of the process of "retrospective thinking". During this thinking, doctors usually try to identify the nature and impact of feelings on the decision they have just made. In this retrospective moment of analysis of the decision, doctors also question themselves on the feelings they did not experience. They do this to estimate the consequences of this lack of feeling on the way they behaved with the patient.

### Clinical and professional ethics guidelines for the practice of thyroidology [^d1cc71c1]. Thyroid (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroidology ethics — core principles and conflict resolution — state that thyroid disease specialists should provide care consistent with these core ethical principles, but also recognize that patient care occurs within a framework influenced by an array of psychosocial factors within the home, family, friendship groups, cultural, and societal context. The Principle of Respect for Persons obligates healthcare providers to respect autonomous patients' wishes and to guide care in accordance with patients' values, beliefs, and preferences, and when patients lack decision-making capacity this principle obligates healthcare providers to seek a surrogate decision-maker to make a substituted judgment consistent with the patients' stated preferences or values if known, or, if not known, to make decisions that are in the patients' best interests. To fulfill this obligation, the Principle of Respect for Persons further requires that valid informed consent to treatment is sought from patients or their surrogate decision-makers. The Principle of Beneficence obligates practitioners to improve patient well-being by maximizing clinical benefits and minimizing clinical harms, and healthcare providers must recognize that there may be limits to patient autonomy and what physicians should offer as therapeutic — especially when patients request (or demand) interventions otherwise judged to be medically ineffective and/or inappropriate. The Principle of Nonmaleficence obligates practitioners not to cause or introduce intentional harms for which there is no expectation of resulting greater benefits, not to neglect patients, and to warn identifiable third parties if the patient is known or perceived to pose certain threats or risks to third parties, and under this principle, medical errors (unintentional harms) should be fully disclosed to relevant parties. The Principle of Justice concerns access and barriers to healthcare and includes ensuring that healthcare is allocated equally without discriminatory practices based on such matters as income, psychosocial issues, health insurance coverage, age, cultural backgrounds, sex, or sexual orientation. Whenever such conflicts occur, a clinical ethics consultation service should be sought, if institutionally available, and if a clinical ethics consultation service is not available, advice may be sought by contacting the American Society of Bioethics and Humanities (www.asbh.org).

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^74d64253]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Patient autonomy — patient-centered care and shared decision making (SDM) recommendations emphasize that "Medical care should be patient-centered, meaning it should be tailored to optimize the outcomes and to support the values most important to the individual", and that "Clinicians should elicit and document preferences and values important to the patient, including the outcomes most important to them". The guidance further states, "Although the principles of patient-centered care apply broadly, formal SDM should be reserved for decisions with significant tradeoffs among reasonable options". It also specifies, "Tools designed to support formal SDM should be designed with multistakeholder input, including both clinicians and patients", and "Payers and healthcare systems must support policies and infrastructure that facilitate patient-centered care, including formal SDM when appropriate".

### Community ambulation: influences on therapists and clients reasoning and decision making [^d70977d1]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Community ambulation is an important element of a rehabilitation training programme and its achievement is a goal shared by rehabilitation professionals and clients. The factors that influence a physiotherapist's or health professionals decision making around the preparation of a client for community ambulation and the factors that influence a client's decision to return to walking in their community are unclear.

Objective

To review the available literature about the factors that have influenced the reasoning and decision making of rehabilitation therapists and clients around the topic of ambulation in the community.

Method

Three separate searches of the available literature were undertaken using Ovid, Cinahl, ProQuest, Medline and Ebscohost databases. Databases were searched from 1966 to October 2006. The first search explored the literature for factors that influence the clinical reasoning of rehabilitation therapists. The second search explored the literature for factors that influence client's decision to ambulate in the community. A third search was undertaken to explore the literature for the demands of community ambulation in rural communities.

Results

Very few studies were found that explored community ambulation in the context of clinical reasoning and decision making, the facilitators and barriers to a clients return to ambulation in their community or the demands of ambulation in a rural community.

Conclusion

Consideration of the environment is key to the successful return to walking in the community of clients with mobility problems yet little literature has been found to guide physiotherapist's decision making about preparing a clients to return to walking in the community. An individual's participation in their society is also a result of the interaction between their personal characteristics and his or her environment. The influence of these characteristics may vary from one individual to another yet the factors that influence a person's decision to return to walking in their community after stroke remain unclear.

### Ethical decision making in intensive care units: a burnout risk factor? Results from a multicentre study conducted with physicians and nurses [^9c7425f6]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ethical decision making in intensive care is a demanding task. The need to proceed to ethical decision is considered to be a stress factor that may lead to burnout. The aim of this study is to explore the ethical problems that may increase burnout levels among physicians and nurses working in Portuguese intensive care units (ICUs). A quantitative, multicentre, correlational study was conducted among 300 professionals.

Results

The most crucial ethical decisions made by professionals working in ICU were related to communication, withholding or withdrawing treatments and terminal sedation. A positive relation was found between ethical decision making and burnout in nurses, namely, between burnout and the need to withdraw treatments (p = 0.032), to withhold treatments (p = 0.002) and to proceed to terminal sedation (p = 0.005). This did not apply to physicians. Emotional exhaustion was the burnout subdimension most affected by the ethical decision. The nurses' lack of involvement in ethical decision making was identified as a risk factor. Nevertheless, in comparison with nurses (6%), it was the physicians (34%) who more keenly felt the need to proceed to ethical decisions in ICU.

Conclusions

Ethical problems were reported at different levels by physicians and nurses. The type of ethical decisions made by nurses working in Portuguese ICUs had an impact on burnout levels. This did not apply to physicians. This study highlights the need for education in the field of ethics in ICUs and the need to foster inter-disciplinary discussion so as to encourage ethical team deliberation in order to prevent burnout.

### A.S.P.E.N. ethics position paper [^a12dfca8]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2010). Medium credibility.

Cultural and religious considerations in artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) emphasize that "Cultural values and religious beliefs are far more powerful and pervasive factors in decisions regarding ANH than in those involving almost any other modern medical intervention", so "practitioners should endeavor to learn about the relevant religious positions and cultural attitudes comprising their patient population, learn the questions to ask and listen to the patients". Institutional context also matters because "Clinicians should also be aware that the inherent culture of an institution, such as a nursing home, may also influence the decision to use ANH", and, regardless of agreement, "Clinicians should show sensitivity and respect for the individual faith commitments and cultural preferences of patients regarding ANH even when they do not agree with them from a medical perspective".

### Using an algorithmic approach to shape human decision-making through attraction to patterns [^f76ffab4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The current study did not directly manipulate or assess a number of alternative motivational factors stated above, such as risk aversion or an experience of agency. The absence of targeted manipulations means that the influence (if any) of these factors remains speculative, and future research should design experiments that will systematically isolate and assess the relative contribution of these different factors. Additionally, future research where, for example, participants are explicitly asked about the amount of control they felt during the task, or their confidence in when rewards will be received, as well as their ability to explicitly reproduce the observed pattern, while using algorithms that systematically differ in the degree of regularity of the rewards allocated, could help tease these possibilities apart.

As mentioned above, recent reviews of the efficacy of nudges suggest that, to date, little is known about how or if people's choices can be substantially affected by subtle or concealed interventions. Nevertheless various actors have much to gain from devising such interventions, and may in fact take advantage of the belief that they are ineffective and hence harmless. The truth is that we do not know, yet given the scant data on potentially harmful nudges, malevolent actors may appear to meet the most stringent of regulations and still intentionally and adversely influence unsuspecting digital consumers or seekers of information. At the very least, the current demonstration should make it clear to regulators that subtle changes in the decision environment can have a real and negative impact on individual and societal interests.

By capitalizing on humans' preference for regularity, RaCaS biased participants' choices even as they were attempting to maximize their profit. This is crucial, especially when considered in light of current estimates regarding the (in)efficacy of nudging, at least in real world contexts. A limitation of the current study is that the controlled laboratory conditions may not fully reflect the complexity of real-world decision environments, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. On the other hand, while RaCaS' efficacy may decrease when deployed in such contexts, the fact that several of RaCaS' design decisions were admittingly arbitrary, leaves room for optimization and suggests that the current estimate of the bias created by RaCaS can be taken as a lower bound of its biasing potential. For example, other regularities could attract individuals even more, and using a more efficient reward allocation policy could minimize the number of cases in which the Bias + rewards are left to the very last trials, better harnessing their potential influence.

### Decision-making in the catheter laboratory: the most important variable in successful outcomes [^e2fd47cb]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasingly the importance of how and why we make decisions in the medical arena has been questioned. Traditionally the aeronautical and business worlds have shed a light on this complex area of human decision-making. In this review we reflect on what we already know about the complexity of decision-making in addition to directing particular focus on the challenges to decision-making in the high-intensity environment of the pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory. We propose that the most critical factor in outcomes for children in the catheterization lab may not be technical failures but rather human factors and the lack of preparation and robust shared decision-making process between the catheterization team. Key technical factors involved in the decision-making process include understanding the anatomy, the indications and objective to be achieved, equipment availability, procedural flow, having a back-up plan and post-procedural care plan. Increased awareness, pre-catheterization planning, use of standardized clinical assessment and management plans and artificial intelligence may provide solutions to pitfalls in decision-making. Further research and efforts should be directed towards studying the impact of human factors in the cardiac catheterization laboratory as well as the broader medical environment.

### Should the scope of NIPT be limited by a' threshold of seriousness'? [^365520e0]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our paper explores whether there is an ethical basis for using the seriousness criterion to limit the scope of NIPT that is made available for pregnant people. We recognise that in practice, there are a variety of factors that impinge upon access to NIPT, including who might be able to afford an expanded test. Performance and clinical utility may also be relevant for limiting the scope of the test. Thus, we are not suggesting that seriousness is the only way to limit test scope in any given circumstance; rather, we are concerned with the question of whether seriousness should in principle be used as a reason to limit the test scope at all.

There is a need for robust ethical analysis and empirical evidence in determining whether limiting the scope of NIPT best addresses concerns about expanded NIPT. Given the potential for regulatory limits to negatively impact reproductive autonomy, it is important to ensure that individual choice is not eroded 'wherever and whenever a voting majority can be assembled against them'. Our intention in this paper is not to examine the validity of concerns raised in relation to expanded screening but rather to evaluate whether a threshold of seriousness is a justified and workable response. In the following section, we critically analyse the 'seriousness' threshold, to argue that it is arbitrary, potentially stigmatises certain disabilities over others, and fails to respect reproductive autonomy. We recommend that concerns about the impact of expanded NIPT could be more appropriately addressed through improving practices in its clinical delivery that enable the scope of NIPT screening to be adapted for individuals on a case by case basis. In the final section, we outline a decision-making process that enables healthcare providers to support prospective parents to make informed decisions about the nature and scope of NIPT screening based on their own values and social context.

### Cognitive debiasing 1: origins of bias and theory of debiasing [^469338c0]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Biases are 'predictable deviations from rationality'. Many biases that diagnosticians have can possibly be recognised and corrected. Essentially, this is the process that underlies learning and refining of clinical behaviour. We may have acquired an inappropriate response to a particular situation that, in turn, leads to a maladaptive habit. Through feedback, however, or other processes, some insight or revelation occurs and we are able to change our thinking to achieve a more successful outcome. The basic premise is that if we can effectively debias our thinking, from innate and learned biases, we will be better thinkers and more accurate diagnosticians.

Clinical decision making is a complex process. Besides the overall vulnerability of the human mind towards biases in decision making, it is generally appreciated that the quality of decision making is also influenced by ambient conditions: prevailing conditions in the immediate environment — context, team factors, patient factors, resource limitations, physical plant design and ergonomic factors. Individual factors such as affective state, general fatigue, cognitive load, decision fatigue, interruptions and distractions, sleep deprivation and sleep-debt, are influential too. Other individual factors such as personality, intelligence, rationality, gender and other variables also impact decision making. Since our judgments are so vulnerable to biases and so many different factors affect decision making, the challenge of developing clinical decision makers who consistently make optimal and reliable decisions appears daunting. Two questions need to be answered: can we improve our performance by using cognitive debiasing to repair incorrect judgments made under the influence of bias? This means appropriately alerting the analytical mode to situations in which a bias might arise so that it can be detected and a debiasing intervention applied. Second, can we mitigate the impact of adverse ambient conditions, either by improving conditions in the decision making environment, or by changing the threshold for detection of bias and initiating debiasing strategies?

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^17e40a66]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Parental decision-making and clinician responsibilities — parental coping mechanisms and their perceptions of undue external influence by clinicians or family members on decision-making may result in hostile and uncertain feelings about treatment goals for their seriously ill children, and clinicians should be aware of the effects of stress and uncertainty on autonomous parental decision-making and choose effective communication strategies to limit these negative effects. Parents generally are better situated than others to understand the unique needs of their children and family and make appropriate, caring decisions regarding their children's health care, but this parental responsibility for medical decision-making in caring for their child or young adult is not an absolute right because the state also has a societal interest in protecting the child or young adult from harm and can challenge parental authority in situations in which the child or young adult is put at risk (the doctrine of parens patriae); pediatric health care providers have legal and ethical duties to provide a standard of care that meets the pediatric patient's needs and not necessarily what the parents desire or request. Parental decision-making should primarily be understood as parents' responsibility to support the interests of their child and to preserve family relationships, and it is important to note that parental authority regarding medical decision-making for their minor child or young adult who lacks the capacity for medical decision-making is constrained compared with the more robust autonomy in medical decision-making enjoyed by competent adults making decisions regarding their own care; by moving the conversation from parental rights toward parental responsibility, clinicians may help families minimize conflicts encountered in the course of difficult medical decision-making.

### Evidence, values, guidelines and rational decision-making [^7f44beeb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Medical decision-making involves choices, which can lead to benefits or to harms. Most benefits and harms may or may not occur, and can be minor or major when they do. Medical research, especially randomized controlled trials, provides estimates of chance of occurrence and magnitude of event. Because there is no universally accepted method for weighing harms against benefits, and because the ethical principle of autonomy mandates informed choice by patient, medical decision-making is inherently an individualized process. It follows that the practice of aiming for universal implementation of standardized guidelines is irrational and unethical. Irrational because the possibility of benefits is implicitly valued more than the possibility of comparable harms, and unethical because guidelines remove decision making from the patient and give it instead to a physician, committee or health care system. This essay considers the cases of cancer screening and diabetes management, where guidelines often advocate universal implementation, without regard to informed choice and individual decision-making.

### What is important when making treatment decisions in metastatic breast cancer? A qualitative analysis of decision-making in patients and oncologists [^720266cf]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an ideal environment for shared decision-making because of the large number of guideline-based treatment options with similar efficacy but different toxicity profiles. This qualitative analysis describes patient and provider factors that influence decision-making in treatment of MBC.

Materials and Methods

Patients and community oncologists completed in-person interviews. Academic medical oncologists participated in focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo. Using an a priori model based on the Ottawa Framework, two independent coders analyzed transcripts using a constant comparative method. Major themes and exemplary quotes were extracted.

Results

Participants included 20 patients with MBC, 6 community oncologists, and 5 academic oncologists. Analysis of patient interviews revealed a decision-making process characterized by the following themes: decision-making style, contextual factors, and preferences. Patient preference subthemes include treatment efficacy, physical side effects of treatment, emotional side effects of treatment, cognitive side effects of treatment, cost and financial toxicity, salience of cutting-edge treatment options (clinical trial or newly approved medication), treatment logistics and convenience, personal and family responsibilities, treatment impact on daily activities, participation in self-defining endeavors, attending important events, and pursuing important goals. Physician decisions emphasized drug-specific characteristics (treatment efficacy, side effects, cost) rather than patient preferences, which might impact treatment choice.

Conclusion

Although both patients with MBC and oncologists considered treatment characteristics when making decisions, patients' considerations were broader than oncologists', incorporating contextual factors such as the innovative value of the treatment and life responsibilities. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggests the value of tools to facilitate systematic communication of preferences in the setting of MBC.

Implications For Practice

Both patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and oncologists emphasized importance of efficacy and physical side effects when making treatment decisions. However, other patient considerations for making treatment decisions were broader, incorporating contextual factors such as the logistics of treatments, personal and family responsibilities, and ability to attend important events. Furthermore, individual patients varied substantially in priorities that they want considered in treatment decisions. Differences in perspectives between patients and oncologists suggest the value of tools to facilitate systematic elicitation of preferences and communication of those preferences to oncologists for integration into decision-making in MBC.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^f2f5b216]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee — key terms for DOI and conflicts of interest define disclosure of interests as a signed declaration of financial and intellectual interests related to health care, and conflict of interest as any declared interest that may affect or be perceived to affect objectivity and independence; a participant is any person involved in development of a clinical guideline or in supporting evidence review; a household member includes a partner with whom the participant has lived for ≥ 1 y in the same home or a dependent/related person with whom the participant has lived for ≥ 1 y in the same home; the reporting time frame is 3 y back from the current year; types of interests include active (ongoing), inactive (terminated within the previous 3 y), financial (any payments or financial value from holdings), and intellectual (attachment to academic ideas/activities or a specific viewpoint); factors affecting seriousness include clinical relevance (same disease/condition and ≥ 1 of: same cascade of care, same intervention, competing intervention, competing intellectual property) and high-risk entity (entity with a vested interest defined as direct financial profit) in clinical decision making.

### The wish to die and hastening death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a scoping review [^6a0d82cf]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Impact of psychosocial factors and the broader socio-cultural context

The international consensus definition of the WTHDfocusses on physical symptoms, psychological distress, existential suffering and on social aspects in the sense of feelings of being a burden to others. This corresponds well with our results, in that psychosocial factors, in particular, have a great impact on decisions in favour of life-shortening measures. However, according to our findings, the broader socio-cultural context and socio-demographic status are also of importance. In particular, the immense variation in use of IV between countriessuggests differences, not only on an individual level. On the one hand, positive attitudes and a decision in favour of IV are related to an adequate healthcare system, support and information provided by healthcare professionals and supporting attitudes of families. On the other hand, an inadequate healthcare system or lack of financial coverage, as well as the absence of legal options to discontinue treatment, seem to influence decisions. Media reports are referred to as distributing negative images of ventilation; and cultural or social values also seem to play a role, although these aspects remain rather vague in the studies we examined. Furthermore, negative attitudes of healthcare professionals towards certain therapies are reported to influence the way information is provided, thus indirectly undermining patient autonomy.

Ethical issues

From an ethical perspective, this reveals a highly problematic aspect: PALS are not always provided with sufficient or adequately presented information and counselling about treatment options and the possibility of discontinuing treatment. This is partly due to attitudes, but also prejudices, of healthcare professionalsand to social and legal conditions. For example, Matuz revealed that some physicians in Germany avoid communication about IV, because they assume a negative quality of life, and fear ethical conflicts or legal consequences if patients request withdrawal from IV. This underlines the fact that healthcare professionals must be aware of their personal judgements and reactions to patient requests, especially in end-of-life discussions. Mattulat refers to another German study from 2003, which showed that 81% of invasively ventilated patients had not been informed about the pros and cons of mechanical ventilation before they were tracheotomised, and only 29% were given the opportunity of discussing the end-of-life phase with their physicians. Therefore, at least sometimes, PALS are not given the basic information needed to make an informed decision about end-of-life issues, resulting in a disrespect of their autonomy and a lack of required support.

### Personalizing decision-making for persons with Parkinson's disease: where do we stand and what to improve? [^588ebdf5]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is interesting to see how different clinical and non-clinical factors that influence personalized decision-making find their way into the consultation room, and importantly, how this process can be optimized further and implemented for all the different professional disciplines that are involved in the management of PD. Even though professionals in our study indicated in the interviews that they use many different factors to tailor decisions to individual patients, these factors were often not explicitly discussed in daily practice. Furthermore, we noticed that the expected effect of a decision was seldom discussed, and if so, professionals mainly referred to a 'trial and error approach'. A more specific expectation of the effect of a decision for an individual patient was described in generic terms without stating why that was expected for that particular patient. This points out that it is still difficult to deliver care that is tailored to an individual patient. It would also be interesting to see whether a fuller discussion of the factors used to tailor the decision, or a discussion of the expected outcomes for the individual, would lead to better treatment adherence. Studying adherence was beyond the scope of this study.

The most likely explanation for not discussing individual decision outcomes in this study is the difficulty to predict the effect of a decision for an individual patient, which was indeed mentioned as the most important barrier for being able to make truly personalized decisions. Sufficient evidence on the impact of individual patient- and disease characteristics on outcomes is lacking, as are trials comparing different treatment options for different types of patients. Efforts are made to develop more personalized predictive algorithms, using large observational datasets with structured and unstructured data from large populations of real life patients. Machine learning techniques, i.e. analytics that learn automatically from data, can be used to find specific patterns and profiles in large datasets to make more personalized predictions. These are promising developments that might help to overcome the barrier of predicting patient outcome on individual profile level. The question remains whether these technological approaches will allow us to build personal disease profiles that are sufficiently fine-grained to make truly individualized decisions. It is perhaps more likely to expect that machine learning and other comparable approaches will allow us to build a set of subgroups, with much more detail than the rather crude subtyping that is currently available, allowing us to make at least decisions tailored to a specific subtype of PD. Such personalized predictions could ideally be integrated in a shared decision-making process where a patient and professional make a joint decision on what is best for that patient at that moment.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^7d1a774e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patient assent — practical steps are to help the patient achieve a developmentally appropriate awareness of the nature of his or her condition, tell the patient what he or she can expect with tests and treatments, make a clinical assessment of the patient's understanding and factors influencing responses (including whether there is inappropriate pressure to accept testing or therapy), and solicit an expression of the patient's willingness to accept the proposed care.

### Understanding the influence and impact of stakeholder engagement in patient-centered outcomes research: a qualitative study [^3a06d6fa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that not all instances of influence resulted in a desirable, observable, or known impact on the study. The few reported undesirable impacts related to unanticipated delays or increased costs. Sometimes, researchers unintentionally constrained influence by not offering an opportunity or clearly articulating a role for stakeholders. In other cases, researchers could not implement stakeholders' suggestions due to IRB constraints or other barriers. This finding adds weight to early conceptualizations of engagement that suggest that human and system factors can enable or disable partner contributions. – Institutional system adjustments and training for researchers and partners in engagement may be warranted. For example, researchers and partners may need additional support balancing input and scientific rigor in team discussions.

Many impacts identified by this study were proximal in nature. This focus is consistent with the fact that two-thirds of the studies in the sample were in progress and proximal impacts may be easiest to recognize and recall. It will be important, as a greater number of stakeholder-driven studies are completed and diffused, to also measure longer-term impacts, such as the relevance and usefulness of findings in healthcare decision making. Doing so requires having a comprehensive way of capturing proximal impacts as they are occurring. The taxonomy of types of influences and impacts from this study can be foundational to future research in this area.

Limitations and Strengths

We used a purposeful sampling approach with PCORI-funded studies and conducted interviews in English, which may limit generalizability of the findings. For each study, we interviewed one partner and one to two researchers; other people involved in the study may have had different experiences. However, across studies, we were able to identify diverse perspectives, including patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders. Because interviewers were outside of the funder, participants had greater assurance of confidentiality to share less socially biased examples.

At times, interview participants had difficulty recalling specific examples of influence and impact. Because the analysis rested on recalled examples, it may not capture the full breadth of influences or impacts. To enhance recall, interviewers prompted participants to think back to specific events or decision-making points mentioned in study progress reports and asked them to share what they remembered. Even with the limitations, these systematic, in-depth qualitative findings lay a critical foundation for continued examination of engagement's influence and impact.

### Factors that impact on women's decision-making around prenatal genomic tests: an international discrete choice survey [^10d227f6]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

The design, administration, and analysis of the DCE survey followed good practice guidelines. Ethical approval for the study was granted by National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority London – Riverside. Research Ethics Committee reference: 18/LO/2120.

2.1 Development of discrete‐choice experiment choice scenarios

An extensive description of the development of the attributes and levels for the DCE survey is provided elsewhere. In brief, we applied a two‐phase mixed methods approach involving a systematic review of the literature, followed by semi‐structured interviews and a quantitative scoring exercise. This yielded five attributes (described in Table 1): diagnostic yield, reporting of variants of uncertain significance, reporting of SFs, time to receive results, and which healthcare provider explains the results. Each of these attributes had either two or three levels which were grounded in reality yet in some cases for example, diagnostic yield, represented the higher and lower ends of what was realistic to 'encourage' participants to make decisions and trade‐offs. An example of the sample choice questions is shown in Figure 1. In the DCE survey (supplementary information Figure 1), we first described a hypothetical scenario in which a couple attend their routine 20 weeks ultrasound scan and a fetal anomaly is suspected. The couple is subsequently offered invasive testing (presented as having a 0.5% risk of miscarriage – this risk estimate was chosen to strike a balance between how this risk is presented in different countries). Respondents were then presented with 13 choice questions, which is considered an acceptable number of choices to complete without introducing concerns around the impact of fatigue on responses. For each choice question, responders were asked to choose Test A, Test B or No Test. The No Test option was included to make the choice more realistic; in practice, women may choose not to have a test. This approach has been used in previous DCE studies looking at attributes of prenatal testing. Respondents were told that if they selected No Test, they would not get a diagnosis, waiting time would be zero, and no uncertain results or secondary findings would be reported. If they selected No Test, respondents were then asked which test they would prefer if No Test was not an option.

### Creating an ethical culture to support recovery from substance use disorders [^70b40085]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

PCC and supportive, empathic relationships

Commitments to PCC are well established in health systems. A person-centred approach is driven by practical and ethical imperatives to elicit the values and preferences of service users. Among the practical drivers of PCC are the need to provide quality care that is tailored to the service users' particular needs and preferences in an efficient and sustainable manner. Ethical drivers for PCC include the need to safeguard the values and rights of individuals. It is this same type of person-centred approach which features in the recovery process outlined by SAMHSA. The Institute of Medicine has also recommended that, despite concerns over intermittently impaired decision making being associated with SUDs, PCC should and can be used in this field.

Related to PCC is literature supporting the importance of effective therapeutic relationships in the context of SUD treatment. A strong therapeutic alliance is as significant as the type of treatment a person receives. As Miller et al note 'treatment method is not the only, and often not even the primary determinant of client outcomes'. he variation in the success of therapists, including some with particularly poor outcomes, raises concerns over the performance of individual counsellors, therapists and treatment facilities. Research suggests there are a range of relational factors that have a positive impact, including: therapists having 'strong interpersonal skills', alliance building with clients, collecting client feedback and empathy. Empathic consultations with clients have been presented as a significant influence on achieving positive outcomes. Rogers describes empathy as 'temporarily living in the other's life, moving about in it delicately without making judgements'. The importance of strong, empathic relationships with clients has been linked to their ability to assist people to feel 'safe and understood', thereby helping to overcome their sense of alienation, resistance to assistance and behavioural change. Conversely, confrontational consultation styles can result in more resistance from clients.

### Evaluating the impact of healthcare interventions using routine data [^9eef0fdf]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Are there any additional considerations?

It is essential to consider threats to validity when designing and evaluating an impact evaluation; validity relates to whether an evaluation is measuring what it is claiming to measure. See Rothman et alfor further discussion.

Internal validity refers to whether the effects observed are due to the intervention and not some other confounding factor. Selection bias, which results from the way in which subjects are recruited, or from differing rates of participation due, for example, to age, gender, cultural or socioeconomic factors, is often a problem in non-randomised designs. Care must be taken to account for such biases when interpreting the results of an impact evaluation. Sensitivity analyses should be performed to provide reassurance regarding the plausibility of causal inferences.

External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised to other settings. Understanding the societal, economic, health system, and environmental context in which an intervention is delivered, and which makes its impact unique, is critical when interpreting the results of evaluations, and considering whether they apply to your setting. Descriptions of context should be as rich as possible.

Often, the impact of an intervention is likely to vary depending on the characteristics of patients. These can be usefully explored in subgroup analyses.

Clear and transparent reporting using established guidelines (eg, STROBEor TREND)to describe the intervention, study population, assignment of treatment, and control groups, and methods used to estimate impact should be followed. Limitations arising as a result of inherent biases, or validity, should be clearly acknowledged.

Around the world, many interventions designed to improve health and healthcare are under way. An evaluation is an essential part of understanding what impact these changes are having, for whom and in what circumstances, and help inform future decisions about improvement and further roll out. There is no standard, "one size fits all" recipe for a good evaluation: it must be tailored to the project at hand. Understanding the overarching principles and standards is the first step towards a good evaluation.

### Quality of perinatal care services from the user's perspective: a Dutch study applies the World Health Organization's responsiveness concept [^fcce515d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of responsiveness was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) to address non-clinical aspects of service quality in an internationally comparable way. Responsiveness is defined as aspects of the way individuals are treated and the environment in which they are treated during health system interactions.

The aim of this study is to assess responsiveness outcomes, their importance and factors influencing responsiveness outcomes during the antenatal and delivery phases of perinatal care.

Method

The Responsiveness in Perinatal and Obstetric Health Care Questionnaire was developed in 2009/10 based on the eight-domain WHO concept and the World Health Survey questionnaire. After ethical approval, a total of 171 women, who were 2 weeks postpartum, were recruited from three primary care midwifery practices in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, using face-to-face interviews. We dichotomized the original five ordinal response categories for responsiveness attainment as 'poor' and good responsiveness and analyzed the ranking of the domain performance and importance according to frequency scores. We used a series of independent variables related to health services and users' personal background characteristics in multiple logistic regression analyses to explain responsiveness.

Results

Poor responsiveness outcomes ranged from 5.9% to 31.7% for the antenatal phase and from 9.7% to 27.1% for the delivery phase. Overall for both phases, 'respect for persons' (Autonomy, Dignity, Communication and Confidentiality) domains performed better and were judged to be more important than 'client orientation' domains (Choice and Continuity, Prompt Attention, Quality of Basic Amenities, Social Consideration). On the whole, responsiveness was explained more by health-care and health related issues than personal characteristics.

Conclusion

To improve responsiveness outcomes caregivers should focus on domains in the category 'client orientation'.

### Recommending 24-hour attendant care: a qualitative study exploring the clinical decision-making process of occupational therapists in Ontario, Canada [^7dfeed0a]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Before meeting with the participants, basic demographic information was collected for each individual, including their registration number (a unique identifier provided by the relevant provincial college), to verify their occupational therapy registration. This information was gathered through a survey created in REDCap, with a link sent to each participant. The survey asked participants about key details related to their work as occupational therapists (e.g. years of practice, the number of attendant care decisions they have made). For more information, refer to the REDCap Demographic Survey Questions within the Supplementary Materials.

A pre-established interview guide was created by the entire research term used to direct each interview (refer to Interview Questions within the Supplementary Materials). Participants did not receive the interview guide before the interview. Not providing participants with the interview guide beforehand is a deliberate approach to ensure that their responses are spontaneous and reflect their authentic thoughts, rather than being influenced by prior reflection on the questions. This method helps to capture more genuine and unbiased data, as it reduces the risk of participants tailoring their answers based on preconceived ideas about the topics. Participants were included in a single interview. The interview questions were created using the Person-Environment-Occupation model. They focused on three key areas: (1) psychosocial factors in decision-making, (2) decisions regarding 24-hour supervision on occupational injuries (e.g. orthopedic, neurological) and environmental limitations, and (3) litigation considerations. Psychosocial factors in decision-making relate to individualized assessments by considering how personal circumstances and mental health impact choices, ensuring decisions are tailored to the person's needs. Decisions regarding 24-hour supervision and environmental limitations connect to evidence-based decision-making by emphasizing the need to evaluate work environments, accessibility, and support systems when determining the best course of action. Litigation considerations are linked to risk assessment in decision-making, as legal factors and potential consequences influence how risks are evaluated in the context of returning to work or ongoing disability.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^6b05f10c]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Assessment and intervention with persons with disabilities — concluding statements describe that the Guidelines for Assessment and Intervention with Persons with Disabilities are recommendations that psychologists are encouraged to implement to strengthen their professional knowledge and skills in advancing the health and well-being of disabled individuals. Psychologists are uniquely positioned to work with individuals with disabilities and other stakeholders to facilitate disabled individuals' health and well-being and to promote their full inclusion, and may enhance their professional skills and ensure validity, fairness, and appropriateness of assessments and interventions by critically evaluating their own possible biases and stereotypes about disability. Psychologists strive to recognize that the disability experience is multifaceted and may be affected by different intersections and sociocultural contexts, and strive to recognize that not all clients seek clinical services based on disability-related issues, and can help individuals discover and balance personal strengths and challenges. Psychologists strive to promote equal access and opportunity for persons with disabilities by using all appropriate accommodations and by guarding against construct irrelevant factors affecting valid, fair assessments and interventions, may actively pursue disability-related training, education, and consultation to maintain and strengthen their skills and knowledge to serve their clients competently and ethically, and have the opportunity to be effective advocates for change that removes individual and systemic barriers and contributes to a more inclusive society.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of cockroaches: a practice parameter [^6534c2ff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Classification of recommendations and evidence — recommendation rating scale defines Strong recommendation (StrRec), Recommendation (Rec), Option (Opt), and No recommendation (NoRec) with corresponding implications. Strong recommendation (StrRec): A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a strong negative recommendation) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (grade A or B).* In some clearly identified circumstances, strong recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec): A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (grade B or C).* In some clearly identified circumstances, recommendations might be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms. Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt): An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (grade D)* or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C)* show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they might set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec): No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D)* and an unclear balance between benefits and harms. Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision-making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Ethical issues in artificial nutrition and hydration: a review [^9a6d446a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Healthcare professionals often face clinical and ethical challenges when charged with making decisions related to provision or lack of provision of artificial nutrition and hydration. The intent of this review is to supply a framework of clinical practices, ethical principles, legal precedents, and professional guidelines that will impart information and can assist decision making regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. Comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of informed consent for competent adults, decisionally incompetent adults, and minors is necessary for making valid clinical judgments and for guiding patients and their families or surrogates in choosing options related to initiating, withholding, or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration. The framework offered in this review can serve as a basis for evaluation of appropriateness of artificial nutrition and hydration in 3 common conditions in which decision making is particularly challenging: terminal illness, advanced dementia, and a persistent vegetative state. The framework facilitates guidance for institutional policy makers and individual nutrition support professionals dealing with situations in which personal values often create ethical dilemmas related to artificial nutrition and hydration and its utility.

### Restraint use in home care: a qualitative study from a nursing perspective [^a89829da]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The use of restraints has a large impact on patients (e.g. physical and psychological consequences); family (e.g. anger, worry); and healthcare workers (e.g. mixed emotions such as anger, reassurance). Furthermore, the decision process to use restraints lies along a complex trajectory that depends on patient characteristics and on the attitude of nurses (e.g. nurses' perception of patient behavior, their willingness to take risks, or their own comfort). It also depends on context-related factors such as family involvement, which can have a positive or negative impact on nurses' decision making; insufficient time to discuss restraint use with other staff members like physicians; lack of staff; and the requirement of balancing safety, and ethical and legal aspects.

Current understanding about restraint use derives mostly from acute and long-term residential settings. Knowledge about restraint use obtained from residential settings does not easily generalize to the home-care setting, because of the uniqueness of the home-care setting. Moreover, it is unclear how the little research that has been done in home-care settings relates to that done in long-term residential care settings. In the home-care setting, healthcare professionals work in the patient's personal living environment rather than in a healthcare facility, where they have more control over decisions. Moreover, they see their patients for short visits; thus, they have no opportunity to continuously supervise restrained persons. Also, home-care nurses typically work alone, often leaving them in an unsupported professional position when confronted with decisions about restraints. Patients' relatives also play a crucial role and may even take the lead in the decision-making process. These factors emphasize the need for research on restraint use in home-care settings.

Because of their pivotal role in home care and their intensive interactions with family and other healthcare workers, home-care nurses are in an excellent position to provide relevant information about the use of restraints in home care. The aim of this study was to gain initial insights into the use of restraints in home care in Flanders, Belgium, from the perspective of home nurses. The overarching research question was, "What are nurses' experiences about restraint use in Flemish home care?"

### What do we know about strategies to manage dementia-related wandering? A scoping review [^0ede277d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Three of five persons with dementia will wander, raising concern as to how it can be managed effectively. Wander-management strategies comprise a range of interventions for different environments. Although technological interventions may help in the management of wandering, no review has exhaustively searched what types of high- and low-technological solutions are being used to reduce the risks of wandering. In this article, we perform a review of gray and scholarly literature that examines the range and extent of high- and low-tech strategies used to manage wandering behavior in persons with dementia. We conclude that although effectiveness of 49 interventions and usability of 13 interventions were clinically tested, most were evaluated in institutional or laboratory settings, few addressed ethical issues, and the overall level of scientific evidence from these outcomes was low. Based on this review, we provide guidelines and recommendations for future research in this field.

### Preferences of newly qualified healthcare professionals for working with people with dementia: a qualitative study [^af95a1cd]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

there is little research on preferences in students and newly qualified healthcare professionals for working with people with dementia. Understanding the development of these preferences can help inform strategies to increase workforce capacity in response to current suboptimal dementia care and the increasing numbers of people with dementia.

Objective

to explore the factors that influence career preferences in relation to working with people with dementia. Specifically, to understand how these factors relate to early career doctors' and nurses' preferences and how they influence decisions and perspectives on their careers.

Methods

qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 newly qualified doctors and nurses within 2 years of graduation. This included a subset of participants that had taken part in a dementia educational intervention during their undergraduate training. Transcripts were analysed using grounded theory methods.

Results

the results present six main categories representing complex interlinked factors influencing preferences for working with people with dementia as well as exploring the definition of a career working with people with dementia. The factors include the importance of making a difference; seeing dementia care as a different type of care; its perceived alignment with personal characteristics; perceptions of people with dementia; care environments and career characteristics.

Discussion

this is the first study to explore the factors influencing preferences for working with people with dementia in newly qualified healthcare professionals. It provides useful data to inform workforce planning, and curriculum and practice development to stimulate interest and drive improved quality of care.

### Understanding clinical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional worldwide survey [^55423ec4]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This research reflects the choice of therapy during an unprecedented pandemic, in which evidence about the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies has been scarce. We found that several factors including self-perceived expertise, quality of COVID-19 publications as determined by the physician, clinical specialty, gender, geographic origin, and involvement in medical research influenced the decision-making process. We found that the heterogeneity of therapeutic decisions increased as the clinical scenario worsened, indicating that the clinical severity attenuated the physician's tolerance for uncertainty and affected the decision-making process.

Management for SARS-CoV-2 has widely been supportive, and during the first weeks of the pandemic, no specific therapy had been scientifically proven to reduce mortality (Fig. 1). In many countries, physicians who were caring for patients with COVID-19 have faced an unprecedented health emergency with overwhelmed healthcare systems that were confronted with a new and often life-threatening disease. Most physicians who were involved in the management of patients with COVID-19 have witnessed passionate debates that were polarized between a clear disposition to try new therapeutic options based on anecdotical reports or personal experiences and a more cautious approach to at least avoid harm in the absence of efficacy data. The factors that we identified as predictors of a more conservative approach suggest an association with a greater sensitivity to a rational and evidence-based decision-making process (i.e. more criticism of the published literature, more involvement as leading authors on PubMed-indexed articles). We also found an effect of the region of residence, especially for physicians working in Europe compared with the US, with the former being more conservative in their decisions. The European countries that contributed most to the survey (Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom) were those that were more strongly affected by SARS-CoV-2 when this survey was conducted. We think that these geographic differences indicate a more paternalist pattern of decision-making in Europe compared to the US and possibly a greater constraint to prescribe off-label medications in the US that is motivated by a greater fear of medical malpractice litigation. Additionally, our data suggest different clinical management among infectious disease physicians compared to other specialists. To date, we have no data demonstrating the association between infectious disease physician care and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. This more conservative approach among infectious disease physicians could be explained by the greater acceptance of uncertainty with a new infectious disease, but also by awareness of the potential deleterious consequences of off-label medications that were used in past infectious diseases, as observed with ribavirin in the last SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003.

### Shared decision-making with athletes: a survey study of healthcare professionals' perspectives [^920b4399]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Factors influencing SDM (open questions; objective 3)

We asked healthcare professionals why they practise SDM. The most common themes were better patient engagement (24/73, 32.9%), better patient outcomes (20/73, 27.4%), better patient compliance (17/73, 23.3%), patient empowerment (16/73, 21.9%), improved patient knowledge (15/73, 20.5%), ethical reasons (12/73, 16.4%), achieving realistic patient expectations (6/73, 8.2%) and improved clinician–patient relationship (6/73, 8.2%). For example, one participant emphasised:

I am aware that buy-in and compliance are significantly improved with well-educated patients who can take some control. I dislike creating athlete-dependency. (Physiotherapist, 22 years in practice, trained in the United Kingdom)

Healthcare professionals named several factors that positively and negatively impact SDM.

The factors said to impact SDM positively were patient motivation (18/74, 24.3%), patient knowledge (12/74, 16.2%), enough time (9/74, 12.2%), a good clinician–athlete relation (9/74, 12.2%), clinician knowledge and experience (8/74, 10.8%), good clinician–athlete communication (6/74, 8.1%) and multidisciplinary collaboration (5/74, 6.8%). The following quote illustrates the importance of those factors on the side of the organisation and professionals, as well as specific patient factors:

Everyone in the healthcare team is on board with shared decision-making. The patient has higher levels of health literacy and self-efficacy. Having a good therapeutic alliance with the patient. (Physiotherapist, 13 years in practice, trained in Australia)

### Self-perceived responsibility of HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men for preventing HIV transmission [^55b6ab28]. AIDS and Behavior (2003). Low credibility.

Relatively little attention has been paid to unique factors that may motivate HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men (MSM) to prevent HIV transmission. This study examines the beliefs of 250 HIV-seropositive MSM about their responsibility for protecting sex partners from HIV infection. Participants completed an open-ended interview about their sexual practices, substance use, and other HIV-related issues. Seventy percent of participants were men of color. Most participants (72%) spontaneously mentioned issues related to responsibility that were represented by three themes: (1) personal responsibility for protecting sex partners, (2) partners' responsibility for protecting themselves, and (3) mutual responsibility. These beliefs were expressed by 63%, 24%, and 12% of respondents, respectively. Motivations underlying beliefs about personal responsibility included altruism, self-standards, and self-interest. Beliefs about personal responsibility were influenced by participant characteristics, partner characteristics, disclosure of HIV status, and contextual factors. The findings suggest that self-perceived responsibility may be an important factor that affects HIV-seropositive MSM's sexual decision making.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^c9f338fc]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Appropriate use criteria and clinical practice guidelines — clinicians should objectively apply appropriate use criteria (AUC) and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the evidence-based care of individual patients while avoiding potential conflicts of interest (COIs) in their development and in their application in value-based models of care; tools such as AUC and CPGs can objectively help clinical decision making but are derived from populations and must be applied carefully in unique individual patients; development of these tools must be done with full disclosure of any personal or professional COIs, and AUC, CPGs, and clinical decision support mechanisms should not be used to withhold testing or treatment solely to reduce cost within value-based models of care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6e161f04]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — patient-level controller choice indicates that treatment choices for individual patients also take into account any patient characteristics or phenotype, or any environmental exposures, that may predict their risk of exacerbations or other adverse outcomes, together with assessment of multimorbidity, the patient's goals and preferences, and practical issues such as cost, ability to use the medication and adherence. Choosing between controller options for individual patients uses shared decision-making with the patient or parent/caregiver to discuss preferred treatment (as above) based on evidence for symptom control and risk reduction; patient characteristics or phenotype, including features that predict differences in future risk or treatment response (e.g., smoker; history of exacerbations, blood eosinophilia or high FeNO; environmental exposures); whether there are modifiable risk factors or multimorbidity that may affect treatment outcomes; patient views about goals, beliefs and concerns; and practical issues including which inhaler(s) are available to the patient, inhaler technique – can the patient use the inhaler correctly after training, adherence – how often is the patient likely to take the medication, cost to patient – can the patient afford the medication, and which of the available inhalers has the lowest environmental impact.

### Factors influencing uptake of changes to clinical preventive guidelines [^1c80757a]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite widespread recognition that adherence to clinical preventive guidelines improves patient outcomes, clinicians struggle to implement guideline changes in a timely manner. Multiple factors influence guideline adoption and effective implementation. However, few studies evaluate their collective and inter-related effects. This qualitative study provides a comprehensive picture of the interplay between multiple factors on uptake of new or changed preventive guidelines.

Methods

Semistructured interviews conducted in 2018 with a diverse sample of clinicians and practice leaders sought to understand patient, clinician, practice, health system, environment, and guideline factors of influence. An immersion-crystallization approach was used to identify emergent themes.

Results

Interviewees expressed motivation to adhere to guidelines but also valued sharing decisions with patients. Personal biases and fears affected both clinician and patient guideline adoption. Practices facilitated implementation through workflow optimization and encouraging a culture of evidence-based practice while a key health system function was to maintain electronic health record alerts. More traditional environmental factors, such as insurance coverage or transportation, were less of a barrier to guideline adoption and implementation than the influence of media and specialists. Various specific guideline characteristics also affected ease of adoption and implementation. Different settings expressed greater health system, practice, or clinician-centric approaches to guideline implementation.

Conclusions

Guideline uptake is influenced by a complex interplay of multiple levels of factors including the patient, clinician, practice, health system, environment, and guideline levels. Comprehensively understanding all levels of influence for each specific clinical setting may help to determine the optimal intervention(s) for improving uptake of evidence-based guidelines.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^5d025a51]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Disability cultural competence in psychological practice — common biases, workforce representation, and corrective actions — are detailed, noting limited representation and access as follows: "leaving individuals with disabilities overwhelmingly without access to providers who share the lived experience of disability" and "approximately 3% of psychology graduate students and 2% of faculty in APA-accredited programs report having a disability", while cognitive errors include "A psychologist may misattribute a psychological characteristic to having a disability" and the "example of diagnosis overshadowing" wherein "psychologists tend to believe problems… are attributable to their disability as opposed to psychological conditions". Additional pitfalls include that "psychologists may under-emphasize disability-related concerns, or even assume clients use their disabilities as an excuse to avoid specific actions", with countertransference highlighted as "psychologists need to address countertransference issues". The text also cautions that "Psychologists may assume that people with cognitive impairments or intellectual disabilities are unable to speak on their own behalf; therefore, they are incapable of exercising control over their own lives and are incompetent to make their own treatment-related decisions", and that "Lack of familiarity with disability may influence how a psychologist perceives and responds to the client's emotional expression". To address bias and improve care, it specifies: "Two recommended actions psychologists may take to address biases, faulty assumptions, and negative emotional reactions are (1) self-examination and (2) increasing cultural understanding, including learning about disability-related issues", alongside practical steps that explicitly state, "Acknowledge that beliefs, attitudes, and values may be held that differ from the client and may have the potential to be deleterious to rapport building, clinical decision-making, and delivery of clinical services", "Examine preconceptions, beliefs, and emotional reactions toward persons with disabilities", "Consider ableist views that might underpin attitudes and reactions", "The development of attitudes is typically an insidious process", "Consider how disability-related and life experiences, separately or together, may be related to the client's current psychological issues", and "Assess the client's strengths and weaknesses and incorporate them into interventions".

### Strategies for improving vaccine communication and uptake [^9865d7d0]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

World Health Organization vaccine hesitancy matrix — determinants are grouped as contextual influences, individual and group influences, and vaccine or vaccination–specific issues, with examples from each category. Contextual influences include communication and media environment, influential leaders and immunization program gatekeepers with anti- or provaccination lobbies, historical influences, religion, culture, gender, or socioeconomic factors, politics or policies, geographic barriers, and perception of the pharmaceutical industry. Individual and group influences include personal, family, and community members' experience with vaccination (including pain), beliefs and attitudes about health and prevention, health system and providers — trust and personal experience, perceived risk and benefit, and whether immunization is seen as a social norm versus not needed or harmful. Vaccine or vaccination–specific issues include epidemiologic and scientific risk–benefit, mode of administration, vaccination program design and mode of delivery, supply reliability, vaccination schedule, costs, and the strength of the recommendation and/or knowledge base and/or attitude of health care professionals.
