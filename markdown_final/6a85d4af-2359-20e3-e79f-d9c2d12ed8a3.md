## Question

Does Rybelsus have a robust weight loss side effect?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) has a robust weight loss side effect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact formulation and dose of Rybelsus and how that differs from the obesity-approved semaglutide dose. Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled indications. Next, I will review the weight-loss evidence for oral semaglutide at diabetes doses versus the higher-dose obesity regimen. After that, I need to check the magnitude of weight loss in randomized trials and real-world data. Finally, I will synthesize whether the effect is "robust" in the context of obesity treatment and clarify what patients can expect clinically and off-label.

> Let me first confirm the product details. Rybelsus is oral semaglutide approved for type 2 diabetes at 3 mg daily for 30 days, then 7 mg daily, with a maintenance dose of 7 or 14 mg daily depending on glycemic response, which is substantially lower than the 2.4 mg once-weekly subcutaneous dose approved for chronic weight management, so I need to be careful not to conflate these regimens [^116wHY3J] [^113rk5uo].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory status before drawing conclusions. The FDA labeling for Rybelsus is for glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for obesity or chronic weight management, whereas subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (Wegovy) carries that indication, so any weight loss with Rybelsus would be considered a side effect rather than a labeled therapeutic outcome [^116wHY3J] [^112khpZL].

> I will now examine the weight-loss signal at diabetes doses. In the PIONEER program, oral semaglutide 7–14 mg produced modest weight reductions of about 2–5 kg over 26–52 weeks in people with type 2 diabetes, with roughly 13–44% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss at 26 weeks, which is clinically meaningful for diabetes but not comparable to obesity-trial magnitudes [^116aantW] [^114t6i6f]. Hold on, I should double-check the durability; yes, weight loss was maintained in longer extensions, though still modest in absolute terms relative to obesity doses [^117XhUC4].

> Next, I should review real-world data to see if the signal holds outside trials. Observational cohorts of oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes show weight losses typically in the 1–8 kg range over 6–12 months, with about 30–41% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss, reinforcing that the effect is real but modest at diabetes doses and highly variable across patients and settings [^1154UmS8].

> But wait, what if we consider higher-dose oral semaglutide specifically studied for obesity. Let me check that. A recent 71-week randomized trial of oral semaglutide 25 mg in adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes showed a mean weight loss of 13.6% versus 2.2% with placebo, with high proportions achieving ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, and ≥ 20% losses, indicating that oral semaglutide can indeed produce robust weight loss when dosed for obesity, though this 25 mg dose is not the current Rybelsus diabetes dose [^114DdbUM].

> I should confirm how this compares with the subcutaneous obesity regimen. In STEP 1, subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly produced about 14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks versus 2.4% with placebo, with 86% achieving ≥ 5%, 69% achieving ≥ 10%, and 50% achieving ≥ 15% weight loss, establishing the benchmark for "robust" weight loss with semaglutide in obesity [^112Zwtm3] [^117BU1yt]. Hold on, I should verify durability; STEP 5 showed sustained ~15% mean loss at 2 years, confirming maintenance with ongoing therapy [^111QAHRT].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Rybelsus at diabetes doses (7–14 mg daily) produces a modest, clinically relevant weight loss side effect of about 2–5 kg and roughly 13–44% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss in trials, which is not "robust" by obesity-treatment standards. In contrast, higher-dose oral semaglutide (25 mg) and subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg produce robust, obesity-level weight loss of 13–15% or more with high categorical response rates, but these are different products/regimens than standard Rybelsus [^116aantW] [^114DdbUM] [^112Zwtm3].

> I should also consider tolerability and practical use. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are more frequent with higher semaglutide doses and can limit titration, which partly explains why obesity-level oral dosing requires careful escalation and why the diabetes dose is capped at 14 mg; this dose–response trade-off is important when counseling patients about expectations with Rybelsus [^114DdbUM] [^116wHY3J].

> Final answer: No, Rybelsus at its approved diabetes doses does not have a robust weight loss side effect; it produces modest weight loss of about 2–5 kg and a modest proportion achieving ≥ 5% weight loss, whereas robust weight loss with semaglutide requires higher-dose regimens such as 25 mg oral or 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly, which are indicated for obesity and achieve 13–15% or greater mean weight loss in randomized trials [^116aantW] [^114DdbUM] [^112Zwtm3].

Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) produces **modest weight loss** in people with type 2 diabetes, with an average loss of 3–5 kg over 26–52 weeks and about 30–40% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss [^116aantW] [^114t6i6f]. This effect is **smaller than the 12–15% weight loss** seen with the 2.4 mg weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (Wegovy) used for obesity, and is not an approved indication for Rybelsus [^112Zwtm3] [^116wHY3J]. Weight loss with Rybelsus is dose-related and mainly due to reduced appetite and caloric intake; gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are common but usually mild-to-moderate and transient [^111hWRbR] [^112QQ3gT].

---

## Clinical evidence for weight loss with Rybelsus

- **PIONEER program**: In people with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide 7–14 mg daily reduced weight by 3–5 kg over 26–52 weeks, with 30–40% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss [^116aantW] [^114t6i6f].

- **PIONEER 4**: Oral semaglutide 14 mg reduced weight more than liraglutide 1.8 mg (-4.4 kg vs -3.1 kg at 26 weeks; p = 0.0003) [^114XnK78].

- **PIONEER 7**: Flexible dosing of oral semaglutide (3–14 mg) led to greater weight loss than sitagliptin (-2.8 kg vs -0.7 kg at 52 weeks) [^117XhUC4].

- **Real-world data**: Observational studies show 1–8 kg weight loss over 6–12 months, with 30–41% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss [^1154UmS8].

## Comparison with subcutaneous semaglutide (Wegovy)

| **Metric** | **Oral semaglutide (rybelsus)** | **Subcutaneous semaglutide (wegovy)** |
|-|-|-|
| Dose | 7–14 mg daily | 2.4 mg weekly |
| Indication | Type 2 diabetes | Obesity |
| Mean weight loss | 3–5 kg (26–52 weeks) | 12–15% (68 weeks) |
| ≥ 5% weight loss | 30–40% | 86% |
| ≥ 10% weight loss | 10–20% | 69% |
| ≥ 15% weight loss | 5–10% | 50% |

---

Thus, Rybelsus produces **smaller weight loss** than Wegovy and is not approved for obesity management [^116wHY3J].

---

## Mechanism of weight loss

Weight loss with Rybelsus is mediated by **GLP-1 receptor agonism**, which:

- Slows gastric emptying, increasing satiety and reducing intake [^112QLZyx].

- Acts centrally to suppress appetite and food cravings [^112QQ3gT].

- Reduces energy intake by ~20–30% [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and patient selection

Weight loss with Rybelsus is **clinically meaningful** for many with type 2 diabetes, especially those with overweight or obesity, and can improve glycemic control, blood pressure, and lipids [^116aantW] [^114t6i6f]. It is most appropriate for patients with type 2 diabetes who also need weight reduction, but not for those without diabetes or for primary obesity treatment.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common but usually mild-to-moderate and transient [^1114jsJH] [^112M8r5N].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Risk is low when used alone, higher with insulin or sulfonylureas [^notfound].

- **Pancreatitis**: Rare but serious; avoid in patients with prior pancreatitis [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Dose limitation**: Max 14 mg daily; higher doses for obesity are not approved for Rybelsus [^116wHY3J].

- **Gastrointestinal intolerance**: May limit dose titration and adherence [^notfound].

- **Long-term data**: Limited data beyond 2 years; ongoing monitoring is needed [^notfound].

---

Rybelsus produces **modest, clinically meaningful weight loss** in type 2 diabetes, averaging 3–5 kg with 30–40% achieving ≥ 5% loss, and is best viewed as a glycemic therapy with a beneficial weight side effect rather than an obesity treatment.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Semaglutide in the spotlight: weighing benefits against rising concerns [^116rs2mE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

The recent surge in popularity of the antidiabetic drug, Semaglutide, marketed under the names Wegovy (which has the highest concentration of the active drug), Rybelsus, and Ozempic, for its notable efficacy in weight loss has raised pertinent considerations. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that is administered once weekly. It is effective in reducing hemoglobin A1C levels and promoting weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Further studies demonstrated significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors with evidence showing good toleration, although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common.

While it is commendable to find a drug that offers promising results beyond its primary intended purpose, the skyrocketing demand in developed nations necessitates vigilance.

First and foremost, there is potential for off-label abuse. With societal pressure to attain perceived ideal body weights, it is conceivable that individuals may seek this medication outside of its primary indication, potentially exposing themselves to unforeseen risks. Long-term side effects, especially when taken by non-diabetics, are not yet well documented and require continued monitoring.

Furthermore, the surge in demand can invariably drive up costs. This inflation could inadvertently limit access for diabetic patients who genuinely require Semaglutide for glycemic control. Price escalation also means increased out-of-pocket expenses, further burdening the healthcare systems of many developed countries and by extension, stifling the likelihood of patronage and usage in low- and middle-income countries.

It is imperative that endocrinologists and by extension other medical professionals, policymakers, strategic stakeholders, and regulatory bodies remain vigilant. Best still, it is most convenient to note that Semaglutide is a prescription medication and should be used under the guidance of a physician. It is not intended for recreational or non-medical use. Ongoing research, public awareness campaigns about potential risks, a vetting system for usage, and a structured pricing mechanism are vital to ensuring that Semaglutide remains both accessible and safe.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the 3 trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2. Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in participants who took semaglutide than placebo (RR 1:47, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.68); however, the majority of these events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, semaglutide is efficacious for sustained weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111.5 kg, and BMI 39.3 kg/m². Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2.3% for the placebo group versus -6.0% (0.05 mg), -8.6% (0.1 mg), -11.6% (0.2 mg), -11.2% (0.3 mg), and -13.8% (0.4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0.0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0.0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0.2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13.8% to -11.2% vs -7.8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0.1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0.0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg QW

The STEP 1 clinical trial has investigated the benefits of once-weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people who are obese or overweight. In a double-blind trial of 1961 nondiabetic obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight patients (≥ 27 kg/m 2) with coexisting weight-related complications, semaglutide 2.4 mg along with lifestyle modifications led to a 14.9% reduction in body weight as compared with a 2.4% reduction with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of − 12.4 percentage points at 68 weeks. The mean reduction in body weight from baseline to week 68 was − 15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared to − 2.6 kg in the placebo group. 86.4, 69.1, and 50.5% of the patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more, respectively, at the end of 68 weeks. Not only that, patients receiving semaglutide also reported significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors and physical functioning as compared to the placebo arm. Transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events; these were of mild-to-moderate severity that subsided over time. The STEP 2 trial compared semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and semaglutide 1 mg for weight management in a double-blind, double-dummy design in overweight and obese T2DM patients. At the end of 68 weeks, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week demonstrated a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in body weight compared with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of 6.2 percentage points (95% CI − 7.3 to − 5.2; p < 0.0001). A higher number of patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo achieved a weight loss of 5% or more (OR − 4.88, 95% CI 3.58–6.64). Furthermore, semaglutide 2.4 mg has been investigated versus placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and a low-calorie diet for weight management in 611 overweight and obese patients in the STEP 3 trial. Higher proportions of the patients in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more at the end of 68 weeks: 86.6, 75.3, and 55.8%, respectively.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^1118yYW4]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week 104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0) years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg/m² and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 104 was −15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus −2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of −12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, −15.3 to −9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week 104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104 weeks versus placebo.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115FCrCS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%‐17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo) and 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was −15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus −2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was −9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus −3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity‐related diseases.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115aaKv4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^113kagtW]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, semaglutide showed a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in 17,604 adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease, overweight or obesity, without diabetes. Here in this prespecified analysis, we examined effects of semaglutide on weight and anthropometric outcomes, safety and tolerability by baseline body mass index (BMI). In patients treated with semaglutide, weight loss continued over 65weeks and was sustained for up to 4years. At 208weeks, semaglutide was associated with mean reduction in weight (-10.2%), waist circumference (-7.7cm) and waist-to-height ratio (-6.9%) versus placebo (-1.5%, -1.3cm and -1.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons versus placebo). Clinically meaningful weight loss occurred in both sexes and all races, body sizes and regions. Semaglutide was associated with fewer serious adverse events. For each BMI category (< 30, 30 to < 35, 35 to < 40 and ≥ 40 kg/m²) there were lower rates (events per 100years of observation) of serious adverse events with semaglutide (43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo). Semaglutide was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation. Discontinuations increased as BMI class decreased. In SELECT, at 208weeks, semaglutide produced clinically significant weight loss and improvements in anthropometric measurements versus placebo. Weight loss was sustained over 4years.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^116bRTXu]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0)years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg/m² and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104weeks versus placebo.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

RYBELSUS has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, insulins, and thiazolidinediones in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of RYBELSUS was compared with placebo, empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide. RYBELSUS has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, RYBELSUS produced clinically significant reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared with placebo.

The effectiveness of RYBELSUS (formulation R2 - 1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg strengths) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] and RYBELSUS (formulation R1 - 3 mg, 7, mg and 14 mg strengths) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] has been established as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on adequate and well-controlled studies of RYBELSUS (formulation R1) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Below is a display of the efficacy results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of RYBELSUS (formulation R1) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The efficacy of RYBELSUS was not impacted by baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, body weight, duration of diabetes and degree of renal impairment.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

### Proteomic changes upon treatment with semaglutide in individuals with obesity [^116xoYJq]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the randomized Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial (intent to treat: 1,961 adults with overweight or obesity without T2D), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in greater weight loss compared with placebo over a 68-week period (estimated treatment difference −12.4 percentage points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −13.4, −11.5; P < 0.001); half of the participants treated with semaglutide (50.5%) had a weight reduction of ≥ 15% compared with 4.9% assigned to placebo. In the randomized STEP 2 trial (intent to treat: 1,210 adults with overweight or obesity and T2D), the estimated treatment difference from baseline to week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo was −6.2 percentage points (95% CI −7.3, −5.2; P < 0.0001).

In our analysis, we used fasting serum samples collected at baseline and end of treatment in a large subset of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, STEP 1 and STEP 2, to investigate the effects of semaglutide treatment on the circulating proteome. By examining the effects following weight loss and also effects after accounting for weight loss on the proteome throughout the trial in those with and without T2D, and by comparing proteomic profiles with those of observational cohorts, we aimed to comprehensively study the proteomic effects of semaglutide treatment and elucidate the mechanism of action driving its benefits on weight- and obesity-related complications, and to determine its potential for use in new indications.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n = 126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n = 127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

### Semaglutide treatment of hypothalamic obesity-a real-life data study [^111LUBTE]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that many substitution therapies are considered weight dependent, we did not find any specific pattern in dosage changes of the substitution therapy during the observation time reflecting the many different factors affecting the hormone levels in a real-life setting.

The strengths of this study are the relatively large number of participants, the relatively long follow-up time and the real-life setting demonstrating the feasibility of the clinical implementation of the treatment. However, due to the retrospective real-life data design, several limitations also apply. The primary limitation of our study was the absence of a placebo control group. However, we found a much greater weight loss on semaglutide than reported in the before-mentioned RCT investigating exenatide, even without further weight loss support or dietician counselling. Thus, we find it unlikely that the massive weight loss in our patients is solely attributed to a placebo effect or confounding. We did not have systematical data on (changes in) hyperphagia nor the presence of nausea and other side-effects which is an important limitation to the study compared to most RCTs. Only two patients (8%) stopped the treatment due to intolerable side effects which is comparable to previous findings. The median dosage of semaglutide of 1.6 mg in our data was lower than in most weight loss trials, but we do not have evidence of side-effects as the main cause of not achieving the maximum dosage. Furthermore, we did not have measures of the quality of the weight loss regarding changes in waist circumference and/or body composition which are important in terms of metabolic health. Finally, the patient group was rather heterogenous in terms of degree of obesity and duration of the disease, reflecting the real-life setting. We did not have data to assess whether obesity occurred primarily before or after surgery of the patient and/or whether early intervention with semaglutide would have made any difference to the weight loss response. We tried to address this question by adding a co-variate of disease duration before start of semaglutide to the model, but did not find any significant difference. To further address such questions, we believe, there is a need for large (multi-center) RCTs, however, the rarity of HO, make such RCTs difficult and time costly.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

To compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg vs placebo for weight management as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy with initial low-calorie diet in adults with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 68-week, phase 3a study (STEP 3) conducted at 41 sites in the US from August 2018 to April 2020 in adults without diabetes (N = 611) and with either overweight (body mass index ≥ 27) plus at least 1 comorbidity or obesity (body mass index ≥ 30).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (2:1) to semaglutide, 2.4 mg (n = 407) or placebo (n = 204), both combined with a low-calorie diet for the first 8 weeks and intensive behavioral therapy (ie, 30 counseling visits) during 68 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The co-primary end points were percentage change in body weight and the loss of 5% or more of baseline weight by week 68. Confirmatory secondary end points included losses of at least 10% or 15% of baseline weight.

Results

Of 611 randomized participants (495 women [81.0%], mean age 46 years [SD, 13], body weight 105.8 kg [SD, 22.9], and body mass index 38.0 [SD, 6.7]), 567 (92.8%) completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) were receiving treatment at trial end. At week 68, the estimated mean body weight change from baseline was -16.0% for semaglutide vs -5.7% for placebo (difference, -10.3 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -8.6]; P < .001). More participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo lost at least 5% of baseline body weight (86.6% vs 47.6%, respectively; P < .001). A higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide vs placebo group achieved weight losses of at least 10% or 15% (75.3% vs 27.0% and 55.8% vs 13.2%, respectively; P < .001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide (82.8%) vs placebo (63.2%). Treatment was discontinued owing to these events in 3.4% of semaglutide participants vs 0% of placebo participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo, used as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy and initial low-calorie diet, resulted in significantly greater weight loss during 68 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability of these findings.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^111hTJmk]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The overall safety profile did not reveal any new signals from prior studies, and there were no BMI category-related associations with AE reporting. The analysis did reveal that tolerability may differ among specific BMI classes, since more discontinuations occurred with semaglutide among lower BMI classes. Potential contributors may include a possibility of higher drug exposure in lower BMI classes, although other explanations, including differences in motivation and cultural mores regarding body size, cannot be excluded.

Is the weight loss in SELECT less than expected based on prior studies with the drug? In STEP 1, a large phase 3 study of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals without diabetes but with BMI > 30 kg m − 2 or 27 kg m − 2 with at least one obesity-related comorbidity, the mean weight loss was −14.9% at week 68, compared with −2.4% with placebo. Several reasons may explain the observation that the mean treatment difference was −12.5% in STEP 1 and −8.7% in SELECT. First, SELECT was designed as a CV outcomes trial and not a weight-loss trial, and weight loss was only a supportive secondary endpoint in the trial design. Patients in STEP 1 were desirous of weight loss as a reason for study participation and received structured lifestyle intervention (which included a −500 kcal per day diet with 150 min per week of physical activity). In the SELECT trial, patients did not enroll for the specific purpose of weight loss and received standard of care covering management of CV risk factors, including medical treatment and healthy lifestyle counseling, but without a specific focus on weight loss. Second, the respective study populations were quite different, with STEP 1 including a younger, healthier population with more women (73.1% of the semaglutide arm in STEP 1 versus 27.7% in SELECT) and higher mean BMI (37.8 kg m − 2 versus 33.3 kg m − 2, respectively). Third, major differences existed between the respective trial protocols. Patients in the semaglutide treatment arm of STEP 1 were more likely to be exposed to the medication at the full dose of 2.4 mg than those in SELECT. In SELECT, investigators were allowed to slow, decrease or pause treatment. By 104 weeks, approximately 77% of SELECT patients on dose were receiving the target semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly dose, which is lower than the corresponding proportion of patients in STEP 1 (89.6% were receiving the target dose at week 68). Indeed, in our first on-treatment analysis at week 208, weight loss was greater (−11.7% for semaglutide) compared with the in-trial analysis (−10.2% for semaglutide). Taken together, all these issues make less weight loss an expected finding in SELECT, compared with STEP 1.

### Effectiveness of adjuvant semaglutide following bariatric metabolic surgery [^115rRg4A]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a relapsing condition and response to anti-obesity therapies appears to be normally distributed. Therefore, some patients undergoing metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) will demonstrate a partial response to therapy. When prescribing therapies to patients living with obesity (PwO) the median total weight loss (TWL) gives a good indication of the likely utility of prescription for that individual. GLP-1 agonists (GLP1a) offer patients a reasonable prospect of clinically significant weight loss even if they have been previously treated with MBS.

Methods

A retrospective review of prospectively collected data in a single bariatric clinic was performed. Patients with insufficient weight loss at any time point were offered semaglutide therapy with doses titrated depending on response to treatment, tolerability, availability and affordability. Duration of therapy, highest dose tolerated, anthropometric measures and reported side effects were recorded. Reasons for discontinuation were noted where possible; however, discontinuation due to medication unavailability was not reliably captured in the dataset.

Results

The median dose tolerated was 1 mg s/c per week, and 78% tolerated ≤ 1 mg as the maximum achieved dose. The median TWL was 7.5% and side effects were uncommon. Most patients took therapy for > 6 months, but continued therapy > 1 year was uncommon.

Conclusion

Overall 'real-world' utility of semaglutide after MBS may potentially be hampered by supply and cost issues more than issues associated with effectiveness or side effect profile.

### Effectiveness of adjuvant semaglutide following bariatric metabolic surgery [^112BaKig]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The pooled data showed a median reduction in weight of 7.5 kg (4–13) and a median decrease in BMI of 2.8 kg/m 2 (2–5) following semaglutide. This corresponded to a percentage total weight loss (%TWL) of 7.5%. For patients taking 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg doses of semaglutide, the range of %TWL varied between 10 and 14%. Therapy duration and dosing are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. More than half of the cohort continued therapy beyond 6 months (the median duration was 6 months) with only 4 patients extending therapy beyond 12 months. As expected, continued adherence with therapy correlated with a greater degree of weight loss. The greatest difference in weight loss occurred between months 9 and 12; however, this effect plateaued at 12 months (although these results were seen in a smaller cohort). The median maximum dose of semaglutide was 1 mg (0.5, 1.0) and this was achieved in 50% of the cohort (78% of the cohort took doses equal to or less than 1 mg). Despite this, there was no association between the duration of treatment and the dose administered. There was no difference in the maximum achieved dose of semaglutide between primary and revision cases and the weight loss achieved for both groups was not significantly different (p = 0.4). Men took a higher dose of semaglutide compared to women (Fig. 3).

At the maximum achieved dose of semaglutide, 36 patients (22.6%) reported one or more side effects (Fig. 4). As expected, the most common side effects were nausea, change in bowel function and headache.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^115fQHyA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

No retrospective cohort study has assessed the effectiveness of semaglutide at doses used in randomized clinical trials to treat obesity (ie, 1.7 and 2.4 mg).

Objective

To study weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment at doses used in randomized clinical trials for patients with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study, conducted at a referral center for weight management, retrospectively collected data on the use of semaglutide for adults with overweight or obesity between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2022, with a follow-up of up to 6 months. A total of 408 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more were prescribed weekly semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 months or more. Patients with a history of bariatric procedures, taking other antiobesity medications, and with an active malignant neoplasm were excluded.

Exposures

Weekly 1.7-mg or 2.4-mg semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 to 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the percentage of weight loss. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving weight loss of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more after 3 and 6 months and the percentage of weight loss for patients with or without type 2 diabetes after 3 and 6 months.

Results

The study included 175 patients (132 women [75.4%]; mean [SD] age, 49.3 [12.5] years; mean [SD] BMI, 41.3 [9.1]) in the analysis at 3 months and 102 patients at 6 months. The mean (SD) weight loss after 3 months was 6.7 (4.4) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 5.9% (3.7%) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) weight loss after 6 months was 12.3 (6.6) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 10.9% (5.8%) (P < .001 from baseline). Of the 102 patients who were followed up at 6 months, 89 (87.3%) achieved weight loss of 5% or more, 56 (54.9%) achieved weight loss of 10% or more, 24 (23.5%) achieved weight loss of 15% or more, and 8 (7.8%) achieved weight loss of 20% or more. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a lower mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 3 and 6 months compared with those without type 2 diabetes: 3.9% (3.1%) vs 6.3% (3.7%) at 3 months (P = 0.001) and 7.2% (6.3%) vs 11.8% (5.3%) at 6 months (P = 0.005).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that weekly 1.7-mg and 2.4-mg doses of semaglutide were associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials. Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to evaluate prolonged weight loss outcomes.

### Cagrilintide-semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes [^1179kSRV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cagrilintide and semaglutide have each been shown to induce weight loss as monotherapies. Data are needed on the coadministration of cagrilintide and semaglutide (called CagriSema) for weight management in adults with type 2 diabetes, including those in a subgroup who are undergoing continuous glucose monitoring.

Methods

In this phase 3a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 12 countries, we assigned adults with a body-mass index of 27 or more, a glycated hemoglobin level of 7 to 10%, and type 2 diabetes in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (2.4 mg each) or placebo, along with lifestyle intervention, for 68 weeks. The two primary end points were the percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients with a weight reduction of at least 5%. Additional end points were changes in glycemic measures and safety assessments. Effect estimates were calculated with the use of the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle).

Results

A total of 1206 patients underwent randomization to either the cagrilintide-semaglutide group (904 patients) or the placebo group (302 patients). The estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -13.7% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and -3.4% in the placebo group (estimated difference, -10.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to -9.5; P < 0.001). More patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group than in the placebo group had a weight reduction of 5% or more (P < 0.001); the same was true of reductions of at least 10%, 15%, and 20% (P < 0.001 for the last comparison). The percentage of patients who had a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or less was 73.5% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 15.9% in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 72.5% of the patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 34.4% in the placebo group, most of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg each) resulted in a significantly lower body weight than placebo in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05394519.).

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^1152fu5J]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight/obesity is well established, with more than 90% of people with T2D being overweight. Individuals with T2D and overweight/obesity are at increased risk of developing T2D complications compared with people who are not overweight/obese. Body weight (BW) reductions of ≥ 5% improve glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.BW control is an important component of an individualized, multifactorial approach to T2D management, as recommended in current treatment guidelines.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended as second-line therapy (add-on to metformin) where minimizing weight gain, promoting weight loss or when hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk reduction are considerations. All available GLP-1RAs (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide) have demonstrated weight loss in people with T2D. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark) is a GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D as once-weekly (OW) subcutaneousand once-daily oral formulations. The efficacy and safety of OW semaglutide have been established in the global phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trial program, encompassing subjects from across the continuum of T2D care. In addition to significantly greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), semaglutide demonstrated superior reductions in BW versus all comparators across all SUSTAIN trials.

The SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials compared semaglutide with the GLP-1RAs OW exenatide extended release (exenatide ER), OW dulaglutide and once-daily liraglutide, respectively. In these trials, mean BW loss was significantly greater with semaglutide versus comparators at end of treatment (EOT: weeks 56, 40 and 30 for SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10, respectively): SUSTAIN 3: –5.6 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs exenatide ER 2.0 mg; SUSTAIN 7: –4.6 kg vs –2.3 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg and –6.5 kg vs –3.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg; SUSTAIN 10: –5.8 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; all p < 0.0001.

### Incretin-based therapies for the treatment of obesity-related diseases [^113ufQQo]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

The development program of semaglutide 2.4 mg, STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity), consistently suggested an even greater BW lowering efficacy compared to SCALE. The double-blind multicenter phase 3 trials STEP 1, 3, 4, 5 were conducted in adults (mean age 46.2–47.3 years), mostly females, with obesity or overweight with ≥ 1 weight-related complication (mean BMI 37.8–38.4 kg/m 2) and aimed to demonstrate the superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg over placebo in BW lowering at 68 or 104weeks as an adjunct to diet and physical activity. Of note, in STEP 3 intensive behavioral treatment was also administered in both arms, and in STEP 4 all patients were initially assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg but were randomized 2:1 to semaglutide 2.4 or placebo after 20 weeks. In STEP 1 and STEP 3, patients on semaglutide lost 14.8–16.0% BW compared to 2.4–5.7% in the placebo group at 68 weeks. STEP 5 yielded very similar results (−15.2% vs. −2.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, respectively) at 104 weeks. In STEP 4, all participants lost on average 10.6% BW at 20 weeks; those continuing on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved a 7.9% BW reduction at study end, while patients on placebo exhibited a BW gain of 6.9%. The efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg was also assessed in patients aged 12–17 years with a BMI > 95 th percentile or a BMI > 85 th percentile with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity in the STEP TEENS trial, producing similar results (−14.7 vs 2.7% weight change with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs placebo, respectively). Moreover, a post-hoc analysis of the STEP 1 trial confirmed the consistency of the semaglutide 2.4 mg weight-lowering potential regardless of baseline BMI < 35 kg/m 2 and comorbidities.

### Coadministered cagrilintide and semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^1134QoPH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg has established weight-loss and cardiovascular benefits, and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg has shown promising results in early-phase trials; the efficacy of the combination (known as CagriSema) on weight loss in persons with either overweight and coexisting conditions or obesity is unknown.

Methods

In a phase 3a, 68-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 21:3:3:7 to receive the combination of semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg, semaglutide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, cagrilintide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions for all groups. The coprimary end points were the relative change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight from baseline to week 68 with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with placebo. Body-weight reductions of 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more were assessed as confirmatory secondary end points. Effect estimates were assessed with the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle). Safety was assessed.

Results

A total of 3417 participants underwent randomization, with 2108 assigned to receive cagrilintide-semaglutide, 302 to receive semaglutide, 302 to receive cagrilintide, and 705 to receive placebo. The estimated mean percent change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -20.4% with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with -3.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -17.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -18.1 to -16.6; P < 0.001). Participants receiving cagrilintide-semaglutide were more likely than those receiving placebo to reach weight-loss targets of 5% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Gastrointestinal adverse events (affecting 79.6% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 39.9% in the placebo group), including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, were mainly transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Cagrilintide-semaglutide provided significant and clinically relevant body-weight reductions in adults with overweight or obesity, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05567796.).

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^111QAHRT]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114UrjaB]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

Introduction

Burden of obesity

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, progressive disease (1) with a multifactorial origin, including genetic, metabolic, behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental factors (2, 3). The clinical complications of obesity include cardiovascular diseases (CVD; e.g. ischemic heart disease, heart failure), metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes [T2D]), mechanical dysfunction (musculoskeletal disorders [e.g. osteoarthritis]), sleep apnea, and malignancy (4, 5, 6, 7). Around 13% to 19.5% of adults globally have obesity, and the prevalence of obesity is predicted to continue to rise (5, 8). There is a recognition that much of the pathophysiology of obesity involves abnormal satiety and feeding signaling within the brain (9). The hypothalamus, mesolimbic system, and executive functioning are all implicated in the physiology of obesity (9). Thus, there is a necessity for developing more effective novel treatment approaches that address these central nervous system processes (2, 9, 10).

Treatment of obesity

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of weight management (WM) (11), but alone they are generally associated with moderate weight loss (WL) that is gradually regained (9, 12, 13). Maintaining WL is inherently difficult because of counter‐regulatory neuroendocrine pathways that promote weight regain by influencing hunger and satiety, which are a component of appetite, and potentially by decreasing energy expenditure (14, 15). Antiobesity medications (AOMs) may provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle interventions, which typically have a limited effect on WL, to help people achieve and maintain healthy behaviors that are consistent with sustaining WL.

The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have approved AOMs that have been shown to achieve clinically significant WL when used as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions (2, 16). However, most approved AOMs have moderate efficacy, quantified as a < 10% reduction in mean WL over that achieved with lifestyle intervention alone, with significant limitations related to adverse effects, cost, or restrictions on use (2). There is a need for additional AOMs that can induce and sustain greater clinically meaningful WL and that have a convenient form of administration that improves associated complications, such as T2D and CVD. One potential new AOM is the glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) analogue semaglutide, which has been developed with these characteristic features in mind (11, 17).

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7.2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m² or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg, 2.4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2.4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7.2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73.7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113.0 (24.1) kg, and mean BMI was 39.9 (7.1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg (-18.7% [SE 0.4] vs -15.6% [0.7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3.1% [95% CI -4.7 to -1.6]; p < 0.0001) and with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (-18.7% [0.4] vs -3.9% [0.6]; -14.8% [-16.2 to -13.4]; p < 0.0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7.2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12.1 [95% CI 8.3 to 17.6]; p < 0.0001), 10% or greater (14.5 [9.6 to 21.9]; p < 0.0001), 15% or greater (20.3 [11.2 to 36.8]; p < 0.0001), 20% or greater (27.3 [10.9 to 68.0]; p < 0.0001), and 25% or greater (127.4 [36.8 to 441.4]; p < 0.0001); and more likely than those in the 2.4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]; p = 0.0006) and 25% or greater (2.4 [1.6 to 3.5]; p < 0.0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11.7 cm [95% CI -13.0 to -10.4]; p < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7.2 mg (711 [70.8%] of 1004) versus 2.4 mg (123 [61.2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42.8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22.9%], 12 [6.0%], and one [0.5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6.8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7.2 mg, 22 (10.9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 11 (5.5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7.2 mg was superior to placebo and 2.4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^112zMLnF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg for 2 years resulted in substantial and sustained changes in body weight versus placebo in STEP 5 (−15.2% vs. −2.6%), demonstrating encouraging long‐term maintenance of weight loss.

The mean weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes in STEP 2 was less than that observed in STEP 1 (which employed a similar study design but with a population of adults with obesity, and without type 2 diabetes). It is well known that weight reductions in people with type 2 diabetes are often less than in people without diabetes, although the full reasons for this remain unknown. In STEP 2, semaglutide 2.4 mg provided only a small numerical improvement over 1.0 mg in glycaemic parameters (HbA 1c levels and targets, fasting plasma glucose, and reduction in use of concomitant oral glucose‐lowering mediations). However, the benefit of the higher dose is seen in the context of greater weight loss.

STEP 3 assessed the impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with intensive behavioural therapy and an initial low‐calorie meal‐replacement diet, reporting mean weight loss of 16.0% (vs. 5.7% in the placebo group). However, in the other STEP trials, a less intensive lifestyle intervention programme was used, and similar levels of weight loss were achieved, suggesting that an intensive approach may not contribute significant additional weight loss. Rather, the results show the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in those with overweight or obesity, probably through its ability to control appetite, energy intake and food cravings.

The STEP 6 results indicate that semaglutide 2.4 mg is an effective weight management option also in people from east Asia with obesity, and further illustrates a semaglutide‐induced reduction in visceral fat, which are known to be a strong predictor of weight‐related comorbidities, particularly in people from east Asia.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^1134d9Jy]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long‐term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%‐81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m² and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long‐term follow‐up.

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of real-world evidence [^1154UmS8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Oral semaglutide has undergone global Phase 3 development programs named PIONEER and approved for therapeutic use in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aim to systematically review the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in real-world settings.

Methods

We systematically searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 15, 2024, using several keywords with Boolean "AND". We retrieved all the available granular details of real-world studies (RWS).

Results

To date, results from four prospective and ten retrospective real-world studies of oral semaglutide in T2D are available. In prospective studies, the primary outcome of HbA1c reduction varied from -0.9% to -1.6%, weight loss varied from -4.7 kg to -8.2 kg and HbA1c target of < 7% was achieved in 30%-64% with oral semaglutide. In retrospective studies, HbA1c reduction varied from -0.4% to -1.8%, weight reduction varied from -1.4 to -9.0 kg, HbA1c target of < 7% was achieved in 32–64%, and 30–41% of people with T2D had ≥ 5% weight loss with oral semaglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events with oral semaglutide varied from 16% to 50% in prospective and 6%-47% in retrospective RWS. Overall, 0%-18% of patients had oral semaglutide discontinuation due to any cause.

Conclusion

Oral semaglutide exhibited a reasonable reduction in HbA1c and weight in people with T2D, consistent with the findings from PIONEER trials. While no new safety issues emerged, the inherent limitations of RWS underscore the necessity of long-term investigations to comprehensively assess safety.

### Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence [^1129GeoM]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Weight loss trials

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) studies had no upper limit in age. STEP-1 took 1961 adults with a BMI ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 in people with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) without T2D and demonstrated mean weight reduction of 14.8% in participants taking semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (vs. 2.4% in the placebo group), as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 86.4% (vs. 31.5%) of patients achieved weight loss ≥ 5%, 69.1% (vs. 12%) achieved weight loss ≥ 10% and 50.5% (vs. 4.9%) achieved weight loss ≥ 15%. Results were reduced in those with T2D, but still significant (STEP-2). Further STEP trials have demonstrated mean weight reduction of 16% (vs. 5.7%) when semaglutide was used as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy (STEP-3), and improved head-to-head weight reduction compared to liraglutide over 68 weeks, with possible benefits in older adults given the once weekly administration of semaglutide (STEP-8). STEP-4 gave every participant a 20-week course of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, and produced a mean weight loss of 10.6%, before randomisation to either continued semaglutide treatment or exchange to placebo for an additional 48 weeks. Continuation of semaglutide resulted in a further 7.9% reduction in body weight from their week 20 weight, whereas the placebo group regained 6.9%. However, STEP 1 extension concluded that 1-year withdrawal of semaglutide results in regain of two-thirds of prior weight loss, highlighting that withdrawal of semaglutide results in weight regain which may be problematic in older adults who are already using polypharmacy approaches for comorbid disease. Consideration of a cyclical delivery of semaglutide, and other AOMs, could be considered, where semaglutide is administered until a pre-determined body weight is achieved, at which point an interval period is commenced until a pre-determined percentage of weight is regained, before restarting treatment. In addition to being polypharmacologically beneficial, this method would appeal to organisations funding healthcare in the licensing of AOMs. More evidence is needed to clarify the ideal duration that an AOM should be given initially before the first interval, but longer compliance with anti-obesity agents from the outset does result in reduced weight regain following cessation. If this method was to be implemented, it would be imperative to remember the evidence to date suggests benefit only with chronic prescription of respective AOM, both in relation to weight and cardiometabolic disease.

STEP 8 — weekly subcutaneous semaglutide versus daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes — compared semaglutide 2.4 mg administered SQ once weekly with liraglutide 3.0 mg administered SQ once daily over a 68-week trial, showing mean weight reduction of 15.8% with semaglutide versus 6.4% with liraglutide (difference from semaglutide = 9.4%), gastrointestinal adverse events in 84.1% versus 82.7%, and concluding that semaglutide resulted in significantly greater weight reduction at 68 weeks when added to diet and physical activity counseling.

3.3 Preliminary Evidence With Semaglutide in T1D: Effect on Body Weight and Glycaemic Control

Real‐world data from a retrospective study conducted on long‐lasting T1D individuals, mean age of 44 years, and weight excess found that Semaglutide, compared to no adjunctive treatment, improved glucose control and reduced body weight by around 7 kg in 12 months. Other authors confirmed the effectiveness of Semaglutide (0.25–2 mg) in inducing and maintaining significant weight loss (−5% compared to baseline) up to 9 months of treatment, but they reported uncertain glycaemic effects.

Better results came from a double‐blind, randomized, crossover trial in which T1D patients with weight excess (obese, 63%) were treated with Semaglutide up to 1 mg (or the maximum tolerated dose) and followed up to 12 weeks, comprising 2 months of titration in add‐on to a background insulin pump and 4 weeks of full‐dose Semaglutide plus an automated insulin delivery system to reduce biases. Overall, all participants showed a significant body weight reduction by 5% compared to baseline and a slight but significant amelioration of glucose control. The authors reported a correlation between weight loss and improvements in time in range and HbA 1c levels, even if patients with baseline undetectable rather than detectable c‐peptide levels lost weight equally (around 6.5 kg) despite slightly but suggestive worse glycaemic results.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^117Uf9Da]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Behavioral intervention incorporating modifications in diet and physical activity remains the foundation of treatment for overweight and obesity. However, because behavioral intervention is often not associated with clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss, pharmacotherapy is recommended as an additional tool for long-term weight management in people with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m², or at least 27 kg/m² in those with weight-related comorbidities.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (oral semaglutide and subcutaneous semaglutide) and for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (subcutaneous semaglutide only) –. At a dose of 2.4 mg once-weekly, subcutaneous semaglutide was approved in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada for weight management in adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg m –2 with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m –2) –, based on results from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) clinical trial program. In the STEP 1 and 3 trials in participants without type 2 diabetes, average placebo-subtracted weight losses of 12.4% and 10.3%, respectively, were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 (refs.).

Previous studies in the STEP trial program have been limited to treatment durations of up to 68 weeks –. The 2-year STEP 5 study reported herein was conducted to evaluate the long-term effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo, as an adjunct to behavioral intervention, on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m –2), or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg m –2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes (Extended Data Fig. 1). This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial represents the longest study of the use of semaglutide for weight management to date. Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 104 and achievement of weight loss of at least 5% of baseline weight at week 104.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^116w5Qwp]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The availability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analog, represents a paradigm shift in the management of obesity, a chronic, progressive, and relapsing disease. Newer‐generation nutrient‐stimulated, hormone‐based therapeutics are more effective for weight loss than previously approved medications, provide weight‐dependent and other pleotropic cardiometabolic effects, and are delivered as convenient weekly formulations. The phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) program evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for weight management in people with obesity or overweight.

Once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg was approved for chronic weight management by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022. In addition to improvements in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, a dedicated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (CVOT) was conducted to evaluate CV safety, as requested by the FDA and EMA for antiobesity medications (AOMs). In the Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) study, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced major adverse CV events (MACE) by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001) versus placebo in 17,604 patients with overweight and obesity and preexisting CV disease (CVD) without diabetes. The FDA recently approved a label expansion including this indication.

The effects of semaglutide on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk in a high‐risk population must be weighed against its safety profile. The safety profile is evaluated based on prospectively collected clinical trial data and continuous post‐marketing reporting. As the longest and largest placebo‐controlled study to date systematically evaluating semaglutide, SELECT significantly builds on data from the STEP studies, providing a unique opportunity to explore known and new safety signals. This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the safety data collected in SELECT (including all adverse events [AEs] leading to permanent treatment discontinuation) to support clinicians and policy makers in assessing the risk–benefit and potential coverage of semaglutide for relevant patients.

Semaglutide STEP 3 — subcutaneous semaglutide as an adjunct to intensive behavior therapy in adults with overweight or obesity — enrolled participants without diabetes mellitus, used a low-calorie, meal-replacement diet for the first 8 weeks (1000–1200 kcal/day) followed by 1200–1800 kcal/day with regular physical activity goals of 200 minutes per week and 30 individual sessions; semaglutide 2.4 mg SQ per week plus intensive behavior therapy resulted in a 16.9% reduction in body weight versus 5.7% with placebo, and the authors noted 14.9% vs 2.4% at 68 weeks in STEP 1, concluding that these findings suggest that the inclusion of intensive behavioral therapy plus an 8-week low-calorie diet ultimately may not contribute significant additional weight reduction beyond that achieved by semaglutide and less-intensive lifestyle intervention.

For Studies 2, 3, and 4, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to week 68.

After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY achieved 5%, 10% and 15% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 6.

3.5 Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on weight loss (1‐3)

Among participants on treatment at week 68 with a body weight assessment, the observed placebo‐corrected weight loss from baseline to week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg was 14.4 percentage points in the STEP 1 trial, 7.6 percentage points in the STEP 2 trial and 12.7 percentage points in the STEP 3 trial. Weight loss appeared nearly as great in those without versus with GI AEs (Figure 3). In the semaglutide 2.4 mg arms, the mean change observed from baseline to week 68 in body weight in those with versus without GI AEs was −17.3% versus −15.7% in STEP 1, −11.4% versus −9.6% in STEP 2 and −17.7% versus −17.1% in STEP 3. Results were similar when weight change was analysed in participants with or without any of the three common GI AEs that were considered to possibly influence weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting) (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Change in body weight from baseline to week 68 among participants with and without gastrointestinal adverse events in: (A) STEP 1; (B) STEP 2; and (C) STEP 3. Bars present the mean percentage change from baseline in body weight ± standard error of the mean. Body weight data are observed on‐treatment data (any dose of trial product within previous 2 weeks) among participants who had a week 68 body weight assessment. Gastrointestinal adverse events comprise any type of gastrointestinal disorder, including on‐treatment adverse events (for assessment of adverse events, participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days). Additional information on these analyses is included in Table S4

Mediation analysis found that the vast majority of the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg were because of effects unrelated to GI AEs. Overall, < 1 percentage point of semaglutide‐induced weight loss versus placebo was mediated by GI AEs, whether analysed based on the occurrence of any GI AE (Figure 4A) or the occurrence of nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting (Figure 4B). There was no notable difference in the magnitude of weight loss effect mediated by GI AEs between the STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials (Figure 4).

### Cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in chronic weight management in Portugal [^112QLZyx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide (Wegovy®) 2.4 mg injection is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), that promotes weight loss via slowing down gastric emptying and thereby reducing hunger and increasing satiety. Approximately 5,000 patients enrolled in five phase 3 trials– the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program. In STEP 1 trial, patients who received semaglutide 2.4 mg had clinically significant weight loss (at least a 5% reduction in weight from baseline level) compared with placebo (weight reduction: 14.9% vs. 2.4% at week 68; P < 0.001), and superior weight loss at 68 weeks when compared with placebo in STEP 2 trial for weight management in patients with overweight or obesity and T2D.

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with D&E compared to D&E alone for the treatment of adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) with one or more weight-related comorbidities, from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS).

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

### Effectiveness of adjuvant semaglutide following bariatric metabolic surgery [^116mWKug]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The suboptimal initial response to MBS and/or worsening of a significant obesity complication that occurs after an initially adequate post-operative clinical response are not an uncommon occurrence. The reasons for this are not fully understood; however, genetics and hormonal mechanisms have been implicated. The incretin effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1a) in the medical management of obesity is well documented by stimulating insulin release, suppressing glucagon secretion, reducing gastric emptying and promoting increased satiety. The efficacy and tolerability of liraglutide (daily s/c GLP1a) have been reported elsewhere and have been shown to improve weight loss outcomes in that where satisfactory weight loss following surgery has not been achieved. Within this class, semaglutide represents a unique GLP1a, with both subcutaneous (s/c) and oral routes of administration available. The Therapeutic Good Administration (TGA) has approved the use of high dose semaglutide (2.4 mg) for management of obesity in Australia; however, the oral equivalent will not be available for the foreseeable future.

Several randomised trials (STEP) have compared outcomes following weekly subcutaneous administration of semaglutide to both placebo and lifestyle modification in patients mostly without diabetes with overweight/ obesity. The STEP trials showed that semaglutide resulted in significant weight loss in patients with and without diabetes and these effects have been sustained out to 2 years.

Similar results have been borne out in several meta-analyses. Once weekly semaglutide s/c injection results in a pooled reduction in total body weight of 10–12.57% and reductions in both BMI and waist circumference when compared to placebo. High dose s/c semaglutide is also more effective than low dose s/c semaglutide, oral semaglutide and other GLP1a's for weight loss. With this in mind, we aimed to analyse weight loss outcomes for semaglutide at the maximum tolerated dose in a cohort of post-surgical bariatric patients.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^112TCecx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30kg/m 2 (or ≥ 27kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight-related co-morbidity) without diabetes to 68weeks of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off-treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.

Results

Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.

Conclusions

One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health.

### Greater combined reductions of hbA ≥ 1.0% and body weight loss ≥ 5.0% or ≥ 10.0% with orally administered semaglutide versus comparators [^112YAtaG]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and body weight in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both of which are important therapeutic goals. The glucose and body weight lowering benefits and cardiovascular (CV) benefits of GLP-1RAs are becoming increasingly recognised, and GLP-1RAs are included in international T2D treatment recommendations and guidelines across the disease continuum. Semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1RA available as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection and a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of people with inadequately controlled T2D. The tablet formulation of semaglutide may remove the administrative burden on people and physicians (as compared to injectables) and facilitate initiation of GLP-1RAs earlier in the course of T2D.

Treatment guidelines for T2D recommend a comprehensive, individualised approach with multiple therapeutic goals (including HbA 1c reduction and body weight loss), as many people with T2D also have overweight or obesity, which is associated with several comorbid conditions. Composite endpoints are useful to differentiate between treatment options in terms of overall efficacy and safety, thereby providing physicians with a holistic view of the clinical benefit of different treatments. Additionally, composite endpoints can provide a foundation for clinical decision-making, addressing the limitation of basing clinical decisions on a single outcome, such as change in HbA 1c.

HbA 1c reductions of ≥ 1% and body weight loss of ≥ 5% in people with T2D are considered important indicators of a clinically meaningful response to treatment, and have been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. Furthermore, the incidence rate of diabetes-related complications has been reported to decrease with every 1% reduction in HbA 1c, while a reduction in body weight of ≥ 5% can confer metabolic improvement and reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease. In this post hoc analysis, data from several trials included in the PIONEER programme were evaluated to determine to what extent people with T2D treated with orally administered semaglutide versus comparators achieved composite endpoints of ≥ 1% reduction in HbA 1c plus either a ≥ 5% or ≥ 10% reduction in body weight, as well as separate endpoints of ≥ 1% decrease in HbA 1c and a ≥ 5% or ≥ 10% decrease in body weight.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^114YSbP5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

A growing body of data from the STEP clinical trial programme has demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity. Across the STEP trials, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistently associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%‐17.4% in participants without diabetes, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, physical function and quality of life. Furthermore, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class. Results of other trials within the STEP programme are awaited, together with data from SELECT, which will provide valuable information on the impact of weight reduction with semaglutide 2.4 mg on decreasing CV risk.

3 MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY

Older pharmacological options for chronic weight management, such as orlistat, phentermine‐topiramate and naltrexone‐bupropion, typically show moderate efficacy (~3%‐9% mean weight loss over that achieved with lifestyle intervention alone). Liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily administered subcutaneously was the first GLP‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) to be approved for weight management, after demonstrating weight losses of 4%‐6% over those achieved with lifestyle intervention alone in clinical trials of 20‐56 weeks' duration. In these trials, 46%‐76% of participants lost ≥ 5% and 23%‐37% lost ≥ 10% of their baseline body weight.,

Semaglutide is a GLP‐1 analogue shown to reduce energy intake, reduce hunger and increase feelings of satiety and fullness. This effect has been shown to arise via GLP‐1 receptor activation in the central nervous system, with further indirect modulation of neuronal activity involved in appetite regulation and food intake and preference. The STEP programme was designed to comprehensively explore the efficacy of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity, with each trial addressing a specific research question. For the six completed trials discussed in this review, these are: STEP 1 (large pivotal study), weight loss; STEP 2, weight loss in type 2 diabetes; STEP 3, weight loss in combination with intensive behavioural therapy; STEP 4, effect of continuing versus withdrawing semaglutide on weight‐loss maintenance; STEP 5, weight maintenance over 2 years; and STEP 8, head‐to‐head comparison of semaglutide and liraglutide. In addition to these STEP trials, a regional phase IIIa trial, STEP 6, assessed the effect of semaglutide versus placebo for weight management in 401 adults from east Asia (Japan and South Korea) with obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

Aim

To explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight‐related co‐morbidity) without diabetes to 68 weeks of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16 weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off‐treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.

Results

Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.

Conclusions

One year after withdrawal of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two‐thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^112C25J8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Mean body weight data suggested a slowing of weight regain towards the end of the extension phase in participants withdrawn from semaglutide. By contrast, the STEP 4 study did not show a clear slowing of weight regain towards the end of its 48‐week observation period following semaglutide withdrawal. However, interpretation of weight trajectory in STEP 4 is limited by the comparatively small magnitude of weight regain (owing to the shorter treatment duration and smaller initial weight loss in STEP 4 relative to STEP 1, and the continuation of lifestyle intervention). Whether the slowing in regain in the off‐treatment STEP 1 extension represents a plateauing of mean body weight below baseline levels, or simply a slowing of weight regain as body weight approached baseline, cannot be determined without longer follow‐up.

Subgroup analyses indicated no difference in weight loss based on age, but did suggest lesser mean weight loss in men relative to women in the semaglutide arm, both at the end of active treatment (at week 68) and at the end of the off‐treatment extension phase (at week 120). Despite the small difference between men and women, weight losses during treatment were still substantial and clinically meaningful in both sexes. Subgroup analyses based on baseline BMI categories showed inconsistent trends in the semaglutide arm: weight loss during treatment (week 0 to week 68) showed no clear trend across increasing BMI categories, but over week 0 to week 120 showed a trend for greater weight loss in the subgroups of patients with higher versus lower baseline BMI categories, in part owing to a lesser weight regain in the 40 kg/m 2 or higher subgroup than most others. However, the differences in weight loss between baseline BMI subgroups were comparatively small, and a meaningful effect of baseline BMI cannot be concluded based on the present data. Differences in weight loss in the semaglutide arm were also seen based on baseline glycaemic status, with lesser weight loss from baseline at week 68 and week 120 among those with prediabetes at baseline relative to those with normoglycaemia. This finding is consistent with the established difficulty of achieving weight loss among people with type 2 diabetes, and with the previous observation of smaller reductions in body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes in the STEP 2 trial, relative to those seen during the main treatment period of STEP 1, which excluded patients with type 2 diabetes.

For Study 5, the primary efficacy parameter was mean percent change in body weight from randomization (week 20) to week 68.

From randomization (week 20) to week 68, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo (Table 7). Because patients who discontinued WEGOVY during titration and those who did not reach the 2.4 mg weekly dose were not eligible for the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect the experience of patients in the general population who are first starting WEGOVY.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^117XhUC4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The PIONEER 7 trial demonstrated superior glycemic control and weight loss with once-daily oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment versus sitagliptin 100mg in type 2 diabetes. This 52-week extension evaluated long-term oral semaglutide treatment and switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide.

Research Design and Methods

A 52-week, open-label extension commenced after the 52-week main phase. Patients on oral semaglutide in the main phase continued treatment (n = 184; durability part); those on sitagliptin were rerandomized to continued sitagliptin (n = 98) or oral semaglutide (n = 100; initiated at 3mg) (switch part). Oral semaglutide was dose-adjusted (3, 7, or 14mg) every 8 weeks based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) (target < 7.0% (< 53mmol/mol)) and tolerability. Secondary endpoints (no primary) included changes in HbA 1c and body weight.

Results

In the durability part, mean (SD) changes in HbA 1c and body weight from week 0 were -1.5% (0.8) and -1.3% (1.0) and -2.8kg (3.8) and -3.7kg (5.2) at weeks 52 and 104, respectively. In the switch part, mean changes in HbA 1c from week 52 to week 104 were -0.2% for oral semaglutide and 0.1% for sitagliptin (difference -0.3% (95% CI -0.6 to 0.0); p = 0.0791 (superiority not confirmed)). More patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% with oral semaglutide (52.6%) than sitagliptin (28.6%; p = 0.0011) and fewer received rescue medication (9% vs 23.5%). Respective mean changes in body weight were -2.4 kg and -0.9 kg (difference -1.5 kg (95% CI -2.8 to -0.1); p = 0.0321). Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported with oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

Long-term oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment maintained HbA 1c reductions, with additional body weight reductions, and was well tolerated. Switching from sitagliptin to flexibly dosed oral semaglutide maintained HbA 1c reductions, helped more patients achieve HbA 1c targets with less use of additional glucose-lowering medication, and offers the potential for additional reductions in body weight.

Methods

Trial design and participants

The current work complies with all relevant ethical regulations and reports a prespecified analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SELECT trial, details of which have been reported in papers describing study design and rationale, baseline characteristicsand the primary outcome. SELECT evaluated once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiac events (a composite endpoint comprising CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in individuals with established CVD and overweight or obesity, without diabetes. The protocol for SELECT was approved by national and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities in each participating country. All patients provided written informed consent before beginning any trial-specific activity. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 45 years, with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m² and established CVD defined as at least one of the following: prior myocardial infarction, prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere.

Human participants research

The trial protocol was designed by the trial sponsor, Novo Nordisk, and the academic Steering Committee. A global expert panel of physician leaders in participating countries advised on regional operational issues. National and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities approved the protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Study intervention and patient management

Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner and 1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The starting dose was 0.24 mg once weekly, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg per week) until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached after 16 weeks. Patients who were unable to tolerate dose escalation due to AEs could be managed by extension of dose-escalation intervals, treatment pauses or maintenance at doses below the 2.4 mg per week target dose. Investigators were allowed to reduce the dose of study product if tolerability issues arose. Investigators were provided with guidelines for, and encouraged to follow, evidence-based recommendations for medical treatment and lifestyle counseling to optimize management of underlying CVD as part of the standard of care. The lifestyle counseling was not targeted at weight loss. Additional intervention descriptions are available.

The proportion of patients achieving weight loss of ≥ 5% across the global trials was consistently greater with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg (13%‐44%) than with placebo (3%‐15%) and active comparators (10%‐36%) at week 26, and the difference was maintained at the end of treatment in each trial. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 Other measures of body size (body mass index and waist circumference) were reduced with oral semaglutide compared with placebo and active comparators. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42

4.3 Composite outcomes

With the exception of PIONEER 6, 40 two composite outcomes were studied in the PIONEER trials. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 At week 26, a greater proportion of patients achieved HbA1c < 7% with no weight gain or severe/blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg than with placebo and active comparators (Table 2). 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 This advantage was maintained over longer treatment durations. Similarly, more patients achieved HbA1c reduction ≥ 1% with body weight loss ≥ 3% at week 26 with oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg than with placebo and active comparators. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 The difference also remained over longer treatment durations.

Anti-obesity medication use — Patients have an average of approximately 5–20% weight reduction with variable responses; for many agents, if no clinical improvement of at least 3–5% loss of baseline body weight occurs after 12–16 weeks, labeling may recommend increasing the dose or possibly discontinuing therapy, whereas some agents such as semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly injection do not have explicit stopping instructions; if weight regain indicates loss of effectiveness the medication should be discontinued, while a plateau after clinically meaningful loss should not necessarily be interpreted as tolerance and should not automatically warrant that the medication "be discontinued".

Compared with patients in the global trials, Japanese patients tended to have greater HbA1c reductions than global patients (from similar baselines), 43, 44 supporting the hypothesis that T2D in East Asian patients is mainly a disease of beta‐cell dysfunction rather than of obesity and insulin resistance. 48

In the global trials, oral semaglutide was as effective as the oral SGLT2i empagliflozin in helping patients to lose weight at 26 and 52 weeks, 36 and was more effective than the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin 37, 41 and the subcutaneous GLP‐1RA liraglutide at both time points. 38 In these trials, up to 4.3 kg of weight loss was achieved at 52 weeks in patients receiving oral semaglutide 14 mg once daily (treatment policy estimand), 36, 37, 38, 41 and in PIONEER 3 weight loss was maintained up to 78 weeks. 37 Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 15‐29 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and those at high CV risk also lost weight over the course of oral semaglutide treatment. 36, 37 Up to 69% of patients treated with oral semaglutide in the global trials achieved the composite outcome of HbA1c < 7.0% with no weight gain or severe/blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^116hFDqT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8 is the first direct comparison of semaglutide with another weight‐management medication in a randomized trial. Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated better efficacy than liraglutide as well as offering more convenient once‐weekly rather than once‐daily injections. Although direct comparisons with other treatments cannot be made because of methodological differences between trials, overall the weight loss with other approved medications appears to be more modest than that seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials.,

The STEP trials showed both short‐ and longer‐term improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight or obesity. Earlier data from PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 suggested a CV benefit of semaglutide at lower doses in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for semaglutide in the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. The ongoing SELECT trial (NCT03574597) will report on CV outcomes with semaglutide 2.4 mg in a population without diabetes who are at high CV risk.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class and was similar to that seen in other trials of subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In clinical practice, the extensive experience with this molecule at the 1.0 mg dose in type 2 diabetes and with the GLP‐1RA class overall should ensure a certain degree of confidence in the safety profile. This includes the rate of severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia, which in STEP 2 was reported in similar proportions of subjects receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg (5.7% and 5.5%, respectively).

The encouraging data from validated patient‐reported outcomes (Short Form‐36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version in STEP 1‐4 and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life‐Lite Clinical Trials Version questionnaire in STEP 1 and 2) point towards the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg being directly perceived by study participants.

A reduction in body weight was observed with WEGOVY irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, and level of renal function impairment.

The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 for Studies 2 and 3. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from ‑10% in Study 2 intersects the WEGOVY and placebo curves at approximately 66%, and 12%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 6.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^116fTk3q]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the direct comparative studies analysed in this meta‐analysis, tirzepatide demonstrated superior weight loss compared to semaglutide, supporting the notion of enhanced clinical efficacy of dual GLP‐1 and GIP agonism. The efficacy of semaglutide has been established throughout the SUSTAIN trials, where semaglutide showed significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo and active comparators (p < 0.0001 for all). Semaglutide also achieved greater proportions of weight loss over 5% or 10% (p < 0.0001 for all). Additionally, the STEP trials noted that semaglutide 2.4 mg had an average weight loss reduction of up to 16%. Tirzepatide has also been established to be efficacious in reducing body weight, with up to 20.9% weight loss seen across the SURMOUNT trials. However, it is important to note that these trials evaluated each of these GLP‐1 RAs independently rather than direct head‐to‐head trials. Thus, the data in this meta‐analysis provide more clinically relevant comparisons between these agents.

Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle intervention and usage of GLP‐1 RAs is still unclear. However, Wadden et al. suggest that an initial lifestyle intervention period followed by medication addition can maximise weight reduction. This stems from the observation that STEP‐1 (semaglutide only) and STEP‐3 (lifestyle and semaglutide) did not produce an additive benefit towards weight loss. These findings in the literature combined with this study's results suggest that adding semaglutide or tirzepatide produces clinically significant weight loss that can be further potentiated through diet and exercise habit changes. There also appears to be a dose‐dependent improvement in clinical outcomes (glycemic control and weight loss) with tolerable safety profiles at higher doses.

Fertility

Women with obesity and/or diabetes sometimes struggle with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal imbalance that occurs due to excessive androgen production by the ovaries. This disorder contributes to infertility, weight gain, insulin resistance, and abnormal heart function. Recent research shows that semaglutide aids not only in weight reduction in PCOS patients but also impacts the reproductive system. Semaglutide increases fertility by helping toreduce inflammation and fibrosis in the ovaries.

Side effects

Semaglutide may also cause various side effects, the frequency of which is shown in the Fig. 6.

The most common side effects of using semaglutide are related to the digestive system. Nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting are reported most frequently. Gastrointestinal problems increase with higher doses.

Other adverse events include nasopharyngitis, hypoglycemia, increased lipase levels, lack of appetite, gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, influenza symptoms, and headaches.

Semaglutide can also cause skin problems. Pruritus is the most common symptom of an injection site reaction. Fortunately, it is transient and patients do not require the cessation of therapy.

Pancreatic inflammation, including hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis is a rare but very serious potential side effect of using semaglutide. This drug stimulates pancreatic islet beta cells and exocrine duct cells leading to ductal overgrowth and narrowing, which increases pancreatic mass and the risk of ductal occlusion. This may predispose individuals to pancreatitis.

Moreover, the appearance of the so-called "Ozempic face" is an increasingly common side effect. "Ozempic face" is related to rapid weight loss, particularly to a significant loss of fat in the face. Ozempic users complain about wrinkles, sunken eyes, a hollowed appearance, sagging jowls around the neck and jaw, and alterations in the cheeks, lips, and chin.

Contraindication

Semaglutide is contraindicated in pregnancy. Patients (female and male) should not take semaglutide at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to a concern for potential fetal damage.

Contraindications also apply to patients with a history of medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, and hypersensitivity to semaglutide.

### Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg in adults with overweight or obesity [^114DdbUM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg may provide an alternative treatment option to injectable semaglutide (2.4 mg) and higher-dose oral semaglutide (50 mg) for persons with overweight or obesity.

Methods

In a 71-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 22 sites in four countries, we enrolled persons without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. The participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral semaglutide (25 mg) or placebo once daily, plus lifestyle interventions. The coprimary end points at week 64 were the percent change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight; confirmatory secondary end points included reductions in body weight of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more and the change in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT) Physical Function score.

Results

A total of 205 participants were randomly assigned to receive oral semaglutide, and 102 to receive placebo. The estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 64 was -13.6% in the oral semaglutide group and -2.2% in the placebo group (estimated difference, -11.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -13.9 to -9.0; P < 0.001). Participants in the oral semaglutide group were significantly more likely than those in the placebo group to have body-weight reductions of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons) and to have an improved IWQOL-Lite-CT Physical Function score (P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with oral semaglutide than with placebo (74.0% vs. 42.2%).

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide at a dose of 25 mg once daily resulted in a greater mean reduction in body weight than placebo in participants with overweight or obesity. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; OASIS 4 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05564117.).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^115LFpiF]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg — type 2 diabetes mellitus glycemic and weight outcomes: Because "semaglutide was originally approved for T2DM, we also examined glycemic control of semaglutide 2.4-mg dose that was approved for the treatment of obesity". In an East Asian trial, "83% of participants (39 of 47) with T2DM in the semaglutide 2.4-mg cohort (baseline mean HbA1c, 8.4%) and 4% of participants (1 of 25) in the placebo group (baseline mean HbA1c, 8.1%) were able to achieve HbA1c < 6.5% at week 68". In another study, "the MD in %TBWL in the semaglutide group (n = 404) vs placebo group (n = 403) was 6.22% (95% CI, 5.11%–7.33%), favoring the semaglutide group".

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: an updated review of head-to-head clinical studies [^114XnK78]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The SUSTAIN-10 trial compared once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg with liraglutide 1.2 mg in patients on 1–3 oral antihyperglycemic agents in a 30 week randomized, controlled trial. Mean A1C decreased by 1.7% in the semaglutide group and 1.0% in the liraglutide group (p < 0.0001). Mean body weight decreased by 5.8 kg with semaglutide and 1.9 kg with liraglutide (p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients achieving an A1C < 7% or weight loss of ⩾5% were both significantly higher in the semaglutide group compared with the liraglutide group (p < 0.0001 for both).

The PIONEER-4 trial examined the first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, in comparison with subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in a 52-week randomized controlled trial. Patients were on either metformin or a SGLT-2 inhibitor at baseline. The primary endpoint was change in A1C from baseline to week 26 using the treatment policy estimand (which assessed treatment effect for all participants assigned to treatment regardless of study drug discontinuation or use of rescue medication). At 26 weeks, oral semaglutide was non-inferior (−1.2% versus −1.1%, 95% CI −0.3 to 0.00, p < 0.0001) to liraglutide in A1C reduction. There were no significant differences in percentage of patients achieving an A1C target of less than 7% between oral semaglutide and liraglutide (67.6% versus 61.8%, p = 0.1530). After 26 weeks, oral semaglutide resulted in significantly more weight loss than liraglutide (−4.4 kg versus −3.1 kg, p = 0.0003). After 52 weeks of treatment, oral semaglutide reduced A1C significantly more than liraglutide (−1.3% versus −1.1%, p < 0.0001).

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^113j88CW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The STEP 8 trial, including 338 patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, is one of the few head-to-head studies in the field of obesity research, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg/week with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and placebo combined with counseling, a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and 150 min/week physical exercise for 68 weeks. Patients treated with semaglutide showed a 15.8% body-weight reduction versus 6.4% for the liraglutide group and 1.9% for the placebo group, with an estimated treatment difference of -9.4% between semaglutide and liraglutide (95% CI −12.0, −6.8; p < 0.001). 38.5% of patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥ 20%, versus 6.0% with liraglutide (p < 0.001).

### Tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1131JNcQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-5 was published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tirzepatide compared to semaglutide in patients with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the population was: 750 patients (485 female, 265 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with obesity without T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication for weight reduction or a GLP-1 receptor agonist in the past 90 days; change in body weight of > 5 kg in the past 90 days. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the interventions were: n = 374 tirzepatide (at a dose of 10 mg or 15 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks) n = 376 semaglutide (at a dose of 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (20.2% vs. 13.7%; MD 6.5, 95% CI 4.9 to 8.1). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in waist circumference at week 72 (18.4 cm vs. 13 cm; MD 5.4, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.1) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (81.6% vs. 60.5%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 25% (31.6% vs. 16.1%; RR 2, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.6). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with obesity without T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management in participants from China: a prespecified analysis of the STEP 7 randomized clinical trial [^1168TbFE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo for weight management in a population of Chinese adults with overweight or obesity.

Materials and Methods

In STEP 7 (NCT04251156), a double-blind, phase 3a trial, adults from a predominantly East Asian population with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, were randomized 2:1 to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg or placebo for 44weeks as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. This prespecified analysis evaluated Chinese participants in STEP 7. The primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to Week 44 and the proportion of participants who achieved ≥ 5% reduction in body weight from baseline.

Results

Overall, 195 Chinese participants were randomized to semaglutide 2.4mg and 105 to placebo. Estimated change in mean body weight from baseline to Week 44 was -11.8% with semaglutide 2.4mg versus -3.5% with placebo (estimated treatment difference -8.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2, -6.4; p < 0.0001). At Week 44, a greater proportion of participants treated with semaglutide 2.4mg achieved ≥ 5% body weight loss versus placebo (85.4% vs. 26.8%): odds ratio 16.1; 95% CI 8.4, 30.9; p < 0.0001. Adverse events were reported by 92.3% of semaglutide-treated participants and 82.9% of placebo-treated participants, the most common of which were gastrointestinal disorders (126/195, 64.6% vs. 35/105, 33.3%).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate beneficial effects of semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo, supporting its use in an adult Chinese population with overweight or obesity.
