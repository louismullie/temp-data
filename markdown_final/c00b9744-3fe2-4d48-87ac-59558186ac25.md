## Question

Antibiotic coverage for scrape on skin from fall in ground with cellulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about empiric antibiotic coverage for cellulitis following a ground scrape, including how to assess severity, choose between outpatient and inpatient therapy, select appropriate agents, and determine duration and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and likely pathogens. Then, I should verify severity and disposition using SIRS and hemodynamic stability. Next, I will consider whether MRSA coverage is indicated. After that, I will select empiric antibiotics for outpatient and inpatient scenarios. Then, I should confirm duration and reassessment checkpoints. Finally, I will address wound care, predisposing factors, and what to do if there is no improvement, anchoring to IDSA and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely microbiology. A ground scrape with subsequent cellulitis typically represents a nonpurulent infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, where β-hemolytic streptococci predominate and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is less common but possible, while MRSA is an unusual cause unless specific risk factors are present, so I should not jump to routine MRSA coverage without indications [^114qTzei] [^1158v9Ao] [^112hv8YA].

> I need to check severity and disposition next. If there are no SIRS criteria, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability, outpatient therapy is appropriate. If SIRS is present or the patient is unstable, hospitalization is indicated, and I should also have a low threshold to admit for immunocompromise, poor adherence, or concern for deeper infection such as necrotizing fasciitis, so I should double-check vitals and mental status before deciding [^114pSATx] [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL].

> Hold on, let's not conflate purulent and nonpurulent disease. I initially thought "trauma from a fall" might imply MRSA, but wait, let me verify the distinction: penetrating trauma, purulence, or abscess increase the likelihood of S. aureus and MRSA, whereas a simple nonpurulent cellulitis from a superficial abrasion is usually streptococcal, so routine MRSA coverage is not warranted unless specific risk factors are present [^112z7Dvu] [^111zAoE9] [^1158v9Ao].

> I will now examine MRSA risk factors that would change empiric therapy. Indications to add MRSA coverage include penetrating trauma, prior MRSA infection or colonization, injection drug use, concurrent purulence or abscess, severe infection with systemic toxicity, or failure of appropriate β-lactam therapy within 48–72 hours. Otherwise, for nonpurulent cellulitis, streptococcal coverage alone is sufficient, and I should confirm whether any of these are present before broadening [^111zAoE9] [^114ZhUEW] [^116nahUu].

> For mild, nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk factors, I should confirm that first-line outpatient therapy targets streptococci. Reasonable oral options include cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours, dicloxacillin 500 mg every 6 hours, or amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours. If penicillin allergy is present, clindamycin 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours provides streptococcal and staphylococcal coverage, and I need to ensure the dose and frequency align with local resistance patterns and patient tolerance [^116QtZHg] [^116aZEV3] [^114pSATx].

> But wait, what if MRSA risk factors are present or the patient is severely ill. In that case, I should broaden to cover both MRSA and streptococci; oral options include clindamycin monotherapy, or TMP-SMX or doxycycline combined with a β-lactam such as amoxicillin or cephalexin to ensure streptococcal coverage, while inpatient regimens include vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin, with vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem reserved for severe systemic toxicity or concern for polymicrobial infection, and I should verify renal function and monitoring plans if using vancomycin [^115M76PW] [^111zAoE9] [^113PjKu3] [^111FU7My].

> Next, I should review duration and reassessment. A 5–6 day course is generally sufficient for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis if the patient is improving clinically, with extension to 10–14 days for slow response or more severe disease. I should confirm early improvement within 48–72 hours and extend or escalate if there is no clear response, keeping in mind that longer courses have not shown superiority in uncomplicated cases [^111gsSaf] [^114pSATx] [^115KeBek].

> I need to ensure supportive care is addressed. Elevation of the affected limb reduces edema and accelerates resolution, meticulous local wound care with cleansing and dressings is essential, and I should examine and treat predisposing factors such as toe-web fissures, edema, eczema, or venous insufficiency to reduce recurrence risk. If the patient is a nondiabetic adult, a short course of systemic corticosteroids can modestly hasten symptom resolution when combined with antibiotics, though I should confirm no contraindications first [^117WMmEy] [^114NgcMq] [^117V2ULq].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if there is no improvement. If erythema, warmth, pain, or systemic signs fail to improve within 48–72 hours, I should reassess the diagnosis for mimics like venous stasis, lymphedema, or DVT, consider whether MRSA was missed and add coverage, obtain cultures if purulence is present or if the patient is immunocompromised, and evaluate for deeper infection such as abscess or necrotizing fasciitis that may require imaging and surgical consultation [^114pSATx] [^112m3gRJ] [^116FHBtP].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency. For a ground-scrape cellulitis without purulence or MRSA risk factors, treat as nonpurulent cellulitis with streptococcal coverage, use oral therapy if stable, aim for 5–6 days if improving, and escalate only if risk factors emerge or response is inadequate. This aligns with IDSA guidance and contemporary evidence showing no advantage to routine MRSA coverage or prolonged therapy in uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis [^114pSATx] [^111gsSaf] [^112JMiZb].

For a scrape-related cellulitis, **empiric therapy should target streptococci and MSSA** [^116aZEV3] with a first-generation cephalosporin (cephalexin 500 mg PO q6h) or dicloxacillin 500 mg PO q6h for 5–6 days [^111gsSaf], extending to 10–14 days if slow response [^115KeBek]. Add **MRSA coverage** if risk factors are present (prior MRSA, penetrating trauma, injection drug use, or severe infection) [^111zAoE9] using clindamycin 300–450 mg PO q6–8h, doxycycline 100 mg PO q12h, or TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO q12h plus a beta-lactam for streptococcal coverage [^115M76PW] [^112z7Dvu]. Use IV therapy (cefazolin 1 g IV q8h or nafcillin/oxacillin 1–2 g IV q4–6h) for severe infection or if oral therapy is not tolerated, and add vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV q12h for MRSA risk [^114pSATx]. Adjust therapy to culture results and clinical response, and escalate if no improvement in 48–72 hours [^111pS5Gp].

## Common pathogens associated with cellulitis from a scrape

Cellulitis from a scrape is typically caused by **skin flora**, with streptococci predominating and staphylococci (including MRSA) less common in nonpurulent cases [^114qTzei] [^1158v9Ao]:

- **Beta-hemolytic streptococci**: Most common cause of nonpurulent cellulitis [^114qTzei] [^1158v9Ao].
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Including MSSA and MRSA; more likely with purulence, penetrating trauma, or prior MRSA [^114qTzei] [^111zAoE9].
- **Gram-negative rods**: Rare in uncomplicated cellulitis; consider if immunocompromised or with water exposure [^notfound].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy recommendations

Empiric therapy should be guided by **severity, purulence, and MRSA risk** [^114pSATx]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Mild, nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk | - Cephalexin 500 mg PO q6h <br/> - Or dicloxacillin 500 mg PO q6h [^116QtZHg] [^114pSATx] |
| Moderate infection or MRSA risk factors | - Clindamycin 300–450 mg PO q6–8h (covers MRSA and streptococci) <br/> - Or TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO q12h plus amoxicillin 500 mg PO q8h for streptococcal coverage [^115M76PW] [^112z7Dvu] |
| Severe infection or systemic toxicity | - Cefazolin 1 g IV q8h <br/> - Or nafcillin/oxacillin 1–2 g IV q4–6h <br/> - Plus vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV q12h if MRSA risk [^114pSATx] [^115p3xNL] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Standard duration is **5–6 days** [^111gsSaf] for uncomplicated cellulitis with close follow-up; extend to 10–14 days if the response is slow or the infection is severe [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Patient allergies**: Avoid beta-lactams if allergic; use clindamycin or doxycycline-based regimens [^112z7Dvu].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Consider local MRSA prevalence and resistance data [^116nahUu].
- **Clinical severity**: Use IV therapy and broader coverage for severe infection or systemic toxicity [^114pSATx].

---

## Clinical response and adjustment of therapy

Reassess at **48–72 hours** [^116zpUYf]; if there is no improvement, obtain cultures, broaden coverage (e.g. add MRSA therapy), and evaluate for complications (abscess, necrotizing infection) [^1152eBNE].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate antibiotic coverage

Inadequate coverage can lead to **progression, recurrence, or severe complications**:

- **Progression of infection**: Deeper infection, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis [^112aNEXQ].
- **Bacteremia and sepsis**: Especially in immunocompromised patients [^112aNEXQ].
- **Recurrent cellulitis**: Due to inadequate initial therapy or unresolved predisposing factors [^116anE5J].

---

## Preventive measures and wound care

- **Wound cleaning**: Thorough irrigation and debridement [^111uNx3y].
- **Topical antiseptics**: Apply after cleaning [^notfound].
- **Elevation**: Reduce swelling and improve healing [^117WMmEy].
- **Patient education**: Signs of infection and when to seek care [^notfound].

---

Empiric therapy for scrape-related cellulitis should prioritize **streptococcal and MSSA coverage** [^112hv8YA], adding MRSA therapy only when risk factors are present. Use a 5–6 day course [^111gsSaf], extend if needed, and adjust based on response and cultures.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116zpUYf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, and increasing frequency and costs are reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) that are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, there are significant treatment challenges, including overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties regarding when to initiate rescue therapy and when to stop treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Also, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing the knowledge on the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in dealing with the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response may be a key factor, due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. The standard assessment of response in SSTI trials has been performed after end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success posttreatment may often be the result of natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following nonantibiotic therapy in studies from the preantibiotic and early antibiotic eras. Moreover, 2 studies published in 1937 comparing antibiotic and ultraviolet therapy found the difference between treatment arms to peak 2–3 days after start of treatment, suggesting that early response is a more treatment-specific measure than cure assessed posttreatment. Clinical response 48–72 hours after treatment initiation is therefore currently recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the primary efficacy endpoint for clinical trials. This has not been without controversy, however, primarily because early response is not the ultimate goal of antibiotic therapy. European guidelines still recommend cure assessed after treatment as the primary endpoint.

### Decreased antibiotic utilization after implementation of a guideline for inpatient cellulitis and cutaneous abscess… [^111BwCZv]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Parenteral vancomycin was suggested for empirical therapy15, 33 in addition to adjunctive use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, 34 unless contraindicated, and elevation of the affected area. 15, 33 Use of antimicrobial agents with broad aerobic gram-negative or anaerobic activity was specifically discouraged. All end points were specified prior to the study. The primary outcome was change in antimicrobial exposure as measured by duration of therapy and use of agents with a broad spectrum of aerobic gram-negative activity and anaerobic activity. Duration of therapy was defined as the number of calendar days that a patient received antibiotic treatment. The median duration of therapy decreased by 3 days during the intervention period. Significantly more patients received less than 10 days of therapy, and fewer patients received more than 14 days.

Similar trends were noted when stratified by cellulitis or cutaneous abscess. Antimicrobial exposure, as measured by days of antibiotic therapy, was reduced in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Although cellulitis and cutaneous abscess are predominantly caused by gram-positive pathogens, use of treatment regimens with a broad spectrum of gram-negative and anaerobic activity is common. 7–13 In our guideline, we promoted the use of a single gram-positive agent, vancomycin, as empirical treatment for both cellulitis and cutaneous abscess. We observed 45%, 36%, and 36% relative declines in the use of broad aerobic gram-negative agents, antipseudomonal agents, and broad anaerobic agents, respectively. These improvements were observed in cases of both cellulitis and abscess. Implementation of the guideline promoting 7 days of therapy decreased the median duration of therapy by nearly 25%.

Moreover, patients were less likely to receive prolonged durations of therapy and more likely to receive a short course of therapy. Of importance, patients who received a short course of therapy were not more likely to experience clinical failure than those who received a long course of therapy. Our data suggest that short durations of therapy targeted to gram-positive pathogens decreases unnecessary antibiotic exposure without adversely affecting outcomes; however, clinical trials in this area are needed.

Periocular inflammation — preseptal and orbital cellulitis require antibiotics that cover Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species, with consideration for anaerobic coverage; treatment of both preseptal and orbital cellulitis should begin with amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) orally, 2 times daily for 10 d, with oral fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin) as a substitute if not available; if infection is isolated to the preseptal space, evacuation can be nonemergent, but if there is any question of orbital involvement or lack of response, we recommend emergent evacuation, as orbital cellulitis is a true medical emergency and failure to treat quickly can lead to blindness, intracranial infection, and possibly death. Antibiotics: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for orbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Nonemergent evacuation for periorbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Infections developing in damaged skin

It is a heterogeneous group that includes soft tissue infections developing in damaged skin such as bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds or in pressure or vascular ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft tissue infections

Soft tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is always recommended for high-risk wounds. For patients with signs of sepsis, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is always required.

Patients with serious burn injury require immediate care. Significant burn injuries can predispose to infectious complications. Burn wound infections are one of the most important and potentially serious complications that occur in the acute period following injury. Accurate medications of the wound with early excision of the eschar can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive burn wound infection.

Although burn wound surfaces are sterile immediately following thermal injury, these wounds may be colonized with microorganisms. If the patient's host defenses and therapeutic measures (such as excision of necrotic tissue and wound medications) are inadequate, microorganisms can colonize viable tissue, and a burn wound infection can occur.

Burn wound infections usually are polymicrobial. They can be immediately colonized by gram-positive bacteria from the patient's endogenous skin flora or the external environment. However they can also be rapidly colonized by gram-negative bacteria, usually within a week of the burn injury.

Pressure ulcers are localized areas of tissue necrosis that tend to develop when soft tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. The damage may be relatively minor, or it may lead to massive destruction of deeper tissues. The majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter.

Combination of surgical and antimicrobial interventions may be required to manage infected decubitus ulcers. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic tissue. Antimicrobial therapy should be used for patients with severe pressure ulcer infections, including those with spreading cellulitis or patients with signs of sepsis. Because such infections usually are polymicrobial, therapeutic regimens should be directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative organisms as well as anaerobic organisms.

In many cases a correct wound care management can largely prevent the appearance of these infections.

### Which antibiotics are best for skin and soft tissue infections?… [^1177STE7]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections have traditionally responded well to treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics or macro-lides. However, there has been concern whether they are still effective given the emerging resistance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Results: Twenty studies involving 4, 817 patients were reviewed. The beta-lactam agents included in the studies were extended-spectrum agents; first-generation ceph-alosporins; and third-generation cephalosporins. Overall, fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactam antibiotics for empirically treating SSTIs, but the difference was small.

Fluoroquinolones also were more effective in treating mild to moderate SSTIs. However, both of these advantages disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded from the analysis. There also was no difference between the antibiotic classes in the treatment of moderate to severe infections. Fluoroquinolones were no more effective than beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of abscesses and wound infections, nor were they more effective in treating patients hospitalized for SSTIs. Microbiologically, eradication rates of S. aureus and streptococci infections were the same for the two groups of medications. However, fluoroquinolones were more effective where gram-negative or anaerobic infections were identified. Conclusion: The authors concluded that although fluo-roquinolones were slightly more effective in treating SSTIs compared with beta-lactam antibiotics, this difference disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded.

When the greater adverse effect profile of fluoroquinolones was also considered, there was no substantial advantage to using them over beta-lactam agents for the empiric treatment of SSTIs. Although third-generation cephalosporins often are used to treat SSTIs, they appear to be less effective than extended-spectrum penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins.

### Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas… [^112JMiZb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Meaning In light of low-quality evidence found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis, additional research is required to define the optimum management of cellulitis. Importance The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non–surgically acquired cellulitis. Data Sources. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inform the production of evidence-based guidelines that cover antibiotic choice, route of administration, duration of treatment, the role of combinations of antibiotics, and gaps in research. We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished. The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy.

One study49 actively excluded patients with purulent cellulitis, whereas another48 included those with pustules less than 3 mm in maximal diameter. Although their numbers were small, purulent cellulitis was not a factor in response to therapy. 48 Both studies included data on adverse events. We found no difference between the 2 treatments. The use of oral therapy was supported by the limited data for oral vs IV antibiotics and by trials in which only oral antibiotics were used with good outcome. The earliest studies of antimicrobials for erysipelas administered the drugs orally with good outcomes. 21, 22 In this review, when oral antibiotics were compared with IV treatments, the oral treatments appeared more effective. 28, 29, 48, 58.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent cellulitis (hygiene practices), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider offering environmental hygiene measures in patients with recurrent SSTIs in the household or community setting. Counsel regarding the following:

- focus cleaning efforts on high-touch surfaces (surfaces that come into frequent contact with people's bare skin each day, such as counters, door knobs, bathtubs, and toilet seats) that may contact with bare skin or uncovered infections

- use commercially available cleaners or detergents appropriate for the surface being cleaned according to label instructions for routine cleaning of surfaces.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### Cellulitis: a review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, but it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain is typical. However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^112aNEXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors increase a person's risk. Breaks in the skin Disruption of the cutaneous barrier is a risk factor for developing cellulitis:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Fungal skin infections
- Injection drug use
- Injuries and wounds. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep.

Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis.

Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

Necrotizing fasciitis, including Fournier gangrene — evaluation and treatment specify that prompt surgical consultation is recommended for patients with aggressive infections associated with signs of systemic toxicity or suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, low). Empiric antibiotic treatment should be broad (eg, vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem; or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole), as the etiology can be polymicrobial or monomicrobial (strong, low).

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^113H9Nh1]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We hope that this case will expand the range of pathophysiology known to be associated with GCS cellulitis, including rhabdomyolysis; whereas most cases of cellulitis are self-limited streptococcal infections, this case highlights the importance of being alert to toxin-mediated disease, with systemic symptoms out of proportion to visible surface inflammatory signs. This distinction is important because the default therapeutic response is often broader antibiotic coverage, whereas the most appropriate response for virulent yet antibiotic-sensitive pathogens, such as GCS, is more narrowly targeted high-dose antibiotics with vigilant clinical monitoring and supportive care to avoid a poor prognosis and prolonged hospitalization.

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^114KLBse]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically-acquired cellulitis.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Empirical MRSA coverage for nonpurulent cellulitis… [^1158v9Ao]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Cellulitis is an infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, manifesting as expanding erythema, edema, and warmth of the skin. 1 In most instances of cellulitis, the causative microorganism cannot be definitively determined. However, based on studies using blood cultures, other laboratory markers, and clinical response to β-lactam antimicrobials, the vast majority of cellulitis is thought to be caused by β-hemolytic streptococci.
2. Staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are a less common cause of cellulitis and are more likely to be encountered in cases of purulent cellulitis or abscess formation. 3 Thus, current guidance from the Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that nonpurulent cellulitis without abscess should be treated with antimicrobials targeted primarily against streptococci.

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common cause of hospitalization and use of antibiotic therapy, and may result in significant disability. Infections managed by surgeons may vary from simple, noncomplicated cellulitis to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. The differentiation of necrotizing infections from nonnecrotizing infections is critical to achieving adequate surgical therapy. An understanding of the changing epidemiology of all complicated skin and soft tissue infections is required for selection of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Mycobacterium marinum cellulitis: a fishy etiology [^112WCN1R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections account for 2% of emergency department visits annually, though more unusual causative bacteria associated with saltwater exposure may result in morbidity. Mycobacterium marinum represents a rare but important cause of cellulitis, which if untreated or improperly managed, can progress to dactylitis or osteomyelitis. This unusual diagnosis is made more challenging due to the prolonged incubation period of approximately 21 days, temporally separating the inoculation from the disease. Patients will present with a nodular rash in a sporotrichoid pattern. While doxycycline is one antibiotic providing saltwater coverage, M. marinum has variable sensitivities to anti-mycobacterial antibiotics, and thus biopsy helps confirm the diagnosis as well as provide sensitivities for treatment. Emergency clinicians should inquire about environmental risk factors when caring for patients with cellulitis, especially with atypical skin presentations, and consider M. marinum as a rare but important cellulitis etiology.

### Current and future trends in antibiotic therapy of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections [^116pjXgX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations and guidance on developing drugs for treatment of skin infection using a new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). The new classification includes cellulitis, erysipelas, major skin abscesses and wound infection with a considerable extension of skin involvement, clearly referring to a severe subset of skin infections. The main goal of the FDA was to better identify specific infections where the advantages of a new antibiotic could be precisely estimated through quantifiable parameters, such as improvement of the lesion size and of systemic signs of infection. Before the spread and diffusion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in skin infections, antibiotic therapy was relatively straightforward. Using an empiric approach, a β-lactam was the preferred therapy and cultures from patients were rarely obtained. With the emergence of MRSA in the community setting, initial ABSSSI management has been changed and readdressed. Dalbavancin, oritavancin and tedizolid are new drugs, approved or in development for ABSSSI treatment, that also proved to be efficient against MRSA. Dalbavancin and oritavancin have a long half-life and can be dosed less frequently. This in turn makes it possible to treat patients with ABSSSI in an outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalization or potentially allowing earlier discharge, without compromising efficacy. In conclusion, characteristics of long-acting antibiotics could represent an opportunity for the management of ABSSSI and could profoundly modify the management of these infections by reducing or in some cases eliminating both costs and risks of hospitalization.

### Dilemmas when managing cellulitis [^117NfS13]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly seen in primary care. It is also a common reason for hospital admission accounting, for example, for around 3% of emergency medical consultations at one UK district general hospital. Here, we review the management of cellulitis, and try to resolve some common dilemmas: whether a patient with cellulitis should be treated in hospital; which antibacterial to use; whether it should be given orally or parenterally; and whether patients with recurrent cellulitis should take prophylactic antibacterials.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [^1145FNnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft tissue infections that range in virulence from very mild to limb/life threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations are varying and subject to controversy. Antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider administering a β-lactam antibiotic, such as cefazolin, in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis with modification to MRSA-active therapy if there is no clinical response.
Continue treatment for 7–14 days while individualizing based on the patient's clinical response.
