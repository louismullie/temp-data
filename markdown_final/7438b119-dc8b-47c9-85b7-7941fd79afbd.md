## Question

Use of memantine in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of memantine for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — whether it has a role and supporting evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what POTS guidelines recommend and whether memantine appears anywhere in authoritative statements. Then, I should verify memantine's approved indications, mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects to assess biological plausibility and risk. Next, I'll need to check for any direct clinical evidence for memantine in POTS. Finally, I should synthesize a recommendation grounded in evidence and pathophysiology while considering potential harms and monitoring needs.

> Let me first anchor the clinical question clearly: POTS is a chronic autonomic disorder defined by excessive orthostatic tachycardia with orthostatic symptoms in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, typically affecting young women and managed with a combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies per consensus guidelines, so the issue is whether memantine fits anywhere in that treatment framework [^113cxBWU] [^114vZw6V].

> I will now examine memantine's established profile to see if there is a rationale for use in POTS; memantine is FDA-labeled for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, acts as a low-to-moderate affinity uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has a long elimination half-life around 60–80 hours with predominantly renal excretion, and carries adverse effects such as dizziness, headache, confusion, somnolence, fatigue, and both hypertension and hypotension, with dosing adjustments needed in severe renal impairment, which could intersect problematically with orthostatic intolerance physiology [^111rkETR] [^113YPYfv] [^113YMrVZ] [^111NXmjp] [^111UM7gG].

> Next, I should review what guideline-directed POTS care actually endorses; the Canadian Cardiovascular Society 2020 position statement emphasizes nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise (often semirecumbent), volume and salt expansion, and compression, and when medications are necessary it supports agents like propranolol, ivabradine, midodrine, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, and in hyperadrenergic presentations, central sympatholytics such as clonidine or methyldopa, without any mention of memantine as a therapy for POTS [^113cxBWU] [^1145XuDa] [^1153yfc8] [^112jwyou].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider pathophysiology and target alignment to see if there is any plausible mechanistic role for an NMDA antagonist in POTS, which is heterogeneous with contributions from hypovolemia, partial autonomic neuropathy, hyperadrenergic states, venous pooling, mast cell activation in subsets, and impaired orthostatic cerebrovascular regulation, none of which are established as glutamatergic NMDA-driven processes in the peripheral or central autonomic circuits according to current frameworks, though recent reviews do raise the possibility of CNS involvement in POTS without specifying a glutamatergic therapeutic target [^114vZw6V] [^112yxddp] [^1147R6tW].

> Wait, let me verify whether any direct clinical evidence exists for memantine in POTS; scanning the provided materials shows no randomized controlled trials, no observational cohorts, and no case reports of memantine treating POTS, and importantly, systematic reviews of POTS medications and the CCS guideline's pharmacologic tables do not list memantine, which strongly suggests an evidence gap rather than supportive data [^115ji8H7] [^113cxBWU].

> But wait, what if the goal is symptom control for "brain fog" via a CNS mechanism; I should double-check whether related centrally acting agents help POTS generally, yet acute trials with atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and sertraline, an SSRI, actually worsened tachycardia or symptoms in POTS, underscoring that centrally active drugs can be counterproductive in this population, and with memantine's dizziness, fatigue, and blood pressure effects, there is a credible risk of exacerbating orthostatic intolerance rather than improving it [^116vNVhR] [^111Gz6Ee] [^114EN8aF] [^113YMrVZ].

> I need to ensure the risk assessment includes pharmacokinetics and comorbidity context; the long half-life means adverse effects can persist, renal clearance mandates dose reduction in severe impairment, and cardiovascular adverse reactions including both hypotension and hypertension could confound management in POTS patients whose orthostatic physiology is already labile, making the risk-benefit calculus unfavorable in the absence of efficacy data [^111UM7gG] [^111NXmjp] [^114EN8aF] [^113YMrVZ].

> Let me reconsider guideline consistency one more time and confirm there isn't a niche use such as rescue therapy; CCS explicitly discourages routine chronic IV saline and reserves intermittent bolus only as rescue in select cases, and across first- and second-line strategies there remains no role for memantine, further supporting that its use in POTS would be experimental at best and not standard care [^116rhUw9] [^112ghzRH] [^113cxBWU].

> Hold on, let's not overstate; memantine does have an established role in Alzheimer's disease with small effect sizes in cognition and global measures and a generally tolerable safety profile in that context, but none of that translates to POTS-specific benefits, and off-label extrapolation here lacks mechanistic backing and trial data to justify risk, so any consideration would require a research protocol with ethics oversight rather than routine clinical use [^1124KG8h] [^117CbGND] [^116jRiMH] [^1169LUES].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the recommendation clearly; memantine is not recommended for treatment of POTS given no supportive clinical evidence, no alignment with established pathophysiology, and potential to worsen orthostatic symptoms through adverse effects, and management should align with guideline-directed strategies including exercise training, volume and salt strategies, compression, and evidence-supported pharmacotherapies such as low-dose propranolol, midodrine, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, ivabradine, and central sympatholytics for hyperadrenergic subtypes, reserving intermittent IV saline as rescue when needed [^113cxBWU] [^1145XuDa] [^1153yfc8] [^112jwyou] [^112ghzRH].

> If a patient is already receiving memantine for a labeled dementia indication, I should confirm that continuation decisions be made on dementia-related endpoints and adverse effect surveillance, and I would explicitly avoid framing it as a POTS therapy; conversely, if memantine is being considered solely for POTS, I need to advise against off-label use outside of a controlled trial and pivot to optimizing guideline-based POTS care and comorbidity management, including careful review of other centrally acting agents that may worsen orthostatic symptoms [^111rkETR] [^113cxBWU] [^116vNVhR] [^111Gz6Ee].

Memantine is **not recommended for POTS** because there is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use in this condition [^113cxBWU] [^115ji8H7]. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist approved for Alzheimer's disease [^111rkETR], and its cardiovascular effects (including hypertension and dizziness) [^113YMrVZ] may worsen POTS symptoms [^114EN8aF]. Current POTS guidelines **do not mention memantine**; instead, they recommend beta-blockers, midodrine, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, and ivabradine, along with nonpharmacologic measures [^1153yfc8] [^113cxBWU] [^1145XuDa] [^114vZw6V]. Memantine should only be considered in POTS patients if there is a clear, evidence-based indication (such as moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease) [^117CbGND] [^1124KG8h], and patients should be monitored for adverse effects.

---

## Pharmacological properties of memantine

Memantine is a low- to moderate-affinity, uncompetitive **NMDA receptor antagonist** that blocks excessive glutamatergic activity while sparing normal neurotransmission. It is approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease [^111rkETR] and has been studied in other neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions.

---

## Clinical evidence for memantine in POTS

There are **no clinical studies** — randomized trials, observational studies, or case reports — evaluating memantine in POTS [^111k9wf7] [^115ji8H7]. Existing evidence is limited to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [^111b8PFc] [^116jRiMH], with no data on autonomic or cardiovascular effects in POTS.

---

## Potential mechanisms of action relevant to POTS

Although memantine's NMDA antagonism could theoretically modulate central autonomic pathways [^1147R6tW], there is no evidence that it improves autonomic function or orthostatic tolerance in POTS. Its known cardiovascular effects — including hypertension, dizziness, and syncope — **may exacerbate POTS symptoms**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) **do not mention memantine for POTS** [^1153yfc8] [^114vZw6V]. Recommended pharmacologic options include:

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol 10–20 mg QID to reduce standing heart rate and improve exercise capacity [^1153yfc8].
- **Midodrine**: 2.5–15 mg every 4 hours up to TID for symptom control [^1153yfc8].
- **Fludrocortisone**: 0.1–0.3 mg daily to expand plasma volume [^113cxBWU].
- **Pyridostigmine**: 30–60 mg TID to enhance cardiovagal tone [^113cxBWU].
- **Ivabradine**: 2.5–7.5 mg BID to reduce heart rate [^113cxBWU].

Nonpharmacologic measures include increased salt and fluid intake, **exercise training** [^1145XuDa], and **compression garments** [^1168Pari].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Memantine's safety profile includes cardiovascular and neurological adverse effects that **may worsen POTS symptoms**. Cardiovascular effects include **hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, syncope, bradycardia, and tachycardia**, and neurological effects include **confusion, headache, fatigue, somnolence, and hallucinations**. These risks are **particularly concerning in POTS**, where autonomic instability is central to the disorder.

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological treatments

Compared with guideline-supported therapies, memantine **lacks evidence for efficacy in POTS** [^115ji8H7] and carries potential risks. Beta-blockers, midodrine, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, and ivabradine have demonstrated benefits in symptom control and orthostatic tolerance, whereas memantine has not been studied in this context [^1153yfc8] [^113cxBWU].

---

## Current research and ongoing clinical trials

No ongoing clinical trials or research initiatives are **investigating memantine in POTS**. This absence underscores the lack of scientific rationale for its use in this condition.

---

## Clinical scenarios where memantine might be considered

Memantine should **only be considered** for patients with POTS when there is a **clear, evidence-based indication** (e.g. moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease) [^1169LUES]. In such cases, careful monitoring for adverse effects is essential given the potential to exacerbate autonomic symptoms.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Memantine is **not recommended for POTS** given the absence of clinical evidence and the potential for adverse cardiovascular and neurological effects. Clinicians should adhere to established guidelines and use evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies [^1153yfc8]. If memantine is prescribed for a separate, **clear, evidence-based indication**, patients with POTS should be closely monitored for adverse effects.

### Namendaxr [^113hQZ8o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms most often accompanying an overdosage with other formulations of memantine in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, include:

- **Neurological effects**: Agitation, confusion, coma, dizziness, lethargy, loss of consciousness, psychosis, restlessness, slowed movement, somnolence, stupor, unsteady gait, visual hallucinations, vertigo
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Bradycardia, ECG changes, increased blood pressure
- **Gastrointestinal and other symptoms**: Asthenia, vomiting, weakness

The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2 grams in a patient who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications. This patient experienced coma, diplopia, and agitation but subsequently recovered.

One patient participating in a NAMENDA XR clinical trial unintentionally took 112 mg of NAMENDA XR daily for 31 days and experienced an elevated serum uric acid, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low platelet count.

Fatal outcomes have very rarely been reported with memantine, and the relationship to memantine was unclear. Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. As in any cases of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized, and treatment should be symptomatic.

Elimination of memantine can be enhanced by acidification of urine.

Regarding the medical management of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, specifically concerning intravenous fluids, the CCS 2020 guidelines recommend not administering routine IV normal saline for chronic treatment in patients with POTS. This is due to the risks of complications such as infections and thrombosis related to central intravenous access, as well as the absence of supporting evidence.

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: Increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^114t5zQy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperventilation syndrome, also known as hypocapnic hyperpnea, produces POTS, a postural hyperventilation condition. Although previously considered a psychological disorder when it occurred without cardiac, respiratory, or well-defined central nervous system disorders, it has been recognized as a significant contributor to "effort syndrome" during World War I. This condition was effectively treated by CO2 mixture breathing or CO2 rebreathing.

- **Postural hyperventilation**: Previously reported only once before our work, postural hyperventilation was minimized in terms of physiological cause while psychological aspects were emphasized. Recent reports from both our laboratory and the Mayo autonomic group have revived the relationship of hyperventilation to orthostasis. These studies are contemporary with the definition of POTS. Recently, "hyperventilation syndrome", though not specifically "postural hyperventilation", has been included under "dysfunctional breathing", with variable success in treatment through breathing retraining.

- **Consequences of hyperventilation (hypocapnic hyperpnea)**: The primary effects of uncontrolled spontaneous hyperventilation stem from hypocapnia, which induces respiratory alkalosis. These effects largely resolve when CO2 levels normalize. Due to CO2's lipid solubility, alkalotic changes occur across cell membranes and the blood-brain barrier. Hypocapnia can cause tissue ischemia by reducing local oxygen supply and increasing oxygen demand.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: A clinical association [^1163XiKn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with mast cell activation (MCA) disorder may have symptoms suggestive of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, in these cases, one may anticipate that the clinical presentation will be characterized by a broader symptom profile than is typical with POTS. In particular, the presence of allergic reactions, gastrointestinal complaints, and to a lesser extent, skin disturbances should lead to considering MCA.

While no single laboratory finding provides an assured diagnostic marker, the presence of elevated prostaglandin (prostaglandin D2 and/or F2 alpha), especially in conjunction with an increased second marker such as histamine or less often tryptase, suggests that MCA disorder may be responsible for the POTS-like symptoms.

### Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome [^114LFZrj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of the most common forms of chronic orthostatic intolerance, affecting an estimated 500,000 Americans. It commonly affects women of child-bearing age and often results in significant functional disability. The hallmark of POTS is exaggerated orthostatic tachycardia in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Posture-related symptoms**: Mental clouding, blurred vision, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, tremulousness, chest discomfort, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea. The pathophysiology of POTS is unknown and likely heterogeneous, including partial autonomic neuropathy and hypovolemia, but many patients have elevated sympathetic tone and norepinephrine levels upon standing.

Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NET) inhibitor (NRI) that is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Although there are no prior clinical trials of NRI in POTS, drugs that inhibit NET are sometimes prescribed by physicians seeking a clinically beneficial peripheral vasoconstriction for POTS patients. NET inhibition has been shown to increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in normal volunteers and in patients being treated for ADHD. These effects could be potentially deleterious in the POTS population since they experience excessive tachycardia on standing. We hypothesized that because it potentiates noradrenergic pathways, atomoxetine would increase standing HR and worsen the symptom burden in patients with POTS.

### Complete remission with histamine blocker in a patient with intractable hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome secondary to long coronavirus disease syndrome [^113fVjW4]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) remains incompletely understood, although several theories have been suggested. It has been proposed that mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) may be present in hyperadrenergic POTS, as they share many symptoms and both have been found in postinfection viral syndromes.

Mast cells are myeloid-derived immune cells located in mucosal and connective tissues all over the body. They are capable of reacting to various stimuli, either endogenous or exogenous, because of the broad variety of receptors expressed on their surface. MCAS refers to the clinical entity characterized by recurrent mast cell activation, in which mast cell mediators are released more abundantly and more frequently.

MCAS can be established when: typical symptoms arising from recurrent, acute, multiorgan mast cell activation are documented; mast cell mediators are increased in serum or urine from baseline; and remission of symptoms with pharmacological blockage of mast cell activation, mast cell mediators, mediator production, or their effects is achieved.

A causative connection between them remained hidden. To our knowledge, this is the first case where post-coronavirus syndrome (PCC), POTS, and MCAS converge at the same time, which opens up room for further investigations to fully understand the association of these entities.

### Predictors of discontinuation, efficacy, and safety of memantine treatment for Alzheimer's disease: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of 18 randomized clinical trials involving 5004 patients [^116UwmHZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Another issue that further complicates the assessment of memantine's risk-benefit relationship is the variability of results between different clinical trials. While some studies show positive findings on cognitive symptoms and discontinuation rate, others find no differences from placebo. Between-study variability can be determined by means of meta-analysis, which allows for calculating the proportion of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. The presence of statistical heterogeneity reflects inconsistency, and this reduces the confidence in the meta-analysis findings and the strength of clinical recommendations derived from them.

- **Determining sources of variability**: Determining the sources of between-study variability enables clustering the studies in groups with more consistent results for which specific clinical recommendations should be made. Meta-regression can be used to determine the sources of between-study variability, which could be related to the following:
	- The study design, such as whether there is a lead-in period and the number of study sites
	- The intervention studied, for example, dose and length of treatment
	- Patient characteristics, for example, age and severity of the disease
	- Study sponsorship

Identifying these factors can help tailor treatment with memantine for patients with Alzheimer's disease and guide future research. Previous meta-analyses have analyzed the efficacy and safety of memantine for Alzheimer's disease; however, none have used all-cause discontinuation to assess the risk-benefit treatment relationship, nor have they investigated extensively.

### Memantine treatment in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease already receiving donepezil: a randomized controlled trial [^111b8PFc]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Memantine is a low- to moderate-affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of memantine monotherapy for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease (AD); however, no controlled trials of memantine in patients receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor have been performed.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy and safety of memantine versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe AD already receiving stable treatment with donepezil.

- **Design, Setting, and Participants**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 404 patients with moderate to severe AD and Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 5 to 14, who received stable doses of donepezil. The trial was conducted at 37 US sites between June 11, 2001, and June 3, 2002. A total of 322 patients (80%) completed the trial.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized to receive memantine (starting dose 5 mg/d, increased to 20 mg/d, n = 203) or placebo (n = 201) for 24 weeks.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Change from baseline on the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a measure of cognition, and on a modified 19-item AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL19). Secondary outcomes included a Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Behavioral Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients (BGP Care Dependency Subscale).

- **Results**: The change in total mean (SE) scores favored memantine versus placebo treatment for SIB (possible score range, 0–100), 0.9 (0.6).

### Complete remission with histamine blocker in a patient with intractable hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome secondary to long coronavirus disease syndrome [^116akZ1m]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a global public health concern, and its sequelae have barely started to outcrop. A significant percentage of patients who suffered from COVID-19 are prone to develop long-COVID or post-COVID condition (PCC), a multisystemic, heterogeneous, chronic disorder. Patients with PCC may experience diverse manifestations, with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms being among the most frequently reported. Indeed, dysautonomia presented as orthostatic intolerance has gained attention following recent reports linking postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with PCC. Disturbances in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) during postural changes are the cornerstones of orthostatic intolerance seen in patients suffering from PCC. A subtype of POTS, hyperadrenergic POTS, has been widely studied because of its association with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Although a causative relationship between PCC, hyperadrenergic POTS, and MCAS remains unrevealed, these syndromes can overlap. We propose here a correlation produced by a closed-loop mechanism with positive feedback established after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a previously healthy young patient.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder [^1147R6tW]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by an increase in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from a supine to standing position. Traditionally, it has been viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that POTS should also be considered a central nervous system (CNS) disorder based on several factors:

- **Symptom burden**: There is a significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS.
- **Neuroimaging differences**: Structural and functional differences have been found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance.
- **Cerebral hypoperfusion**: There is evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume.
- **Therapeutic response**: Patients show a positive response to medications targeting the CNS and to non-pharmacologic CNS therapies.

This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder could lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions for patients affected by this disabling syndrome.

### Canadian cardiovascular society position statement on postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and related disorders of chronic orthostatic intolerance [^113gbTQU]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the CCS 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following routine blood tests to identify secondary causes of orthostatic tachycardia:

- **CBC**: Complete blood count.
- **Serum electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chlorine.
- **Renal function tests**: Creatinine, urea.
- **TSH**: Thyroid-stimulating hormone.
- **Morning cortisol levels**: For adrenal function.
- **Ferritin**: To check iron stores.

### Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome [^116vNVhR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of chronic orthostatic intolerance accompanied by excessive orthostatic tachycardia. Patients with POTS commonly have comorbid conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, or fibromyalgia that are treated with medications that inhibit the norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NRI). NRI medications can increase sympathetic nervous system tone, which may increase heart rate (HR) and worsen symptoms in POTS patients. We sought to determine whether NRI with atomoxetine increases standing tachycardia or worsens the symptom burden in POTS patients.

- **Methods and results**: Patients with POTS (n = 27) underwent an acute drug trial of atomoxetine 40 mg and placebo on separate mornings in a randomized, crossover design. Blood pressure (BP), HR, and symptoms were assessed while seated and after standing prior to and hourly for 4 hours following study drug administration. Atomoxetine significantly increased standing HR compared with placebo (121 ± 17 beats per minute versus 105 ± 15 beats per minute; P = 0.001) in POTS patients, with a trend toward higher standing systolic BP (P = 0.072). Symptom scores worsened with atomoxetine compared to placebo (+4.2 au versus −3.5 au; P = 0.028) from baseline to 2 hours after study drug administration.

- **Conclusion**: Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with atomoxetine acutely increased standing HR and symptom burden in patients with POTS.

### Malmö POTS symptom score: Assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112KckAE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

We observed a strong positive correlation between the total Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS) and orthostatic heart rate at 3 minutes of head-up tilt in POTS patients, and during active standing for healthy controls. Likewise, there was a significant increase in total MAPS score across supine and orthostatic heart rate quartiles in POTS patients compared to controls.

- **Relationship between total Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS) and orthostatic heart rate**: Heart rate was measured at 3 minutes of standing using the head-up tilt test (HUT) for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and active standing for controls.

- **Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS) by heart rate quartiles**:
	- **Supine (panel a)**: HR was measured at 3 minutes of standing.
	- **Orthostatic (panel b)**: HR quartiles in the overall study population.

We found a significant correlation between all haemodynamic parameters — systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate — at 10 minutes of head-up tilt and symptoms in POTS compared to healthy controls in the univariate analysis (p < 0.001). After adjustment for age and sex, only palpitations remained significantly associated with all haemodynamic parameters in POTS patients (p < 0.001), whereas concentration difficulties were significantly associated with increased heart rate during head-up tilt in POTS patients (p < 0.05). Other cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular symptom categories did not demonstrate significant associations.

### Effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for treating dementia: Evidence review for a clinical practice guideline [^114J3b84]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic therapies for dementias in achieving clinically relevant improvements is unclear.

- **Purpose**: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and the neuropeptide-modifying agent memantine in achieving clinically relevant improvements, primarily in cognition, global function, behavior, and quality of life, for patients with dementia.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, AgeLine, and PsycINFO from January 1986 through November 2006.

- **Study selection**: English-language randomized, controlled trials were included in the review if they evaluated pharmacologic agents for adults with a diagnosis of dementia, did not use a crossover design, and had a quality score of at least 3 on the Jadad scale.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted on study characteristics and outcomes, including adverse events. Effect sizes were calculated, and data were combined when appropriate.

- **Data synthesis**: 96 publications representing 59 unique studies were eligible for this review. Both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine had consistent effects in the domains of cognition and global assessment, but summary estimates showed small effect sizes. Outcomes in the domains of behavior and quality of life were evaluated less frequently and showed less consistent effects. Most studies were of short duration (6 months), which limited their findings.

- **Open-label study**: The adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of patients in the 12–48 week open-label study to identify responders to enroll in Study B are listed in Table 3.

- **Randomized withdrawal study (Study B)**: In the randomized withdrawal study, the adverse reaction in patients randomized to placebo (n = 160) and reported in at least 5% of patients and twice that of the full-dose memantine treatment group (n = 157) was irritability (5.0% vs. 2.5%).

- **Juvenile animal study**: In a juvenile animal study, male and female juvenile rats were administered memantine (15, 30, and 45 mg/kg/day) starting on postnatal day (PND) 14 through PND 70. Body weights were reduced at 45 mg/kg/day. Delays in sexual maturation were noted in male and female rats at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Memantine induced neuronal lesions in several areas of the brain on PND 15 and 17 at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Behavioral toxicity, indicated by a decrease in the percent of auditory startle habituation, was noted for animals in the 45 mg/kg/day dose group. The 15 mg/kg/day dose was considered the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for this study.

### Excessive postural tachycardia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in youth: Associations with distress, impairment, health behaviors, and medication recommendations [^111cH9qd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Among adolescents with fatigue and postural dizziness, it is unclear how health behaviors and emotional distress relate to the presence of excessive postural tachycardia. We prospectively evaluated adolescents aged 13–22 years presenting with symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction between September 2017 and December 2018. Patients underwent standard 10-minute, 70-degree head-up tilt testing. Clinician diagnoses and recommendations were recorded from the medical record. Patients completed validated self-report measures of lifestyle factors, autonomic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and functional disability. Of 179 patients, 58 were diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and 59 had excessive postural tachycardia, with a 90.5% concordance between the two groups. The presence of excessive postural tachycardia was associated with greater baseline fluid intake and a higher likelihood of medication prescription in their treatment plan. Medication findings were replicated for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome diagnosis. The presence of excessive postural tachycardia or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome did not differentiate patients on perceived symptom severity, emotional distress, disability, or health behaviors but did appear to determine treatment recommendations.

### The dermatological manifestations of postural tachycardia syndrome: A review with illustrated cases [^114wz2M5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterized by excessive tachycardia when standing and symptom relief upon lying down. Several proposed subtypes exhibit unique pathophysiological mechanisms. Symptoms include excessive tachycardia, lightheadedness, blurry vision, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness, all associated with orthostatic intolerance. Additionally, co-morbid conditions such as chronic headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances, though linked with POTS, may not be directly attributed to orthostatic intolerance. Dermatological manifestations of POTS are diverse, ranging from livedo reticularis to Raynaud's phenomenon and from cutaneous flushing to erythromelalgia.

In this article, three illustrative cases of POTS with dermatological manifestations are presented. We explore the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these manifestations and discuss how these insights could guide management strategies.

### Predictors of discontinuation, efficacy, and safety of memantine treatment for Alzheimer's disease: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of 18 randomized clinical trials involving 5004 patients [^116jRiMH]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). High credibility.

The risk-benefit relationship of memantine treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. In addition, variability between the results of clinical trials has been observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk-benefit relationship of memantine treatment in patients with AD and to determine the predictor effect of patient, intervention, and study design-related covariates.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials was performed. Primary outcomes were all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to adverse events (AE), and efficacy on cognitive function. Odds ratio (OR) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Meta-regression was conducted to identify related covariates. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias of included trials.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies involving 5004 patients were included. No differences between memantine and placebo were found for all-cause treatment discontinuation (OR = 0.97 [0.82, 1.14]) and discontinuation due to AE (OR = 1.18 [0.91, 1.53]). Memantine showed a small improvement in cognitive function (SMD = 0.15 [0.08, 0.22]). Baseline functional ability was positively associated with all-cause treatment discontinuation and discontinuation due to AE.

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggests that memantine has a very small efficacy on AD symptomatology and its safety profile is similar to that of placebo. No evidence of treatment discontinuation improvement with memantine is found, indicating a dubious risk-benefit relationship.

### Splanchnic venous compression enhances the effects of ß-blockade in the treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome [^112yxddp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic condition characterized by a sustained and excessive increase in heart rate (HR) in the upright position accompanied by persistent symptoms in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. It is the most common form of orthostatic intolerance in young people, predominantly women, and can cause significant disability. Multiple studies have documented low health-related quality of life in patients with POTS, comparable to those seen in heart failure patients. It is important, therefore, to identify effective therapies that improve orthostatic tolerance and quality of life in these patients.

POTS is a heterogeneous condition associated with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. In some patients, the orthostatic tachycardia is thought to be caused by a primary sympathetic activation, whereas in others it is thought to be secondary to chronic hypovolemia, partial sympathetic denervation in lower limbs, cardiovascular deconditioning, mast cell activation, or autoimmunity. Regardless of the primary pathophysiologic mechanism, the upright posture induces gravitational pooling of blood in the veins of the lower body, particularly in the splanchnic vascular bed where most of the orthostatic venous pooling normally occurs, resulting in decreased venous return and stroke volume, unloading of baroreceptors, and compensatory sympathetic activation that ultimately triggers the orthostatic tachycardia.

Thus, compression of venous capacitance beds in the abdomen or lower body with compression garments h (Note: Incomplete sentence present.)

### Withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both, in people with dementia [^112vXXh6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterized by deterioration in memory, thinking, and behavior, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drugs — cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and memantine — are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalization, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life, and carer-related outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialized Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries, and grey literature sources.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholines.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to see the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management, as seen in the following list:

- **Potential causes of syncope**: A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Neurogenic OH (nOH), that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction, can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in primary care: Diagnosis, treatment and a case of African-American man presenting with POTS [^114dK2Na]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous autonomic disorder characterized by orthostatic intolerance and a rise in heart rate by at least 30 bpm or an absolute heart rate value of at least 120 bpm within 10 minutes of standing or during a tilt table test. Overwhelmingly, POTS affects young Caucasian women, which can lead physicians to miss the diagnosis in men or non-white patients. We describe the case of a 29-year-old African-American man who developed lightheadedness, generalized weakness, tachycardia, and palpitations and was subsequently diagnosed with POTS. We review its clinical features, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment options. We also emphasize that POTS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with typical clinical features, who may not be in the usual demographics of the disorder.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: A clinical association [^112yXaeM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, there has been increased interest in a possible association between mast cell activation (MCA) disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). This study examined the frequency with which symptoms and laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder occurred in patients diagnosed with POTS.

- **Methods and results**: Data were obtained from patients in whom symptoms and orthostatic testing were consistent with a POTS diagnosis. Individuals with less than four months of symptom duration, evident ongoing inflammatory disease, suspected volume depletion, or those who declined consent were excluded. All patients had typical POTS symptoms; however, some had additional nonorthostatic complaints not usually associated with POTS. The latter patients underwent additional testing for known MCA biochemical mediators, including prostaglandins, histamine, methylhistamine, and plasma tryptase.

	- The study comprised 69 patients who met the POTS diagnostic criteria. In 44 patients (44/69, 64%), additional nonorthostatic symptoms included migraine, allergic complaints, skin rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 44 patients, 29 (66%) exhibited at least one laboratory abnormality suggesting MCA disorder, and 11 out of these 29 patients had two or more such abnormalities. Elevated prostaglandins (n = 16) or plasma histamine markers (n = 23) were the most frequent findings. Thus, 42% (29/69) of patients initially diagnosed with POTS exhibited both additional symptoms and at least one elevated biochemical marker suggesting MCA disorder.

- **Conclusions**: Laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder were relatively common.

### Special issue: Abstracts of the 11th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, Helsinki, Finland [^115dN2er]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Multi-level spinal cord neuromodulation has shown effectiveness in treating postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS is a complex disorder characterized by invalidating symptoms such as tachycardia, presyncope, fatigue, and dyspnea occurring after assuming an upright position. It predominantly affects young women of childbearing age, with prevalence notably increasing after COVID. In severe cases, patients may become functionally disabled and experience serious dysautonomia symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues. Currently, no approved treatment exists, and management relies on lifestyle and diet changes, heart medications, and other supportive measures, which often do not effectively control the symptoms.

We are treating patients with severe POTS using a multi-level spinal cord stimulation (SCS) approach, employing a 4-port system and thoracic and cervical electrodes. Standard assessments for POTS are conducted pre- and post-SCS at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, focusing on pain (VAS), quality of life (SF-36), autonomic dysfunction (BASQ), and heart rate response to tilt (∆HR).

At the time of writing, two female subjects aged 28 have been successfully implanted. Several other patients are scheduled for implantation in the coming months. The first patient, with a 3-year illness progression, presented with cardinal symptoms including a heart rate response to tilt (∆HR) of 70 bpm, frequent fainting, dysautonomia with severe sensory deficits, and gastrointestinal and urogenital issues. Following SCS, the response to tilt normalized.

### Pharmacokinetics of pyridostigmine in a child with postural tachycardia syndrome [^116iu2Zb]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Pyridostigmine has been proposed for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in adults at a dose of 60 mg twice daily, but no dosing recommendation exists for children. With the approval of our local ethics board, we tested the pharmacokinetics of pyridostigmine in six children with myasthenia and a pediatric index patient with severe postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome whose condition failed all conventional therapy and who had developed significant postural hypertension.

Pyridostigmine was quantified using a validated, semiautomated, and specific high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay in combination with online column-switching extraction and turbo electrospray ionization. The patient with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome showed a dose-dependent favorable response to oral pyridostigmine. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed a short half-life of 2.29 hours, similar to the 2.0 ± 0.63 hours observed in the patients with myasthenia.

The patient with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome has subsequently been treated at a dose of 45 mg in the morning, 30 mg at lunchtime, and 15 mg at bedtime. After 9 months, there has been a persistent positive effect without the need for additional blood pressure medication. No major adverse effects occurred. Pyridostigmine has been a safe and effective treatment modality for this child with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. The short half-life suggests that dosing three times per day is preferable.

### Successful treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia and mast cell activation syndromes using naltrexone, immunoglobulin and antibiotic treatment [^115QRDPK]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) appeared to be effective for multiple manifestations of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), but this treatment is expensive and has potentially significant side effects. In contrast, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is inexpensive, safe, and appeared to provide effective adjunctive therapy in both mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and POTS. Recognition that small bowel dysfunction in POTS can lead to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is important since antibiotic treatment can lead to significant gastrointestinal relief.

- **Patient's perspective**: After decades of declining health, despite trying every conventional treatment with 100% compliance, I was pretty discouraged. I used to be such a high achiever, and now I couldn't even stand or sit up. I'd seen numerous top specialists and tried everything they recommended. I started seeing doctors for these complaints in 1997 and first received diagnoses of rosacea and restless leg syndrome (RLS). Rosacea was treated with antibiotics and numerous laser treatments. RLS was treated unsuccessfully with iron supplements and trials of various drugs (such as ropinirole, which made me pass out). My facial flushes got better, but other POTS/MCAS/RLS symptoms continued to get worse. Cardiologists didn't find anything but referred me to a neurologist for dizziness and presyncope. The neurologist thought I had Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) and referred me to the Mayo Clinic in 2006. They determined I did not have LEMS but did have 'excessive venous compliance' and prescribed compression stockings. After that, the original neurologist was out of ideas and suggested I get a psychiatric evaluation, which I declined. Still getting worse, I received a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroid in 20…

### Namendaxr [^111UM7gG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Memantine is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60–80 hours. Approximately 48% of the administered drug is excreted unchanged in the urine; the rest is converted primarily to three polar metabolites that possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. In total, 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH-dependent tubular reabsorption.

- **Specific populations**: Memantine pharmacokinetics are consistent across different demographics.

	- **Elderly**: The pharmacokinetics of memantine in young and elderly subjects are similar.

	- **Gender**: Following multiple dose administration of 20 mg of memantine hydrochloride daily, females had about 45% higher exposure than males. However, when adjusted for body weight, no significant gender difference in exposure was observed.

	- **Renal impairment**: Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following a single oral administration of 20 mg memantine hydrochloride in 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CLcr, > 50–80 mL/min), 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30–49 mL/min), 7 subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr 5–29 mL/min), and 8 healthy subjects (CLcr > 80 mL/min) matched as closely as possible by age, weight, and gender to the subjects with renal impairment. Mean AUC0-∞ increased by 4%, 60%, and 115% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.

### Case report: A unique presentation of memantine overdose causing echolalia and hypertension [^1143gd4w]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

In 2020, nearly 4 million prescriptions for memantine were written, making it the 152nd most prescribed medication in the United States at that time and an increasingly prescribed medication worldwide. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that prevents overactivation of the glutamate system while allowing physiologic activity. It also exhibits antagonist activity at the serotonergic and acetylcholine receptors and reaches a maximum concentration in the body between 3 and 8 hours, with an elimination half-life of between 60 and 100 hours. Its use has become widespread partly because unlike other NMDA receptor antagonists, it is reportedly well tolerated with few deleterious side effects. This has been reported to be due to differences in the timing of drug elimination, in transitions between blocked states of the receptor, and in the number of bound sites on NMDA receptors. Dizziness, confusion, and headaches are some of its most reported adverse effects.

Our case uniquely highlights two important adverse effects in a patient who overused memantine. One is hypertension, which is commonly managed and easy to overlook as a medication side effect. It presented as a hypertensive crisis in our patient. The other is echolalia, or meaningless repetitive speech. This is a sign usually seen in behavioral disorders or strokes, not medication overdose. To our knowledge, echolalia has not previously been published as an adverse effect of the regular or overdose of this medication.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Using an experimental medicine model to understand the antidepressant potential of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine [^115QE1RN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Memantine is a low-moderate affinity, non-competitive, open-channel NMDA receptor antagonist currently licensed for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Animal models suggested that memantine might have antidepressant properties, and this is supported by a successful open-label trial in depressed patients. However, a randomized controlled trial found no evidence that memantine was more effective than a placebo in treating depression.

A novel model of antidepressant drug action based on changes in behavioral measures of emotional processing in healthy volunteers has recently been proposed. This model suggests that antidepressants may work by reversing negative affective biases (i.e. the tendency to preferentially process and remember negative as opposed to positive information) in depression; such biases are believed to play a critical role in the maintenance of this disorder. Consistent with this, a number of studies have found reliable effects of conventional antidepressant treatment on these measures. For example, a single dose of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, reboxetine, increased positive affective memory recall and improved the recognition of happy facial expressions in healthy volunteers. In a similar manner, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram has been shown to result in an attentional bias to positive words and increased recognition of happy facial expressions.

Studies of this type suggest that antidepressant treatment results in changes in emotional processing in the absence of substantially different mood improvements.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurring during treatment for breast cancer [^115rt1ew]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common condition characterized by orthostatic intolerance in response to changes in position. We report a case of a middle-aged woman presenting with new onset POTS, likely due to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment. She was started on a trial of a beta blocker, which was effective in controlling her symptoms and heart rate. The objective of this report is to encourage clinicians to consider POTS as a differential diagnosis while managing patients with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is associated with elevated G-protein coupled receptor autoantibodies [^112t19aQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder affecting as many as 3 million people in the United States, predominantly young women of childbearing age, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. The syndrome was first described by Schondorf and Low in 1993, including a heterogeneous group of conditions/disorders previously reported in the literature with similar clinical physiological presentations. The disorder can be extremely debilitating, and the diagnosis requires the presence of chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with an increased heart rate of ≥ 30 beats per minute from the supine or sitting basal rate, or a rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute when standing or by an upright tilt test that occurs within 10 minutes.

An inability of the peripheral vasculature to maintain adequate resistance related to orthostatic stress is thought to lead to excessive pooling of blood in the more-dependent areas of the body. Yet, the variety of comorbidities identified in affected patients illustrates the potential for a variety of etiologies for the development of POTS. There have been numerous postulates to explain the mechanisms related to the etiology of POTS, with strong evidence that a predisposing viral infection, celiac disease, thyroiditis, and joint hypermobility may be triggers.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome may be classified as either a primary (or idiopathic) or secondary condition, and at the time of writing, the etiology of POTS is complex with no known specific basis.

### Treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with medication: A systematic review [^115ji8H7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review is to address the inconsistent and anecdotal-based pharmacologic treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition recognized for decades. The aim is to identify controlled studies to inform treatment decisions.

- **Method**: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a standard systematic review of English-language studies on medication treatment for POTS. The studies included had a comparison or control group and documented outcomes for at least one week of treatment.

- **Results**: Our search identified 626 studies, with 8 studies, involving 499 patients, meeting the criteria. However, due to differences among studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Among these, 2 studies were randomized controlled trials, and 4 underwent peer review. Some individual studies showed favorable effects with medications such as fludrocortisone, beta blockers, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

- **Conclusion**: There is a paucity of high-quality data on the effectiveness of medication for treating POTS. Nevertheless, 2 randomized trials and 6 other reports indicate some favorable effects of medication.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112XnN1z]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterized by the development of excessive tachycardia upon standing, while blood pressure remains stable. We report a case of POTS in a 20-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes who presented with a 3-week history of lethargy, fatigue, and orthostatic intolerance. Examination revealed a postural rise in heart rate of over 50 bpm with maintained blood pressure, accompanied by symptoms of light-headedness. Cardiac structure and function, as assessed by ECG and ECHO, were normal, as were thyroid and adrenal functions. POTS was confirmed with tilt table testing. Treatment was initiated with increased fluid intake, fludrocortisone, and bisoprolol, which led to an improvement. POTS is a disabling condition that can significantly limit a patient's activities and working capacity and should be considered in young, otherwise healthy patients who present with orthostatic intolerance and a postural rise in heart rate.

### Memantine treatment in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: results of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-month study [^115tRZLE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Memantine is a moderate affinity, uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 99679) conducted in Europe evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 20 mg/day memantine in patients with mild to moderate AD. Patients were randomised to either memantine or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.

Efficacy was primarily assessed as change from baseline in ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus score. Of 470 patients randomised and treated (memantine, n = 318; placebo, n = 152), 85% and 91% completed the study. Memantine-treated patients showed statistically significant improvement relative to placebo at weeks 12 and 18, and numerical superiority at week 24 on both efficacy scales. The lack of significance at week 24 was attributed to an unexpectedly high placebo response.

Memantine was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The data presented support the efficacy of memantine in mild to moderate AD.

### Acute hemodynamic effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in postural tachycardia syndrome: a randomized, crossover trial [^111Gz6Ee]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often prescribed to patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and act at synaptic terminals to increase monoamine neurotransmitters. We hypothesized that they increase blood pressure and attenuate reflex tachycardia, thereby improving symptoms. Acute hemodynamic profiles after SSRI administration in POTS patients have not previously been reported.

- **Methods**: Patients with POTS (n = 39; F = 37, 39 ± 9 years) underwent a randomized crossover trial with sertraline 50 mg and placebo. Heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure were measured with the patient seated and standing for 10 minutes prior to drug or placebo administration, and then hourly for 4 hours. The primary endpoint was standing heart rate at 4 hours.

- **Results**: At 4 hours, standing heart rate and systolic blood pressure were not significantly different between sertraline and placebo. Seated systolic (106 ± 12 mmHg vs. 101 ± 8 mmHg; p = 0.041), diastolic (72 ± 8 mmHg vs. 69 ± 8 mmHg; p = 0.022), and mean blood pressure (86 ± 9 mmHg vs. 81 ± 9 mmHg; p = 0.007) were significantly higher after sertraline administration than placebo. Symptoms at 4 hours were worse with sertraline than with placebo.

- **Conclusions**: Sertraline had a modest pressor effect in POTS patients, but this did not translate into a reduced heart rate or improved symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YRs2c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The role of currently available drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been controversial, with some national formularies restricting their use and health economists questioning whether the small clinical effects are economically worthwhile.

- **Objective**: To estimate the efficacy and safety of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine for the treatment of AD.

- **Methods**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, trials with random assignment to a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine were included in the pooled studies.

- **Results**: Cognitive effects were significant for all drugs, ranging from a -1.29 points mean difference (95% CI -2.30 to -0.28) in the 20 mg daily memantine trials to -3.20 points (95% CI -3.28 to -3.12) in the 32 mg daily galantamine group. Only memantine had no effect on the Clinicians' Global Impression of Change scale. No behavioral benefits were observed except for -2.72 (95% CI -4.92 to -0.52) in the 10 mg daily donepezil group and -1.72 (95% CI -3.12 to -0.33) for the 24 mg daily galantamine trial. Only 5 mg daily donepezil had no effect on the function outcome. Compared with placebo, more dropouts and adverse events occurred with the cholinesterase inhibitors, but not with memantine.

- **Conclusions**: Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are able to stabilize or slow decline in cognition, function, behavior, and global change.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia [^1152P19p]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Use of cholinesterase inhibitors to correct the cholinergic deficit in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, the treatment is only effective in about half of the patients for whom it is prescribed. Vascular dementia may respond, at least to some extent, to these drugs. In 2002, the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products recommended that memantine — a drug that acts on the glutamatergic system rather than the cholinergic system — be approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderately severe to severe AD. Clinical trials have shown some effectiveness of memantine in the treatment of vascular dementia, although it has not been approved for use in this disorder.

- **Recent developments**: The results of a study of the effects of memantine on moderate to severe AD have recently been published. Reisberg and colleagues treated their patients for 28 weeks, assessed several outcome variables, and found that memantine reduced clinical deterioration without significant adverse effects. This study is important as memantine is the only treatment licensed for patients with more advanced AD.

Several questions about the use of memantine as a treatment for AD remain to be answered. For instance, how beneficial is memantine treatment in routine clinical practice compared with clinical trials? What is the best way to assess treatment effects? How long do the beneficial effects last? Does memantine have additional properties contributing to its efficacy?

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^111NthAQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Until recently, it was largely under-recognized as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12–19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 minutes of standing from a supine position, in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs, or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management.
