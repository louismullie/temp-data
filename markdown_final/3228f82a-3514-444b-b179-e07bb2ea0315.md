## Question

give me the taper schedule in a bullet format

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a bullet-format taper schedule for benzodiazepines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that anchor safe tapering. Then, I should verify how to assess dependence and withdrawal risk to decide whether to taper and how fast. Next, I will examine medication-specific considerations, including switching to longer-acting agents. After that, I need to set the initial taper pace and dose-reduction cadence, and then plan for dynamic adjustments, including hyperbolic strategies and the "tail-end" problem. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety, adjunctive supports, and special populations, and close with a concise, clinically usable summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principles that govern benzodiazepine tapering, because if I get these wrong, everything downstream will be unsafe. The central tenets are gradual dose reduction rather than abrupt discontinuation, individualized pacing based on patient response, and shared decision-making with explicit risk–benefit reassessment at each step. No single taper schedule fits all patients, and the process is often nonlinear and may extend beyond a year in long-term users [^113vUkGX] [^116qxA3Y] [^1169JqwH].

> I need to check how to assess dependence and withdrawal risk before proposing any schedule, since this determines whether a taper is necessary and how conservative to be. Physical dependence can develop within weeks of daily or near-daily use, with higher risk at higher doses, longer duration, and with shorter half-life agents; dose categories in diazepam-equivalent terms help frame risk, but patient-level heterogeneity is substantial, so I should not over-rely on heuristics alone [^111HaPj4] [^112mN5d2] [^113XGstc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tapering everyone the same way. I should stratify by risk. For high-risk patients — those on high daily doses, long duration, short half-life agents like alprazolam, or with prior withdrawal — slower tapers with smaller initial reductions are prudent; for lower-risk patients — short-term, low-dose use — faster tapers or even brief tapers may be acceptable, but I should still monitor closely for emergent withdrawal or rebound symptoms [^113XGstc] [^115Zjn3Z] [^112mN5d2].

> Next, I should review medication-specific considerations, especially whether to switch to a longer-acting benzodiazepine before tapering. Switching to diazepam can smooth receptor occupancy and reduce interdose withdrawal; I need to calculate an equipotent dose and transition one dose at a time over 1–2 weeks, adjusting based on patient response, while remembering that not all patients require or tolerate a switch and that shared decision-making applies here too [^113GEiFa] [^115jvcSM] [^113hNeHb].

> I will now examine the initial taper pace and dose-reduction cadence, and I should double-check the evidence-based guardrails. A typical starting point is a 5–10% reduction of the total daily dose every 2–4 weeks, with a strong recommendation not to exceed 25% every 2 weeks; for the first reduction, starting at the lower end (about 5%) helps gauge tolerability, and for highly dependent patients, reductions as small as 5% every 6–8 weeks may be necessary [^111wCmGW] [^115jvcSM] [^117WZCH8].

> Wait, let me verify the "tail-end" problem and how to handle very low doses, because this is where many tapers fail. As doses approach the low single-digit milligram range, smaller and smaller reductions are often needed. Hyperbolic tapering, where each decrement is a percentage of the current dose rather than the starting dose, can maintain a more consistent impact on receptor occupancy and reduce withdrawal severity, and microtapering with liquid formulations or compounded doses can be invaluable when tablet splitting becomes imprecise [^115uFAWe] [^113pjFyt] [^114tJUcC].

> I should confirm the plan for dynamic adjustments during the taper, because rigidity increases dropout and relapse risk. If withdrawal or rebound symptoms emerge, I should pause or slow the taper, consider smaller decrements, and only in limited circumstances return to the prior dose temporarily; maintaining at a lower, safer dose is reasonable when further reductions are not tolerated, and I must avoid going backward whenever possible to preserve progress and receptor adaptation [^111XCZes] [^117Ro2fc] [^113ih89W].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety, and I need to ensure I am not missing high-risk scenarios. I should assess for withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction, monitor for post-acute symptoms for 2–4 weeks after discontinuation, and escalate to closer follow-up or inpatient care if severe withdrawal, seizure risk, or dangerous rebound emerges. In correctional settings or when outpatient safety is uncertain, converting to a long-acting agent and tapering no faster than about 25% per week is advised, with even slower pacing near the end [^1136Dxdr] [^113hNeHb].

> Let me consider adjunctive supports, because symptom mitigation and coping skills can make or break success. Cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene interventions, and peer support can improve tolerability and outcomes; evidence for pharmacologic adjuncts is mixed and low quality, so if used, they should be individualized and time-limited, with clear stop criteria and shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^113reQEH] [^113hNeHb].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases so I do not overgeneralize. Older adults are more sensitive and often require slower tapers; patients with hepatic impairment may need dose adjustments and longer intervals; those with substance use disorders may benefit from coordinated SUD treatment; and when initiating a taper without patient consent, I must document rationale, communicate clearly, and arrange close monitoring and second opinions as appropriate [^1113YBNz] [^1159qPYP] [^114LPDP9].

> But wait, what if the patient is on multiple benzodiazepines or has prescribers across systems; I need to ensure consolidation and coordination. Prior to tapering, I should convert all benzodiazepines to a single agent and equivalent dose when feasible, coordinate with other prescribers, and ideally assume management of all benzodiazepine prescriptions to avoid conflicting changes that could destabilize the taper [^117BBiTo] [^113GEiFa].

> Let me reconsider the overall timeline so expectations are realistic. Many patients, especially long-term users, will need months to more than a year to complete a taper; planning for pauses, dose holds around life events, and a nonlinear trajectory helps maintain engagement and safety, and I should explicitly counsel that slower is not failure — it is often the safest path to discontinuation [^1169JqwH] [^114tJUcC].

> In summary, I should confirm that the taper is individualized, starts low and goes slow with 5–10% reductions every 2–4 weeks, respects a ceiling of about 25% every 2 weeks, anticipates and plans for the tail-end with hyperbolic or microtaper strategies, adjusts dynamically based on symptoms, and is anchored in shared decision-making and vigilant monitoring. This approach minimizes withdrawal, reduces dropout, and aligns with contemporary guideline consensus and FDA labeling for specific agents like alprazolam [^111wCmGW] [^115uFAWe] [^1113YBNz] [^1159qPYP].

For benzodiazepine tapering, use a **5–10% reduction every 2–4 weeks** [^111wCmGW] as the initial pace, not exceeding 25% every 2 weeks [^113vUkGX]. Adjust to patient tolerance, and **slow the taper as doses decrease** [^113ih89W]; consider smaller reductions (e.g. 1 mg) or longer intervals near the end [^115uFAWe]. For high dependence risk, taper over 6–12 months or longer [^1169JqwH] [^113vUkGX]; for low risk, 4–8 weeks may suffice [^115hdkrZ]. If withdrawal occurs, pause or slow the taper [^117KZYfH]; consider switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine [^113GEiFa] and use adjunctive nonpharmacologic support [^113reQEH].

## General tapering principles

- **Individualization**: Tailor the taper to patient goals, needs, and response [^116qxA3Y] [^113vUkGX].
- **Gradual reduction**: Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent severe withdrawal [^1172otGa] [^116qxA3Y].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in setting the pace and adjusting the plan [^116V8uvF] [^112mw24q].
- **Monitoring**: Assess for withdrawal and symptom recurrence at each reduction [^115hdkrZ] [^116qxA3Y].

## Recommended tapering schedule

| **Phase** | **Reduction** | **Interval** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial | 5–10% of total daily dose | Every 2–4 weeks | - Adjust based on tolerance <br/> - Do not exceed 25% every 2 weeks [^111wCmGW] [^113vUkGX] |
| Middle | 5–10% of current dose | Every 2–4 weeks | Slow if withdrawal symptoms emerge [^113ih89W] [^117KZYfH] |
| Final | 1–2 mg or smaller decrements | Every 2–4 weeks or longer | - Hyperbolic taper <br/> - Microtapering <br/> - Compounded liquids [^115uFAWe] [^113pjFyt] [^112mw24q] |

## Factors influencing tapering pace

- **Duration of use**: Longer use requires slower tapers [^113XGstc] [^115hdkrZ].
- **Dose and half-life**: Higher doses and shorter half-lives (e.g. alprazolam) need slower tapers [^113XGstc] [^115hdkrZ].
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, insomnia, and psychiatric comorbidity may necessitate slower tapers [^113XGstc].
- **Prior withdrawal**: History of withdrawal suggests a slower pace [^113XGstc].

---

## Management of withdrawal symptoms

- **Pause or slow**: If significant withdrawal occurs, pause or reduce the pace [^117KZYfH] [^115hdkrZ].
- **Adjunctive support**: Use CBT, sleep hygiene, and peer support [^113reQEH] [^113hNeHb].
- **Medication switch**: Consider switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine (e.g. diazepam) [^113GEiFa] [^115hdkrZ].
- **Symptom control**: Treat specific symptoms (e.g. gabapentin for anxiety, melatonin for sleep) [^113reQEH] [^117KZYfH].

---

## Special considerations

Geriatric patients generally require **slower tapers** with smaller reductions [^notfound]. In pregnancy, **avoid abrupt discontinuation**; taper slowly with close monitoring. For patients with substance use disorders, coordinate with addiction specialists and consider inpatient tapering when appropriate [^114X59su] [^114A96qk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial pace**: 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; not more than 25% every 2 weeks [^111wCmGW] [^113vUkGX].
- **Adjust pace**: Slow as doses decrease and symptoms emerge [^113ih89W] [^115hdkrZ].
- **High dependence**: 6–12 months or longer [^1169JqwH] [^113hNeHb].
- **Low dependence**: 4–8 weeks may suffice [^notfound].
- **Withdrawal**: Pause, slow, or switch to longer-acting agent; add nonpharmacologic support [^117KZYfH] [^113GEiFa] [^113reQEH].

---

A benzodiazepine taper should be **slow and individualized**, with **5–10% reductions every 2–4 weeks** and slower pacing near the end; adjust based on tolerance, and use supportive measures to manage withdrawal [^111wCmGW] [^113ih89W] [^113vUkGX].

### Methadone at tapered doses for the management of opioid withdrawal [^1128dAHW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use in many countries of tapered methadone for detoxification from opiate dependence, the evidence of efficacy to prevent relapse and promote lifestyle change has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To determine whether tapered methadone is effective to manage withdrawal from opioids.

Search Strategy

We searched: the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2000), MEDLINE (OVID 1966–2000), EMBASE (1980–2000); scan of reference list of relevant articles; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry; Internet (NIDA, Clinical Trials.org, BMJ).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which focus on the use of tapered methadone (length of treatment max 30 days) versus all other pharmacological detoxification treatments, placebo and different modalities of methadone detoxification programs for the treatment of opiate withdrawal. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as benzodiazepine dependence were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer (LA) assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between reviewers. Qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies were carried out using validated checklists. Where possible analysis was carried out according to the "intention to treat" principles.

Main Results

20 studies were included in the review, with 1357 people randomised. 10 studies compared methadone with adrenergic agonists, 7 studies compared different modalities of methadone detoxification, 2 studies compared methadone with other opioid agonists, 1 study compared methadone with chlordiazepoxide one with placebo. The conclusions of the 10 studies that compared methadone with adrenergic agonists showed no substantial clinical difference of the two treatments in terms of retention in treatment, degree of discomfort and detoxification success rates. The conclusions of the 6 studies that compare different methadone reduction schedules, showed that different types of methadone withdrawal schedule produce different responses in terms of time course of withdrawal, the severity of withdrawal response and possibly in terms of subsequent engagement with treatment. Regarding the studies that compare methadone with other opioid agonists, in Sorensen 1982 methadyl acetate performed similarly to methadone on most process and outcome measures, while in Tennant 1975, methadone reduced severity of withdrawal and had fewer drop-outs than did a propoxyphene group. In Drummond 1989, using chlordiazepoxide vs methadone, the results suggest that the two drugs had similar results in terms of overall effectiveness. San 1992 compared methadone with placebo and found more severe withdrawal and more drop outs in the placebo group. The results indicate that tapered methadone and other medications used in the included studies are effective in the treatment of the heroin withdrawal syndrome, although symptoms experienced by subjects differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. It seems that regardless of which medication is selected for heroin detoxification, the rates of subsequent heroin abstinence are about equal. This suggests that the medications are similar in terms of overall effectiveness. Improvements were achieved when other services such as counseling and other supporting services were offered contemporaneously with detoxification.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to duration, design and treatment objectives, impairing the application of meta-analysis. Results of many outcomes could not be summarised because they were presented either in graphical form or provided only statistical tests and p-values. For most studies standard deviation for continuous variables were not provided. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medicaopioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. However this cannot be considered a goal for a detoxification as heroin dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder and the goal of detoxification should be to remove or reduce dependence on heroin in a controlled and human fashion and not a treatment for heroin dependence.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^111jbAdW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

This paper offers some pharmacological principles that may aid in withdrawing from antipsychotics. We anticipate that this regime might reduce relapse during and after discontinuation. At a minimum, it should be recognized that tapering periods of weeks down to minimum or half-minimum therapeutic doses of medication are likely to be inadequate to avoid withdrawal symptoms, including early relapse. In those who have received antipsychotics over prolonged periods, tapering regimes over months and years down to small portions of drug doses are more likely to be effective. The hypothesis put forward in this paper should be tested in further tapering trials of antipsychotics, including slower tapering down to lower final doses before complete cessation, including the use of depot preparations. Establishment of formal guidelines for tapering antipsychotics is required.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113ih89W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^112LBvns]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The new Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering published in this special issue can assist clinicians with overcoming the dilemmas and uncertainties that have hindered benzodiazepine tapering (when clinically appropriate to do so). This guideline was developed through a partnership of experts from 10 professional societies representing a broad spectrum of specialties that are commonly involved in prescribing or supporting tapering of benzodiazepines: family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, geriatrics, addiction medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatric pharmacy, and medical toxicology. The Guideline emphasizes the importance of a patient-centered process with shared decision making and the goal of maximizing benefits while minimizing harm to each person's health and well-being.

The Guideline recommends regular reassessment of each patient, considering both the risks and benefits of ongoing benzodiazepine therapy as well as those associated with benzodiazepine tapering. Tapering is recommended when the overall risks outweigh the benefits of continued benzodiazepine therapy for the individual. The Guideline also notes that clinicians should generally consider tapering of long-term benzodiazepines in older adults, unless there are compelling reasons for continuation. When benzodiazepine tapering is indicated, the Guideline emphasizes the importance of starting low and going slow (e.g. beginning with a 5–10% reduction in total daily dose every 2–4 weeks), monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal or other negative taper-associated effects following each dose reduction, and adjusting the tapering pace based on each patient's response (i.e. as tolerated by an individual patient).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112bXX8c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Tapering Rate

Evidence to support specific tapering rates is limited. The rate of tapering should be individualized based on the patient's clinical situation. When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g. anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used. Tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns. Longer durations of previous opioid therapy might require longer tapers. Evidence on optimal taper rate is emerging. Tapers of approximately 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers when patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g. ≥ 1 year). When patients have taken opioids for shorter durations (e.g. weeks to months rather than years), a decrease of 10% of the original dose per week or slower (until approximately 30% of the original dose is reached, followed by a weekly decrease of approximately 10% of the remaining dose) is less likely to trigger withdrawal and can be successful for some patients. For patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress. Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate. At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages to allow gradual accommodation to lower opioid dosages and development of new skills for nonopioid management of pain and emotional distress. Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with patients benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage. If the clinician and patient have determined that the goal is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached, the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.

European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases.

These guidelines were also the first to acknowledge that some patients are unable to take oral intake either due to an ileus or other medical co-morbidities. Given this, they recommended instilling vancomycin directly via enema. This was a foundational addition that was clinically relevant and remains in the current guidelines as well.

The novelty of this guideline continued by recommending a vancomycin taper or pulse as treatment of recurrent CDI. A 'taper' is defined as slowly decreasing the dose of the medication over an extended period of time and a 'pulse' involves giving a fixed dose on a schedule that skips days between medication administration. Theoretically, a taper will continue to suppress C. difficile from proliferating while the lower dose will minimize 'collateral' damage to the microbiota, allowing the microbiota to rejuvenate and minimizing the risk of recurrence. A pulse is believed to work by mimicking the life cycle of CDI and therefore minimizing the ability of the bacterium to proliferate. The most quoted study to validate a taper/pulse method was that by McFarland and colleagues, who took a cohort from another trial considering Saccharomyces boullardii to prevent recurrent CDI and assessed those patients who recurred who did not receive the S. boullardii and randomized them to receive either vancomycin 1 g per day for 7–14 days, vancomycin 2 g per day for 7–14 days, a taper of vancomycin, or a pulse of vancomycin. It turned out that those who received the high dose vancomycin recurred frequently, those who received the tapered dose recurred 31.0%, while those that received a pulse recurred 14.3%. Studies such as this supported adding these alternative treatment regimens to the guidelines. Within the 2009 European guideline, a vancomycin taper or pulse was reserved for those patients with two or more recurrences given a shortage of well-controlled trials to assess this regimen's efficacy.

### Butorphanol tartrate [^116BEATn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including butorphanol tartrate nasal spray) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on butorphanol tartrate nasal spray who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115jvcSM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering strategies — recommendations for the tapering process specify initial dose-reduction pacing, optional transition to longer-acting medication, individualized adjustments, and monitoring. Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114LPDP9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient safety during tapering without consent — communication, documentation, and monitoring steps include that when initiating a taper without a patient's consent, clinicians should carefully explain the reasons for their decision to the patient and their care partners, if applicable, and clinicians should also carefully document the rationale for initiating the taper and related discussions. Clinicians should then explain to patients that their next prescription will be at a lower dose and describe how they will monitor and manage patient symptoms and concerns during the tapering process, and the tapering process should be patient-centered. It is important for clinicians to closely monitor a patient's response to the taper and adjust the strategy as appropriate. Clinicians should be mindful of any potential bias when initiating a taper against a patient's wishes, and if clinicians and patients and their care partners continue to disagree on the need for a taper after this discussion, clinicians may consider referral for a second opinion. The CGC noted that some patients may become aggressive, threaten legal action, or suggest that progressing with the taper may lead them to suicide, and the CGC recommends that healthcare systems have established policies and procedures to guide clinicians in their response to these situations in ways that are responsive to a patient's needs and supports ready access to risk management services.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^111dxzGD]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There are little data to support a specific steroid tapering schedule. Based on consensus, once the patient responds, the steroids should be weaned to an average daily dose of 1 mg/kg per day over 8–12 weeks. Reducing to an alternate day dosing schedule, often increasing the first day's dose while decreasing the second day's dose, can accomplish this. The dose should then be further tapered slowly to find the minimal maintenance dose necessary to keep the hemoglobin in the range of 80–100 g/l, the target level being determined by the individual patient's requirement to sustain growth and activity. The recommended maximum maintenance dose is ≤ 1 mg/kg every other day or ≤ 0.5 mg/kg daily. Steroids should be tapered more slowly, and with great care, below this level to reduce the risk of overshooting the minimal effective dose for that individual. If this occurs, the dose should be immediately increased to the previous level at which the hemoglobin was within target range. The hemoglobin should be monitored closely during this phase because a too rapid taper often necessitates the reinstitution of the initial 2 mg/kg per day dose to re-achieve response. If an acceptable hemoglobin cannot be sustained at the recommended dose, steroids should be tapered and discontinued. Some patients require very small doses for continued response.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1127JFjt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper. However, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients. As a result, determining whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal is not always clear (see Table 3). Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. One of the most significant challenges the CGC faced in writing this Guideline was developing tapering recommendations that apply broadly in the context of this patient heterogeneity. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses.

The CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper, particularly given the heterogeneity in responses to BZD tapering. It is important to educate patients on what to do if they experience concerning symptoms and how to contact their clinicians, if necessary, before the next scheduled visit. This can help patients feel more confident and in control of a process that is often associated with some level of apprehension.

Prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers, if applicable, and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions that may be impacted by the taper. In addition, clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper (see Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents). A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112PpZce]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence for Prolonged Tapering

There is evidence to support the notion that longer tapering periods may lead to lower relapse rates compared with more rapid tapering periods. A meta-analysis of studies examining relapse comparing abrupt discontinuation with "gradual" discontinuation (average period of 4 weeks) found no significant benefits for this "gradual" discontinuation over abrupt cessation. However, 4 weeks is a brief period and a more recent meta-analysis finds an inverse dose response between the duration of discontinuation and the rate of relapse over the next year: abrupt stopping led to relapse in 77% of patients; stopping over 1–2 weeks to relapse in 57%; 3–10 weeks to 47%; and stopping over longer than 10 weeks led to a relapse rate of 31%.

Recent systematic reviews, have included 10 tapering studies (n = 1040) with maintenance arms in people with first-episode psychosis (FEP), with one further study looking at a group with longer-term illness(table 2). The discontinuation group showed more relapses than the maintenance group, in all but 3 studies examined. These 3 studies were distinguished by either the longer length of their tapering processor the longer length of their follow-up period, or both(however, this last study was not randomized, meaning selection bias is possible).

Table 2
Randomized controlled trials examining discontinuation (DS) groups vs maintained (MT) groups (n.s. = no significant difference; N/A = not available)

One of these studies was in people with FEP with a tapering period of 10–40 weeks and found no significant difference in relapse rates between withdrawn patients and patients who were maintained on antipsychotics. Tapering over months and years (by 25%–30% reductions of original dose every 3 months) also demonstrated no significant difference in relapse rates between patients who continued or discontinued antipsychotics.

The final dose of medication before complete cessation may also be a predictor of relapse because it might represent a large "step down" in dopaminergic (or other target) blockade (table 2). However, this is a difficult value to establish, with most authors reporting that they used either the smallest available tablet or half that value, or that this value was not recorded.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116qxA3Y]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — individualized plan, monitoring, and adjustment emphasize shared decision-making and flexible pacing: The CCG emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences, and the FDA advises: To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition. Tapering often does not proceed at the same pace over the entire process; rather, pacing should be flexibly adjusted based on patient response, and clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each dose reduction and counsel them to report any concerning symptoms. Clinicians should discuss this inherent uncertainty with patients so that, together, they can adjust planned tapering strategies as necessary, should help patients understand that these symptoms commonly reflect physical dependence, and should reassure patients that tapering strategies can be adjusted to address significant symptoms that may occur.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112mw24q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Some available guidance points to the availability of liquid formulations for some BZD medications (e.g. diazepam oral solution concentrate) and the use of compounding pharmacies for custom dosage tablets. However, these options come with a higher cost, and not all patients have access to them. In addition, measuring out liquid doses can be challenging for some patients. These strategies are discussed in detail in The Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines. See Appendix 7 for resources on managing challenging dosage reductions with available formulations.

Patients who have been taking lower doses of BZDs for shorter periods of time may desire or be able to taper from the medication more quickly than recommended in this Guideline. Clinicians can reasonably consider if a faster taper may be indicated or if a taper is necessary for patients whose presentation and history suggest a low risk of significant physical dependence and withdrawal.

Clinicians should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies. For example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first. See Appendix 3 for case descriptions and associated sample tapering strategies.

The CGC emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences. The FDA also underscored the importance of developing individualized tapering strategies in a 2020 Drug Safety Communication (2):

To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117BBiTo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112mN5d2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — heterogeneity and withdrawal risk indicates that although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper; however, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients, making it not always clear whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal. Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses, and the CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper. It can be helpful for clinicians and patients to discuss what to expect with the taper, how to manage withdrawal symptoms, and how to contact clinicians before the next scheduled visit to help patients feel more confident and in control.

### Opioid taper practices among clinicians [^116SoLjb]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This survey of 149 clinician respondents highlights the discomfort many providers have in tapering opioid therapy and the wide variability in both method and rationale for tapering. The findings bolster the authors' hypothesis that due to a lack of evidence-based recommendations for tapering opioids there would be a large amount of variability in prescriber identified expertise in tapering opioids. These findings are further supported by the multitude of variability in available literature regarding opioid tapers. Of the limited data and guidance available regarding safe and effective tapering of opioids, Pergolizzi et al suggest a patient specific approach emphasizing shared decision making and a 5–20% decrease in dose every 4 weeks. 10 The process can take months or years depending on how long a patient has been on opioids, their total daily dose and other various patient specific factors. While prior literature released by the CDC and Washington State Agency Medical Directors' Group advocate a reduction of 10% per week while, yet another guideline recommends decreasing total daily opioid dose by 20% per week if the patient is high risk.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1147bgZG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids. Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription. For example, if opioids are used continuously for > 3 days but for < 1 week, clinicians can consider reducing the daily dosage to 50% for 2 days to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing opioids. When patients have taken opioids continuously for ≥ 1 week but < 1 month, clinicians might consider a slower taper (e.g. reducing the daily dosage by approximately 20% every 2 days, a range consistent with tapering rates successfully used in studies of postoperative opioid prescribing). When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, opioid dosages needed during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict tapering needs to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

Recommendation 7

Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

### External validation of the medication taper complexity score for methadone tapers in children with opioid abstinence syndrome [^117KRZfd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone is commonly prescribed for children with opioid abstinence syndrome (OAS) as a taper schedule over several days to weeks. The Medication Taper Complexity Score (MTCS) was developed to evaluate outpatient methadone tapers.

Objective

To further validate the MTCS and determine if it is a reliable tool for clinicians to use to assess the complexity of methadone tapers for OAS.

Methods

An expert panel of pediatric clinical pharmacists was convened. Panel members were provided 9 methadone tapers (ie, "easy", "medium", and "difficult") to determine construct and face validity of the MTCS. The primary objective was to further establish reliability and construct/face validity of the MTCS. The secondary objective was to assess the reliability of the MTCS within and between tapers. Instrument reliability was assessed using a Pearson correlation coefficient; with 0.8 as the minimum acceptable coefficient. Construct (divergent) validity was assessed via a repeated-measures ANOVA analysis (Bonferroni post hoc analyses) of the mean scores provided by panel members.

Results

Six panel members were recruited from various geographical locations. Panel members had 18.3 ± 5.5 years of experience, with practice expertise in general pediatrics, hematology/oncology, and the pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit. The MTCS had a reliability coefficient of .9949. There was vivid discrimination between the easy, medium, and difficult tapers; p = 0.001. The panel recommended minor modifications to the MTCS.

Conclusions

The MTCS was found to be a reliable and valid tool. Overall, the panel felt that the MTCS was easy to use and had potential applications in both practice and research.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^113GRAVZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Whenever an opioid is prescribed, an exit strategy should always be considered and discussed with the patient. Opioid tapering may be undertaken owing to inadequate response or if the patient is suspected of using his opioid inappropriately. As noted in Canadian guidelines, tapering of an opioid may be accompanied by a reduction in pain and improvements in mood owing, perhaps, to the reduction or elimination of hyperalgesia and withdrawal symptoms; the alleviation of adverse effects, such as sedation or dysphoria; or the psychological interventions that may be implemented in conjunction with the decision to taper.US guidelines state that an opioid may be tapered using a schedule ranging from a 10% dose reduction each week to a 25%–50% dose reduction every few days. If possible, patients who abuse their opioid or otherwise have difficulty tapering on their own should be referred to a facility allowing for a structured, supervised approach.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111XCZes]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

### Current strategies for tapering psychiatric drugs: differing recommendations, impractical doses, and other barriers [^113pjFyt]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While effective ways to prevent withdrawal symptoms from psychiatric drugs remain unclear, a highly accepted clinical approach for treatment discontinuation is to gradually reduce doses over time. The objective of this review is to gather the current strategies for tapering of psychiatric drugs described in the literature and guidelines in an attempt to identify the most promising one. Literature review and search for practice guidelines provided by government agencies and medical organizations were performed. Different strategies for tapering were found: linear tapering, hyperbolic tapering (by exponential dose reduction and pre-established dose-response curves), extended dosing, and substitution for a long half-life drug. The use of guidelines offers support for patients and prescribers, increasing the likelihood of achieving effective drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization found among the guidelines makes any attempt to reduce or stop the drug very difficult for prescribers. Hyperbolic tapering by exponential dose reduction appears to be the most promising strategy for psychiatric drug discontinuation. Yet, we still face a constant challenge: how to safely obtain flexible doses for the discontinuation of drugs, particularly during the last steps in which lower doses are required. Further studies are needed to reduce the barriers associated with psychiatric drug discontinuation.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^112v3URL]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Dose Reduction

Because of the danger of withdrawal, abrupt discontinuation of treatment should be avoided (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.

In any case, reduction of dose must be undertaken under close supervision and must be gradual. If significant withdrawal symptoms develop, the previous dosing schedule should be reinstituted and, only after stabilization, should a less rapid schedule of discontinuation be attempted. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

Dosing in Special Populations

In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg, given two or three times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. The elderly may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If side effects occur at the recommended starting dose, the dose may be lowered.

Instructions to be Given to Patients for Use/Handling NIRAVAM®Tablets

Just prior to administration, with dry hands, remove the tablet from the bottle. Immediately place the NIRAVAM®tablet on top of the tongue where it will disintegrate, and be swallowed with saliva. Administration with liquid is not necessary.

Discard any cotton that was included in the bottle and reseal the bottle tightly to prevent introducing moisture that might cause the tablets to disintegrate.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal of benzodiazepines, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend to consider dose reductions of 5–10% when determining the initial pace of the benzodiazepine taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks.

### Scientific bases for precompetition tapering strategies [^116BuhDM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2003). Low credibility.

The taper is a progressive nonlinear reduction of the training load during a variable period of time, in an attempt to reduce the physiological and psychological stress of daily training and optimize sports performance. The aim of the taper should be to minimize accumulated fatigue without compromising adaptations. This is best achieved by maintaining training intensity, reducing the training volume (up to 60–90%) and slightly reducing training frequency (no more than 20%). The optimal duration of the taper ranges between 4 and more than 28 d. Progressive nonlinear tapers are more beneficial to performance than step tapers. Performance usually improves by about 3% (usual range 0.5–6.0%), due to positive changes in the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, hematological, hormonal, neuromuscular, and psychological status of the athletes.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113hNeHb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Sedative hypnotic use disorder — For patients in need of withdrawal management for benzodiazepines, we recommend gradually tapering benzodiazepines (Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The recommended clinical approach to benzodiazepine discontinuation is gradual dose tapering with consideration of patient symptoms and tolerability, and early stages typically use an early rapid step-down followed by a slower rate of reduction. Low-dose benzodiazepines can be tapered by 20% per week, whereas higher-dose withdrawal should be conducted over an 8 − 12 week period, and up to six months or longer may be necessary in exceptional cases; a commonly used slow strategy is weekly 25% dose reduction until 50% of the dose remains, followed by a one-eighth dose reduction every four to seven days. Slow tapering schedules are associated with total cessation in about two-thirds of patients. Abrupt discontinuation carries risks: seizures can occur and symptoms can include paranoid thoughts, hallucinations, and delirium. Providers may consider switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine, such as diazepam, using a conversion chart (Table B-3) to determine the equivalent dose, and management can be improved when extended tapering occurs in a structured clinical environment with close monitoring, optimized patient instruction/education, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients should be monitored throughout the tapering period.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^114tJUcC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^112TLUiD]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

3.4.2. Titration and taper phases

Titrating or tapering are issues specific to drug studies and potentially studies of devices such as neurostimulation. Titration and taper phases are expected to be more flexible in pragmatic trials than in efficacy-focused RCTs, especially if 2 drugs are compared (as opposed to comparing several titration schedules or dosages of the same drug) or if flexible titration or tapering is required by the research question. However, unknown variations in dosage may undermine the interpretability of the results of pragmatic trials, so that adherence should be monitored where possible.

3.4.3. Treatment duration

The duration of the treatment phase and often the length of follow-up are based on the characteristics of the pain, the treatment being evaluated, and the research question. Considerations are also intimately linked to how interventions are usually delivered in clinical practice, which outcomes measures are employed, and what patients expect from the intervention (considerations that likely benefit from patient involvement). In trials with people living with persistent or recurring pain, realistic interventions may range from intensive one-off treatment courses to continuous ("maintenance") care but with similar follow-up periods; or, it may be found that time to relief or time to discontinuation are meaningful outcome measure (discussed below, outcomes section), which would require trials with variable treatment phase length.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^1136Dxdr]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Sedative withdrawal recommendations — treatment should not be delayed based on the potential timeline for release, and patients who have been taking sedatives should be converted to an equivalent dose of long-acting benzodiazepine, with clonazepam described as having a long half-life, being well-tolerated and easy to administer, and as the preferred medication for treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal for most patients. Dose equivalencies for clonazepam will not hold for all patients and must be individualized according to the patient's response, and adequate dosing of clonazepam will control sedative withdrawal symptoms including increased heart rate, sweating, and hand tremor. Benzodiazepines should be tapered over a period of weeks or months with taper duration based on agent of choice, dose, frequency and duration of use, comorbid physical or mental health conditions, and treatment setting; in patients who are not hospitalized, the medication should not be tapered any more rapidly than 25 percent per week, and as the taper nears the end it may be necessary to taper more slowly if anxiety or insomnia develop, with these symptoms continuing for many months, and comorbid conditions should be monitored throughout withdrawal to inform the taper schedule. If withdrawal symptoms increase, medication dosage should be stabilized or even increased for a period of days, and signs and symptoms of sedative withdrawal may last beyond the period of acute withdrawal, may take months or years to resolve, and should be treated with evidence-based interventions. If the patient is experiencing both sedative and opioid withdrawal, provide methadone or buprenorphine to stabilize withdrawal from opioids before tapering the dose of the sedative, and if the patient has been using multiple sedative substances or a sedative and alcohol, withdrawal should be handled by using an equivalent or longer-acting agent than the longest-acting agent used by the patient.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

Sleep hygiene interventions may also help support successful tapering. Sleep hygiene refers to the sleep environment and behaviors around sleep — such as adopting a nightly routine, following a sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol near bedtime, and avoiding napping during the day — that are conducive to optimizing restorative sleep. Although sleep hygiene education is not a standalone treatment for primary insomnia, some evidence suggests it may help support the tapering process. For example, incorporating sleep hygiene education and psychosocial support during BZD tapering has been shown to lead to short-term reductions in BZD use as well as long-term discontinuation in older adults.

Peer specialist services are another resource that can support patients during BZD tapering. Peer specialists are individuals who have relevant lived experience with BZD tapering, mental health conditions, and/or SUD and are trained to provide services that promote recovery, foster resilience, and build on patients' strengths as they work through the BZD tapering process. Peer specialist services can be delivered one-on-one or in group settings, as well as in-person or virtually.

The most important considerations when considering adjunctive psychosocial interventions during tapering are an individual patient's treatment preferences, their response to the BZD tapering process, and their access to adjunctive services.

Adjunctive Pharmacological Interventions

Considerable disagreement exists in the literature on the utility of pharmacological interventions as an adjunct to BZD tapering. Existing clinical guidelines that endorse adjunctive medications do not offer clear guidance on implementation (e.g. dosing, duration). In a Cochrane review, Baandrup et al.were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of various medications in facilitating BZD discontinuation because the quality of the evidence was low or very low and with a high risk of bias. The systematic literature review for this CPG review yielded 28 RCTs on various adjunctive pharmacological interventions, including over-the-counter aids such as melatonin, to support BZD tapering (see Table 7 in Supplementary Material for methodology). The CGC considered the evidence for medications that are currently available in the USA.

### Dexamethasone (taperDex 12-day) [^111TBBG5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration: The initial dosage of dexamethasone varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached.

Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m² body surface area/day).

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

### Trends and rapidity of dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy, 2008–2017 [^117AxhQE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How often are patients who are prescribed long-term opioids undergoing tapering of their daily doses, and how often do patients undergo a rapid taper rate?

Findings

This cohort study found that, among 100 031 patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance who were using long-term opioids, the annual percentage undergoing tapering of their daily dosage increased from 10.5% in 2008 to 22.4% in 2017. Tapering was significantly more likely among women and patients with higher baseline opioid doses, and 18.8% of patents undergoing tapering had a maximum dose reduction rate exceeding 10% per week.

Meaning

A substantial percentage of patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy are undergoing tapering, often at rapid maximum rates.

Adjusting the Taper Strategy

Tapering often does not proceed at the same pace over the entire process; rather, pacing should be flexibly adjusted based on patient response. Although clinicians and patients can prepare for the BZD tapering process by setting realistic expectations around the potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms a given patient may be likely to experience, accurately predicting the extent and severity of symptoms that may manifest once tapering is underway is difficult. For this reason, clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each dose reduction and counsel them to report any concerning symptoms. Clinicians should discuss this inherent uncertainty with patients so that, together, they can adjust planned tapering strategies as necessary.

Some patients may interpret the emergence of symptoms as evidence that BZD medication is necessary to manage their underlying condition. Clinicians should help patients understand that these symptoms commonly reflect physical dependence. Chronic BZD use leads to changes in BZD receptor expression and response. As the BZD dose is reduced, the BZD receptors slowly adjust. Symptoms should resolve as the receptors return to homeostasis. Clinicians should reassure patients that tapering strategies can be adjusted to address significant symptoms that may occur.

Symptoms can also reflect the reduction in BZD-induced sedation. For example, patients who are taking high doses of BZDs may have increased sleep duration above their age-appropriate sleep needs. As the BZD is tapered, they may return to age-appropriate sleep needs. Patients may be concerned that this reduced sleep indicates insomnia, but it may instead be evidence of previous oversedation with the BZD.

In general, tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper. Adjustments could include slowing the pace of the taper, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing the taper. The CGC noted that clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose as this can undermine the goal of resetting BZD receptor levels in the brain. However, if patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms that are not addressed adequately by the above strategies, clinicians can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize and are able to continue with the taper.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^112xtceD]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) is associated with a risk of adverse events and comorbidities. As such, a goal in assessing the efficacy of biologics in severe asthma is often to monitor reduction in OCS usage. Importantly, however, OCS dose reductions must be conducted without loss of disease control.

Main Body

Herein, we describe the development of OCS-sparing study methodologies for biologic therapies in patients with asthma. In particular, we focus on four randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of varying sizes (key single-center study [n = 20], SIRIUS [n = 135], ZONDA [n = 220], VENTURE [n = 210]) and one open-label study (PONENTE [n = 598]), which assessed the effect of asthma biologics (mepolizumab, benralizumab or dupilumab) on OCS use using predefined OCS-tapering schedules. In particular, we discuss the evolution of study design elements in these studies, including patient eligibility criteria, the use of tailored OCS dose reduction schedules, monitoring of outcomes, the use of biomarkers and use of repetitive assessments of adrenal function during OCS tapering.

Conclusion

Taken together, these developments have improved OCS-sparing asthma studies in recent years and the lessons learned may help with optimization of further OCS-sparing studies, and potentially clinical practice in the future.

### Alprazolam [^1113YBNz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Alprazolam Tablets

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Reduce the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

2.4 Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients

In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prescribing characteristics associated with opioid overdose following buprenorphine taper [^116AsH7X]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among people receiving buprenorphine maintenance therapy and undergoing a taper, what prescribing characteristics are associated with opioid overdose?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5774 individuals undergoing a buprenorphine taper, a longer time to taper initiation (≥ 1 year vs < 1 year), a lower mean rate of taper (≤ 2 mg per month and > 2 to ≤ 4 mg per month vs > 4 mg per month), and a lower percentage of days during which the dose was decreasing (≤ 1.75% vs > 3.50% of taper days) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of opioid overdose. Taper duration was not significantly associated with overdose.

Meaning

Buprenorphine tapers undertaken after at least 1 year of therapy, those with a slower rate of taper, and a lower percentage of days during which the dose was decreasing were associated with a significantly lower risk of opioid overdose, regardless of taper duration.

2.3	Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of XANAX

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6	Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

XANAX should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and XANAX together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with XANAX. Increase the XANAX dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and XANAX together. It is not necessary to reduce XANAX dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days.

XANAX is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Tapering long-term opioid therapy… [^115HKX1G]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

RISK–BENEFIT CALCULATION The risk–benefit calculation helps determine whether the relative benefits of opioid therapy outweigh the risks and whether a dose decrease or full taper is indicated. 3 This calculation is not about any specific dose of opioids but about weighing the risks and benefits in a given patient and tapering to a place where benefits exceed risks, including the risks of a taper. VELOCITY MATTERS Velocity. The standard recommendation to decrease opioid doses by 5% to 10% of the starting dose every one to two weeks 8 is intolerable for many patients using long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Many patients need to decrease by less than 5% every month, with even smaller decrements toward the end of the taper. 9 Some patients require many months to wean off chronic opioid therapy, especially those who have taken opioids daily for decades. It may be helpful to keep the same dosing cadence, especially in the beginning of the taper. The brain is habituated to having the medication at set times. If the patient is on a regimen of taking doses two times or three times a day, keep that schedule during the taper for as long as possible. Patient involvement, and appropriate autonomy, is vital to success in tapering. If the patient takes several different opioids, let the patient decide which medication to taper first. Include the patient in the decision of how much to taper and when. Breaks in the taper are appropriate. Patients can maintain a given dose for some period before continuing. For example, if the patient has an important event scheduled and does not want to risk being in low-grade withdrawal, including subtle psychological symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, irritability, and dysphoria, it is reasonable to defer the next decrement in dose. It is imperative never to go backward during the taper.

Going back up on the dose risks losing the hard work already invested. Nonaddictive medications can help relieve symptoms of withdrawal. Regarding the patient in the case scenario, the physician could use the BRAVO protocol for broaching the subject of tapering his opioid prescription. The physician should be empathetic and address the risks and benefits of the taper. The physician could then provide a tapering plan, if warranted, and suggest alternate strategies for addressing pain.

### A trial of methadone tapering schedules in pediatric intensive care unit patients exposed to prolonged sedative infusions [^116CqKWf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of a low-dose methadone tapering schedule to a high-dose methadone tapering schedule in pediatric intensive care unit patients exposed to infusions of fentanyl, with or without infusions of midazolam, for ≥ 5 days.

Design

Prospective, double-blind, randomized trial.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care children's hospital.

Patients

Seventy-eight patients, 74 of whom had been receiving infusions of both fentanyl and midazolam, were randomized. Forty-one patients were randomized to the low-dose methadone group and 37 were randomized to the high-dose methadone group. Sixty patients successfully completed the trial, 34 were in the low-dose methadone group, and 26 were in the high-dose methadone group.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive methadone either at a starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/dose (low-dose methadone group) or at a starting dose based on both the patient's weight and the most recent fentanyl infusion rate (high-dose methadone group). In each group, methadone was administered every 6 hrs for the first 24 hrs and then every 12 hrs for the second 24 hrs. The methadone was then decreased to once daily and tapered off over the next 10 days. Patients were monitored for withdrawal symptoms using the Modified Narcotic Withdrawal Score.

Measurements and Main Results

The percentage of patients who successfully completed the 10-day methadone taper was the same in the low-dose methadone group as in the high-dose methadone group (56% vs. 62%; p = .79). Patients that failed to complete the assigned methadone taper had a greater total fentanyl dose and longer pediatric intensive care unit length of stay compared to patients who completed the assigned methadone taper.

Conclusions

Patients who received infusions of fentanyl for at least 5 days were just as likely to complete a low-dose methadone taper as a high-dose methadone taper. Because of the risks of both withdrawal and oversedation with any fixed methadone schedule, the methadone dose must be adjusted according to each patient's response.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^112bNzVM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

In the absence of direct data in humans of the time taken for dopamine D₂ receptor adaptations to resolve, we can be guided by observations that TD improves over 2–3 years, and this is the same time period over which relapse rates of patients discontinued from medication takes to converge with relapse rates of patients maintained on medication, suggesting that this may be a reasonable time period over which to taper patients who have received long-term antipsychotics.

There is some support for this time period for tapering in small studies examining tolerable rates of discontinuation. One study has investigated reducing antipsychotics in patients with remitted psychosis by 25% of the most recent dose every 6 months (a logarithmic pattern that closely approximates hyperbolic dose reductions), with 3 quarters of patients able to achieve between 25% and 71.4% dose reduction without relapse in the first year of the study. Another pilot study found that patients with chronic schizophrenia who, on average, achieved a 42% reduction in antipsychotic dose over 6 months demonstrated no difference in relapse rates from patients maintained on antipsychotics. This suggests that many patients may tolerate dose reductions of 25%–50% of the most recent dose (corresponding approximately to 5–10 percentage point decrements of D₂ occupancy) every 3–6 months. Smaller reductions (such as 10% of the most recent dose) made every month may be more tolerable in the aim of producing more "evenly spread" perturbation to the equilibrium.

There is likely to be considerable interindividual variability in this process, with patients able to tolerate greatly varying rates of reduction: given the data on time for TD to resolve, some long-term treated patients may need longer periods, and some first-episode patients or those treated for briefer periods may tolerate shorter tapering periods. However, we suggest that, even in quicker tapering protocols, tapering should follow a hyperbolic course to "evenly spread" change at receptors. If the reason for discontinuation is pressing, such as a severe adverse reaction, such schedules may need to be much quicker, acknowledging the increased risk of withdrawal symptoms. In patients with poor compliance, such prolonged tapers will be challenging, although a reduced adverse effect burden and the possibility of discontinuation may enhance engagement with the process.

### Antidepressant tapering is not routine but could Be [^1157bh4f]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When antidepressants are discontinued, severe withdrawal symptoms are possible. Some patients have few or no problems stopping, whereas others struggle. That struggle can be minimized or prevented with careful dose tapering. How often is that done?

Methods

Using 7years of medical records, we determined the percentage of patients who received a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant before it was discontinued, as an indicator of a deliberate taper.

Results

Over that period, 8.9% of patients had evidence of tapering. The percentage increased from 4.9% in 2014 to a plateau around 10% in the past 4 years.

Discussion

While reports of severe withdrawal are increasingly recognized and must be addressed, our data suggest that many patients can discontinue their antidepressants without a taper through the lowest dose. However, it is difficult to identify which patients will struggle without a careful taper. A "one-size-fits-all" taper approach is recommended, balancing the need for withdrawal prevention with the need to avoid unnecessary complexity for the majority of patients. The first decrement is key for all patients: it must go well. Thereafter many patients may accelerate but all should receive a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant.

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^114X59su]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

### Buprenorphine tapering schedule and illicit opioid use [^117Thgt7]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effects of a short or long taper schedule after buprenorphine stabilization on participant outcomes as measured by opioid-free urine tests at the end of each taper period.

Design

This multi-site study sponsored by Clinical Trials Network (CTN, a branch of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse) was conducted from 2003 to 2005 to compare two taper conditions (7 days and 28 days). Data were collected at weekly clinic visits to the end of the taper periods, and at 1-month and 3-month post-taper follow-up visits.

Setting

Eleven out-patient treatment programs in 10 US cities.

Intervention

Non-blinded dosing with Suboxone during the 1-month stabilization phase included 3 weeks of flexible dosing as determined appropriate by the study physicians. A fixed dose was required for the final week before beginning the taper phase.

Measurements

The percentage of participants in each taper group providing urine samples free of illicit opioids at the end of the taper and at follow-up.

Findings

At the end of the taper, 44% of the 7-day taper group (n = 255) provided opioid-free urine specimens compared to 30% of the 28-day taper group (n = 261; P = 0.0007). There were no differences at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups (7-day = 18% and 12%; 28-day = 18% and 13%, 1 month and 3 months, respectively).

Conclusion

For individuals terminating buprenorphine pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence, there appears to be no advantage in prolonging the duration of taper.

Benzodiazepine tapering versus abrupt discontinuation — comparative evidence and guidance: "If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued". In limited evidence, "the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation"; "Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias", and although labeled gradual "the taper duration was only 7–8 days". There was "no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion", but the taper group had "significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks". The CCG agreed that benefits of tapering are "likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies".

Table 3
Comfort Tapering at Specific Doses

In assessing provider approach to opioid tapering our survey found that 50% of respondents approach a taper for a long-acting or extended release (ER) opioid by reducing the dose of the ER opioid and using a short-acting product as needed. There were 47 respondents (32%) who would lower the dose of the ER opioid and not supply an immediate release product. Two respondents skipped this question. Providers were asked if they prescribe any pharmacological agents to blunt symptoms of withdrawal when tapering opioids. Approximately half, 74 (50%), responded that they do not while 57 (38.5%) responded that they use an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Of note, 1 respondent skipped this question.

The most commonly cited motivation for tapering opioids over the last year was the new CDC guidelines with 50% of respondents identifying that as one of the reasons they have tapered. The second most prevalent reason was patient misuse at 32%. Patient request and insurance regulations tied for third most commonly identified reason for tapering opioids with 29% of respondents citing each as one of the reasons they have tapered opioids in the last year (Figure 1). Of note, 4 respondents skipped this question.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^113FwTgp]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials

In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo-treated group were as follows:

From the studies cited, it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam (see WARNINGS).

To discontinue treatment in patients taking NIRAVAM®, the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of NIRAVAM®be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113XGstc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk factors for severe withdrawal and implications for taper pace — "The development of more severe BZD withdrawal symptoms is associated with use of BZDs with a shorter half-life and fewer active metabolites (e.g., alprazolam), daily use, higher total daily dose, longer duration of use, and history of severe withdrawal". Accordingly, "A slower initial pace of BZD tapering is likely to be safer and more effective for patients who have a high likelihood of physical dependence and significant risk of withdrawal", and "patients should be involved in determining the initial and ongoing tapering pace with clinicians, with the pace ideally agreed upon in a shared decision-making process". The guideline also notes that psychiatric comorbidity complicates tapering: "The presence of certain psychiatric symptoms has been associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms", with examples including "higher levels of anxiety" and personality disorder traits that "often experience considerable difficulty discontinuing BZDs".

Tapering Strategies

BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and are at risk of significant withdrawal symptoms (see Table 3). Most existing clinical guidance documents emphasize the importance of gradual dose reductions to discontinue BZD use in these patients. Clinicians can suggest a trial dose reduction for patients who are extremely reluctant or anxious about tapering rather than asking them to commit to a tapering plan. This approach may increase patients' motivation, self-efficacy, and willingness to continue with tapering. However, clinicians should clearly communicate any concerns for patients' safety with ongoing BZD use.

Several BZD tapering strategies have been described in the literature. Evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, with even more gradual reduction at lower doses when approaching discontinuation. Clinical trials that reduced doses at a faster pace tended to have high patient dropout rates. Schweizer et al.noted that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. Oude Voshaar et al.evaluated the same pace and found that nearly a quarter of participants dropped out. Guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. The CGC highlighted the importance of considering a patient's BZD dose, frequency, and duration of use when determining an approach to tapering.

Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies. A more rapid taper may be indicated for patients who have significant imminent safety risks associated with continued BZD use that will not be mitigated sufficiently with smaller dose reductions. If risks are not imminent, clinicians should consider patient preferences more heavily when developing tapering strategies and seek to minimize risks associated with tapering, including withdrawal symptoms.

Feasibility issues may influence the tapering strategy. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given BZD, reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging. Although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians can consider converting the prescription to lower strengths of the same medication as an initial step to facilitate the tapering process. The availability of a greater range of low-dose formulations for commonly prescribed BZDs would help facilitate BZD tapering.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114A96qk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key takeaways — tapering approach and setting: Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and care partners using shared decision‑making strategies, and clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms; physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients; although most patients can complete tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when significant risk cannot be safely managed as an outpatient; clinicians should design the taper to minimize harms, with an initial pace generally including dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks; a boxed caution also states BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly and dosage should be tapered gradually over time under clinical supervision.

### A prospective multi-centre, randomized study comparing the addition of tapering dexamethasone to other standard of care therapies for taxane-associated pain syndrome (TAPS) in breast cancer patients [^1172vGnj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Taxane-associated pain syndrome (TAPS) is common with docetaxel and is characterised by myalgias and arthralgias starting 2–3 days after treatment and can last for up to 7 days. Anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids can reduce TAPS. This multicentre, randomized trial evaluated the effect of additional tapering dexamethasone on TAPS.

Methods

130 breast cancer patients commencing docetaxel were randomized to dexamethasone premedication (8 mg/twice daily for 3 days) or dexamethasone premedication followed by tapering dexamethasone (4 mg/daily for 2 days followed by 2 mg/daily for 2 days). The primary endpoint was absolute change in FACT-Taxane questionnaire during the first chemotherapy cycle. Secondary endpoints: proportion of patients with clinically significant TAPS, QoL, pain and toxicity.

Results

110/130 patients had complete data included in the primary analysis. The fall in FACT-Taxane scores was lower in the experimental group on day 5 (p = 0.05), but not on day 7 (p = 0.21). There was no difference in FACT-Taxane scores over the entire study duration (p = 0.59). Fewer patients in the experimental arm reported TAPS on day 5 (30 vs. 47%). There was a borderline significant attenuation of impairment of QoL with experimental treatment on day 5 (p = 0.06), but not day 7 (p = 0.53). Tapered schedule was associated with more dyspepsia and insomnia.

Conclusion

A tapering schedule of dexamethasone was associated with a brief reduction in docetaxel-associated symptoms which was observed only during dexamethasone exposure and did not persist after discontinuation of the drug.

### Defining dosing pattern characteristics of successful tapers following methadone maintenance treatment: results from a population-based retrospective cohort study [^114xYcGh]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To identify dose-tapering strategies associated with sustained success following methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).

Design

Population-based retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Linked administrative medication dispensation data from British Columbia, Canada.

Participants

From 25 545 completed MMT episodes, 14 602 of which initiated a taper, 4183 individuals (accounting for 4917 MMT episodes) from 1996 to 2006 met study inclusion criteria.

Measurements

The primary outcome was sustained successful taper, defined as a daily dose ≤ 5 mg per day in the final week of the treatment episode and no treatment re-entry, opioid-related hospitalization or mortality within 18 months following episode completion.

Findings

The overall rate of sustained success was 13% among episodes meeting inclusion criteria (646 of 4917), 4.4% (646 of 14 602) among all episodes initiating a taper and 2.5% (646 of 25 545) among all completed episodes in the data set. The results of our multivariate logistic regression analyses suggested that longer tapers had substantially higher odds of success [12–52 weeks versus < 12 weeks: odds ratio (OR): 3.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.76–4.65; > 52 weeks versus < 12 weeks: OR: 6.68; 95% CI: 5.13–8.70], regardless of how early in the treatment episode the taper was initiated, and a more gradual, stepped tapering schedule, with dose decreases scheduled in only 25–50% of the weeks of the taper, provided the highest odds of sustained success (versus < 25%: OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.22–2.14).

Conclusions

The majority of patients attempting to taper from methadone maintenance treatment will not succeed. Success is enhanced by gradual dose reductions interspersed with periods of stabilization. These results can inform the development of a more refined guideline for future clinical practice.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1144gW8u]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine dosing regimens and front loading — Symptom-triggered treatment is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method, and fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper is appropriate if symptom-triggered treatment cannot be used. Front loading is recommended for patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 19), and diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading. A front loading regimen can be driven by a withdrawal symptom severity scale (e.g., 10 mg diazepam PO every hour if CIWA-Ar score ≥ 10) or according to a fixed schedule (e.g., 20 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses). When using a fixed-dose schedule, patients' signs and symptoms should still be monitored, and additional doses of medication provided as needed, and if prescribing a short-acting benzodiazepine, using a fixed-dose regimen with a gradual taper may be preferred to symptom-triggered dosing to minimize breakthrough and rebound signs and symptoms. While monitoring for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression is important for any dosing regimen, it is particularly important in patients receiving fixed-dose and front-loading regimens.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1129nofU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine regimens (doses in chlordiazepoxide equivalents) provide severity-based single doses, symptom-triggered dosing, fixed-dose tapers, and front-loading options. Mild withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised [CIWA-Ar] < 10) uses 25–50 mg by mouth (PO); moderate (CIWA-Ar 10–18) uses 50–100 mg PO; severe (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19) uses 75–100 mg PO. Symptom-triggered dosing is 25–100 mg PO every 4–6 hours (q4–6h) when CIWA-Ar ≥ 10 with additional doses as needed (PRN). A fixed-dose taper reduces the daily total by 25–50% per day over 3–5 days with PRN doses, using a schedule of Day 1: 25–100 mg PO q4–6h; Day 2: 25–100 mg PO q6–8h; Day 3: 25–100 mg PO q8–12h; Day 4: 25–100 mg PO at bedtime; and optional Day 5: 25 to 100 mg PO at bedtime. A front loading option includes symptom-triggered 50–100 mg PO q 1–2h until CIWA-Ar < 10 or fixed-dose 50–100 mg PO q1–2h for 3 doses.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^116xHLB8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: part 2 [^114PHMea]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To develop a much needed standardized concept of weaning dmards after reaching remission

Methods: A RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) consensus exercise undertaken through MIWGUC, involving pediatric rheumatologists (n = 10), pediatric uveitis specialists (n = 5) and patient representatives (n = 2), in January 2024. The RAM comprised: a rapid scoping review, presentation of review findings to attendees, open discussion to develop statements, and expert scoring of statements with a threshold of ≥ 80% agreement across the group to define consensus.

Results: The statements which reached scores indicating consensus were: use of a standardised tapering schedule should be limited to those patients without any significant structural ocular damage; 24 months of disease remission are needed before DMARD tapering can begin; the definition of remission is inactive disease off topical therapy; children undergoing tapering should be examined for uveitis every 3 months at least applying the proposed MIWGUC assessment protocoll. Statements on discontinuation schedules involving dosage tapering, dosing interval extension and/or simple stopping were also developed for each of the most commonly used therapeutic interventions for JIA-U and CAU:
methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy (interval extension from weekly to every 2 weeks then every 3 weeks or dose reduction from > 15 to < 10 mg/m²/week)
biologics (adalimumab, interval extension from x1/2 weeks to x1/5 weeks, infliximab, interval extension by 1–2 weeks and tocilizumab, interval extension by 1–2 weeks) monotherapy or
biologic in combination with MTX, with consensus on the biologic agent being stopped first when used in combination. There was an additional consensus statement on an overall discontinuation window of 18 months for biologic therapies.

Conclusion: We present consensus-based recommendations for standardized medication tapering approaches for children with JIA-uveitis and idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis. The standardization of care enabled by these recommendations should support future multi-centre observational research on long term outcomes following medication tapering, and on the predictors of long-term disease remission for affected children and for adults with childhood onset disease.

### Impact of dosing on treatment with TNF inhibitors: managing dose adjustment [^113gCTeE]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represented a significant advance in the treatment of this debilitating disease, and led to dramatic changes in overall treatment goals and guidelines. Despite these advances, best practice use of TNF inhibitors in the clinical setting still needs to be determined. In particular, although all TNF inhibitors have standard, recommended doses that were determined in clinical trials, dose adjustments are often necessary in clinical practice to optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. Dose escalation may be necessary in patients who experience disease flares, or because of insufficient initial efficacy or loss of efficacy over time, while dose tapering can be a response to adverse events, or if a patient achieves remission of disease. The amount of available evidence for managing dose adjustments for the currently available TNF inhibitors varies, and thus the strategies used with each are different. At present, although dose adjustments are common, data are insufficient for consensus guidelines to be recommended.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117WZCH8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — preparation, pacing, dependence-adjusted cadence, and monitoring — emphasize safety and individualized adjustments. Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper, and clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD. Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns, and for further reductions clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate. For patients likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g., those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper, whereas clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 10–25%) for patients unlikely to have significant physical dependence (e.g., lower dose for a shorter period [e.g., less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated. Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction and should monitor for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD; virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose. Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.

### The PRINTO evidence-based proposal for glucocorticoids tapering / discontinuation in new onset juvenile dermatomyositis patients [^111b9Rny]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Up to now, we cannot compare our results with other randomized trials on steroid tapering/discontinuation in new- onset JDM patients. The lack of alternative steroid protocols, provided by evidence-based trials, or standard consensus on glucocorticoid therapy for both intravenous and oral induction, does not allow further considerations about safety and efficacy of the proposed steroid tapering schedule neither comparison with a shorter steroid course, likely to be considered preferable. Since the purpose of the present work was not to provide recommendations on the use of glucocorticoids in JDM, but to propose a possible protocol for glucocorticoids tapering withdrawal in new-onset JDM patients, the proposed protocol may help the pediatric rheumatologist to deal at onset with such a challenging disease.

Another major point of discussion is the presence of around 50% of patients in Group 1 on PDN + MTX, which is the most effective treatment group in the PRINTO JDM trial. This could have induced an improvement in disease activity, not due to the proposed glucocorticoid tapering protocol, but to the combination therapy with MTX as also underlined by the logistic regression model. It should be noted, however, that one third of patients in the other two groups, received the same combination of PDN + MTX.

Another limit of the present work is the small comparative sample size and reference group. However this should be read in light of the rarity of the disease and the lack of prospective data on new onset JDM patients which makes our results noteworthy.

Finally, it is notable that a large percentage of patients (42%) failed to discontinue GC according to the proposed weaning schedule. If we consider that all the three groups of patients presented at baseline with the same demographic and clinical features (Table 1), except for a slightly increased disease duration in Group 3, and since MTX therapy is well-proven in efficacy in JDM patients, this should be read as a warning in considering MTX at the very beginning of the JDM patient history.

The lack of change in the CSM after 12 months in Group 1 and 2 in particular may raise the need of new trials testing two different strategies for steroid tapering with the main aim to shorten the on-therapy period. In fact, in order to either confirm our results or propose new treating strategies in new onset JDM patients, there is the new of new comparative studies in pediatrics.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115uFAWe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This Guideline uses two terms to describe an interruption to the planned taper: pausing and maintaining. When tapering is paused, the intent is for patients to remain at the current dose until their symptoms stabilize, and then continue with dose reductions. When patients are ready to resume tapering, clinicians may need to reassess the amount and pace of subsequent dose reductions more frequently. Maintaining refers to circumstances in which no current plan is in place to continue dose reductions; instead, patients are expected to continue taking BZDs at a lower dose (i.e. a partial taper). This may occur when the risks of continuing the taper outweigh the benefits of achieving a lower BZD dose or the benefits of taking the BZD medication now outweigh the risks for a given patient. The dose should be maintained at the reduced level achieved by the partial taper; dose increases should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, such as in response to severe withdrawal symptoms. The harms of BZDs are dose-dependent. In some cases, maintaining patients at a lower BZD dose may be sufficient to reduce their current risk of harm such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

Clinicians can use hyperbolic tapering for patients who experience withdrawal symptoms to reduce the likelihood of symptoms with each dose reduction. Hyperbolic tapering is a strategy of nonlinear sequential reduction of a substance, such that dose reductions are smaller and smaller over time. Each dose reduction is based on the previous dose, not on the dose at the start of the taper. For example, a patient who began a taper on 10 mg diazepam/day with plans for dose reductions of 10% would first reduce their dose to 9 mg/day, then to 8.1 mg/day, then to 7.2 mg/day, then to 6.5 mg/day, and so on. The theory behind hyperbolic tapering is to maintain a consistent impact of each dose reduction on receptor occupancy throughout the taper. As the hyperbolic taper progresses, clinicians can also slow the pace of the dose reductions to give the BZD receptors more time to adjust. Many patients may benefit from a slower taper as they approach the point of discontinuation. However, as discussed in "Tapering Strategies", limitations on available dosages may limit feasibility.

### A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine taper duration among opioid-dependent adolescents and young adults [^1112gEeA]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Few randomized controlled trials have evaluated buprenorphine treatment interventions for opioid-dependent youth. Consequently, optimal administration strategies for this cohort are unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the relative efficacy of two different buprenorphine taper lengths in promoting abstinence from illicit opioids and treatment retention among opioid-dependent youth.

Design

A double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Two hospital-based research clinics (Manhattan and Brooklyn) in New York City, USA from 2005 to 2010.

Participants

Volunteer sample of 53 primarily Caucasian participants between the ages of 16 and 24 (n = 11 under age 18) who met DSM-IV opioid dependence criteria.

Intervention

Participants were assigned randomly to either a 28-day buprenorphine taper (n = 28) or 56-day buprenorphine taper (n = 25) via a parallel-groups design during a 63-day period. Both groups received behavioral counseling and opioid abstinence incentives. Both taper conditions had a minimum of 1 week of placebo dosing at the end of the taper.

Measurements

The primary outcome was opioid abstinence measured as a percentage of scheduled urine toxicology tests documented to be negative for opioids. The secondary outcome was treatment retention, measured as number of days attended scheduled visits.

Findings

Intent-to-treat analyses revealed that participants who received a 56-day buprenorphine taper had a significantly higher percentage of opioid-negative scheduled urine tests compared with participants who received a 28-day buprenorphine taper [35 versus 17%, P = 0.039; Cohen's d = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.02, 1.13]. Participants who received a 56-day buprenorphine taper were retained in treatment significantly longer than participants who received a 28-day buprenorphine taper (37.5 versus 26.4 days, P = 0.027; Cohen's d = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.19). Daily attendance requirement was associated with decreased abstinence and shorter retention compared with a two to three times weekly attendance requirement, independent of taper duration. Follow-up data were insufficient to report.

Conclusion

Longer (56-day) buprenorphine taper produces better opioid abstinence and retention outcomes than shorter (28-day) buprenorphine taper for opioid-dependent youth.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^1126jfAu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for catatonia, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to taper benzodiazepines gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly. Decide on the speed of the taper depending on a balance of the therapeutic benefits and the risks of withdrawal effects against the possibility of dependence and the risks of long-term harm from benzodiazepines.

### Tapering of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: an overview for daily practice [^114jPjUm]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

In this Review, we discuss the possibility of drug tapering in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease activity, for glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We review international guidelines and recommendations, as well as remaining uncertainties, and provide an overview of the current literature. Three strategies of tapering are discussed: (1) tapering by discontinuation of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, (2) tapering by reducing the dose of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, and (3) tapering by dose reduction of monotherapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We discuss the outcomes and robustness of evidence of trials and observational cohorts, and we give a trajectory for further research and drug tapering in daily practice.

### Axial spondyloarthritis in the era of precision medicine [^117MoMJ5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

In axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the first treatment step is generally a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and if insufficient, a biologic is added. Currently, most evidence is available of the biologic tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. In patients who have achieved sustained low disease activity, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor tapering is considered, although standardized tapering schedules are lacking. In axSpA patients with extra-articular manifestations, the effect of axSpA treatment on these extra-articular manifestations is important to determine the preferred therapy. Overall, it is recommended that treatment of axSpA be individualized based on the most prominent symptoms and presence of extra-articular and peripheral symptoms.

### Optimizing treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis-a proof of principle and exploratory trial: is dose tapering practical in good responders? [^112SUtVU]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Design

OPTTIRA was an open label, 6-month multicentre proof of principle trial with a subsequent 6-month exploratory phase for patients who completed the initial trial. OPTTIRA enrolled RA patients achieving good responses with low disease activity or remission taking standard TNFi doses and receiving one or more DMARDs.

Participants

Patients receiving TNFi had met existing English criteria from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for these agents. The criteria have changed with time; they included failing to respond to MTX and another DMARD. These criteria meant all patients had established RA. Patients had also achieved sustained good responses with DAS28 scores of ≤ 3.2 without increases of > 0.6 during the previous 3 months.

Interventions

Patients were taking etanercept or adalimumab; their existing TNFi were the trial investigational medicinal products.

The proof of principle trial (months 0–6) compared three groups: experimental group 1: TNF inhibitor tapered by 33% initial dose; experimental group 2: TNF inhibitor tapered by 66% initial dose; control group: continued standard doses. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, available at Rheumatology Online, show reducing etanercept and adalimumab dosing schedules.

In the exploratory phase (months 7–12) patients in experimental groups increased times between injections until they stopped. Patients in the control group were further randomized into two groups: control group A had TNFi tapered by 33% initial dose; control group B had TNFi tapered by 66% initial dose. Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at Rheumatology Online, show the dosing schedules. The tapering schedules reflected standard dosing regimens related to the half-lives of the drugs.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was time to first flare, defined as an increase in DAS28 scores ⩾0.6 resulting in a DAS28 > 3.2 together with an increase in the swollen joint count; both had to be present on two occasions at least 1 week apart. An increase in DAS28 score ⩾1.2 resulting in DAS28 > 3.2 was defined as flare irrespective of changes in swollen joints. These criteria reflect the subsequently developed DAS28 flare definitions proposed by OMERACT and supported by the Cochrane group. Patients were assessed 3 monthly and telephoned by their Research Nurse monthly to check their disease control. Patients who considered they were experiencing a flare were seen urgently (within 2 weeks).

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115Zjn3Z]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — short-duration use and short-taper option: Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper, and a short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116V8uvF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

Methods

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and clinical consensus process. The process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

Recommendations

Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk-benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering, clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients, clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal, clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response, and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.
