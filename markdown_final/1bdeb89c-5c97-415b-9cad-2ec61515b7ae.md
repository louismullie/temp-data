## Question

What laboratory test results are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory test results are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia and how to interpret them stepwise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core complete blood count pattern that signals microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Then, I should verify confirmatory iron studies, especially ferritin and transferrin saturation, and account for inflammation. Next, I will review advanced and functional markers like soluble transferrin receptor and reticulocyte hemoglobin. After that, I need to consider the diagnostic role of a therapeutic iron trial. Finally, I will differentiate IDA from look-alikes such as thalassemia trait and anemia of chronic disease, summarize practical diagnostic thresholds, and note special-population nuances including IBD, CKD, cancer, and preoperative settings.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic signature on the CBC to anchor the diagnosis. IDA typically presents as a microcytic, hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin below the laboratory lower limit of normal aligned to WHO thresholds, classically with MCV less than 80 fL and reduced MCH, plus a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count indicating underproduction rather than hemolysis or acute loss, and a smear showing microcytosis, hypochromia, and poikilocytes such as elliptocytes, target forms, and pencil cells, with RDW often increased early in the course signaling anisocytosis before MCV falls markedly [^1149wkcb] [^111sFJG3] [^113YLrwi] [^113BLgw2]. Wait, let me verify one nuance about indices: MCH is generally a more reliable microcytic marker than MCV across platforms, though both lose sensitivity in the presence of chronic disease or hemoglobinopathy, and while MCHC may be reduced in IDA, it is less dependable for case-finding than MCV/MCH and RDW in routine practice, so I need to weigh it cautiously alongside the smear and iron studies rather than overinterpreting it in isolation [^116Ln8KB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without confirmatory iron studies. Serum ferritin is the single most useful test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation, where levels below about 15–30 µg/L are highly specific for depleted stores, but because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, I should confirm that in inflammatory states a ferritin less than 100 µg/L together with transferrin saturation under 20 percent is more consistent with iron deficiency, whereas a normal or elevated ferritin does not exclude IDA if CRP is high or chronic disease is present, prompting me to check TSAT and related indices and not rely on ferritin alone [^114N2wZa] [^114CUyEC] [^1157g8j4] [^111o9XK7] [^112L9fB4] [^112MALUZ]. Let me also think about the classic iron panel pattern: serum iron tends to be low and TIBC/transferrin elevated in IDA, while in anemia of chronic disease both serum iron and TIBC are often low or normal-low with restricted iron availability despite adequate or elevated ferritin, so I should integrate these patterns with the clinical context and CRP [^114CUyEC] [^112MALUZ] [^111sFJG3].

> Next, I should review functional markers that help when inflammation or mixed etiologies blur the picture. I need to check whether soluble transferrin receptor is elevated, since sTfR rises with cellular iron demand and is relatively independent of inflammation, and whether the sTfR/log ferritin index exceeds about 1.03 (mg/L scale) or 14 (nmol/L scale), which significantly increases the likelihood of IDA over isolated anemia of chronic disease, especially in mixed patterns where ferritin can be equivocal [^111W7LCz] [^114N3Uxa]. Let me also consider reticulocyte hemoglobin content as a near-real-time gauge of iron available for erythropoiesis; values under roughly 26–29 pg support iron-restricted erythropoiesis and predict response to IV iron in CKD and inflammatory states, and a high percentage of hypochromic red cells similarly signals impaired hemoglobinization, so these indices add confidence when standard markers conflict with the clinical picture [^112s7Cr6] [^112KFCtq] [^112rkjre] [^116RmEyQ].

> I should confirm the role of a diagnostic iron trial when baseline data are ambiguous. A hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about two weeks of starting iron replacement therapy is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency even if initial ferritin or TSAT were borderline or confounded by inflammation, so an early on-treatment check becomes a practical diagnostic tool and a safeguard against overinvestigation when the pretest probability is high [^1149wkcb]. But wait, I need to remember to re-evaluate if there is no early hemoglobin increment, because nonresponse can indicate poor adherence, malabsorption, ongoing bleeding, alternate or additional etiologies such as B12/folate deficiency, hemolysis, bone marrow disease, or anemia of inflammation, and in such cases further iron indices and targeted evaluation are warranted rather than persisting with the same oral regimen [^114wkrGu] [^1149wkcb].

> Now, I will examine the key differentials so I do not mislabel microcytosis. Thalassemia trait can mirror the microcytosis of IDA but typically shows a disproportionately low MCV for the degree of anemia, normal iron stores, and often a normal RDW, so in at-risk ancestries I should obtain hemoglobin electrophoresis to prevent unnecessary gastrointestinal workup and avoid mistaking trait for iron deficiency [^111Woecy] [^116Ln8KB]. I need to check for anemia of chronic disease, which is usually normocytic but can be microcytic and is characterized by ferritin often above 100 µg/L with TSAT below 20 percent in the presence of inflammation due to hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration, and to remember that mixed IDA plus anemia of inflammation is common and requires a composite interpretation of ferritin, TSAT, CRP, sTfR, and reticulocyte indices rather than any single test in isolation [^1162718v] [^111o9XK7] [^112MALUZ]. Let me also consider rarer microcytic mimics such as sideroblastic anemia, where ferritin is elevated and iron overload features may appear, which should prompt a different diagnostic pathway if the iron panel contradicts IDA physiology [^111sFJG3].

> Let me summarize practical diagnostic thresholds so I can double-check internal consistency. Anemia should be defined relative to the laboratory lower limit of normal aligned to WHO cut points, with a microcytic pattern typically showing MCV less than 80 fL, reduced MCH, and increased RDW, while absolute iron deficiency is best confirmed by ferritin under about 15–30 µg/L in the absence of inflammation and by ferritin under 100 µg/L with TSAT under 20 percent when inflammation is present, with serum iron low and TIBC high in straightforward IDA and not in anemia of inflammation where TIBC tends to be low or normal [^1149wkcb] [^114N2wZa] [^114CUyEC] [^111o9XK7] [^112L9fB4]. I should verify functional restriction with reticulocyte hemoglobin under roughly 26–29 pg and consider elevated sTfR and a high sTfR/log ferritin index over 1.03 or 14 according to assay units when classical markers are equivocal, particularly in CKD or inflammatory settings where these functional markers outperform ferritin alone for decision-making [^112s7Cr6] [^112rkjre] [^114N3Uxa] [^111W7LCz].

> Next, I should review special situations where thresholds and surveillance differ so I do not misclassify patients. In IBD, I need to consider ferritin below 30 µg/L without active disease and below 100 µg/L with biochemical or clinical inflammation as consistent with iron deficiency, and I should incorporate periodic screening with CBC, ferritin, TSAT, and CRP at intervals based on disease activity because mixed anemia and treatment effects are common [^114934vw] [^112L9fB4] [^114Acp5z]. In CKD and ESA-treated states, reticulocyte hemoglobin under about 29 pg predicts functional iron deficiency and responsiveness to IV iron, with ferritin and TSAT interpreted alongside percentages of hypochromic red cells to guide therapy and avoid overload, so I need to check these longitudinally rather than relying on a single value [^112s7Cr6] [^112KFCtq] [^116RmEyQ]. For patients with cancer on chemotherapy, absolute deficiency is often set at ferritin under 100 ng/mL with anemia, supporting IV iron strategies in appropriate scenarios, whereas in preoperative pathways and in women of reproductive age, modest ferritin ranges of 30–100 µg/L with TSAT under 20 percent can signal clinically relevant iron depletion where intervention improves outcomes, and I should be cautious that conventional ferritin reference ranges may under-recognize deficiency in women, necessitating clinical judgment and, when needed, a therapeutic trial to confirm [^111ebA3J] [^114stzej] [^115PFf6Y].

> Putting this all together, I should ensure that the characteristic laboratory pattern of IDA combines a microcytic, hypochromic CBC with increased RDW and a low reticulocyte response, plus objective evidence of depleted stores and restricted availability on iron studies, specifically low ferritin or ferritin under 100 µg/L with low TSAT in inflammatory states, supplemented by functional indices such as low reticulocyte hemoglobin and elevated sTfR or sTfR/log ferritin index when chronic disease or mixed etiologies cloud interpretation, with a rapid hemoglobin rise after iron therapy serving as a pragmatic diagnostic confirmation when initial tests are inconclusive [^1149wkcb] [^114N2wZa] [^111o9XK7] [^112s7Cr6] [^114N3Uxa]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across data points and context before finalizing the diagnosis, because discordant values often indicate a mixed picture or assay interference, and a methodical, reference-based approach prevents misclassification and ensures the right patients receive iron repletion and the right patients undergo etiologic evaluation for blood loss or malabsorption [^111sFJG3] [^113dWhbk] [^116yjMTt].

Iron deficiency anemia is defined by hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory, with confirmation by iron studies [^1149wkcb]. The hallmark lab pattern is **microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low ferritin and low transferrin saturation** [^111sFJG3].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and red cell indices

- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**: Decreased, below the lower limit of normal for age, sex, and laboratory [^116SeqRE].
- **Hematocrit (Hct)**: Decreased, reflecting reduced red cell mass [^111sFJG3].
- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Decreased (microcytic anemia), typically < 80 fL in adults [^116SeqRE].
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)**: Decreased (hypochromic anemia) [^113YLrwi].
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)**: Decreased [^113YLrwi].
- **Red cell distribution width (RDW)**: Increased, indicating anisocytosis (variation in red cell size) [^113BLgw2].
- **Reticulocyte count**: Low or inappropriately normal, reflecting inadequate marrow response [^115TJZBu].
- **Platelet count**: Often normal or mildly elevated (reactive thrombocytosis) [^115TJZBu].

---

## Iron studies

- **Serum ferritin**: Decreased; ferritin is the most specific marker of iron deficiency. Levels < 15 µg/L indicate absent iron stores; < 30 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency [^116SeqRE].
- **Serum iron**: Decreased, reflecting reduced circulating iron [^115LH3LE].
- **Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)**: Increased, reflecting increased transferrin production [^111sFJG3].
- **Transferrin saturation**: Decreased, typically < 15% [^116SeqRE] [^115WFgXM].
- **Serum transferrin**: Increased, reflecting increased iron-binding capacity [^112MALUZ].

---

## Additional laboratory markers

Increased **soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)** reflects increased cellular iron demand [^111W7LCz], while reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) is decreased, indicating reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis [^112rkjre]. Zinc protoporphyrin is increased, reflecting impaired heme synthesis [^116Ln8KB].

---

## Peripheral blood smear findings

- **Microcytosis**: Small red blood cells [^111sFJG3].
- **Hypochromia**: Pale red blood cells due to reduced hemoglobin content [^113YLrwi].
- **Anisocytosis**: Variation in red cell size [^114CUyEC].
- **Poikilocytosis**: Variation in red cell shape, including elliptocytes and target cells [^115LH3LE].

---

## Bone marrow findings (rarely required)

Bone marrow assessment is rarely required; when performed, it shows **absent or markedly reduced iron stores**, confirmed by Prussian blue staining [^111sFJG3].

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought.

- **Defining iron deficiency anaemia**: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin, the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

- **Investigations**: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B).

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). High credibility.

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia, both with and without comorbidities.

- **Methods**: Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies conducted between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia without secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using these mean values.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while values from 26 to 31.5 pg can indicate iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. Sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both conditions, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

- **Conclusions**: Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^116WBw1N]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia or one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide but not necessarily as a medical condition in and of itself.

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a simple, standard definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

- **Expert recommendation**: We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency: Iron deficiency is a health-related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia.

- **Clinical impact of iron deficiency**: Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (e.g. pagophagia and restless leg syndrome), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue and exhaustion. This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116Ln8KB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is detected through automated cell counters that measure changes in red cells, such as reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) indicating hypochromia, and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) indicating microcytosis. MCH is considered a more reliable marker of iron deficiency, as it is less reliant on storage and the specific counting machine used. A reduction in MCH is observed in both absolute and functional iron deficiency. Moreover, MCH may be more sensitive for detecting iron deficiency than MCV. However, both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity in the presence of chronic disease, thalassemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited because microcytosis and hypochromia can also occur in various haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemia, where the MCV is typically reduced disproportionally to the level of anemia. These features are also observed in sideroblastic anemia and some cases of anemia of chronic disease. To avoid unnecessary gastroenterological investigations, hemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended for individuals with microcytosis and normal iron studies, especially if they belong to an ethnic group predisposed to these conditions.

Serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and a raised percentage of hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency when inflammation is absent. An SF level of < 15 µg/L indicates absent iron stores.

### Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR/log ferritin index for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia. A meta-analysis [^111W7LCz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Determination of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is proposed to distinguish between iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of sTfR and the sTfR/log ferritin index. The meta-analysis included 18 sTfR and 10 sTfR index studies. However, three sTfR index studies were eliminated as outliers. The odds ratio was significant for both sTfR (22.9, 95% confidence interval, 9.6–55.0) and the sTfR index (9.5, 95% CI, 5.0–18.1) in a heterogeneous set of studies.

Meta-analysis for sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) was performed only in a subset of 10 sTfR studies. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative LRs were 86%, 75%, 3.85, and 0.19, respectively, with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.912 (standard error, 0.039). Additional studies are needed to define the overall diagnostic accuracy of sTfR.

### Iron deficiency: a concise review [^114q2zV3]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. Recent evidence suggests that anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms occur before anemia is apparent. While advances have been made in understanding the physiology of iron deficiency, gaps remain in our comprehension. Oral iron supplements continue to be the mainstay of treatment; however, some indications for intravenous administration have developed. This review will highlight the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options.

### Improved differential diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: a prospective multicenter evaluation of soluble transferrin receptor and the sTfR/log ferritin index [^114N3Uxa]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are the most prevalent forms of anemia and often occur concurrently. Standard tests of iron status used in differential diagnosis are affected by inflammation, hindering clinical interpretation. In contrast, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) indicates iron deficiency and is unaffected by inflammation.

The objectives of this prospective multicenter clinical trial were to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of sTfR and the sTfR/log ferritin index (sTfR Index) for differential diagnosis using the automated Access® sTfR assay (Beckman Coulter) and sTfR Index. We consecutively enrolled 145 anemic patients with common disorders associated with IDA and ACD. Subjects with IDA or ACD + IDA had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR Index values than subjects with ACD (P < 0.0001).

ROC curves produced the following cutoffs for:

- **sTfR**: 21 nmol/L (or 1.55 mg/L)
- **sTfR Index**: 14 (using nmol/L) or 1.03 (using mg/L)

The sTfR Index was found to be superior to sTfR, showing an AUC of 0.87 versus 0.74 (P < 0.0001). Use of all three parameters in combination more than doubled the detection rate of IDA, from 41% (ferritin alone) to 92% (ferritin, sTfR, sTfR Index).

Use of sTfR and the sTfR Index improves detection of IDA, particularly in situations where routine markers provide equivocal results. Findings demonstrate a significant advantage in the simultaneous determination of ferritin, sTfR, and sTfR Index. Obtaining a ferritin level alone may delay diagnosis of combined IDA and ACD.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (e.g. pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (e.g. iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (e.g. chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111gezxs]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) 2021 guidelines emphasize the importance of recognizing that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery. This is particularly relevant for screening and diagnosis concerning the etiology of IDA.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^11544GJD]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and disease burden worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and treated with iron replacement therapy (IRT) via the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake, malabsorption of dietary iron, and several significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Since blood is iron-rich, chronic blood loss can lead to IDA; this is a common mechanism, such as in cases of menstrual or GI bleeding. Approximately one-third of men and postmenopausal women with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly within the GI tract.

Optimal management of IDA requires IRT combined with appropriate investigations to determine the underlying cause. In the UK, unexplained IDA in at-risk individuals is an indication for fast-track secondary care referral, as GI malignancies can present this way, often without specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic procedure for examining the upper and lower GI tract, although radiological scanning can be an alternative in some situations for large bowel assessment. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy is important for assessing the small bowel. IDA may present in primary care or in various specialties in secondary care, and due to the condition's insidious nature, it has not always been managed optimally despite the guidelines.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^111f7YBB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre. These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

- **Case descriptions**:
	- **Case 1**: Hemoglobin and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow-up. At age 26 (6 years post-diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), hemoglobin only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range.
	- **Case 2**: Hemoglobin and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32-year-old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the hemoglobin decrease was less pronounced than during non-pregnancy periods.
	- **Case 3**: Hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (total [missing data]).

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances of iron deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an anemia workup if the hemoglobin levels are below normal. This includes at least measuring red blood cell indices, such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

For a more extensive workup, include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in Black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning.

Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng/mL (46 and 99 mcg/L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g/dL (10 to 20 g/L) increase in the hemoglobin level during that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or an unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112KFCtq]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), specifically in the evaluation of functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend not measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in isolation to predict responsiveness to intravenous (IV) iron therapy in patients with CKD. Instead, it is advised to consider assessing the percentage saturation of transferrin to monitor response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and/or iron therapy in these patients. Moreover, the guidelines suggest measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in combination with either the serum ferritin concentration or other measurements, such as the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content, for diagnosing functional iron deficiency.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia.

- **First line of therapy**: For patients with iron deficiency anemia, oral iron supplementation is recommended. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients, and in a subset of patients, it is insufficient. Patients in whom gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia.

- **Intravenous iron supplementation**: Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels, with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory, and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate potential underlying causes.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: What do we need to know [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determining iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous.

There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards — such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF — among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of 30 years ago does not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and patient referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia, notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to searching for and treating the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively.

Hepcidin plays a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

- **Causes**: Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy. In many patients, the etiology is unknown.

- **Evaluation**: The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia.

- **Further investigation**: In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy.

- **Treatment**: Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores. Low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects the risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein, and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test for iron deficiency and overload is common clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and the risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

- **Search methods** (10 June 2020):

	- **Cochrane library**: DARE Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL Issue 6 of 12 2020

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Furthermore, parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful haemoglobin (Hb) response within a week, so it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should, therefore, be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, aiming for a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease). Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA. Hence, restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of iron replacement therapy (IRT), and early monitoring should detect patients not responding to or intolerant of oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes, including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding, and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after two weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

Logistically, it may be difficult to administer…

### Laboratory methodologies for indicators of iron status: Strengths, limitations, and analytical challenges [^112MALUZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Biochemical assessment of iron status relies on serum-based indicators such as serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and erythrocyte protoporphyrin. These indicators present challenges for clinical practice and national nutrition surveys, often necessitating iron status interpretation based on the combination of several indicators. The diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through SF concentration, the most commonly used indicator, is complicated by concomitant inflammation.

sTfR concentration is an indicator of functional ID that is not an acute-phase reactant; however, challenges in its interpretation arise due to lack of assay standardization, common reference ranges, and cutoffs. It is unclear which indicators are best suited to assess excess iron status. The value of hepcidin, non-transferrin-bound iron, and reticulocyte indexes is being explored in research settings. Serum-based indicators are generally measured on fully automated clinical analyzers available in most hospitals.

Although international reference materials have been available for years, the standardization of immunoassays is complicated by the heterogeneity of antibodies used and the absence of physicochemical reference methods to establish "true" concentrations. From 1988 to 2006, the assessment of iron status in NHANES was based on the multi-indicator ferritin model. However, the model did not indicate the severity of ID and produced categorical estimates. More recently, iron status assessment in NHANES has used the total body iron stores (TBI) model.

### Iron deficiency: New insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology, Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide, especially affecting children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is often caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infections, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, as low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately, frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron, even with a single infusion, and are effective in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

In the specific context of iron deficiency anemia, particularly for patients with IBD, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of IDA. It is essential to determine whether it results from inadequate iron intake or absorption, or from iron loss, typically due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated to enhance iron absorption or to reduce iron depletion (Best Practice Advice).

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2023). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, serum ferritin is the most effective in discriminating iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories may lead to the underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, indicating that basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. Additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that the physiological ferritin "cutoff" is 50 ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing this readily treatable disorder.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias result from defective iron handling by erythroblasts, which decreases the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis.

These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as follows:

- **Defects of intestinal iron absorption**: This occurs when there are issues with the uptake of iron in the intestines.
- **Disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle**: These impair erythroblast iron uptake.
- **Defects of mitochondrial iron utilization**: This affects haem or iron-sulfur cluster synthesis.
- **Defects of iron recycling**: These complications hinder the effective reuse of iron.

A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow for the distinction of the different types, which is a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

For the diagnostic investigations of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, particularly in evaluating functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend measuring serum ferritin levels. This is essential for the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. It is advised to monitor serum ferritin values, especially levels surpassing 1,200 mcg/L, to evaluate the potential for iron overload.

### Threshold ferritin and hepcidin concentrations indicating early iron deficiency in young women based on upregulation of iron absorption [^112XkeZX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is estimated to affect two billion people and is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. The serum or plasma ferritin concentration (referred to hereafter as ferritin) is the most widely used indicator to detect iron deficiency, and a low ferritin indicates depleted iron stores. However, the threshold ferritin that defines iron deficiency remains unclear, and diagnostic ferritin cut-offs from expert groups vary widely. The WHO proposes that iron deficiency is present in adults when ferritin is less than 15 µg/L. This threshold was derived from studies examining the highest ferritin among adults with iron-deficiency anemia who showed a therapeutic response to iron or who had absent bone marrow iron. Given this definition, it is not unexpected that a ferritin level below 15 µg/L is a specific but insensitive threshold for iron deficiency, which precedes iron-deficiency anemia. To increase the sensitivity of ferritin in detecting iron deficiency, other experts recommend using higher cut-offs to avoid false-negative tests that would leave iron deficiency untreated. However, there is little evidence available to justify higher ferritin thresholds. Moreover, many studies that compared ferritin to absent bone marrow iron were conducted in hospitalized patients and were likely biased by inflammation, which increases ferritin independent of iron stores.

A largely unexplored reference method for defining iron deficiency is based on the fact that low iron stores trigger an increase in dietary iron absorption. In otherwise healthy individuals, low hepatic iron stores attenuate iron absorption.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^115TJZBu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition that can occur due to a variety of factors. It is often associated with anemia secondary to blood loss or frequent blood donations. Individuals may experience cravings for non-nutritive substances such as ice, dirt, or starch. Other symptoms include a sore and red tongue, fatigue, loss of appetite, hypochromic anemia, and pale skin.

The condition is linked to an increased serum soluble transferrin receptor, decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and increased red cell distribution width (RDW). It affects certain demographics more frequently, including infants and females, and can be exacerbated during pregnancy.

Additional symptoms include weakness, an increased platelet count, lightheadedness, dizziness, tachycardia, cold skin, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, dyspnea, headaches, and brittle nails. Iron-deficiency anemia can result from a lack of iron in the diet, conditions such as sideroblastic anemia and an inability to absorb iron, and can be indicated by chest pain, koilonychia, asthenia, and a decreased reticulocyte count.

Factors such as vegetarianism and conditions like sideroblastic anemia can also contribute to iron-deficiency anemia. It is vital to address both dietary intake and potential underlying health conditions to manage this form of anemia effectively.

Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating Jesduvroq. Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment with Jesduvroq. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

- **Liver testing**: Assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to initiation of Jesduvroq. Repeat the liver tests if the patient develops signs or symptoms that could be consistent with liver disease during treatment with Jesduvroq.

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Jesduvroq sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin higher than 11 g/dL. Jesduvroq can be taken with or without food and without regard to concomitant administration of iron or phosphate binders. Jesduvroq should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. Jesduvroq can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis. If a dose of Jesduvroq is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose.

### Management of iron deficiency [^1177mVnZ]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia, with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3):

- **Identification of ID/IDA**:
	- Identification is the first crucial step.

- **Investigation and management of the underlying etiology of ID**:
	- Understanding the root cause of ID is essential for effective management.

- **Iron repletion**:
	- Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients. However, there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications and when a poor response to oral iron is anticipated. It is also recommended when rapid hematologic responses are desired and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product.

Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA are central pillars in patient blood management.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: A review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^113qL1qP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a frequent cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy.

Specific patient groups, such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin, and iron-deficient patients without anaemia, may need an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients, with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy.

Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement plus diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance, or treatment failure with oral therapy.

### Iron metabolism and iron deficiency anemia in women [^111DRFhc]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are highly prevalent among women across their reproductive age. An iron-deficient state has been associated with a number of adverse health consequences, affecting all aspects of the physical and emotional well-being of women. Heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, and the postpartum period are the major causes of ID and IDA. However, despite the high prevalence and the impact on quality of life, ID and IDA among women in their reproductive age are still underdiagnosed and undertreated. This chapter summarizes iron metabolism and the diagnosis and treatment of ID and IDA in women.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood count (CBC) for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leukocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to examine the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help identify the various causes of anemia, as shown below.

- **Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count**:

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For instance, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. In cases of drug-induced anemia (e.g. treatment with azathioprine), lab tests can show microcytic or even macrocytic anemia. This demonstrates that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia but are generally normal in ACD. The RDW indicates how much the erythrocytes vary in size. It is commonly increased in IDA and remains within the normal range in thalassemia.

However, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is an additional layer of complexity in anemia diagnosis and management.

Follow-up and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
- **Hb levels**: Normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Long-term IRT**: Recommended as an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA (reIDA) is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Monitoring**: After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend periodic blood count monitoring, perhaps every 6 months initially, to detect reIDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the treatment section. If the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, with no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after the completion of IRT to check for reIDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Further investigation is warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers, and persistent…

The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2024 guidelines address the specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients undergoing surgery. The guidelines recommend considering ferritin levels of 30–100 mcg/L with a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency. This is especially relevant in the context of inflammation, where patients may benefit from iron supplementation.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We also recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). Additionally, we recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits. There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines provide further direction.

### Best but not perfect: Indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency, as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency, as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al. make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. Hematological abnormalities [^113YLrwi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^113BLgw2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The high incidence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in children emphasizes the need for a cost-effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, have been used to evaluate IDA. However, many of these tests are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have low specificity.

Anisocytosis occurs when erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and have a large size variation due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at the molecular level are disturbed due to IDA. Therefore, an increase in red cell distribution width (RDW) values may occur in IDA, allowing early detection of iron deficiency before a reduction in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) occurs.

RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW, when evaluated in a large sample, performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111F7q5A]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The investigation of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases, and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do occasionally develop cancer in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women, particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables — specifically age, sex, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. The IDIOM App has been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process, with the incorporation of additional clinical variables, may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. While low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can result from multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. However, the investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not addressed here and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be a universally problematic condition worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for diagnosing and managing this prevalent condition.

The medical community still lacks consensus on the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, as well as cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations have expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low- versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include designing an algorithm that encompasses multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics. This will provide direction in managing IDA and help distinguish between IDA and the anemia of chronic disease.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children should be screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age. However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force also found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age.

Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with haemoglobin (Hb) levels ranging from 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 100–120, and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV. There are reports of transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected. The hallmark of CDA-I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of ⁵⁹Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated two weeks post-intravenous infusion. When erythropoiesis is effective, such as in cases of anaemia due to bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing ⁵⁹Fe is approximately 75–80%. However, in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30%. Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This index is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of CDA-II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA-I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Figure 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, and irregular forms.
