## Question

What are the common symptoms of tinea pedis in pediatric patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of tinea pedis in pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical morphologies of tinea pedis and which are most likely in children. Then, I should verify how pediatric presentations differ from adult patterns. Next, I will extract and synthesize symptom data from authoritative sources and pediatric studies. After that, I need to check for age-related nuances and diagnostic pitfalls. Finally, I will summarize the most common symptoms and note any exceptions or atypical features that could mislead clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the clinical morphologies. Tinea pedis in children, as in adults, typically presents in interdigital, moccasin (plantar), vesicular/bullous, or acute ulcerative patterns, with interdigital and moccasin forms being most common in pediatric cohorts, and vesicular presentations relatively more frequent in children than adults [^b8c0b16e] [^4486587e].

> Wait, let me verify how pediatric features diverge from adult disease. Children more often have vesicles or bullae on the soles or lateral feet, and their disease may be asymmetric or mimic bacterial cellulitis, which can delay diagnosis. Maceration and fissuring in the toe webs are classic, but scaling on the soles with minimal interdigital involvement also occurs, particularly with Trichophyton rubrum [^4486587e] [^7825ad60].

> I will now examine the most common symptoms across sources. Pruritus is consistently reported and often prominent, especially in the interdigital spaces. Erythema and scaling are frequent, with scaling ranging from fine on the soles to thicker macerated scale between the toes. Peeling or desquamation, fissuring, and a burning sensation are also described, and in more inflamed cases vesicles or bullae may appear on the soles or lateral feet [^9ccff138] [^4486587e] [^9af36af7].

> Hold on, I should verify age-related patterns. Prepubertal children less often have classic interdigital maceration and more often show diffuse plantar scaling or vesicular disease, whereas adolescents approach adult phenotypes with interdigital involvement and moccasin-type plantar scaling. Prevalence rises with age, supporting this shift in morphology and distribution [^7825ad60] [^bce5a195].

> Let me consider diagnostic pitfalls and mimics. Pediatric tinea pedis can mimic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, juvenile plantar dermatosis, impetigo, herpetic infection, or even cellulitis, particularly when vesicles or bullae predominate. Asymmetric involvement or lesions refractory to antibiotics should prompt KOH examination and consideration of dermatophyte infection [^4486587e] [^749264f8].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence for vesicular disease in children. A pediatric series found vesicles in 64% of children with tinea pedis, which is substantially higher than typical adult series, reinforcing that bullous or vesicular features are a key pediatric signal that should raise suspicion when paired with pruritus and scaling [^4486587e].

> Next, I should review the moccasin pattern. Diffuse plantar hyperkeratosis with fine scale, often involving the soles and heels and sometimes extending to the lateral feet, is a recognized presentation in children and can be subtle; reflectance confocal microscopy has helped confirm diagnosis when KOH is negative but suspicion remains high [^b8c0b16e] [^3c94ed98].

> But wait, what if the child is entirely asymptomatic? Subclinical or minimally symptomatic tinea pedis does occur and may serve as a reservoir for onychomycosis; thus, careful foot examination is warranted when evaluating nail disease or persistent foot dermatitis in children [^e5c40d06].

> Let me synthesize the most common symptoms in pediatric tinea pedis. The prevailing clinical picture in children is pruritus of the feet, especially between the toes, accompanied by erythema, scaling, and peeling; maceration and fissuring are common in the interdigital spaces, and vesicles or bullae may appear on the soles or lateral feet, particularly in school-aged children; burning or discomfort can accompany these findings, and the distribution may be asymmetric or involve primarily the plantar surface rather than the toe webs [^9ccff138] [^4486587e] [^7825ad60].

> I need to ensure I note exceptions. While classic adult interdigital maceration is less common in young children, it becomes more frequent after puberty; conversely, diffuse plantar scaling and vesicular disease are relatively more common in pediatrics, so clinicians should maintain a low threshold for mycology when the morphology is atypical for eczema or bacterial infection [^7825ad60] [^4486587e].

---

Tinea pedis in children most often presents with **itchy, scaly, erythematous patches** between the toes, often with maceration and fissuring [^9ccff138] [^7825ad60]. Vesicles or bullae may occur, especially on the soles or sides of the feet, and the infection can spread to the nails (onychomycosis) [^9ccff138] [^e5c40d06]. Symptoms are typically worse with moisture and occlusive footwear, and children may report burning or stinging [^7825ad60] [^bf99d271]. Diagnosis is clinical but should be confirmed with **KOH microscopy or culture** when uncertain [^36d84998] [^c665b9f1].

## Clinical presentations in pediatric patients

Tinea pedis in children presents in several **distinct clinical forms**, each with characteristic features:

| **Clinical form** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Interdigital | - Most common in children <br/> - Scaling, maceration, and fissuring between the toes, especially the third and fourth interdigital spaces <br/> - Often accompanied by pruritus and burning sensations [^9ccff138] [^7825ad60] |
| Plantar (moccasin) | - Diffuse scaling and erythema covering the sole and lateral aspects of the foot <br/> - Often chronic and recurrent <br/> - May extend to the dorsal surface of the foot [^b8c0b16e] |
| Vesicular | - Vesicles or bullae on the soles, sides, or interdigital spaces <br/> - Often associated with intense pruritus and burning <br/> - More common in children than adults [^4486587e] |
| Ulcerative | - Rare in children <br/> - Characterized by erosions and ulcerations, often secondary to bacterial superinfection <br/> - Typically associated with significant discomfort and malodor [^b8c0b16e] |

---

## Common symptoms and signs

The **most frequently reported symptoms and signs** of tinea pedis in pediatric patients include:

- **Pruritus**: Itching is the most common symptom, often intense and persistent, particularly between the toes [^9ccff138].

- **Erythema**: Redness of the affected skin, often localized to the interdigital spaces or soles of the feet [^9ccff138].

- **Scaling**: Fine or coarse scaling, often accompanied by peeling or desquamation of the skin [^9ccff138].

- **Maceration**: Softening and whitening of the skin, particularly in the interdigital spaces due to moisture accumulation [^7825ad60].

- **Fissuring**: Linear cracks or fissures, often painful, particularly in the interdigital spaces [^9af36af7].

- **Vesicles or bullae**: Small fluid-filled lesions, often accompanied by pruritus and burning sensations [^4486587e].

- **Malodor**: Unpleasant odor, particularly in cases with secondary bacterial infection or chronic maceration [^bf99f271].

---

## Factors influencing symptom severity

Several factors influence the **severity and presentation** of tinea pedis symptoms in pediatric patients:

- **Age**: Older children and adolescents are more likely to experience severe symptoms, possibly due to increased physical activity, sweating, and exposure to communal environments (e.g. locker rooms, swimming pools) [^bce5a195].

- **Gender**: Boys are more frequently affected than girls, possibly due to increased participation in sports and greater exposure to moist environments [^bf82761a].

- **Climate**: Warm, humid climates significantly increase the risk and severity of tinea pedis due to prolonged moisture exposure [^90300e6a].

- **Hygiene practices**: Poor foot hygiene, infrequent washing, and sharing of footwear or towels exacerbate symptoms and facilitate transmission [^d647f6f2].

- **Underlying conditions**: Immunocompromised states, chronic skin conditions (e.g. eczema), and concurrent fungal infections (e.g. onychomycosis) can worsen symptoms and complicate management [^902d1eeb] [^e5c40d06].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis of tinea pedis in pediatric patients relies on **clinical evaluation** supported by diagnostic testing:

- **Clinical examination**: Visual inspection of the affected areas, looking for characteristic signs such as scaling, erythema, maceration, fissuring, and vesicles [^9af36af7].

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy**: Direct microscopic examination of skin scrapings to identify fungal hyphae and confirm the diagnosis [^36d84998].

- **Fungal culture**: Useful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, recurrent infections, or suspected resistance to antifungal therapy [^c665b9f1].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and bacterial infections should be considered and excluded based on clinical features and diagnostic testing [^749264f8].

---

## Conclusion

Tinea pedis in pediatric patients typically presents with **itchy, scaly, erythematous patches** between the toes, often with maceration, fissuring, and vesicles. Symptoms are influenced by age, gender, climate, hygiene, and underlying conditions. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent chronicity, recurrence, and transmission.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^e51a748d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

This systematic review assesses the prevalence of tinea pedis among children (0–19 years), following the PRISMA guidelines. The review was registered in the PROSPERO registry on April 5, 2024, with the registration number CRD42024532638.

A literature search was conducted using a search string (Appendix A) in the databases PubMed and Embase (OVID) on October 7 and October 10, 2024. The database DOAJ was also searched on October 7, 2024, but no relevant findings were obtained. The reference lists of the included articles were reviewed to identify additional relevant literature, and one article was included. The literature screening process was done independently by two authors, JBS and NFG, utilizing the Rayyan screening tool (AI tool). No other AI tool has been used. In the event of any disparities in selection, the senior author DMS was consulted to reach a consensus.

2.1 Inclusion Criteria

The inclusion criteria were studies published in peer‐reviewed journals, written in English, and reporting on the prevalence of tinea pedis in at least 100 children up to and including 19 years old.

2.2 Exclusion Criteria

The exclusion criteria were studies with a population having or suspected of tinea pedis, specific patient groups (e.g. diabetes or immunodeficiencies), studies focusing on specific etiological agents, and reviews.

2.3 Data Collection and Statistic

Data regarding the prevalence of tinea pedis (author, year of publication, country where the study was conducted, study duration, population size, diagnostic procedures, etiological agents, accompanying fungal or skin disorders) were gathered by one author, JBS, and entered in an Excel spreadsheet. Narrative synthesis was used due to data heterogeneity, describing prevalence variations based on study designs, age, location, and other factors. A linear regression model was applied to the data to assess the correlation between the prevalence of tinea pedis in children (%) over time (year of publication). Excel Version 16.84 (24041420) was used to determine if the variation in prevalence had changed over time by adding a trend line and calculating the p ‐value and 95% confidence interval. A meta‐analysis was not possible due to differences in study population, design, age, and diagnostic methods.

Key points
- Ringworm can affect skin, hair, and nails.
- Skin infections cause itchy, ring-shaped rashes.
- Ringworm of the hair can cause hair loss.
- Nail infections can cause the nail to be thick, cracked, and discolored. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of ringworm can be a little different depending on the part of the body that is infected. Symptoms typically appear between 4 and 14 days after the skin comes in contact with the fungi that cause ringworm. Skin on most parts of the body Symptoms include a red, itchy ring-shaped rash that can:

- Have a clear or scaly area inside the ring.
- Have scattered bumps inside the ring that
- appear red on white skin.
- appear red-purple, brown, gray, or black on brown skin.
- appear red on white skin.
- Be slightly raised.
- Have overlapping rings.

Feet Symptoms include red, swollen, peeling, itchy skin between the toes that:

- Is most common in the pinky toe and the one next to it
- Can affect the sole and heel of the foot.
- Can cause blisters in severe cases. Groin Ringworm on the groin causes itchy, scaly, red spots. It is usually on the inner sides of the skin folds of the thigh. Scalp Ringworm on the scalp causes a scaly, itchy, circular, red bald spot. Without treatment the spot can grow larger and more can appear. Ringworm of the scalp is more common in children than it is in adults. Beard Symptoms of ringworm on the beard include:

- Scaly, itchy, red spots on the cheeks, chin, and upper neck
- Spots might become crusted over or filled with pus. Nail infections Nails: May affect up to 14% of the population. Finger and toe nails can be affected but toe nail infections are much more common.

People with toenail infections often have infections in the skin of their foot too. Nails can become:

- Discolored, thick, fragile, or cracked.
- Separated from the nail bed.

5 Conclusion

This review identified dermatophytes, primarily T. rubrum, as the predominant etiological agent. However, the included studies exhibited heterogeneity, such as the absence of standardized diagnostic methods and insufficient documentation of other comorbidities, including onychomycosis. More comprehensive and standardized research is necessary to determine the exact prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals should remain vigilant in recognizing pediatric tinea pedis to improve prevention and treatment strategies.

### Identifying signs of tinea pedis: a key to understanding clinical variables [^b8c0b16e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Tinea pedis is a frequently encountered dermatophytosis affecting the superficial skin of the feet, primarily of adults. The prevalence of tinea pedis has increased over the last several decades due to an increase in multiple risk factors. Infection from dermatophytes is most common, but infection from other fungi can also result in tinea pedis. Four distinct clinical presentations occur: interdigital, moccasin, vesicular, and acute ulcerative types. A variety of physical exam findings can help the clinician identify patients with tinea pedis.

### Diagnosis and management of common tinea infections… [^5e9a2b9b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The presentations of tinea infections range from mild scaling and erythema to severe inflammation with bacterial superinfection. The differential diagnosis for suspected tinea infection is listed in Table 1. Trichophyton tonsurans infection, may appear as black dots, which are actually infected hair shafts broken off at the scalp. Sometimes tinea capitis appears only as non-specific dandruff. Microsporum infection presents as gray patches of hairs that are lusterless because of a coating of spores. Inflamed areas usually have scales, pustules and erythema. Some patients develop a localized, boggy, indurated granuloma called a "kerion". A kerion can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. Tinea Corporis Tinea corporis, also called "ringworm of the body, " often affects children and adults who live in hot, humid climates. The classic presentation of this infection is a circular plaque with a well-demarcated border.

Since tinea corporis can be asymptomatic, it can spread rapidly among children in day-care settings. Tinea Pedis Tinea pedis, generally known as "athlete's foot, " is the most common dermatophyte infection. Tinea pedis infection is usually related to sweating and warmth, and use of occlusive footwear. Men between 20 and 40 years of age are most frequently affected. The infection often presents as white, macerated areas in the third or fourth toe webs. Occasionally, tinea pedis may produce acute, highly inflamed, sterile vesicles and pustules at distant sites. Referred to as the "dermatophytid" or "id" reaction, these vesicles and pustules probably represent an immunologic response to the fungus; they subside when the primary infection is controlled. The "id" reaction can be the only manifestation of an asymptomatic web space maceration.

The clinical presentation of tinea unguium depends on whether the fungus has invaded the distal, proximal or superficial nail. Distal involvement is the most common presentation. With distal involvement, the affected nail is hyperkeratotic, chalky and dull. The brownish-yellow debris that forms beneath the nail causes the nail to separate from its bed. The nail plate may become brittle, but the nail fold is seldom involved.

1 Introduction

Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a superficial fungal infection primarily caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton (T.) rubrum. While it predominantly affects adults, its prevalence in children is not negligible. Since the 1960s, an increase in pediatric tinea pedis in Israel has been reported, with a similar recent trend observed for onychomycosis among children. The prevalence of pediatric onychomycosis has been reported to be 0%–7.66%, with a slight increase from 1972 to 2014. Given the perception that tinea pedis is less common in children, understanding its prevalence and identifying age‐related trends is crucial for early detection and management to prevent disease progression and transmission.

Treatment includes topical antifungal agents, such as terbinafine cream, which is the first‐line treatment and is well tolerated in children aged > 2 years. In more severe cases, oral antifungal treatment can be necessary. Preventative measures include keeping the feet dry and avoiding the sharing of footwear.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the global prevalence of tinea pedis in the pediatric population. Additionally, it seeks to highlight the epidemiological aspect of tinea pedis in a potentially overlooked demographic, thereby raising awareness among healthcare professionals and parents about the importance of recognizing, preventing, and treating this condition in children.

4 Discussion

This systematic review combines global research on the prevalence of tinea pedis in children, which is less studied than in adults. Overall, findings reveal heterogeneous studies with variations among countries when reporting the prevalence of tinea pedis. Possible reasons include diagnostics, climate, and/or immigration. The findings are not statistically significant (p ‐value 0.952), 95% confidence interval (−0.0140361; 0.0147446). Some of the data after the year 2000 remain consistent with earlier studies, showing an average prevalence of ~4%. Studies from Tanzania and Nigeria show a decline, with Tanzania dropping from 2.50% to 0.83% and Nigeria from 3.80% to 2.60% (Table 1). This trend might be linked to improved hygiene and healthcare.

Geographically, the highest prevalence is observed in equatorial regions (Figure 3), suggesting a link between tinea pedis, warm climates, and humidity. Increased cases during summer months, suggest risks related to wearing sandals or going barefoot in warmer climates. The lowest prevalence was in regions with cold winters and dry summers (Table 1), confirming the potential link to climate. Regional differences include Turkey, where four studies using identical diagnostics (Table 1) reported prevalence rates ranging 0.27%–15.60%. The highest prevalence was at a male boarding school, in line with studies showing higher infection rates in males, and in environments with shared bathing facilities like boarding schools.

Among the studies, 72.0% (21/29) confirmed diagnosis using a combination of clinical examinations, microscopy, and culture. Prevalence ranged from 0.25% to 15.6% (Table 1), potentially influenced by laboratory expertise and equipment. Disparities in clinical examiners, including teachers, nurses, physicians, pediatricians, and dermatologists, may have caused over‐ or under‐diagnosis, especially for children with darker skin tones, where clinical diagnostics may be more challenging. A higher prevalence was reported in rural and low socio‐economic settings, compared to urban settings and high socio‐economic areas, indicating a notable impact of study settings.

3 Results

3.1 Literature Search

The search across PubMed and Embase yielded a total of 862 articles, and 29 articles were included. The literature screening process and selection of articles is illustrated in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
PRISMA Flow Diagram. Reason 1: Whole study population had or was suspected of having tinea pedis. Reason 2: Wrong population (> 19 years). Reason 3: Not enough children (< 100). Reason 4: Wrong publication type (review or case report). Reason 5: Wrong outcome. Reason 6: Foreign language (not English).

3.2 Demographic Data

The size of the study population ranged from 321 to 8122 children, where most of the children were 7 to 14 years old, and the mean age was 12.6 years (± 6.5). The lowest percentage of males was 38.3%, while the highest was 66.9%. Two studies provided data only on males. The mean percentage of male children was approximately 52.6% (Table 1). Seven studies found that boys are more likely to have tinea pedis compared to girls, while two studies reported the opposite.

3.5 Distribution Over Time

Figure 2 shows a timeline of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children. The data originates from the included studies, which used the same diagnostic method of clinical examination, microscopy, and culture. The studies were published between 1959 and 2018, with prevalence rates showing an increase from 3.6% to 6.0%. The highest prevalence rates appear in studies published post‐2000. Data from earlier periods show a more consistent prevalence of ~4% (Figure 2).

### Systematic review of the prevalence of tinea pedis in children [^bce5a195]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermatophytes (719/750; 96%), particularly(383/719; 53%), were the most common etiological agent, consistent with previous studies. Yeasts accounted for 4% (31/750) (Table 1). Prevalence increased with age, e.g. 25.5% in Turkish adolescents (17–19 years) vs. 7.2% in children aged 14–16 years. In Israel, prevalence was 2.1‐fold higher in children aged 12–14 compared to children aged 5–8 years. This may be due to longer lifespans, increased risk of exposure, participation in sports, military service or higher risk of certain diseases (e.g. diabetes).

Swift diagnose and treatment of tinea pedis is crucial to prevent its progression to onychomycosis, which may require systemic treatment. We therefore expected studies to report on co‐infections with onychomycosis, which we found in six studies (6/29, 20.7%). Higher prevalence was expected in dermatology clinics and in children using public swimming facilities, compared to population‐based studies, as the exposure is higher.

This review's limitations include the exclusion of non‐English articles and lack of studies with standardized diagnostic methods, making comparisons difficult. Furthermore, 48.0% (14/29) of studies did not specify the etiological agent (Table 1). None of the studies included children across the full age range of 0–19 years, resulting in narrower age brackets (Table 1). The data did not allow adjustment for potential confounders or mediators affecting outcomes, such as living conditions or healthcare access. Strengths include large study populations, diverse geographic representation, a majority of studies conducted in school settings, and the inclusion of only peer‐reviewed articles. Given that the latest included study was published in 2020, further research is necessary to confirm the findings.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^5de2211d]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

### Common child and adolescent cutaneous infestations and fungal infections [^4484165c]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cutaneous infections and infestations are common among children and adolescents. Ectoparasitic infestations affect individuals across the globe. Head lice, body lice, scabies, and infestations with bed bugs are seen in individuals who reside in both resource poor areas and in developed countries. Superficial cutaneous and mucosal candida infections occur throughout the life cycle. Dermatophyte infections of keratin-containing skin and skin structures result in tinea capitis (scalp), tinea corporis (body), tinea pedis (foot), and tinea unguium (nails). Less frequent endemic fungal infections such as blastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, and histoplasmosis may present with skin findings. This article will describe the epidemiology and transmission of these conditions as well as their clinical manifestations. The approach to diagnosis will be addressed as well as primary prevention and current therapies.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^bb99cd43]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair follicles, caused by dermatophytes. Dermatophytes is a common name of three genera of fungi – Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton, with the first two species being most dominant. Dermatophytes are also classified by host preference and natural habitat, with anthropophilic dermatophytes affecting humans, zoophilic dermatophytes affecting animals, and geophilic dermatophytes mainly affecting the soil. The latter two are relatively rare. All dermatophytes can exploit keratin (hair, skin, and nails) for growth and their clinical manifestations are named after the affected area of the body (e.g. Tinea manum, Tinea pedis, Tinea capitis). Tinea capitis is one of the most common cutaneous infections in pre-pubertal children, mainly from 6 months to 10–12 years of age. The epidemiology of Tinea capitis varies across geographical regions throughout the world and changes over time. The infection spreads among family members and classmates 1.

The clinical manifestations of Tinea capitis are variable, depending on the type of hair invasion, the level of host resistance, the immune system and the degree of inflammatory host response, but can grossly be classified as alopecic or inflammatory. Inflammatory Tinea capitis includes kerion, which manifests as a tender mass with pustules, purulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, and favus, with yellow cup-shaped crusts around the hair, inflammation and scarring.

Tinea capitis is often misdiagnosed, thus delaying appropriate treatment and enabling spread of infection. The diagnosis can be made in several ways. First and foremost, anamnesis and physical examination are crucial. In recent years, the dermatoscope has become more commonly used for close inspection of the scalp. Diagnosis can be confirmed by direct microscopy, with use of standard potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations. Its disadvantages include the time-consuming process, requirement of an expert and equipment not necessarily available in every clinic, and a false negative rate of up to 40%. In addition, scalp scrapings and hair fragments from the affected area can be cultured, but can involve up to 3 weeks until results are provided. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), provide for faster and more accurate identification of dermatophyte infections.

3.3 Recruitment and Examination of Study Population

Most of the studies included were cross‐sectional studies focusing on school children (25/29, 86%) (Table 1). A quarter of the studies (7/29, 24%) randomly selected participants and differentiated them based on rural vs. urban settings or socioeconomic status. Two studies were conducted at male boarding schools (Table 1). Most clinical examiners were dermatologists (9/29, 31%), while others were nurses (3/29, 10%), specially trained teachers (1/29, 3%), a microbiologist (1/29, 3%), nondermatologist physicians (2/29, 6%), an Assistant Medical Officer of Health (1/29, 3%), or pediatricians (2/29, 6%). The rest of the studies (10/29, 34%) did not specify the examiners.

Of the four studies conducted outside schools, one was from orphanage centers in Tanzania, two were from dermatology clinics in Colombia and Sri Lanka, and one investigated children visiting a public swimming pool carried out in Scotland (Table 1).

3.4 Diagnostics

All studies included a visual examination of each child for clinical signs compatible with tinea pedis (e.g. desquamation, scaling, fissures, redness, grooves). The majority of the studies used microscopy and culture for mycological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis (21/29, 72.4%), with a prevalence ranging from 0.25% to 15.6% (Table 1). One study used a combination of clinical examination and microscopy, resulting in a prevalence of 5.5%. Seven studies estimated the prevalence based on clinical examination only, which varied from 0.03% to 8.7%. Of the studies that relied on clinical examination only, the lowest prevalence was found in Egypt (0.03%), and the highest in Ethiopia (8.70%) (Table 1).

### Common tinea infections in children [^c665b9f1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Population-based epidemiologic study of tinea pedis in Israeli children [^d647f6f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years we have seen an increasing number of children in Israel with tinea pedis.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of tinea pedis in 5- to 14-year-old schoolchildren in a comprehensive epidemiologic population-based study.

Methods

A total of 1148 children, ages 5 to 14 years, from 7 schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds from the Jerusalem area were examined for the presence of tinea pedis. Scrapings from suspected lesions of fungal infection were sent to a mycologic laboratory for KOH microscopy and fungal identification. Information on the children's background and predisposing factors (regarding living conditions, hygiene, etc.) were provided by means of questionnaires filled out by each child.

Results

Of the 1148 children examined, 29.6% exhibited erythema and scaling, but only 6.9% of these were mycologically positive for tinea pedis. was the main causative agent (68%) of tinea pedis. The prevalence of tinea pedis increased with age, hyperhidrosis and particularly repeated foot washing (a 3.2 higher rate in children who washed their feet twice a day those who did not wash daily).

Conclusion

The prevalence of tinea pedis in children has increased in recent decades in Israel and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dermatologic diseases affecting the feet. Washing habits have a significant effect on tinea pedis in children.

3.6 Geographical Distribution

The studies included covered Europe (Denmark, Spain, England, Scotland), Asia (Turkey, Israel, India, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Philipines), the Middle East (Iraq, Saudi Arabia), Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania), South America (Colombia, Peru) and Australia (Figure 3). The prevalence of tinea pedis in these studies ranged from 0.25% to 15.6%. The highest prevalence of tinea pedis in children was 15.6% and was observed in a male boarding school in Turkey. This result was high compared to other studies using the same diagnostic methods (clinical examination, microscopy, and culture) which varied from 0.25% to 6.90%. In total, four studies were conducted in Turkey, which revealed notable variations in prevalence despite the same diagnostic methods: 0.27%, 2.1%, 3.3%, 15.6%. The mean percentage of countries belonging to the same continent and using the same diagnostic method was as follows: Europe 3.32% (SD ± 0.0059, 2.5%–3.9%), Asia 4.11% (SD ± 0.0560, 0.27%–15.6%), the Middle East 1.0% (SD ± 0.0127, 0.10%–1.90%), Africa 2.79% (SD ± 0.0152, 0.83%–5.5%), South America 6.35% (SD ± 0.0049, 6%–6.7%), and Australia 5.20%.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^afddac49]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the systematic review suggests a trend of an increasing prevalence of onychomycosis in children however this trend is not statistically significant based on available data. Childhood onychomycosis has many similarities with adult onychomycosis; it should be considered when the child presents with tinea pedis. The most prevalent pathogen is T. rubrum and toenail infection is more prevalent as compared to fingernails.

### Bilateral sole hyperkeratosis and nonhealing foot mass [^01f3b57e]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Tinea pedis
B. HIV
C. Psoriasis
D. Syphilis
E. Mal de meleda
Answers:
A. Tinea pedis – Incorrect. Tinea pedis with Trichophyton rubrum can present with involvement on the bilateral soles in a moccasin distribution with fine scale and can have palmar involvement — so-called "two foot one hand".
B. HIV – Incorrect. HIV can cause varied cutaneous eruptions with many associated infections and malignancies but on its own does not typically present with palmoplantar keratoderma.
C. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis can present with confluent erythematous scaly plaques on the palms and soles. It is helpful to examine the remainder of the skin for any psoriasiform plaques in a characteristic distribution and the nails for any changes concerning for psoriasis. This patient had one lesion on his ankle but otherwise his skin was clear, and he did not have nail findings. Skin biopsy is helpful in excluding this diagnosis.
D. Syphilis – Correct. Syphilis is the correct diagnosis for this patient with rapidly progressive painful, hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles with erythematous thin scaly plaque on the hand. Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection with Treponema pallidum sub. pallidum, a slow-growing spirochete. Primary syphilis refers to the initial lesion that occurs at the site of inoculation, commonly a painless chancre, that lasts for 3 to 6 weeks. Secondary syphilis is the longest stage and cutaneous manifestations range widely. After resolution of the cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis, patients enter latent-stage syphilis. Patients may get additional cutaneous manifestations while in this stage, which can make them contagious. Complications of latent syphilis include neurosyphilis, cardiovascular syphilis, or gummatous syphilis. On histology, patients may show slender rete ridges with plasma cell inflammation (Fig 3) and actual spirochetes with a treponemal immunohistochemical stain (Fig 4). In this case, the patient presented with skin findings and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) concerning for secondary syphilis.
E. Mal de meleda – Incorrect. Mal de meleda is an autosomal recessive form of painful palmoplantar keratoderma caused by mutation in Ly-6/uPar–related protein. It is most commonly seen in patients from the island of Meleda. Patients can present with hyperhidrosis, malodor, and perioral erythema.

### Epidemiology of dermatophytoses in children living in northeast France: a 5-year study [^4c24d3fe]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Dermatologic fungal infections are thought to occur less frequently in children than in adults. This study, performed over a 5-year period, emphasizes the interregional variability of dermatophytes that cause skin and cutaneous apprendageal diseases in children. In northeast France, two-thirds of dermatophytoses are due to zoophilic fungi, while they are most commonly caused by anthropophilic agents in the Paris region and in other countries. The clinical features of pediatric dermatophytoses vary with the age of the child: tinea capitis and tinea corporis are far more frequent before the age of 12 years. After the age of 12, even if these are still quite frequent, tinea pedis and onychomycosis become more common.

### An update on tinea capitis in children [^14cd521b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tinea capitis presents a significant public health care challenge due to its contagious nature, and potential long-term consequences if unrecognized and untreated. This review explores the prevalence, risk factors, diagnostic methods, prevention strategies, impact on quality of life, and treatment options for pediatric tinea capitis. Epidemiological analysis spanning from 1990 to 1993 and 2020 to 2023 reveals prevalence patterns of pediatric tinea capitis influenced by geographic, demographic, and environmental factors. Notably, Trichophyton species is most prevalent in North America; however, Microsporum species remain the primary causative agent globally, with regional variations. Risk factors include close contact and environmental conditions, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, microscopic examination, and fungal culture. Various treatment modalities including systemic antifungals show efficacy, with terbinafine demonstrating superior mycological cure rates particularly for Trichophyton species. Recurrent infections and the potential development of resistance can pose challenges. Therefore, confirming the diagnosis, appropriately educating the patient/caregiver, accurate drug and dose utilization, and compliance are important components of clinical cure. Untreated or poorly treated tinea capitis can lead to chronic infection, social stigma, and psychological distress in affected children. Prevention strategies focus on early detection and healthy lifestyle habits. Collaborative efforts between healthcare providers and public health agencies are important in treating pediatric tinea capitis and improving patient outcomes. Education and awareness initiatives play a vital role in prevention and community-level intervention to minimize spread of infection. Future research should explore diagnostic advances, novel treatments, and resistance mechanisms in order to mitigate the disease burden effectively.

### Topical therapy for dermatophytoses: should corticosteroids be included? [^67e99e15]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses, commonly known as ringworm or tinea, represent superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, which are among the most common infections encountered in medicine. The use of corticosteroid-containing combinations in dermatophyte infections that are usually treated with topical medications is still a much-debated issue. The addition of a corticosteroid to local antifungal therapy may be of value in reducing local inflammatory reaction and thus carries the theoretical advantage of rapid symptom relief in acute dermatophyte infections associated with heavy inflammation. However, the use of such combinations requires caution as they have some potential risks, especially with long-term use under occlusive conditions. Corticosteroid-induced cutaneous adverse effects have been reported primarily in pediatric patients due to inappropriate application of these preparations on diaper areas. Additionally, the corticosteroid component may interfere with the therapeutic actions of the antifungal agent, or fungal growth may accelerate because of decreased local immunologic host reaction, such that underlying infection may persist, and dermatophytes may even acquire the ability to invade deeper tissues. Analysis of the literature documenting clinical study data and adverse reactions related to combination therapy, drew the following conclusions: (i) combination products containing a low potency nonfluorinated corticosteroid may initially be used for symptomatic inflamed lesions of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, in otherwise healthy adults with good compliance; (ii) therapy should be substituted by a pure antifungal agent once symptoms are relieved, and should never exceed 2 weeks for tinea cruris and 4 weeks for tinea pedis/corporis; and (iii) contraindications for the use of these combinations include application on diaper or other occluded areas and facial lesions, as well as in children < 12 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients for any reason.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

A small amount of cream should be gently massaged into the affected and surrounding skin areas once or twice daily, except in tinea pedis, where administration should be twice daily.

Early relief of symptoms is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, tinea corporis/cruris and tinea versicolor should be treated for 3 weeks and tinea pedis for 4 weeks to reduce the possibility of recurrence.

If significant clinical improvement is not seen after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, an alternate diagnosis should be considered.

### Pediatric onychomycosis: the emerging role of topical therapy [^bd8d002a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the nails is an increasingly recognized disease in infants and children. However, it can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other nail dystrophies. In addition, many mistakenly believe that onychomycosis does not occur in childhood. Under-recognition of this infectious disorder therefore occurs. Although many consider "nail fungus" a trivial cosmetic concern, it can lead to discomfort, risk of secondary infection, and a more significant health threat in immunocompromised or diabetic individuals. It should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of nail plate disorders in children as it is one of the more common causes. Here we review the latest data on prevalence of the disease, reasons for its relatively low incidence compared with adults, and important predisposing factors. It is important to confirm the clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis in children, and affected individuals should be examined for concomitant tinea pedis. As familial disease often occurs, it is important to check parents and siblings as well for onychomycosis and tinea pedis. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, and recurrence appears to be more common in children than in adults. Prolonged systemic antifungal therapy is commonly required. However, pediatric practitioners and parents alike hesitate when asked to treat young children with a systemic drug that requires laboratory monitoring and can have systemic toxicities. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are theoretically more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults, and therefore good candidates for topical antifungal therapy. The clinical data on the use of topical antifungals in pediatric onychomycosis is scarce. We review data that exist from case reports and small clinical trials. New topical antifungals are now available that afford better nail penetration and additional delivery routes to the site of infection. Pediatric trials are now on-going, and should clarify the usefulness of these agents in children.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Grisofulvin [^216cf114]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^8e1d2c92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^e5c40d06]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is one of the most common nail diseases in adults but is described as infrequent in children. Data are, however, scattered and diverse. Studies have nevertheless suggested that the prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing in children lately and the aim of this review was therefore to examine this problem. Two authors individually searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for articles on epidemiology and prevalence of onychomycosis in children. The literature search was conducted in accordance per PRISMA guidelines. In total 1042 articles were identified of which 23 were eligible for inclusion. One of the articles presented two studies and a total of 24 studies were therefore included. Seventeen studies presented data of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children in the general population and seven studies among children visiting a dermatological and pediatric department or clinic. The prevalence ranged from 0% to 7.66% with an overall discrete increase of 0.66% during the period 1972 to 2014 in population studies (not statistically significant). This review supports a trend towards an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in children, albeit based on a paucity of studies. The data suggests an increasing prevalence of onychomycosis with age, and co-infection with tinea pedis (reported in 25% of the studies). The most common pathogen reported was Trichophyton rubrum and onychomycosis was more prevalent in toenails compared to fingernails. The general characteristics of onychomycosis in children are thus similar to those described in adults.

### Skin disorders, including pyoderma, scabies, and tinea infections [^a5f7900c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pyoderma, scabies, and tinea are common childhood skin disorders too often considered to be merely of nuisance value. More than 111 million children are believed to have pyoderma, with many also co-infected with scabies, tinea, or both. These skin disorders cannot be differentiated by ethnicity or socioeconomic status but, in high-prevalence areas, poverty and overcrowded living conditions are important underlying social determinants. Each is transmitted primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact. For many Indigenous children, these skin conditions are part of everyday life. Although rarely directly resulting in hospitalization or death, there is a high and largely unmet demand for effective management at the primary health-care level, particularly for pyoderma and scabies. Despite particularly high prevalence in some settings, treatment is not sought for many children, and when sought, the clinical benefit from such consultations is variable. The lack of standard, evidence-based recommendations is of much concern. The current evidence base for clinical diagnosis and treatment of these common childhood skin disorders is highlighted.

Ciclopirox olamine cream or gel (0.77%) applied twice daily for 4 weeks was superior to 1% clotrimazole or vehicle, achieving ~60% versus 6% end-of-treatment cures and 85% versus 16% two weeks after treatment. For children, a dosage of topical application twice a day is recommended for use in children older than 10 years. Naftifine twice daily for 4 weeks and sulconazole nitrate 1% daily for 4 to 6 weeks yielded higher mycological clearance (57%–66%) than vehicle (13%–34% cleared), though sulconazole is not approved for use in children in the United States. Terbinafine 1% cream applied twice daily for 1 week produced > 93% mycological cure at 4 weeks and is approved for children 12 years and older, whereas a 1% luliconazole cream trial in adults cured less than 50% and is only approved for adults. Oral terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 1 week, had similar efficacy to 4 weeks of clotrimazole 1% twice daily with faster clinical resolution and was similar to itraconazole, 100 mg over 2 weeks, with a slightly lower rate of relapse. Terbinafine is well tolerated in children, with occasional isolated neutropenia and rare liver failure, typically in people with preexisting liver disease.

### The attitudes, behaviors, and opinions about non-pharmacological agents in patients with tinea pedis [^34c2d04e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Tinea pedis affects the life quality distinctly and patients those with a prolonged disease often resort to non-medical methods. We sought to evaluate patients' knowledge about tinea pedis and approaches to the non-pharmacological agents. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 152 patients with tinea pedis who answered the survey between July and November 2019. Demographic and clinical features, patients' attitudes, behaviors, and opinions about non-pharmacological treatments related to tinea pedis were evaluated. Of 152 patients, 65 (42.8%) were female and 87 (57.2%) were male. The frequency of at least one non-pharmacological agent use for tinea pedis was 55.9%. The most common non-pharmacological agent was cologne (27.0%), followed by saltwater, vinegar, and henna. The rate of non-pharmacological agent use was not significantly different between genders and patients with different education levels. Information sources for tinea pedis were dermatologists in only 42 patients (27.8%). The opinion that the disease will improve spontaneously was not significantly different between the groups according to the education level (P = 0.154). Tinea pedis needs awareness as a health problem particularly in Muslim populations. Patients should be prevented from applying wrong practices and informed about the risk factors, contagiousness, and treatment options by physicians.

3.8 Fungal Pathogens

Dermatophytes (719/750; 96%), particularly, were the most common etiological agent (383/719; 53%). This was followed by mentagrophytes (303/719; 42%) and Epidermophyton floccosum (37/719; 5%). In one study from England, T. mentagrophytes was found eight times more often thanand E. floccosum. Yeast infections accounted for 4% (31/750), where(19/31; 61%) was the most frequently isolated agent, followed by Rhodotorula sp. (8/31; 26%). Fourteen studies did not mention the etiological agent. Two studies reported multiple isolates among children with tinea pedis. One study from Colombia reported co‐infections of T. mentagrophytes + E. floccosum (1 case),+(2 cases), and+ T. mentagrophytes (1 case). A study from Scotland reported a co‐infection of E. floccosum with T. mentagrophyte s (2 cases). Further details are available in Table 1.

### Common tinea infections in children… [^7825ad60]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Tinea Corporis DIAGNOSIS Tinea corporis is most commonly caused by Trichophyton species. Patients typically present with an annular patch or plaque with an advancing, raised, scaling border and central clearing. The differential diagnosis includes other annular skin lesions. Most patients with tinea corporis are diagnosed clinically. KOH microscopy of a skin scraping can determine if hyphae are present. Culture confirmation is usually not required. Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum) are also common causes of tinea cruris, the two infections usually occur together. Although the clinical presentation of tinea cruris varies, the lesion border is usually active to some degree with pustules or vesicles. The background rash is red to reddish-brown and is usually a symmetric macule with fairly well-demarcated borders.

TREATMENT The feet should always be evaluated as a possible initial source of tinea cruris. Although the appearance and symptoms of tinea cruris are distinctive, the condition must be distinguished from other common disorders, including candidal intertrigo and erythrasma. Candidal intertrigo is more uniformly red with no central clearing and may have satellite lesions, whereas erythrasma is a bacterial infection that is more uniformly brown with slight scaling and no active border. Tinea Pedis DIAGNOSIS Tinea pedis is caused by the same dermatophyte species as tinea cruris. It is more common in adolescents but rare in prepubertal children. The most important predisposing factor to acquiring tinea pedis appears to be exposure to a moist environment and maceration of the skin. The infection may be less prevalent in societies that do not commonly wear shoes.

21 Tinea pedis typically appears as a white macerated area between the toes, although a more diffuse dry scaling process often caused by T. rubrum may also occur. Another pattern of presentation is characterized by an inflammatory vesiculobullous eruption occurring primarily on the soles of the feet. Conditions that may mimic tinea pedis in children include contact and allergic dermatitis and occasionally atopic dermatitis. Unlike tinea pedis, dermatitis generally spares the intertriginous areas.

### Griseofulvin (griseofulvin MICROSIZE) [^cde60140]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections.

ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Safety is not established at higher doses than recommended.

### Prevalence of tinea capitis and tinea pedis in barcelona schoolchildren [^c7a60845]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although dermatophytoses can appear at any age, some types are particularly prevalent in children. There are no prior data on the prevalence of tinea capitis and tinea pedis in Barcelona, Spain. To identify the prevalence of tinea in school children in the area with the highest immigrant population in this city, a cross-sectional study was performed. A second objective was to identify the etiologic agent to study the possibility of the introduction of foreign dermatophyte species and to evaluate the possibility of encountering healthy hosts.

Methods

From October 2002 until June 2003, we evaluated 1305 schoolchildren, ages 3–15 years, belonging to 21 schools located in the inner city of Barcelona to determine the prevalence of tinea capitis and pedis in school children. Cultures of scalp and feet were done in each child.

Results

36(2.8%) children had tinea pedis and 3 (0.23%) had tinea capitis. One child had tinea capitis and tinea pedis, caused by different species (t. capitis caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes and tinea pedis caused by Trichophyton rubrum). Of the 39 positive cases for dermatophytes, the etiologic agent in 18 (46.1%) was T. mentagrophytes, 17 (43.5%) T. rubrum, 2 (5.5%) Epidermophyton floccosum and 2 (5.5%) Trichophyton tonsurans. Of these 39 cases of tinea, 15 (38.5%) were Spanish natives and 22 (56.4%) were immigrants.

Conclusion

The prevalence of tinea capitis was lower that we had expected, and it was noted that there was a greater prevalence of tinea pedis among schoolchildren 13–15 years of age (64.10%), the great majority of them male. The number of cases of tinea was significantly greater in immigrants.

### Superficial fungal infections in children [^902d1eeb]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections can involve the hair, skin, and nails. Most affected children are healthy, although immunosuppression is a risk factor for more severe presentation. Causative organisms typically are members of the Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton genera (dermatophytes), can be acquired from other infected humans, animals, or soil, and illicit a host inflammatory response. Nondermatophyte infections include pityriasis versicolor. In this article, the most common clinical presentations, diagnostic recommendations, and treatment algorithms for dermatophyte and nondermatophyte mycoses in children and adolescents are described.

### Tinea capitis mimicking cicatricial alopecia: what host and dermatophyte factors lead to this unusual clinical presentation? [^efc773fb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophyte infection in children. The clinical presentation varies from subtle asymptomatic scaling to inflammatory suppurative nodules and draining tracks. Both chronic and acute inflammatory infections may damage the hair follicle leading to secondary cicatricial alopecia. In rare instances, the initial presentation can mimic a primary cicatricial alopecia. We present three cases of tinea capitis in children masquerading as cicatricial alopecia and discuss the possible host immune and fungal antigenic factors that may influence the course of disease and its clinical presentation. An understanding of the clinical morphology of tinea capitis in the context of both host and fungal factors may improve treatment strategies and direct future paradigms of therapy.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^47460065]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presented findings emphasized the importance of diagnosis and treatment of these immigrant children by their primary pediatric doctor since it takes, as mentioned, an average of 4.3 months until they visit a dermatologist. During this critical time period, the scalp can become severely and permanently damaged, and the infection can become systemic or cause an outbreak within the entire community. In conclusion, we recommend to relate to scaly scalp in high-risk populations as Tinea capitis, and to treat with griseofulvin at a dosage of up to 50 mg/kg/day, starting from the first presentation to the pediatrician.

### Optimal management of fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails [^ac89e4bd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are chronic and recurring conditions. Tinea capitis is a scalp infection, primarily affecting prepubescent children. Ringworm infections, such as tinea corporis and tinea cruris, involve the glabrous skin. Tinea nigra is a rare mycotic infection that may be related to travel abroad. Piedra, black or white, is limited to the hair shaft without involvement of the adjacent skin. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are dermatoses associated with yeasts of the genus Malassezia that affect the lipid-rich areas of the body. The taxonomy of the Malassezia yeasts has been revised to include nine species, eight of which have been recovered from humans. Tinea pedis, an infection of the feet and toes, is one of the most common forms of dermatophytosis. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection affecting the nail bed and nail plate; it may be chronic and can be difficult to treat. In instances where the superficial fungal infection is severe or chronic, an oral antifungal agent should be considered. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are oral antifungals that are effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses.

### How to improve cure rates for the management of onychomycosis [^5558bd94]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

To improve the treatment of onychomycosis clinicians need to identify correctly the causative organism, choose a therapy that is effective against the pathogen, and take into consideration the pharmacokinetics (eg, bioavailability, drug interactions) of the oral agent. In addition, variations of the standard regimens may need to be considered (ie, booster or supplemental therapy). To reduce the recurrence of onychomycosis, once mycologic cure has been achieved, clinicians should educate their patients about proper foot care. Familiarity with the symptoms and signs of tinea pedis and onychomycosis may enable patients to seek appropriate care when the disease is at an early stage.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^534a24c9]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### Tinea capitis mimicking dissecting cellulitis in three children [^5d1a956a]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis mimicking dissecting cellulitis is a rare presentation, and there is a paucity of information regarding this presentation in the literature. Three children 10–14 years of age who presented with an unusual clinical manifestation of tinea capitis that clinically resembled dissecting cellulitis are reported. The patients were treated with systemic antifungals for 3–4 months. Treatment success was measured according to repeat fungal cultures and clinical assessment of hair regrowth at follow-up visits. All three patients had resolution of infection, with negative repeat fungal cultures and complete hair regrowth without scarring. These cases highlight a rare inflammatory subtype of tinea capitis that can be easily misdiagnosed and therefore improperly treated, prolonging the duration of infection.

4.2.6 Candidiasis

In nappy eczema, the diagnosis may include AD, ACD but also Candida, which often also acts as a cofactor. Of note is congenital candida, which has burn‐like manifestations, with desquamation, which can make diagnosis difficult.

4.2.7 Tinea corporis and capitis

Although the classic appearance of tinea corporis is an erythematous ring‐shaped plaque with central resolution, atypical morphology is not uncommon and may lead to suspicion of AD, ND or pityriasis rosea. Tinea capitis, on the other hand, when presenting with fine non‐inflamed plaques, may resemble ISD or AD. However, the presence of alopecia, pustules, lymphadenopathy, and broken hair may help the diagnosis. Microscopic examination is a useful tool, but the presence of hyphae does not necessarily exclude AD.,

4.2.8 Scabies

Because of the severe itching and eczematous dermatitis involved, scabies is among the differential diagnoses of AD. However, scabies itching is localized mainly to the armpits and groin in children, as well as to the interdigital spaces, which are not typical sites for eczema. A positive history of itching, especially nocturnal itching, in other family members helps the diagnosis. The dermoscopic examination looking for the mite and the burrow confirms the diagnosis.

### Dermatophytid in tinea capitis: rarely reported common phenomenon with clinical implications [^b48ef3ab]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Tinea capitis may be associated with a dermatophytid, which appears as a disseminated eczematous eruption. This phenomenon may occur before or after initiation of systemic antifungal drug therapy and is not an indication for stopping medication. We present here a series of cases that involve 5 children with tinea capitis who developed a dermatophytid before or during the course of their management. In each child, the eruption resolved despite continuation of oral antifungal therapy. Our experience suggests that dermatophytid secondary to tinea capitis is much more common than reported. Furthermore, parents and clinicians frequently mistake dermatophytid for drug allergy. Recognition of this phenomenon, distinction of dermatophytid from drug allergy, and continuation of systemic treatment is essential for clearing the infection and dermatophytid.

14.1 Interdigital Tinea Pedis

The safety and efficacy of Luliconazole Cream, 1% was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center clinical trials in 423 subjects with a clinical and culture-confirmed diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis. Subjects were randomized to receive Luliconazole Cream, 1% or vehicle. Subjects applied either Luliconazole Cream, 1% or vehicle cream to the entire area of the forefeet including all interdigital web spaces and approximately 2.5 cm (1 in) of the surrounding area of the foot once daily for 14 days.

The mean age of the study population was 41 years (range 13 to 78 years); 82% were male; 53% were White and 40% were Black or African American. Signs and symptoms of tinea pedis (erythema, scaling, and pruritus), KOH exam and dermatophyte culture were assessed at baseline, end-of-treatment (Day 14), 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment.

Overall treatment success was defined as complete clearance (clinical cure and mycological cure) at 4 weeks post-treatment. Luliconazole Cream, 1% demonstrated complete clearance in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis. Treatment outcomes at 4 weeks post-treatment are summarized in Table 1.

### Dermatophyte infection presenting as flat topped / lichenoid papules: an unusual presentation [^afaae343]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dermatophytosis are superficial fungal infections of the skin, hair, or nails caused by the filamentous fungi known as ringworm or tineas. The clinical features of dermatophyte infection depend on the causative organism and the host immunity; they can last for months or years, and infected individuals can be asymptomatic or have solely pruritus. Tinea corporis, also called ringworm of the body, has a characteristic morphology, which is well defined round annular pink patches with raised edges and central clearing. Atypical presentations of tinea corporis reported in the literature include: targetoid bullous lesions over the neck, trunk and forearm, subcutaneous nodules/abscesses over the lower extremities and erythematous papules/plaques over the back and posterior arms of a neonate.

We present a 14-month old boy with unusual numerous dermatophytic lichenoid-like papules over the back.

### Griseofulvin (microsize) (griseofulvin) [^d548c3a9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds - 125 mg to 250 mg daily.

Children weighing over 50 pounds - 250 mg to 500 mg daily.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^9740dc51]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a cutaneous fungal infection common among 3 to 7 year old children but it is rare in the first year of life.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 12-month-old infant with erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss. He was suspected of dermatophytosis and mycological analysis of all suspected lesions was performed. Clinical features and culture results confirmed tinea capitis caused by Microsporum canis. The infant patient was treated with griseofulvin for 2 months. However, 15 days later at the end of treatment he presented with a single vesicle positive for M. canis. Griseofulvin therapy continued for another month. After 3 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.

Conclusions

In infant, sometimes tinea capitis is misdiagnosed and underreported because it is similar to other scalp pathologies. Therefore, if erythematous scalp lesions are present, they must be examined from a mycological point of view to inform the differential diagnosis. Once diagnosed, treatment of tinea capitis can pose a dilemma because different factors may influence the choice between equally effective therapies (i.e. safety, age, formulation, cost). This case report suggests that it is important to establish an accurate diagnosis and treatment for this dermatophytosis to avoid recurrences or therapeutic failures, especially in infants.

### An open-label, multi-center, multiple-application pharmacokinetic study of naftifine HCl gel 2% in pediatric subjects with tinea pedis [^54a76e52]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea pedis is the most common superficial fungal infection. Naftifine hydrochloride is a topical antifungal of the allylamine class, displaying fungicidal activity and clinically significant anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical data on topical antifungal therapy using naftifine for tinea pedis in a pediatric population is limited.

Objective

To assess trends in efficacy, tolerability, safety, and to quantify the pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% in pediatric subjects with tinea pedis.

Methods

Twenty-eight subjects (22 pediatric and 6 adult controls) were enrolled and treated in the study. Approximately 2 grams of naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% was applied to each foot (4 grams total) for subjects with tinea pedis. Pharmacokinetic blood and urine samples were collected at various time points throughout the study. Efficacy was assessed based on potassium hydroxide, dermatophyte culture, and signs and symptom results at days 7, 14, and 28. Adverse event information was collected routinely. <br/>

Results

The rate and extent of systemic exposure among the pediatric and adult control subjects was low. Adverse events were minimal and were not related to treatment. Positive results were observed as early as day 7; however the proportion of subjects achieving success generally increased over time through day 28 in both treatment groups.

Conclusions

Naftifine hydrochloride gel 2% was found to be well tolerated and safe. Trends in clinical benefit were observed throughout the treatment period; however, continued improvement in efficacy rates were observed during the post-treatment period.

The identification of risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis is important to encourage hospital attendance by potential unmedicated patients, which may lead to the prevention of disease progression and the spread of infections to others. In this study, disease risk factors were analyzed using a large‐scale database of the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital, which includes the data of > 1000 patients/year managed in this center for foot diseases. By using this large‐scale database, risk factors could be analyzed with a large amount of sequence data obtained from a single center. This approach enabled consistent diagnostic criteria for diseases such as tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and their identified risk factors.

In this study, data from 337 patients with tinea pedis and 346 patients with onychomycosis were analyzed to identify risk factors. Among the patients with tinea pedis or onychomycosis, 259 patients (~ 75% of each patient population) had both diseases concomitantly. A previous survey conducted with data of 34 730 subjects, obtained from Japanese dermatologists in 2007, demonstrated that 7521 subjects had a tinea pedis, 3474 patients had an onychomycosis, and 2406 subjects had both diseases concomitantly with a concomitant proportion of 32.0%–69.3% of each patient population. There is a slight discrepancy in the concomitant proportion between this study and the previous survey, and one of the reasons is that previous data were obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted as a multicenter study and included data obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for the diseases. On the other hand, our study data were obtained from a single‐center database, which included patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria.

### Risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis: real-world evidence from a single-podiatry center, large-scale database in Japan [^433b3cb1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dermatomycosis, including tinea pedis and onychomycosis, is common worldwide, and is frequently encountered in routine medical care in Japan. The prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis in Japan is estimated to be 21.6% (~ 25 million patients) and 10.0% (~ 12 million patients), respectively.

Patients with onychomycosis are not merely concerned about the cosmetic changes caused by the disease as onychomycosis can be painful, significantly affect a patient's quality of life, and lead to serious complications. Patients with onychomycosis may cause the spread of the disease to others; however, many patients remain unmedicated in real‐world care in Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage hospital visits by unmedicated, potential patients who are at risk of developing tinea pedis and onychomycosis, and to provide these patients with information on the potential hazards of these diseases.

The risk factors for the development of onychomycosis that have been reported outside Japan include male sex, advanced age, family or personal history of onychomycosis, tinea pedis, nail trauma, fomite exposure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression, and psoriasis. Watanabe et al. reported that bone and joint disease, palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, sports activity, and climate are associated with onychomycosis development, according to a random sampling survey of dermatology outpatients in 1999 and 2000, particularly those with tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Most studies that have analyzed the risk factors for these diseases were based on multicenter, questionnaire surveys and included evidence obtained from unclear or inconsistent diagnostic criteria for diseases such as tinea pedis, onychomycosis, and the identified risk factors. In the current study, risk factors for the development of tinea pedis and onychomycosis in real‐world practice in Japan were analyzed using a single‐center, large‐scale database that includes the data of patients managed with consistent diagnostic criteria at the Podiatry Center of Juntendo University Hospital.

### Diagnosis and management of plantar dermatoses [^749264f8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Plantar dermatoses (PD) are common, occurring either spontaneously on healthy skin or developing secondarily from previously established foot disease. PD share similar symptoms and morphology, making them challenging to differentiate. A few of the most frequently encountered PD include tinea pedis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic dermatitis (or recurrent vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis), and juvenile plantar dermatosis. This review offers practical advice for diagnosing and treating the most common PD in the primary care office.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^081348fd]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis is a cutaneous fungal infection common among 3 to 7year old children but it is rare in the first year of life.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a 12-month-old infant with erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss. He was suspected of dermatophytosis and mycological analysis of all suspected lesions was performed. Clinical features and culture results confirmed tinea capitis caused by Microsporum canis. The infant patient was treated with griseofulvin for 2months. However, 15days later at the end of treatment he presented with a single vesicle positive for M. canis. Griseofulvin therapy continued for another month. After 3months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.

Conclusions

In infant, sometimes tinea capitis is misdiagnosed and underreported because it is similar to other scalp pathologies. Therefore, if erythematous scalp lesions are present, they must be examined from a mycological point of view to inform the differential diagnosis. Once diagnosed, treatment of tinea capitis can pose a dilemma because different factors may influence the choice between equally effective therapies (i.e. safety, age, formulation, cost). This case report suggests that it is important to establish an accurate diagnosis and treatment for this dermatophytosis to avoid recurrences or therapeutic failures, especially in infants.

### Ketoconazole cream, 2% (ketoconazole) [^1b86c7d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce thepossibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.

Seborrheic dermatitis: Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until no clinical clearing.

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

### Tinea capitis mimicking favus in rural Washington state [^980da8be]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Favus is a chronic inflammatory dermatophyte infection of the scalp. This condition occurs more commonly in impoverished countries and is associated with poor sanitation. The responsible organism is typically T schoenleinii, with T rubrum cited as the cause less than 1% of the time. T rubrum infections most commonly present as tinea pedis, tinea unguium, tinea corporis, or tinea cruris. T rubrum causing scrotal favus has been observed in immunocompromised patients. Cases of tinea capitis caused by T rubrum have been reported in pediatric as well as adult patients in developed countries.

Classical favus begins with folliculocentric erythema of the scalp followed by formation of the pathognomonic scutulum. Severe presentations involve more than one-third of the scalp, extensive hair loss, atrophy, and scarring. Affected skin may have an unpleasant "cheesy" or "mousy", odor and secondary bacterial infections can occur. Favus may also have a honeycomb appearance, as our patient's scalp demonstrated.

The scutula of favus are concave, cup-shaped yellow keratotic crusts on the scalp that contain fungal hyphae. Despite our patient's presentation with extreme heaped up crusts and abundance of fungal forms, the lack of scutula and atypical causative organism suggest the possibility of tinea capitis mimicking favus, rather than a classic favus case. Tinea capitis mimicking favus caused by T rubrum has been reported previously in an elderly woman with dementia. Additionally, favus is unusual in developed countries, and this patient lives in a private home.

We suspect this patient's skin condition was caused by the combination of unsanitary living environment and delay to treatment. The patient's living conditions and access to care resembled that of a resource-poor region where favus typically presents. Our case report supports the rare but potential occurrence of tinea capitis mimicking favus in developed countries such as the United States in this setting. It also highlights an alternate fungus, T rubrum, as a less commonly encountered organism capable of causing an exuberant cutaneous fungal infection.

### The role of naftifine HCl 2% gel and cream in treating moccasin tinea pedis [^d0580599]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent years, new topical antifungals have emerged for the treatment and management of tinea pedis, but all have been investigated and approved for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis. Moccasin tinea pedis has not been recognized by governing bodies as a definable and treatable disease entity separate from interdigital tinea pedis at this time. Thus, creating randomized, controlled clinical trials to investigate moccasin tinea pedis is a challenge without an agreed upon definition of the disease state, treatment regimen, and treatment course. Considering systemic therapy issues and the lack of data from large trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in the topical management of this clinical presentation, an unmet need has been created for a topical antifungal agent that can treat moccasin tinea pedis. Naftifine 2% gel, an allylamine, was studied in a clinical trial that enrolled patients who had interdigital or both interdigital and moccasin-type tinea pedis. In the moccasin group, the primary efficacy endpoint of complete cure at week 2 (end of treatment) was 1.7% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle) and week 6 (four weeks post-treatment) was 19.2% (gel) vs 0.9% (vehicle). Naftifine 2% cream in combination with urea 39% also showed improvement in hyperkeratotic moccasin tinea pedis.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream have been established in pediatric patients age 12 and above with interdigital tinea pedis and tinea cruris and age 2 and above with tinea corporis [see Clinical Studies (14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Use of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adults and children, with additional safety and PK data from two open label trials conducted in 49 pediatric subjects exposed to Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream [see Clinical Studies (14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Safety and effectiveness of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream in the treatment of tinea cruris and interdigital tinea pedis in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream in the treatment of tinea corporis in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

### Griseofulvin (Gris-peg) [^02b36f2a]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium. Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium-depending on rate of growth-fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Gris-PEG®tablets may be swallowed whole or crushed and sprinkled onto 1 tablespoonful of applesauce and swallowed immediately without chewing.

Adults

Daily administration of 375 mg (as a single dose or in divided doses) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis. For those fungal infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided dose of 750 mg is recommended.

Pediatric Use

Approximately 3.3 mg per pound of body weight per day of ultramicrosize griseofulvin is an effective dose for most pediatric patients. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: Children weighing 35–60 pounds - 125 mg to 187.5 mg daily. Pediatric patients weighing over 60 pounds - 187.5 mg to 375 mg daily. Children and infants 2 years of age and younger - dosage has not been established.

Clinical experience with griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis indicates that a single daily dose is effective. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^b0954361]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Topographically, onychomycosis is generally more prevalent in toenails than fingernails in children and adults alike. Transfer apparently occurs when tinea pedis spread to the toenails, which has also been described in adult studies. This could correlate with the six studies where concomitant tinea pedis and onychomycosis were found.,

The dermatophyte, T. rubrum was the most prevalent pathogen identified (39/153), 36% of the total cases confirmed with culture, which is in good agreement with previous studies in adults. Yeasts accounted for 26% (40/153) of the infections, represented by the Trichosporon spp. (13/40), C. albicans (11/40), C. glabrata (11/40), Rhodotorula spp. (3/40), C. parapsilosis (1/40), C. tropicalis (1/40) primarily isolated in Turkish studies.

### Tinea faciei due to microsporum canis in children: a survey of 46 cases in the district of cagliari (Italy) [^fc9a73dd]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses are frequent in children, but involvement of the facial skin has peculiar aspects that should be considered a separate entity: tinea faciei. Microsporum canis infection in tinea faciei has not been widely documented. To review cases of tinea faciei due to M. canis in children diagnosed at the Dermatology Clinic, University of Cagliari. Between 1990 and 2009, all children with dermatophyte infections of the facial skin were recruited for the study after parental consent. Diagnosis was made through direct microscopic and cultural examination. Age, sex, clinical form, illness duration, identified dermatophyte, source of infection, and treatment were recorded. Forty-six cases of tinea faciei due to M. canis in children aged 11 months to 15 years (29 male/17 female) were diagnosed. In 42 (91.3%) children, the illness was the result of contact with pets, and 4 (8.7%) cases resulted from contact with children affected by tinea capitis due to M. canis. Clinical manifestations were typical ringworm in 34 (74%) patients, whereas in 12 (26%) cases, atypical forms mimicking atopic dermatitis, impetigo, lupus erythematosus, and periorificial dermatitis were observed. In 18 (39%) cases, involvement of the vellus hair follicle was documented as ectothrix invasion. Topical or systemic antifungal therapy was effective in all patients. Tinea faciei shows a complex spectrum of differential diagnosis and age-related variations with respect to other superficial dermatophytosis. M. canis is the main organism responsible in children residing in Cagliari, capitol city of Sardinia, Italy. Close collaboration with veterinary and educational programs within infant communities are required for adequate prevention.

### Subclinical onychomycosis is associated with tinea pedis [^a96dbb3b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common cause of nail dystrophy and may be associated with tinea pedis. The presence of dermatophyte fungi in clinically normal nails is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the presence of dermatophyte fungi in normal-appearing toenails and to compare the risk of subclinical dermatophytosis in patients without and with concurrent tinea pedis.

Methods

This is a prospective, University-based study of adults without and with microscopically confirmed tinea pedis. Subjects with dystrophy of any toenail were excluded, as were those ever previously diagnosed as having onychomycosis and those who had used topical antifungals in the past year. A great toenail clipping obtained from each subject was submitted for periodic acid-Schiff histology.

Results

One hundred and one subjects (63 men and 38 women, mean ± SD age 45.4 ± 15.7 years) were included. Overall, septate hyphae (ostensibly dermatophyte) were identified in seven specimens. Of the 66 control subjects, one case (1.5%) of nail dermatophyte was identified. Of the 35 subjects with tinea pedis, six cases (17%) of nail dermatophyte were identified (P = 0.0066; odds ratio 13.4, 95% confidence interval 1.6–117). There were no significant differences in age or gender between the experimental and control groups or between the nail dermatophyte-positive and negative cohorts.

Conclusions

Dermatophyte fungi may be isolated from normal-appearing toenails. The presence of dermatophytes in this situation is strongly associated with the presence of tinea pedis. Subclinical dermatophyte in the nail plate may serve as a reservoir for ongoing local infection.

### Inflammatory tinea pedis / manuum masquerading as bacterial cellulitis… [^4486587e]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

These cases demonstrate that inflammatory tinnea pedis/manuum can masquerade as cellulitis in children. Early potassium hydroxide examination can allow appropriate antifungal treatment to be initiated before fungal culture results are finalized. TINEA PEDIS and tinea manuum were thought to be rare cutaneous infections in prepubertal children. 1, 2 More recent reports in the dermatologic literature suggest that dermatophyte infections of the feet and hands are more common in children than previously recognized. 3, 4 The clinical presentation of superficial fungal infections in children may be varied, nonspecific, and somewhat confusing.
5. An 8-year-old white female was seen in the dermatology clinic at St Louis Children's Hospital with a 12-month history of a 1- to 2-cm recurrent lesion on her foot.

According to her parents, the lesion appeared as a blister, became swollen and tender, and then resolved spontaneously, with episodes occurring approximately every month. Vesicles and bullae on the thenar eminence of the left hand. Patient 4 A 10-year-old white female was hospitalized at St Louis Children's Hospital for presumed bacterial or herpetic cellulitis on the plantar surface of the right foot. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics and intravenous acyclovir for 1 week, with minimal improvement. Dermatology consultation was obtained. A physical examination demonstrated a 3-cm annular collection of vesicles with surrounding erythema. A KOH examination was performed.

Although the clinical features of tinea pedis may be similar to those seen in adults with interdigital erythema and scaling, signs of dermatophyte infection in children are often nonspecific and mimic other conditions, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, juvenile plantar dermatosis., impetigo, herpetic infection, and cellulitis. 1, 4, 5 Vesicles and bullae may also be more common in children with tinea pedis. 8 Terragni et al7 found that in a study of 80 children younger than 14 years with tinea pedis, 64% of patients had vesicular lesions. In addition, asymmetric involvement of the hands and feet or lesions resistant to antibiotic treatment may indicate a fungal infection. A recent case report described 5 children with unilateral inflammatory plantar lesions as a manifestation of tinea pedis. 9.

### Econazole nitrate foam 1% improves the itch of tinea pedis [^decfb408]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Econazole nitrate topical foam, 1%, is indicated for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis caused by <em> Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, </em> and <em> Epidermophyton floccosum </em> in patients 12 years of age and older. The symptom of itch or pruritus was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multicenter Phase III studies in which econazole foam was compared with foam vehicle in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis. A thin, uniform layer of study treatment was applied once daily to all clinically affected interdigital regions of both feet for four weeks. At baseline, at least 69% of all subjects had moderate to severe itch. Throughout the duration of both studies, numerically econazole foam was numerically superior to vehicle in achieving absence of itch. After the cessation of treatment, from day 29, itching continues to improve until day 43 in the active treatment group, whereas there is no evident continued improvement within the vehicle foam groups. At day 43, in the active treatment groups, 83% in Study 1 and 71% in Study 2 achieved complete absence of itching. Using less stringent criteria, for the econazole nitrate foam arm, achieving no itch or mild itch (0 or 1), in Study 1, 95% and 86.8% in Study 2 achieved this outcome. Tolerability of the products was excellent with few treatment-related adverse events. In summary, econazole foam decreased the burden of itch as early as day 8 in patients with interdigital tinea pedis, and this improvement continued after cessation of treatment. <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(9):1111–1114.

### Ultramicrosize griseofulvin (fulvicin P / G 165) [^58f27e14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: Daily administration of 330 mg (as a single dose or in divided amounts) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis. For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided daily dosage of 660 mg is recommended.

Children: Approximately 3.3 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds- 82.5 mg to 165 mg daily. Children weighing over 50 pounds – 165 mg to 330 mg daily.

Children 2 years of age and younger – dosage has not been established.

### Luliconazole [^435578af]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

PK data of luliconazole measured in adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age) with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis or moderate to severe tinea cruris as well as in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age with tinea corporis are described in Specific Populations below.

Specific Populations

PK of luliconazole was assessed in 30 adolescent subjects 12 to < 18 years of age with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis (N = 15) or moderate to severe tinea cruris (N = 15). Subjects with tinea pedis applied approximately 3 grams of Luliconazole Cream, 1% once daily to the affected area and adjacent skin for 15 days, while subjects with tinea cruris applied Luliconazole Cream, 1% once daily to the affected and adjacent skin for 8 days.

Generally, the systemic exposure of luliconazole was greater in the subjects with tinea cruris than tinea pedis. In subjects with tinea pedis, the systemic concentrations of luliconazole were quantifiable in all the subjects on Day 8 and Day 15. The mean ± SD Cmaxwas 1.80 ± 1.86 ng/mL after the first dose on Day 1, and 3.93 ± 1.67 ng/mL and 3.27 ± 1.71 ng/mL on Days 8 and 15, respectively. The mean ± SD AUC0-24was 20.47 ± 14.47 ng*hr/mL after the first dose on Day 1, and 64.94 ± 32.47 ng*hr/mL and 60.38 ± 37.92 ng*hr/mL on Days 8 and Day 15, respectively. Like in adult subjects, the mean plasma concentrations of luliconazole in adolescent subjects on Days 8 and 15 were similar and fluctuated little during a 24-hour interval.

In two randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, patients 12 years and older with interdigital tinea pedis applied either ERTACZO®Cream, 2%, or vehicle, twice daily for four weeks. Patients with moccasin-type (plantar) tinea pedis and/or onychomycosis were excluded from the study. Two weeks after completion of therapy (six weeks after beginning therapy), patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms related to interdigital tinea pedis.

Treatment outcomes are summarized in the table below.

In clinical trials, complete cure in sertaconazole treated patients was achieved in 32 of 160 (20%) patients with Trichophyton rubrum, in 7 of 28 (25%) patients with Trichophyton mentagrophytes and in 2 of 13 (15%) patients with Epidermophyton floccosum.

### Internal environment of footwear is a risk factor for tinea pedis [^bf99d271]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Further, my results show that the optimal cut‐off point for discriminating between the risk of tinea pedis and non‐tinea pedis is 75% humidity for both patients with TP only and fungal foot disease; humidity and dew point can be assumed to be even higher in the interdigital area and areas close to the skin surface of the foot. Indeed, the average humidity of the fourth interdigital area in the summer was 80%, average maximum humidity was 84%, maximum humidity was 91% and average dew point was 31°C. A humid environment is important for the development of tinea infections; 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33 however, high humidity was not the major factor contributing to the development of tinea manuum, tinea corporis and tinea capitis, 31 but rather the high‐temperature and high‐humidity environment. Based on these studies, the following three factors can be considered necessary for tinea development: an environment with high temperature and high humidity (temperature and humidity), sufficient dermatophyte adhesion time (time) and fine scratches on the skin or nails (injury). 4, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Reducing these three conditions can prevent exacerbating TP infections. In addition, the length of time that footwear is worn is also thought to be a risk factor for TP.

### Naftifine hydrochloride [^d740c65b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Interdigital Tinea Pedis

Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream has been investigated for efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center trial in 217 subjects with symptomatic and dermatophyte culture positive interdigital tinea pedis. Subjects were randomized to receive Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream or vehicle. Subjects applied Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream or vehicle to the affected area of the foot plus a ½-inch margin of healthy skin surrounding the affected area once-daily for 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis (presence or absence of erythema, pruritus, and scaling) were assessed and KOH examination and dermatophyte culture was performed at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 6.

The mean age of the trial population was 42 years and 71% were male and 57% were white. At baseline, subjects were confirmed to have signs and symptoms of interdigital tinea pedis, positive KOH exam, and confirmed dermatophyte culture. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportions of subjects with a complete cure at the week 6 visit (see Table 2). Complete cure was defined as both a clinical cure (absence of erythema, pruritis, and scaling) and mycological cure (negative KOH and dermatophyte culture).

The efficacy results at week 6, four weeks following the end of treatment, are presented in Table 2 below. Naftifine Hydrochloride Cream demonstrated complete cure in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis, but complete cure in subjects with only moccasin type tinea pedis was not demonstrated.

### Tinea capitis in an immigrant pediatric community; a clinical signs-based treatment approach [^217696fd]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The medical records of 76 children fulfilling the eligibility criteria were reviewed (Table 1). Out of 76 cases, 55 (72.4%) were boys and 21 (27.6%) were girls. The average age was 3.1 years (range 0–8 years). In total, 30 children (39.9%; 9 girls (30%) and 21 boys (70%)) had a family member infected with Tinea capitis. All children were born in Israel to parents who emigrated from Eritrea. The average time from the initial appearance of the lesion until contact with a dermatologist was 4.3 months (3 days - 24 month).

Table 1
Demographic and baseline characteristics of pediatric patients with suspected tinea capitis

a Contaminated culture was considered negative

Out of 76 cases, 64 had a positive culture, 18 of which were collected from girls (28%) and 46 from boys (72%). The remaining 12 cultures were contaminated. In parallel, 65 cases had a positive direct examination, 8 of which showed negative cultures (Table 1). Thus, 57 cases had both a positive culture and direct examination, while 72 patients have at least one positive test (Fig. 1).

### Exploratory study on short-term administration of oral fosravuconazole for tinea pedis [^f32dcc4d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

We investigated the clinical efficacy of short-term, oral fosravuconazole (F-RVCZ) therapy for tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot. F-RVCZ (equivalent to 100mg ravuconazole) was administered orally once daily for 1week for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and for 4weeks for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was evaluated based on mycological efficacy and clinical symptoms at Weeks 1, 4, and 8 for interdigital and vesicular tinea pedis and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for hyperkeratotic tinea pedis. Efficacy was confirmed at the end of treatment. Therapeutic efficacy increased over time from the end of treatment for both types of tinea pedis. All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were within expectations and there were no cases of discontinuation due to ADRs or serious ADRs. Short-term oral F-RVCZ therapy is expected to be as effective or more effective than terbinafine and itraconazole, which have already been approved in Japan and may be a useful option for the treatment of tinea pedis.

### Econazole nitrate foam 1% for the treatment of tinea pedis: results from two double-blind, vehicle-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials [^6fec6cc1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Econazole nitrate is a broad-spectrum topical antifungal with activity against a variety of dermatophytes and yeasts. A new topical dosage form, econazole nitrate topical foam 1%, utilizing patented Proderm Technology® has been developed for treatment of interdigital tinea pedis.

Objective

To evaluate econazole nitrate foam 1% versus foam vehicle for treatment of interdigital tinea pedis.

Methods

Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multicenter studies enrolled males and females ≥ 12 years old with a clinical diagnosis of interdigital tinea pedis and baseline fungal culture positive for a dermatophyte. Subjects applied econazole nitrate foam 1% (n = 246) or foam vehicle (n = 249) once daily for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was proportion of subjects achieving a complete cure (negative KOH, negative fungal culture, complete resolution of all signs and symptoms) at 2 weeks post-treatment (Day 43). Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure (negative KOH and negative culture) and effective treatment (mycologic cure + no or mild erythema and/or scaling and all other signs and symptoms absent).

Results

The complete cure rate at Day 43 was 24.3% for econazole nitrate foam 1% vs 3.6% for foam vehicle. In addition, higher rates of mycologic cure (67.6% vs 16.9%) and effective treatment (48.6% vs 10.8%) were observed with econazole nitrate foam 1% versus the foam vehicle. There were few adverse events and only nasopharyngitis and headache were experienced by > 1% of subjects. No serious adverse events were reported for econazole nitrate foam 1%.

Conclusions

Econazole nitrate foam 1% exhibited superiority over foam vehicle for the primary and secondary endpoints with a high mycologic cure rate for all pathogens evaluated. Econazole nitrate foam 1% was safe and well tolerated with a safety profile comparable with the foam vehicle. Econazole nitrate foam 1% presents a novel alternative for the management of tinea pedis.
