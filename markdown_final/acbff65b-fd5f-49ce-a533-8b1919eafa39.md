## Question

what labs for new start lithium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which baseline labs to order before starting lithium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which high-credibility sources anchor pre-initiation requirements and ongoing monitoring. Then, I should verify the non-negotiable baseline labs and clinical assessments. Next, I will review additional tests commonly recommended across guidelines. After that, I need to consider special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical baseline-and-follow-up protocol and reconcile any discrepancies, including self-correcting where I initially overgeneralize monitoring intervals [^117S8BsX] [^1144GRtd].

> Let me first confirm the foundational guidance. The FDA labeling explicitly states that before initiating lithium, it is essential to evaluate renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function, assess concomitant medications, and for women of childbearing potential, assess pregnancy status and potential; it also warns that facilities for prompt and accurate serum lithium determinations must be available before initiation, which affects both baseline planning and early follow-up levels [^117S8BsX] [^1173Kw3f]. NICE provides the backbone for ongoing testing frequency of urea and electrolytes including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function, which informs how we align baseline with longitudinal surveillance [^1144GRtd].

> Now, I need to check renal function specifics because lithium is renally cleared and nephrotoxicity risk rises with impairment. Baseline serum creatinine with an eGFR calculation is mandatory, and I should consider a urinalysis to assess urine concentrating ability and proteinuria given the risk of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and CKD; in inpatients, a measured creatinine clearance is a reasonable gold standard, while in outpatients eGFR is an acceptable alternative, though less precise early in CKD [^1162YrHb] [^113uFE8k]. I should confirm contraindications and dose adjustments: lithium should not be used in severe renal insufficiency defined as creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min; for creatinine clearance 30–89 mL/min, start low and titrate slowly with frequent serum lithium checks and clinical toxicity surveillance [^1162YrHb].

> Next, I should review thyroid baseline testing. Lithium can inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and release, making TSH essential and free T4 advisable at baseline to detect pre-existing dysfunction and facilitate attribution of changes after initiation; real-world data underscore lithium-associated hypothyroidism and the importance of identifying dysfunction early, with some reversibility after discontinuation, so anchoring baseline values matters for longitudinal care [^115HvyjM]. I need to ensure the monitoring framework is consistent with NICE, which recommends 6‑monthly thyroid function during maintenance with closer intervals if abnormalities or symptom changes occur, so capturing a clean baseline is critical [^1144GRtd].

> Hold on, I should verify the electrolyte panel scope, including calcium. A basic metabolic panel with sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate is foundational at baseline given lithium's narrow therapeutic index and sodium-water balance effects; calcium deserves specific attention because lithium can increase serum calcium and PTH via effects on the parathyroid axis, making baseline calcium and periodic reassessment prudent per NICE and supported by toxicity phenotypes that include hypercalcemia and elevated PTH [^1144GRtd] [^1121kRqt]. Let me reconsider whether parathyroid hormone itself needs routine baseline measurement; most guidelines prioritize calcium with PTH reserved for abnormal calcium, which fits the available practice patterns and literature heterogeneity, so I will anchor on baseline calcium and reflex PTH if hypercalcemia is present [^113HT5S8].

> I will now examine additional baseline labs that, while not universally mandated by labeling, are frequently recommended across guidelines. A complete blood count provides a baseline given potential leukocytosis and supports overall medical context, and a hepatic panel (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) is often obtained even though lithium has minimal hepatic metabolism, to establish general safety baselines and capture comorbidities; these elements recur across multiple clinical practice guidelines and are reasonable to include pre-initiation [^113HT5S8].

> Let me think about clinical assessments that complement labs. Baseline vital signs and weight should be documented, as directed by FDA language emphasizing vital signs and because lithium may influence volume status and weight trajectory; I need to ensure a comprehensive medication reconciliation focused on agents that elevate lithium levels or toxicity risk, including NSAIDs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and serotonergic medications, with explicit counseling on interaction risks prior to the first dose [^117S8BsX] [^1156jBin]. I should double-check serotonin syndrome risk and reinforce education and monitoring plans when serotonergic co-therapy is unavoidable, aligning with FDA safety guidance on serotonergic interactions [^113DM5Jn].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, lower starting doses with cautious titration are prudent, as geriatric patients often manifest toxicity at lower serum concentrations; this aligns with product labeling and real-world practice standards [^11524MyS]. In pregnancy, I need to confirm status pre-initiation and counsel on teratogenic risk and dynamic pharmacokinetics; if continued during pregnancy, serum lithium requires closer monitoring due to increased renal clearance, with peripartum dose reduction or brief discontinuation before delivery to reduce maternal and neonatal toxicity, and careful postpartum retitration as clearance normalizes [^1177veaM]. For pediatric patients, FDA provides dosing guidance for ages 7–17, implying the same pre-initiation laboratory framework with weight-based dosing adjustments thereafter [^117S8BsX].

> Let me synthesize the mandatory baseline protocol before the first dose so nothing is missed. Before initiation, obtain serum creatinine with eGFR and consider urinalysis, TSH with free T4, electrolytes including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and calcium, a complete blood count, a hepatic panel, and a pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential; document vital signs, weight, and a thorough medication reconciliation focused on interactions, and ensure that facilities for timely, accurate 12‑hour trough lithium assays are available for early titration and safety [^117S8BsX] [^1173Kw3f] [^1144GRtd] [^113HT5S8].

> Now, I should lay out early and longitudinal monitoring, preserving and refining my initial timing statements. I initially wrote "weekly until stable", but wait, let me verify the exact language: the FDA instructs to obtain the first serum lithium concentration after 3 days, drawn 12 hours post‑dose, and to repeat regularly until stabilized; in acute mania, labeling for Lithobid specifies twice‑weekly levels during the acute phase, which is even more frequent than weekly and better captures early kinetics; BAP recommends every 3 months during the first year of maintenance and every 6 months thereafter, while NICE recommends lithium levels every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months thereafter, and urea/electrolytes including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function every 6 months, with more frequent testing if renal or thyroid parameters worsen or symptoms suggest dysfunction; taken together, "weekly until stable" is reasonable shorthand clinically, but strictly speaking I should correct it to "obtain a day‑3 level, then repeat at least weekly during dose titration or acute mania and after dose changes, transitioning to every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months thereafter per BAP/NICE", all as 12‑hour troughs [^117S8BsX] [^11524MyS] [^116aAXMG] [^116uuDTX] [^113M96tS] [^1144GRtd].

> But wait, I also need to ensure decision thresholds are explicit for renal impairment. If eGFR corresponds to creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, lithium should not be initiated; if creatinine clearance is 30–89 mL/min, begin at lower doses, titrate slowly, and increase the frequency of serum lithium and renal function monitoring while closely assessing for toxicity; these constraints should be documented at baseline and reviewed with the patient before the first dose [^1162YrHb]. I should double-check that this aligns with the broader safety warnings on toxicity proximity to therapeutic concentrations, reinforcing the need for reliable 12‑hour trough sampling capacity before starting therapy [^1173Kw3f].

> Next, I should review how to weigh lower-credibility or observational data that seem to challenge monitoring frequency. The recent high-credibility cohort analysis showed that improved compliance with monitoring guidelines over decades did not translate into lower 10‑year rates of severe renal impairment, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this does not negate the necessity of baseline and early monitoring for individual safety and dosing accuracy, it simply suggests that population-level CKD4 risk in the first decade is low and multifactorial; meanwhile, real‑world thyroid monitoring data hint that earlier intervals can detect dysfunction sooner, supporting clinical judgment to monitor more frequently when indicated, but standard schedules remain anchored by BAP and NICE [^1127cFd9] [^1164uikN] [^116aAXMG] [^1144GRtd].

> Finally, I will summarize the clinical actions so the protocol is actionable and reference-anchored. Mandatory baseline before lithium includes renal function with eGFR and urinalysis consideration, thyroid function with TSH and free T4, electrolytes with calcium, CBC, hepatic panel, pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential, and documentation of vital signs, weight, and interacting medications, with confirmation that 12‑hour trough lithium assays are available; avoid initiation if creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, start low and titrate cautiously if creatinine clearance is 30–89 mL/min, obtain the first 12‑hour trough level around day 3, then repeat frequently during titration or acute mania (up to twice weekly), and transition to every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter for lithium, with urea/electrolytes including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function every 6 months and more often if abnormalities emerge [^117S8BsX] [^1162YrHb] [^11524MyS] [^116uuDTX] [^1144GRtd] [^116aAXMG] [^1173Kw3f].

Before starting lithium, obtain baseline tests: **renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR, BUN)** [^1162YrHb], **thyroid function (TSH, free T4)** [^113HT5S8], **serum calcium** [^1144GRtd], **electrolytes (sodium, potassium)** [^1156jBin], **CBC** [^113HT5S8], and a **pregnancy test** in women of childbearing potential [^117S8BsX]. These labs establish baseline organ function, identify contraindications, and guide safe dosing and monitoring [^116aAXMG].

---

## Renal function tests

Lithium is renally excreted; impaired renal function increases toxicity risk [^117S8BsX]. Baseline renal assessment is **essential** to guide dosing and monitoring [^113uFE8k]. Serum **creatinine** and **eGFR** establish baseline renal function; avoid lithium if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1162YrHb], and **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)** provides additional context [^1144GRtd].

---

## Thyroid function tests

Lithium can cause **hypothyroidism**; baseline thyroid assessment is necessary [^113DM5Jn]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (**TSH**) is the primary baseline test to detect preexisting dysfunction, and **Free thyroxine (free T4)** complements it to identify subclinical disease [^113HT5S8] [^1164uikN].

---

## Serum calcium and parathyroid function

Lithium may cause **hypercalcemia** via hyperparathyroidism [^112ixuXP]; therefore, baseline calcium is recommended. Serum **calcium** detects preexisting hypercalcemia or parathyroid disease [^1144GRtd].

---

## Electrolyte panel

Electrolyte disturbances affect **lithium levels and toxicity risk** [^1156jBin]; baseline electrolytes are required. Sodium and **potassium** identify abnormalities that can alter lithium handling [^117S8BsX].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC)

A **CBC** establishes baseline hematologic status and may reveal underlying conditions [^113HT5S8].

---

## Pregnancy test

Lithium is **teratogenic**; confirm pregnancy status before initiation. A **pregnancy test** is required in women of childbearing potential [^117S8BsX].

---

## Summary table of recommended baseline laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Serum creatinine and eGFR | Baseline renal function |
| Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) | Additional renal assessment |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Baseline thyroid function |
| Free thyroxine (free T4) | Detect subclinical thyroid disease |
| Serum calcium | Baseline calcium/parathyroid status |
| Sodium and potassium | Baseline electrolytes |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Baseline hematologic status |
| Pregnancy test | Confirm pregnancy status |

## Clinical implications of baseline laboratory results

Baseline **labs** guide dosing, monitoring, and risk mitigation:

- **Renal impairment**: Lower initial dose, slow titration, and frequent monitoring [^117S8BsX].
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Monitor closely and treat hypothyroidism if it develops [^113DM5Jn].
- **Hypercalcemia**: Evaluate for hyperparathyroidism before starting lithium [^112ixuXP].
- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Correct before initiation to reduce toxicity risk [^1156jBin].
- **Pregnancy**: Weigh risks and benefits carefully due to teratogenicity.

---

Baseline labs for **lithium initiation** include renal function, thyroid function, serum calcium, electrolytes, CBC, and pregnancy testing. These tests enable safe dosing, early detection of adverse effects, and support ongoing monitoring [^113HT5S8].

### Evaluation of clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder [^113HT5S8]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Monitoring of additional physical and laboratory parameters before and during lithium use**: In total, 247 monitoring instructions were found for patients using lithium in all clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for bipolar disorder (BD), with an average of 27 instructions (range 4‐61) per CPG. The content of monitoring instructions varied between guidelines.

Parameters of renal and thyroid function needed to be monitored according to all guidelines, although differences were noticeable with regard to specific biomarkers. Besides renal and thyroid function, monitoring of body weight, blood pressure, electrolytes, hepatic function, and full blood count was most frequently mentioned. A pregnancy test for baseline monitoring of female patients was mentioned in many CPGs.

Most instructions were formulated in such a way that monitoring was mandatory (n = 178, 72%), while in others, monitoring was recommended (n = 26, 11%) or on indication (n = 43, 17%). Only in the ISBD, Japanese, and American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines were most parameters recommended to be monitored. In the Dutch guideline, several parameters only needed to be monitored during maintenance treatment if clinically indicated. The CPGs produced by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT), Nederlandse Vereniging voor Psychiatrie (NvVP), NICE, and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) contained many mandatory parameters to be monitored for all patients with BD.

### Lithium [^117S8BsX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, it is essential to evaluate renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and for women of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: Dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years) are available. Obtain a serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose, and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), equivalent to the lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. See the conversion table for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Lithium [^1162YrHb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

As lithium is eliminated primarily through the kidney, lithium renal clearance is decreased in patients with abnormal renal function, and the risk of lithium intoxication increases considerably in this setting. Lithium should not be used in cases of severe renal insufficiency, defined as creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault, especially if the condition requires adherence to a low-sodium diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

For patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function, where creatinine clearance is between 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault, initiate treatment with lower doses of lithium. Titrate the dose slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and observing for signs of lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^1144GRtd]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, specifically in terms of laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining urea and electrolytes, including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function every 6 months. This monitoring should occur more frequently if there is evidence of renal or thyroid impairment, raised calcium levels, or an increase in mood symptoms that might be related to impaired thyroid function.

---

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^113M96tS]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, particularly in the context of laboratory monitoring for patients on lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining serum lithium levels more frequently in patients who have elevated urea and creatinine levels or a decreased eGFR over two or more tests.

---

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^116uuDTX]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

For screening and diagnosis of lithium toxicity, particularly concerning laboratory monitoring of patients on lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining serum lithium levels every three months for the first year and every six months thereafter.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^113pN6ss]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

If co-medication interacting with lithium had been prescribed within periods, patients were monitored more often compliant with the guidelines for lithium serum levels. This may be caused by alerts from clinical decision support systems that remind the prescriber to monitor lithium serum levels.

Patients without other days with laboratory measurements were less often monitored in accordance with the guidelines for creatinine. The reasons for this difference can be related to the willingness of patients to have blood tests, comorbidities, or medications requiring additional monitoring.

Many guidelines advise monitoring lithium serum levels at least twice a year. Therefore, our findings could be compared to monitoring compliance in other countries. In agreement with other monitoring studies on adherence to guidelines, improvement of laboratory monitoring of patients using lithium in clinical practice is needed. The study by Collins et al. reported that 68% of patients had undergone two or more tests for lithium serum levels per year, 55% had undergone two or more tests for creatinine, and 82% had undergone at least one TSH test per year after at least one year of lithium use. The time periods in which laboratory measurements had been assessed were different (one-year periods compared to six-month periods for lithium, creatinine, and TSH), but their results indicate a similar trend. Paton et al. described in a later study that monitoring of lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH had increased to 80%, 70%, and 92%, respectively. Monitoring rates increased after.

### The low risk for early renal damage during lithium treatment has not changed over time [^1127cFd9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Modern lithium management guidelines were introduced to improve the renal prognosis of lithium patients.

- **Aims**: To examine whether prospects for severe renal impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease at least stage 4 (CKD4)) in long-term lithium patients have changed over time after the introduction of lithium monitoring guidelines.

- **Methods**: The time to and hazard for CKD4 were compared between three patient cohorts who started long-term lithium in three consecutive decades: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The follow-up time was 10 years after completion of 1-year treatment. The data were collected from Sahlgrenska University Hospital's laboratory database.

- **Results**: In all, 2169 patients were included: 623 in Cohort 1 (started lithium during 1980s), 874 in Cohort 2 (1990s), and 672 in Cohort 3 (2000s). Compliance with lithium monitoring guidelines improved, and mean serum lithium decreased through the cohorts. In all, 22 patients developed CKD4 during follow-up. The time to CKD4 was the same in all three cohorts (overall: 10.96 years, 95% confidence interval: 10.94–11 years). Age and serum creatinine concentration at start were significant risk factors, while sex had no prognostic value. After adjusting for the significant covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in the hazard for CKD4 between the three cohorts.

- **Conclusion**: The risk for severe renal damage during the first decade of long-term lithium is low but has not changed over time. Our data suggest that improved compliance with lithium guidelines is not reflected in less risk for severe renal damage.

### Lithium carbonate [^1177veaM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, it is important to monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed due to increased renal lithium clearance during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, reduce or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to lower neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication. This risk arises from changes in vascular volume that occur during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases, and the renal clearance of lithium may return to pre-pregnancy levels. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery, with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages lower than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and observing for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault).

### Evaluation of thyroid function monitoring in people treated with lithium: Advice based on real-world data [^1164uikN]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Blood test monitoring is essential for the management of lithium treatment, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance recommends 6-monthly serum testing of thyroid function. We examined conformity to these guidelines and the impact of monitoring outside these intervals.

- **Methods**: We extracted serum lithium and thyroid hormone results at one center between January 2009 and December 2020. We identified 266 patients who started lithium during this period with no history of thyroid abnormality within the previous 2 years and were at risk of developing thyroid abnormalities. We examined the interval between tests, the time between the onset of lithium testing and the first thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) outside the laboratory reference range, and assessed the impact of testing outside recommended 6-monthly intervals.

- **Results**: The most common testing frequency was 3 months (± 1 month), accounting for 17.3% of test intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that most thyroid dysfunction manifests within 3 years (proportion with abnormal TSH at 3 years = 91.4%, 19.9% of total patients). In the first 3 months after commencing lithium therapy, eight patients developed subclinical hypothyroidism and had clinical follow-up data available. Of these, half spontaneously normalized without clinical intervention. In the remaining patients, thyroxine replacement was only initiated after multiple occasions of subclinical hypothyroidism (median = 2 years after initiating lithium, range: 6 months to 3 years).

- **Conclusion**: The peak interval at 3 months suggests that thyroid function monitoring at shorter intervals might capture abnormalities earlier, thereby optimizing patient outcomes.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^114vEGuy]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The observation that improvement is needed in terms of compliance with monitoring guidelines is not only seen in patients treated with lithium. The prevalence of lipid and glucose monitoring in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic agents was found by earlier studies to be low as well.

The PHARMO Database Network covers a broad area in the Netherlands. Therefore, one can assume that our findings are generalizable to other patients using lithium in the Netherlands. With this rich database, the odds of being monitored for diverse patient characteristics could be assessed.

Because patients may go to other laboratories not included in the PHARMO Database Network, there is a possible risk of bias due to incomplete laboratory data. In addition, the possibility of hospitalization cannot be ruled out for some patients during the study period or within the six-month period before the initiation of lithium. Some patients may have been admitted to an institution or hospital for a short duration, and lithium treatment may have been initiated there. To lower bias due to missing data, only patients with at least one dispensing in the six-month period before lithium treatment were included. The data provided no information regarding clinical indications for lithium use or comorbidities.

Ideally, the type of healthcare professional requesting laboratory parameters should be evaluated to gain insight into which healthcare professional is most involved in patient monitoring. Unfortunately, only information on the prescriber of lithium was available.

### Lithium [^114SeGUS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or the administration of diuretics. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date. This reduces neonatal concentrations and lowers the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases, and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) on dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and checking for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations].

### Veozah [^114wZR3z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: One 45 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food. Perform baseline hepatic laboratory tests to evaluate for hepatic function and injury before beginning Veozah. While using Veozah, perform follow-up hepatic laboratory tests monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months after initiation of therapy or when signs or symptoms suggest liver injury.

- **Recommended dosage**: Take a single 45 mg Veozah tablet orally once daily with or without food. Take Veozah with liquids and swallow whole. Do not cut, crush, or chew tablets. Administer Veozah orally at about the same time each day. If a dose of Veozah is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the missed dose as soon as possible, unless there is less than 12 hours before the next scheduled dose. Return to the regular schedule the following day.

Perform baseline hepatic laboratory tests to evaluate for hepatic function and injury, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and serum bilirubin (total and direct) before initiating treatment with Veozah. Do not start Veozah if ALT or AST is ≥ 2 × ULN or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 × ULN for the evaluating laboratory.

While using Veozah, perform follow-up hepatic laboratory tests monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months after initiation of therapy. Advise patients to discontinue Veozah immediately and seek medical attention, including hepatic laboratory tests, if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury.

### Lithium in the kidney: Friend and foe [^115u8Ntm]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trace amounts of lithium are essential for our physical and mental health, and the administration of lithium has improved the quality of life for millions of patients with bipolar disorder for over 60 years. However, in a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder, long-term lithium therapy comes at the cost of severe renal side effects, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and, rarely, end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Although the mechanisms underlying lithium-induced renal pathologies are becoming clearer, several recent animal studies revealed that short-term administration of lower amounts of lithium prevents different forms of experimental acute kidney injury (AKI). In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the pathologic and therapeutic effects of lithium in the kidney. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these seemingly paradoxical effects of lithium, in which fine-tuned regulation of glycogen synthase kinase type 3, a prime target for lithium, seems to be key. The new discoveries regarding the protective effect of lithium against AKI in rodents call for follow-up studies in humans and suggest that long-term therapy with low lithium concentrations could be beneficial in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^116REhmR]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The discussion highlights that a considerable number of patients using lithium were not monitored according to the Dutch guidelines. Compliance was relatively higher for laboratory monitoring of creatinine compared to monitoring of lithium serum levels and TSH. The higher proportion of patients being monitored for creatinine might be explained by its frequent inclusion in laboratory protocols, such as during admission laboratory measurements or when necessitated by other medications. In elderly patients, renal function gradually declines, which may be why this parameter is more frequently monitored in this group.

The most recent version of the Dutch Guideline for Bipolar Disorders (2015) states that TSH needs to be monitored at least once a year, instead of every six months. It is possible that some healthcare professionals questioned the previous guideline's advice to monitor TSH every six months, leading to lower compliance before 2015. Some may have directly implemented the 2015 guidelines and monitored TSH at least once annually starting from February, when the guideline was issued.

- **Gender-based compliance**: In general, males were monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines for TSH, but not for creatinine and lithium serum levels.

- **Age-related compliance**: Compliance was especially higher in older patients (> 65 years) compared to those aged < 65 years.

- **Medication-related compliance**: Patients using fewer than five medications were monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines for creatinine.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^111DLEBJ]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Period characteristics**: Age, as determined by year of birth, was assessed in a time-dependent manner at the start of each period. The characteristics of prescribers during lithium use were analyzed. The type of prescriber for lithium was assessed within every period from the pharmacy records and categorized into "medical specialist", "general practitioner", or "both". A medical specialist could, for example, be a psychiatrist or geriatrist.

	- A distinction was made between patients based on the duration of lithium use. Patients were divided into (re-)initiators and prevalent users at the start of each 6-month period. A (re-)initiator of lithium was defined as having a dispensed lithium prescription without a lithium dispensing within the 6 months before the prescription, while being noninstitutionalized (defined as having at least one drug dispensing event for any other drug within 6 months before dispensing). A patient was defined as a prevalent user (maintenance) during consecutive lithium periods of 6 months after the index date. Patients may have had more than one lithium treatment episode.

	- The number of different dispensed medications (based on ATC codes) was determined within each period. Patients were divided into those with polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications including lithium) and those with < 5 medications. It was assessed whether patients with polypharmacy were monitored more often in accordance with the guidelines than patients with < 5 medications.

	- Co-medications interacting with lithium requiring monitoring of lithium according to the G-standard, an ev

Close monitoring of patients on lithium therapy is essential. What are the implications of these findings for the long-term treatment of patients being treated with lithium in clinical practice? First of all, kidney function should be carefully assessed in every patient for whom lithium is considered a viable treatment option and before treatment is started. In an inpatient setting, the measurement of creatinine clearance is recommended as it usually accurately reflects glomerular filtration rate, and complete 24-hour urine collection is feasible.

In an outpatient setting, this may be more difficult; therefore, measuring serum creatinine to calculate the eGFR may represent a reasonable alternative although it is considered less precise in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The eGFR is either provided directly by the laboratory or can be calculated with the help of internet-available calculators, for example, from the UK CKD eGuide on the Renal Association website. Compared to the measurement of serum creatinine alone, both parameters are more sensitive to detecting mild renal insufficiency.

If a patient shows values within the normal range in these assessments and is put on lithium thereafter, serum creatinine to calculate eGFR should be assessed at least twice a year, and more frequently if indicated. This should be supplemented by urinalysis to assess urine concentration ability and proteinuria. If eGFR falls below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m² (generally referred to as chronic kidney disease), a nephrologist should be consulted for discussion and a more comprehensive evaluation on whether to stop lithium.

### A novel, point-of-care test for lithium levels: Description and reliability [^115JPXf4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Lithium is a highly effective agent for numerous psychiatric disorders but requires therapeutic monitoring because of its narrow therapeutic index. This article describes a novel instant blood test that will facilitate the routine monitoring process.

- **Method**: This instant blood test allows the clinician to take a finger-stick sample of whole blood and determine the plasma lithium level in a 2-minute period. This new test is compared with standard laboratory measurements for lithium in human subjects. The reliability of the new test is reported as agreement with standard laboratory values in three studies involving a total of 269 subjects.

- **Results**: The test demonstrates extremely high reliability (r = 0.962, 0.928, 0.983 for studies 1–3, respectively) for the measurement of serum and plasma lithium levels as compared with standard laboratory measures.

- **Conclusion**: This new test is reliable and offers unique advantages over standard laboratory procedures for measuring lithium levels in patients.

### The use of lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder: Recommendations from clinical practice guidelines [^115Nj2Tv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer that is used principally for the management of bipolar disorder (BD). Its administration is complex and often requires sophisticated management and assiduous monitoring. When considering the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, clinicians are advised to refer to recommendations outlined in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); however, varying emphases placed by different international CPGs mean that recommendations addressing the practical use of lithium lack consistency.

- **Method**: In order to inform clinicians of optimal lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, we compared and synthesized recommendations for the treatment of bipolar disorder made by recognized CPGs internationally. We conducted a search of the literature and extracted guidance across multiple clinical issues, including clinical indications, disorder subtypes, additional uses, special populations, practical aspects, and side effects.

- **Results**: Collectively, CPGs consider lithium most robustly as a first-line intervention for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and strongly for the treatment of mania, with relatively modest support for the management of acute bipolar depression. Additionally, there is consensus across the CPGs that lithium tangibly reduces the risk of suicide. Generally, CPGs provide guidance on the many facets of initiating and maintaining patients on lithium therapy, but individually, the CPGs varied in terms of the depth and practical guidance they provide across these areas. However, consensus was established across many key areas of lithium therapy.

Measure the urine protein to creatinine ratio prior to initiation of treatment. Conduct the following laboratory tests at baseline and at periodic intervals until 48 months after the last treatment course of Lemtrada to monitor for early signs of potentially serious adverse effects.

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Conduct prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **Serum creatinine levels**: Assess prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **Urinalysis with urine cell counts**: Perform prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **A test of thyroid function, such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level**: Check prior to treatment initiation and every 3 months thereafter.
- **Serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and total bilirubin levels**: Test prior to treatment initiation and periodically thereafter.

Conduct baseline and yearly skin exams to monitor for melanoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^115HvyjM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

We excluded patients who had received a lithium prescription but never exceeded 0.2 mmol/L in lithium concentration. Further exclusions included patients who reinstated lithium within 3 months of discontinuation. A lithium-free period of 3 months was chosen based on experiences with amiodarone, assuming reversible effects on the thyroid would subside in this timeframe. Patients were also excluded if we could not clearly attribute thyroid dysfunction to lithium. This involved patients who had:

- Started TRT before or on the same day as lithium
- Used lithium short-term and discontinued within 3 months
- Commenced TRT 3 months or more after discontinuation
- Received TRT as an adjuvant treatment for depression rather than thyroid dysfunction correction
- Initiated and ceased TRT during lithium treatment

Hypothyroidism was considered reversible if TRT could be ceased post-discontinuation without persistent TSH elevation during follow-up. We explored hypothyroidism reversibility at intervals within 2, 5, and 10 years post-discontinuation. Thyroid status was categorized into six groups: normal, overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, low free serum T4, unclassified, and hyperthyroidism.

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^115wWXEL]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, particularly concerning laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend considering maintaining serum lithium levels at 0.8–1.0 mEq/L (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) for a trial period of at least six months in patients with bipolar disorder who:

- **Have experienced a relapse**: While taking lithium in the past.
- **Are experiencing subthreshold symptoms**: With functional impairment while taking lithium.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^112pgDsz]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **What is the best timing of blood sampling**: No study was found that addressed this question, but most of the included studies followed the generally accepted recommendation to sample blood 12 ± 1 hours after the last (i.e. evening) intake. There was also consensus on this practice among the task force members for patients taking lithium twice daily or taking lithium once daily in the evening. However, there was no consensus on whether to sample in the evening or the next morning for patients taking lithium once daily in the morning, a dosing schedule probably hardly applied in clinical practice.

- **Should the recommendations be different for dosing once daily vs twice daily and for immediate release vs extended release formulations**: There is pharmacogenetic evidence that a total daily dose of lithium given once daily results in a 10–15% higher 12 ± 1 hours trough level than when given twice daily. Nevertheless, there was consensus among the task force members that one could follow the same recommendations for optimal lithium serum levels for both dosing strategies. Similarly, the members also agreed that the recommendations should be the same for different formulations (immediate release vs extended release).

An important clinical implication of this approach is that the relatively small changes in 12 ± 1 hours trough levels caused by changes in dosing schedule or lithium formulation should not necessarily lead to adjustments of the aimed lithium levels. In the absence of solid evidence to support an alternative approach, this simple pragmatic approach is reasonable.

### Lithium related thyroid and parathyroid disease: Updated clinical practice guidelines are needed [^112ixuXP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of and determine physician approaches to the screening and management of lithium-associated thyroid and parathyroid disorders in British Columbia, Canada.

- **Methods**: Serum lithium and thyroid/parathyroid laboratory data were collected retrospectively for patients with lithium levels measured at seven BC hospitals between 2012 and 2021. A mail-out survey about screening and management of thyroid/parathyroid disorders in patients on lithium was sent to the ordering physicians of patients with abnormal results. Three months after, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to respondents, and the original survey was re-sent to non-responders.

- **Results**: Of 4,917 patients, 1.9% had PTH (mean 22.33 ± 23.00 pmol/L) and 77.1% had TSH (mean 3.61 ± 6.69 pmol/L) measured. Of 222 hypercalcemic patients (defined as any serum calcium or ionized calcium above the laboratory reference), 17.6% had a PTH level measured. From 294 surveys sent to 214 physicians, the overall response rate was 31.6% (n = 93) with twelve fully completed surveys. All twelve respondents monitored TSH levels every 6–12 months, and eight physicians monitored PTH and/or calcium at variable intervals. Two physicians routinely ordered both thyroid and parathyroid screening laboratory tests. Of the 80 non-respondents, limited patient contact was the most common reason for opting out (n = 27).

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest biochemical screening for lithium-associated parathyroid disorders is less common than for thyroid disorders. There is insufficient data to determine.

### Lithium: Clinical considerations in internal medicine [^114hGEwj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorders affect up to 5% of the population. While the pharmacological options for their treatment have expanded over the past several years, lithium remains an inexpensive and efficacious treatment. It has been demonstrated to be effective for acute mania, bipolar depression, the prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder, and as an augmentation agent in the treatment of unipolar major depression. Notably, lithium is the only mood stabilizer proven to lower the suicide rate in patients with bipolar disorder.

- **Use in special populations, side effects, and toxicity**: These aspects are discussed in detail.
- **Drug interactions**: Important interactions are examined.
- **Laboratory monitoring guidelines**: The review includes vital guidelines for monitoring.

Lithium remains an important intervention for the treatment of mood disorders.

### Lithobid [^11524MyS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Dosage and administration

- **Acute mania**: Optimal patient response can usually be achieved with 1800 mg/day. Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium concentration ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum concentrations and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and serum lithium concentrations is necessary. Serum concentrations should be determined twice per week during the acute phase and until the serum concentrations and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

- **Long-term control**: Desirable serum lithium concentrations are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L, which can usually be achieved with 900 to 1200 mg/day. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but generally, the following dosages will maintain this concentration. Serum lithium concentrations in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L. Geriatric patients often respond to reduced dosages and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum concentrations ordinarily tolerated by other patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

- **Important considerations**: Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be carefully timed and managed to ensure accurate readings and patient safety.

### Decoding laboratory test names: A major challenge to appropriate patient care [^114ticPx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory tests have no value if clinicians cannot quickly order and obtain the results they need. We found that efforts to obtain even the most commonly ordered tests are often derailed by excessively complex nomenclature. Ordering the right laboratory tests is critical to diagnosis and treatment, but existing mechanisms for entering lab orders actively interfere with physicians' efforts to provide good clinical care.

Rather than simplifying lab orders, the advent of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems — generally programmed by non-clinicians — has introduced new and vexing practical problems. Medical laboratories have filled their test menus, whether paper or electronic, with bewildering nomenclature and abbreviations, and have failed to appreciate the dangers of assigning perilously similar names to different tests. The efficient and efficacious patient care demanded by the quality care initiative requires progress beyond traditional solutions, such as convening naming conventions, to the development of innovative software with intelligent, real-time, clinically driven search functions that will allow these programs to help rather than hinder physicians.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^115AGgF6]. Bipolar disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Patients who had received lithium prescriptions from general practitioners were monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines regarding lithium serum levels (60% vs 66%; OR 0.72; 0.67‐0.80), creatinine (69% vs 74%; OR 0.63; 0.57‐0.69), and TSH (44% vs 59%; OR 0.54; 0.49‐0.59) compared to patients who had received prescriptions from medical specialists. In addition, patients who had received lithium prescriptions from a general practitioner only were additionally monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines for all three parameters compared to patients who had received lithium prescriptions from both a general practitioner and a medical specialist.

Patients defined as initiators were more often monitored in compliance with the guidelines for TSH compared to prevalent users (73% vs 54%; OR 2.21; 1.65‐2.95).

Patients were dispensed on average five different other medications (IQR 2‐8) per 6‐month period in addition to lithium. The proportion of patients monitored in compliance with the guidelines was slightly higher for patients on fewer than five medications compared to the proportion of patients with polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications) for lithium serum levels (65% vs 64%; OR 1.11; 1.02‐1.22), lower for creatinine (69% vs 77%; OR 0.82; 0.74‐0.90), but not significantly different for TSH.

Patients not receiving interacting co‐medication were monitored less often in accordance with the guidelines for lithium serum levels (64% vs 67%; OR 0.87; 0.78‐0.96) compared to patients receiving interacting co‐medication, but not for creatinine and TSH.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^113pb1xi]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Thus, this study fulfilled only two of the original inclusion criteria (5 and 6). Further limitations include that the study was not blind and only the number of bipolar (BP) patients who were included is presented, leaving it unclear how many BP patients completed the study and how many dropped out.

Nolen published a post-hoc analysis of a long-term study intended to test the efficacy of quetiapine. In this study, patients with BP-1 disorder who had a recent manic or depressive episode and achieved remission during four or more weeks of open-label treatment with quetiapine monotherapy were randomized to two years of treatment: continued quetiapine or switch to placebo or lithium. According to the protocol, the 418 patients in the lithium arm should have received a lithium dose resulting in a 12-hour lithium level of 0.60–1.20 mmol/L, guided by a "programmed automatic system" to alert treating clinicians to adjust the dose while maintaining the blind to the drug (lithium, quetiapine, or placebo). However, in 54 patients, no blood levels were measured, while in 137 patients, the mean lithium levels remained below the minimum predefined level of 0.60 mmol/L, probably due to a failure of the programmed automatic system to adjust the dose, rather than due to adverse events or early response (being the most important indicators of channeling). This circumstance created the possibility to compare these 137 patients with the 201 patients receiving lithium within the predefined range of 0.60–1.20 mmol/L and with the patients receiving placebo (n = 404). The endpoint was a recurrence defined as the "initiation of [psychotic treatment]".

### Monitoring lithium therapy: The impact of a quality improvement programme in the UK [^1137JEnq]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The study was designed to test an audit-based quality improvement programme (QIP) addressing lithium prescribing and monitoring in UK mental health services.

- **Methods**: A baseline clinical audit was conducted against the following standards: (i) measurement of renal and thyroid function before initiating treatment with lithium, and (ii) recommended monitoring of serum lithium and renal and thyroid function during maintenance treatment. A re-audit was conducted at 18 months and a supplementary audit at three years.

- **Results**: Data were submitted for patients at baseline (n = 3,373), re-audit (n = 3,647), and supplementary audit (n = 5,683), 57% of whom had bipolar disorder. The baseline findings prompted a patient safety alert issued by the National Patient Safety Agency. By supplementary audit, the proportion of patients having four serum lithium tests over the previous year had increased from 30% at baseline to 48%, and the respective proportions that had two tests of renal function from 55% to 70% and thyroid function from 49% to 66%. Elderly patients and those prescribed a drug known to interact with lithium were not more likely to be monitored in line with the audit standards. Between baseline and supplementary audit, the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder prescribed an antidepressant increased from 36% to 41%.

- **Conclusions**: Improvements in biochemical monitoring of lithium treatment were achieved over time with participation in a QIP that included benchmarking of performance against clinical standards and customized change intervention.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^113kUJBb]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS 24.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were employed to determine the percentage of patients who had been monitored in compliance with the guidelines for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH over a 6-month period. Additionally, the percentages of patients being monitored during the total follow-up of lithium use were determined for all three parameters. A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the proportion of patients being monitored over a 9-month period for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH.

The strength of the association between patient and period characteristics and guideline monitoring adherence was assessed using logistic regression analysis, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). ORs for being monitored according to the guidelines, compared to not being monitored according to the guidelines, were calculated for the covariates: sex, age, type of prescriber, treatment status (initiation or maintenance), number of prescribed medications (< 5 or ≥ 5 medications), interacting co-medication, and days with laboratory measurements other than lithium, creatinine, or TSH. All ORs were adjusted for all patient and period characteristics.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^112rmq96]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Description of the included trials**: Jerram 21 included "just over 80" patients with bipolar (BP) or unipolar depressive (UP) disorder, of whom 51 BP (and 22 UP) patients completed the one-year study, indicating that about 10 BP or UP patients dropped out. At baseline, all patients were in remission and using lithium while potential use of other psychotropic medication is not reported. Patients were randomized to three different a priori defined 12-hour lithium level ranges: < 0.50; 0.50–0.69, and ≥ 0.70 mmol/L. The endpoint was "need for additional psychotropic medication and/or admission".

	- Thus, this study fulfilled 4 of the 6 original inclusion criteria (2, 3, 5, and 6). Other limitations are that the minimum and maximum lithium levels were not defined for the lower and upper lithium level ranges respectively, the randomization procedure is unclear, the study was not blind, blood was collected between 12 and 16 hours after the last intake, and only the number of BP patients who completed the study is presented, leaving unclear how many BP patients were included and how many dropped out.

	- Waters 22 included 36 BP patients of whom 29 completed the one-year study. It is uncertain whether patients were in remission, as they "had to have reported residual endogenous mood swings which had not required hospitalization" in the past 2 years, indicating that this study was not a pure recurrence prevention study. At baseline randomization, all were using lithium while potential use of other psychotropic medication is not reported. Patients were randomized to two different…

### Lithobid [^1156jBin]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Diuretic-, ACE-, and ARB-induced sodium loss may increase serum lithium concentrations. It is recommended to start with lower doses of lithium or reduce the dosage, while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity. See warnings for additional caution information.

Concomitant administration of lithium with serotonergic drugs can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during lithium initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of lithium and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs. Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).

Concomitant administration of methyldopa, phenytoin, or carbamazepine with lithium may increase the risk of adverse reactions with these drugs.

The following drugs can lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion: acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations, and alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate.

Extended use of iodide preparations, especially potassium iodide, with lithium may result in hypothyroidism.

Use of calcium channel blocking agents with lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxicity, presenting as ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or tinnitus.

Use of metronidazole with lithium may provoke lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be closely monitored.

### Is lithium monitoring NICE? Lithium monitoring in a UK secondary care setting [^116S7gUu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Lithium is widely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Owing to its narrow therapeutic index and side-effect profile, regular monitoring of serum levels, renal, and thyroid function has been recommended by all major guidelines on lithium use.

- **Objectives**: We investigated whether lithium monitoring during maintenance phase treatment in clinical practice meets the latest recommendation by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (i.e. lithium levels between 0.6 and 1.0 mmol/L and lithium level, thyroid, and renal function tests every 6 months) in one of the largest mental health organizations in Europe, the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data were extracted from SLaM's Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system. Adult patients with a psychiatric disorder who were on lithium at any point during the period January 2012–January 2016 and had at least one lithium level test result in the system were included in the analyses.

- **Results**: A total of 2639 lithium level test results were retrieved for 412 patients. Overall, the serum level was within the recommended range in 50.7% of all tests, below the range in 42.4%, and above in 6.9%. Lithium level, renal, and thyroid function tests were performed at the recommended frequency of 6 months (or less) in 76.2%, 72.7%, and 60.2% of patients, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: These data demonstrate that there is a gap between the NICE 2014 recommendation and lithium monitoring practice in secondary care, with a high number of lithium level results below the recommended range.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^113vCjEn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The date of the electronic prescription when lithium was started or discontinued was manually validated in the medical records for all patients. This way, we established the total time of lithium exposure. At this point, the psychiatric diagnosis at initiation of lithium treatment was excerpted. Equally, we validated the accuracy of the start and stop date of TRT in the medical records. If no specific date for discontinuation could be established, for example, if a patient stopped treatment without notifying healthcare personnel, we estimated the stop date from the doctors' notes.

- **Chart review and analysis**: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all eligible patients from 1997 to 31 December 2015. We additionally checked for lithium, TRT, and TFT in medical records dating back to 1965 to ensure we had not missed any previous treatment periods. We followed the clinical course of lithium-associated hypothyroidism and its treatment according to a predefined process flow chart.

- **Outcome parameters**: We mapped the clinical course with the following parameters, which we then stratified further by age and sex: (a) time from lithium start to TRT start, (b) TSH and fT4 levels at which TRT was initiated, (c) proportion of patients who had discontinued TRT having stopped lithium, (d) time from stopping lithium to stopping TRT, and (e) proportion of patients requiring reinstatement of TRT.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^115U84dk]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: For this retrospective follow-up study, the monitoring of ambulatory patients treated with lithium was assessed in multiple regions in the Netherlands. Data were obtained from the PHARMO Database Network, a population-based network of electronic databases from primary and secondary health care settings in the Netherlands. The PHARMO Database Network is a large patient-centered data network, including multiple linked observational databases designed for use in pharmacoepidemiology and outcomes studies of drugs, which collates patient records in geographically defined areas throughout the Netherlands.

Mandatory health insurance requires patients to register with a general practitioner, and most patients are registered with a single pharmacy in the Netherlands. To address the objectives of the study, data from the Out-patient Pharmacy Database and the Clinical Laboratory Database were used.

- **Out-patient Pharmacy Database**: This database comprises all general practitioner- and specialist-prescribed health care products dispensed by out-patient pharmacies and covers a catchment area representing 4.2 million residents. The dispensing records include information on the type of product, strength, dosage regimen, dispensing date, quantity dispensed, and prescriber specialty. Dispensed drugs are coded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.

- **Clinical Laboratory Database**: This database comprises results of tests performed on clinical specimens. These laboratory tests are requested by general practitioners.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^112pu8fB]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Outcomes

Lithium serum levels were monitored in 65% of periods of lithium use, creatinine in 73%, and TSH in 54% of periods of lithium use.

- **Laboratory tests conducted compliant with the guidelines**: About half of all patients were monitored according to the guidelines during the total follow-up of lithium use for lithium serum levels (46%) and creatinine (47%), and about one fifth for TSH (21%). About one seventh (16%) of patients were monitored according to the guidelines for all three parameters during the total period of lithium use.

Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the percentages of monitoring compliant with the guidelines in periods increased to 69%, 79%, and 68%, respectively, for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH when measured over a 9-month period. During total follow-up, the percentage of monitoring in compliance with the guidelines increased to 56%, 63%, and 42% for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH, respectively.

Characteristics of periods monitored in compliance with the guidelines

Monitoring of lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH seemed to be correlated with different characteristics. Between subgroups, the odds for being monitored differed for some characteristics. Males were less often monitored for TSH according to the guidelines compared to females (52% vs. 56%; OR 0.83; 0.77–0.90).

### Lithium specificity in bipolar illness: a classic agent for the classic disorder [^114tLJcy]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

For over half a century, lithium has been the gold standard among the pharmacological armamentarium used to treat bipolar disorder. Its ascendancy can be attributed partly to its primacy of discovery and clinical implementation. It is crucial to consider how lithium has achieved success, retained its prominence, and whether this is due to its unique profile and specificity of actions.

This paper briefly discusses the clinical evidence supporting lithium's specificity and argues for its continued use in patients most likely to benefit, namely, those with 'classic' bipolar disorder. Accurate characterization of 'lithium responders' through focused research is likely to yield novel treatments and provide better understanding of the pathophysiology of the illness. The unique antisuicidal actions of lithium merit further examination, as do its impressive properties as a prophylactic agent, given the high morbidity associated with bipolar disorder and its potential for suicide.

Hence, this paper describes the changing diagnostic backdrop against which much of the research at the time of writing has been conducted. It discusses the clinical therapeutic profile of lithium in both acute and long-term management of bipolar disorder and its phenotypic specificity of action. It demonstrates that lithium possesses significant clinical and therapeutic efficacy, which is very individual, thus remaining the treatment of choice for bipolar disorder when used specifically in select patient populations.

### Saliva testing as a means to monitor therapeutic lithium levels in patients with psychiatric disorders: Identification of clinical and environmental covariates, and their incorporation into a prediction model [^11681dKb]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). High credibility.

The advantages of using saliva rather than blood are numerous, primarily because it does not require trained personnel for collection and can be performed in various settings. These features could directly translate into more frequent and improved lithium monitoring for both outpatients and inpatients. For outpatients, saliva sampling allows at-home collection, enabling patients to schedule lithium measurements around the last dosing, food, and other activities, without the need to arrange and attend a pathology clinic. Additionally, lithium measurements could be taken from saliva samples collected during phases of acute bipolar illness when an individual might be unable to attend a pathology clinic. Knowledge of plasma lithium levels during these times would assist clinicians in determining the optimal therapeutic dose. Such results could be organized in a lithium therapy chart alongside symptoms, medication tolerability, general health, and significant life events, as outlined by the Lithiumeter guide, providing a comprehensive overview of illness and treatment.

Overall, at-home sampling would more accurately predict an individual's lithium level around other potentially confounding activities. This is crucial as the prescription of lithium medications is based on the level in the blood 12 hours after an individual's last dose, which is challenging to capture precisely during a clinical appointment. While no association was found between the time elapsed from the last dose to blood collection and either salivary lithium, serum lithium, or saliva/serum lithium ratios, previous research by Serdar suggests.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^116u9NcL]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Mood stabilizers aim to prevent manic and depressive relapses in patients with bipolar disorder during maintenance therapy. The balance between the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy needs to be monitored and evaluated for each patient before and periodically during treatment. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide instructions regarding both clinical and biomarker monitoring. Clinical monitoring includes the observation of both signs and symptoms, while biomarker monitoring can be divided into monitoring of physical and laboratory parameters. Although the need for monitoring patients treated with psychotropic drugs is widely recognized, adherence to monitoring guidelines is often found to be suboptimal. For example, monitoring rates of metabolic parameters such as weight, glucose, and lipids in patients using antipsychotic drugs have been found not to correspond with advice given in CPGs, posing unnecessary risks of morbidity to patients.

Lithium is approved for the acute treatment of mania and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and is also used to augment antidepressant therapy in unipolar depression. Monitoring lithium serum levels is important to prevent harm and improve effectiveness among its users. The effectiveness of the treatment may decrease during subtherapeutic lithium serum levels, increasing the risk of relapse or recurrence, while higher lithium serum levels may be associated with a higher risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects related to renal and thyroid function frequently occur.

### Estimating the 12-hour serum lithium level (eLi): Development and two proof-of-concept studies [^1138Gh7h]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to address the issue that most serum lithium (se-Li) tests do not comply with the required timing of 12 hours post-lithium intake. Our aim was to develop an equation to estimate the 12-hour se-Li levels when lithium blood tests are taken at time points other than the prescribed 12 hours.

The methods involved developing the equation through secondary analyses using data from the Bipolar Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness (CHOICE) trial. The equation was then verified in two separate proof-of-concept studies. The Bipolar CHOICE trial included 122 lithium-treated patients with 192 se-Li measurements, where patients self-reported the time since lithium intake. The proof-of-concept studies tested the equation's accuracy by measuring se-Li concentrations at various time points up to 24 hours after lithium intake. These studies were performed in Boston, US (5 patients, 10 se-Li measurements) and Aarhus, Denmark (21 patients, 159 se-Li measurements).

The results present a simple equation for calculating the estimated 12-hour se-Li level (eLi 12) based on the measured se-Li level at the patient-reported time of the last lithium dose intake. The accuracy was confirmed in both proof-of-concept studies, where eLi 12 showed a mean deviation from the 12-hour se-Li level of 10%, compared to 25% for the measured se-Li (P < .0001). For 99 out of 102 (97%) blood tests taken between 3 and 24 hours after the last lithium dose, eLi 12 was closer to the 12-hour level than the actual measured se-Li level.

eLi 12 provides clinicians with more accurate 12-hour se-Li estimations and offers patients flexibility regarding when to schedule blood tests.

- **Warning: Risks of hepatotoxicity**: Hepatotoxicity has occurred with the use of Veozah in the postmarketing setting [5.1]. Perform hepatic laboratory tests prior to initiation of treatment to evaluate for hepatic function and injury. Do not start Veozah if either aminotransferase is ≥ 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory. Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory testing monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months of treatment [2.1, 5.1].

	- Advise patients to discontinue Veozah immediately and seek medical attention, including hepatic laboratory tests, if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury (new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain) [2.1, 5.1]. Discontinue Veozah if transaminase elevations are > 5 × ULN, or if transaminase elevations are > 3 × ULN and the total bilirubin level is > 2 × ULN. If transaminase elevations > 3 × ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution [5.1].

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^117TdQdM]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Thus, this study only fulfilled 2 of the original inclusion criteria (1 and 6). Another limitation is that the study was not blind.

Gelenberg studied 94 BP‐1 patients, of whom 59 completed the 3‐year trial. All patients had to be stable for at least 2 months since the last episode and also at least 2 months tolerating lithium at serum levels of 0.60‐1.00 mmol/L, while the potential use of other psychotropic medication at the start or during the trial is not reported. At baseline, patients were randomized to 2 different a priori defined lithium level ranges: 0.40‐0.60 and 0.80‐1.00 mmol/L. The endpoint was a recurrence of mania or major depression, defined by DSM‐III or RDC criteria.

Thus, this study fulfilled 5 of the original inclusion criteria (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). A source of bias could be the abrupt lowering of the lithium levels at randomization in patients previously responding to high levels, resulting in a risk of drug‐discontinuation related morbidity. Another limitation is that only the patients, but not the investigators/clinicians, were blind to the dosage assignment.

Vestergaard included 57 BP and 34 UP patients in a 2‐year follow‐up trial. At baseline, all patients were still hospitalized (indicating that they were not in remission and implying that it was not a real recurrence prevention study) and about half of them were still using antipsychotics or antidepressants. Whether some patients were also already using lithium remains unclear in the report. At baseline, patients were randomized double-blind to 2 different a priori defined lithium level ranges of 0.50‐0.80 and…

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^116rV6uY]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Laboratory monitoring of patients using lithium is important to prevent harm and to increase effectiveness. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium overall and within subgroups.

Patients having at least one lithium dispensing for 6 months or longer between January 2010 and December 2015 were identified retrospectively using data from the Dutch PHARMO Database Network. Laboratory monitoring was defined as being compliant with the Dutch Multidisciplinary Clinical Guideline Bipolar Disorders when lithium serum levels, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) had been measured at least every 6 months during lithium use.

Data were analyzed from 1583 patients with a median duration of 7- to 6-month period of lithium use. Results indicated that patients had been monitored over a 6-month period for lithium serum levels 65% of the time, for creatinine 73% of the time, and for TSH 54% of the time. Just over one-seventh (16%) of patients had been monitored in compliance with the guidelines for all three parameters during total follow-up. Especially males, patients aged below 65 years, patients receiving prescriptions solely from general practitioners, prevalent users of lithium, patients without interacting co-medication, and patients without other days with laboratory measurements had been monitored less frequently in compliance with the guidelines.

A considerable proportion of patients had not been monitored in accordance with the guidelines.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^116SAq4P]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

For this study, 1340 patients were potentially eligible, meeting the sampling requirements. According to our consent procedures, we could include 1098 patients, 58% of whom were women. We identified 181 patients who had received an electronic prescription for thyroid replacement therapy (TRT) after starting lithium, 75% of whom were women (p < 0.01). Of these 181 patients, 91 patients were excluded according to our procedures. Thus, the final sample consisted of 90 patients (Figure 2).

- **Sample characteristics**: Of the final sample, women accounted for 70% of patients who received TRT in the context of lithium treatment. Of all patients, 70% were younger than 60 years. More patients had subclinical than overt hyperthyroidism at the point of starting TRT. For 17% of patients, thyroid function tests (TFT) were either normal or difficult to interpret at the start of TRT.

- **Time from starting lithium to starting TRT**: The mean delay from lithium to TRT start was 2.3 years (SD = 4.7) with a median of 10 months (9.5 months, min. 15 days, max. 29 years). In total, 90% started within 5.5 years of lithium initiation. TRT initiation closely followed the first elevated TSH. Men and women took approximately the same time from starting lithium to starting TRT (log rank test p = 0.76). However, patients younger than 60 years started TRT significantly faster than patients aged 60 years or older (log rank test p < 0.001). The mean time from lithium to TRT start was 1.1 years (SD = 1.5, min. 14 days, max. 8.8 years) for patients younger than 60 years, and 5.1 years for patients aged 60 years or older.

### Quality of laboratory biomarker monitoring during treatment with lithium in patients with bipolar disorder [^112YHgN6]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend monitoring of creatinine and lithium throughout treatment with lithium. We assessed the extent to which this monitoring occurs in healthcare in Sweden.

- **Methods**: This observational study examined all adults with bipolar disorder starting lithium therapy in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2007 to 2018. The main outcome was the monitoring of blood lithium and creatinine at therapy initiation and/or once annually. The secondary outcome was the monitoring of calcium and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Patients were followed up until therapy cessation, death, out-migration, or to the end of 2018.

- **Results**: We identified 4,428 adults with bipolar disorder who started lithium therapy and were followed up for up to 11 years. Their median age was 39 years, and 63% were women. The median duration on lithium therapy was 4.3 years (IQR: 1.9–7.45), and the majority who discontinued therapy started another mood stabilizer soon after. Overall, 21% began lithium therapy without assessing the serum/plasma concentration of creatinine. The proportion of people who did not have both lithium and creatinine measured increased from 21% in the first year to 33% in the eleventh year. The proportion with annual testing for TSH or calcium was slightly lower. Only 16% of patients had both lithium and creatinine tested once annually during their complete time on lithium.

- **Conclusions**: In a Swedish community sample, lithium and creatinine monitoring was inconsistent with guideline recommendations that call for the annual measurement of biomarker levels.

### The low risk for early renal damage during lithium treatment has not changed over time [^115ut4BN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Modern lithium management guidelines were introduced to improve the renal prognosis of lithium patients.

- **Aims**: To examine whether prospects for severe renal impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease at least stage 4 (CKD4)) in long-term lithium patients have changed over time following the introduction of lithium monitoring guidelines.

- **Methods**: The time to and hazard for CKD4 were compared between three patient cohorts who started long-term lithium in three consecutive decades: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The follow-up time was 10 years after completion of 1-year treatment. The data were collected from Sahlgrenska University Hospital's laboratory database.

- **Results**: In all, 2169 patients were included: 623 in Cohort 1 (started lithium during the 1980s), 874 in Cohort 2 (1990s), and 672 in Cohort 3 (2000s). Compliance with lithium monitoring guidelines improved, and mean serum lithium decreased through the cohorts. In all, 22 patients developed CKD4 during follow-up. The time to CKD4 was the same in all three cohorts (overall: 10.96 years, 95% confidence interval: 10.94–11 years). Age and serum creatinine concentration at the start were significant risk factors, while sex had no prognostic value. After adjusting for the significant covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in the hazard for CKD4 between the three cohorts.

The risk for severe renal damage during the first decade of long-term lithium treatment is low but has not changed over time. Our data suggest that improved compliance with lithium guidelines is not reflected in less risk for severe renal impairment.

### Lithium carbonate [^113DM5Jn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Lithium can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort, as well as with drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, such as MAOIs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Monitor all patients taking lithium for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with lithium and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of lithium with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

- **Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism**: Lithium is concentrated within the thyroid and can inhibit thyroid synthesis and release, which can lead to hypothyroidism. Where hypothyroidism exists, careful monitoring of thyroid function during lithium stabilization and maintenance allows for correction.

### The low risk for early renal damage during lithium treatment has not changed over time [^1145QGaz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The study presents several limitations. It is retrospective and relies on data not specifically collected for the study. The low incidence of CKD4 and CKD5 over the 10 years of follow-up may lead to type 2 error, suggesting that a longer timeframe may be needed to detect possible differences.

Treatment variables were calculated based on assumptions about laboratory data. One year without a lithium measurement was regarded as treatment interruption; however, it could actually represent a treatment period with very poor compliance.

In the multivariate analysis, three variables were used: cohort, age at index start, and S-creatinine at index start. The total number of events was 22, resulting in less than 10 events per variable (EPV). This breaches the rule of thumb stating that a Cox model should include at least 10 EPV. However, studies have shown that the model's performance when using 5–9 EPV is fairly comparable to that for 10–16 EPV, especially when the multivariate model is used to adjust for covariates.

No adjustments have been made for somatic comorbidities or associated medications that influence the progression of renal impairment. This is an important limitation, as later cohorts may have included a higher proportion of patients with somatic comorbidities. This is indicated by the lower eGFR at the index start in later cohorts, despite a lower age at index start.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^112kwiXT]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The covariates examined for their effect on the CIF are as follows:

- **Treatment**: Using lithium as the reference, binary dummy variables were created for the non-lithium treatments.

- **Age at treatment**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among older patients.

- **Sex**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among female patients.

- **Patient visit days in the year preceding monotherapy**: Serves as a proxy for engagement with the health care system before monotherapy.

- **Thyroid testing in the 14 days preceding monotherapy**: Addresses observation bias — patients who tested positive for hypothyroidism were excluded, as patients receiving lithium are more likely to be tested pretreatment than those receiving other therapies.

- **Nonparametric thyroid testing rank during monotherapy**: Used to adjust for observation bias, acknowledging that hypothyroidism should not be diagnosed without a thyroid test, and not all treatments have comparable thyroid testing. We used the following SNOMED-CT procedure concepts and their descendants to count thyroid tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement (61167004), thyroid hormone measurement (390780008), thyrotropin-releasing hormone test (252219000), thyroid panel (35650009), and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins measurement (104972000).

To account for different observation times, covariates were calculated as follows. For each patient, the competition rank of the patient's number of thyroid tests was found among the smallest time interval centered around the patient's treatment time that included at least 50 patients, and this was then normalized.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^113KivXk]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Delphi method**: Anticipating that our literature review would fall short of providing clear evidence-based conclusions and definite guidance regarding optimal lithium serum levels, we concurrently developed a survey consisting of clinical questions and corresponding statements using the Delphi method. Informed by the findings of clinical trials that have been conducted and by existing reviews and guidelines, we formulated 32 statements on 16 clinical questions (see Supplemental Table S1) presented to all 50 Task Force members, representing 15 countries. They were asked to score all statements as "Agree" or "Not agree", with the option in several statements to mark a preferred, more specified response. For statements endorsed by at least 80% of the participating members, consensus was considered as having been achieved.

Two survey rounds were initially planned. In the first survey round, we tested the statements and, besides asking members to choose among the additional responses, we also asked for comments on the statements and on the additional responses. After having received the responses and comments, it was concluded that a second survey round was not needed as the comments received did not reveal a need to change statements or responses.
