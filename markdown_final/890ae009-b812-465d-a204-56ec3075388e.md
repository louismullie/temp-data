## Question

Roaccutane

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Roaccutane (isotretinoin), preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the licensed indications and where guidelines diverge. Next, I will review the mechanism of action, followed by dosing and administration. After that, I need to examine the teratogenicity and pregnancy prevention programs. I will then assess adverse effects and monitoring, including psychiatric risk. I should also consider special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing recommendations and a concise conclusion, ensuring each point is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and nomenclature. Roaccutane is the brand name for isotretinoin, also known as 13-cis-retinoic acid, and is marketed under multiple names including Accutane, Absorica, Claravis, Zenatane, Myorisan, and others, which are not interchangeable in terms of bioavailability and dosing, so I need to ensure the specific product is named in prescriptions and counseling to avoid substitution errors [^11221Lkq] [^111sW4xJ].

> I need to check the licensed indication versus guideline scope. The UK MHRA license restricts isotretinoin to severe forms of acne (nodular, conglobate, or acne at risk of permanent scarring) that are resistant to adequate courses of systemic antibiotics and topical therapy, and mandates prescriber expertise and oversight, which I should explicitly document in the record [^115FZBzG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — international guidelines often broaden use to severe acne or acne with significant psychosocial burden or scarring, and some recommend considering isotretinoin after failure of standard therapy rather than only for the most severe nodulocystic disease, so I should align indication with local regulation and patient-specific severity and impact [^115sg9Qn] [^11121thf] [^114fRucE].

> Let me consider the mechanism of action to anchor expectations. Isotretinoin reduces sebaceous gland size and sebum output, normalizes keratinization to prevent microcomedones, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects, which explains its broad efficacy across acne pathophysiology; I should confirm patients understand that these effects underlie both efficacy and mucocutaneous adverse effects like cheilitis and xerosis [^112GrzCe] [^115FZBzG].

> Next, I should review dosing and administration. Standard dosing is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses with food for 15–20 weeks, with the option to adjust up to 2 mg/kg/day in severe, scarring, or trunk-predominant disease if tolerated; once-daily dosing is not recommended, and absorption is significantly reduced without fatty meals, so I need to reinforce meal timing and capsule swallowing instructions to avoid underexposure and relapse [^111qyZtH] [^111m3WnN]. Wait, let me verify the cumulative dose concept — many clinicians target a cumulative dose around 120–150 mg/kg to reduce relapse risk, but I should clarify that this is practice-based rather than label-mandated and must be individualized to response and tolerability [^notfound].

> I will now examine teratogenicity and pregnancy prevention, since this is the most critical safety domain. Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic with a boxed warning; in the US, the iPLEDGE REMS requires prescriber certification, two negative pregnancy tests before initiation (with the second in a CLIA-certified lab), monthly pregnancy tests, and use of two effective forms of contraception for one month before, during, and one month after therapy, with strict 7-day prescription pickup windows for those who can become pregnant; I should double-check that documentation and counseling are complete before the first dose [^116zD6qE] [^111sW4xJ] [^117QVWEk]. Hold on, I should verify test timing — if cycles are irregular or amenorrheic, the second test should immediately precede therapy after one month of contraception, and I must counsel on drug interactions that can reduce contraceptive efficacy, including certain antibiotics and herbal products [^117QVWEk] [^111sViZr].

> Let me think about adverse effects and monitoring, and I should be careful not to over-test. Common effects include cheilitis, xerosis, photosensitivity, arthralgia, and dose-dependent triglyceride and cholesterol elevations; rare but serious risks include pseudotumor cerebri (especially with tetracyclines), hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, IBD, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and psychiatric symptoms including depression and suicidality, so I need to screen and counsel accordingly and adjust dose or discontinue if significant adverse effects occur [^114HLuyA] [^11221Lkq]. Wait, I initially thought routine monthly labs were universally required, but I should correct that — evidence suggests that in healthy young patients without risk factors, routine CBC and frequent LFTs may not be necessary, whereas fasting lipids and LFTs at baseline with selective follow-up are reasonable; AAD 2024 advises considering LFTs and lipids and explicitly recommends against routine CBC in healthy patients, so I should tailor testing to risk and local policy while ensuring I do not miss clinically significant signals [^116TWmEa] [^11773Egv] [^117QVWEk].

> I should confirm psychiatric risk assessment and monitoring. A 2024 meta-analysis found no significant increase in depression, anxiety, or suicide compared with controls, but rare cases of mood disturbance and suicidality are reported; given this, I need to screen patients and families pre-treatment, monitor mood at each visit, and maintain a low threshold to pause therapy and involve mental health professionals if symptoms emerge, especially in patients with bipolar disorder where case series suggest higher risk of mood worsening [^11221Lkq] [^1141tT5E]. Hold on, I should verify that I document baseline psychiatric history and any active symptoms to contextualize any changes during therapy [^11221Lkq].

> Let me consider special populations and procedural timing. In adolescents, I should monitor growth and musculoskeletal complaints and avoid prolonged or repeated courses when possible due to potential effects on bone; in adults over 65, age-related risks may increase, so I should individualize dosing and monitoring; for patients who need cutaneous procedures, evidence does not support delaying most surgeries or lasers solely due to recent isotretinoin, though mechanical dermabrasion and fully ablative lasers should generally be avoided during treatment, so I should discuss procedure-specific risks rather than apply a blanket delay rule [^115STDrs] [^113yWTey]. I need to ensure I counsel on photosensitivity and sun protection throughout therapy to mitigate burn risk and dyspigmentation [^112GrzCe].

> Next, I should review drug interactions and contraindications. Concomitant tetracyclines increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri and should be avoided; agents that raise triglycerides or are hepatotoxic warrant caution; and because isotretinoin can affect night vision, patients should be advised about driving safety, particularly at night, with prompt ophthalmology referral for visual symptoms [^11221Lkq] [^112GrzCe]. I should double-check all prescription, OTC, and herbal products at each visit to avoid interactions that could increase toxicity or reduce contraceptive efficacy [^111sViZr].

> I will now synthesize practical prescribing steps. Before initiation, I should confirm indication, counsel on risks and benefits, obtain informed consent, verify two negative pregnancy tests with appropriate timing for those who can become pregnant, and ensure iPLEDGE enrollment; at baseline, obtain fasting lipids and LFTs in all patients and consider CBC only if clinically indicated; during therapy, reassess monthly for adherence, adverse effects, mood, and pregnancy status, and repeat lipids and LFTs if abnormal or if dose is escalated; at the end of a 15–20 week course, discuss outcomes and relapse risk, and if relapse occurs, consider a second course after an appropriate interval, typically at least 2 months off therapy [^111sW4xJ] [^11773Egv] [^111qyZtH]. Wait, I should verify that cumulative dose and tolerability guide retreatment decisions rather than a fixed interval alone, and I must re-enroll in iPLEDGE for any new course [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient has moderate acne with scarring or high psychosocial burden — should I still wait for multiple antibiotic failures? Contemporary guidelines support considering isotretinoin earlier in patients with significant scarring or psychosocial impact, so I should document severity, prior therapy, and impact on quality of life to justify earlier use while still adhering to regulatory requirements and safety monitoring [^115sg9Qn] [^11121thf].

> In conclusion, isotretinoin remains the most effective therapy for severe or recalcitrant acne, with broad mechanistic benefits, but it demands meticulous attention to teratogenic risk, patient selection, dosing with food, adverse effect monitoring, and psychiatric screening; aligning local regulatory constraints with guideline-based care ensures both safety and efficacy, and I should continually verify that each step — from indication to follow-up — is documented and communicated clearly to the patient [^112GrzCe] [^115FZBzG] [^115sg9Qn].

Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is the **most effective treatment for severe, scarring, or treatment-resistant acne** [^112GrzCe], with about 80% of patients achieving long-term clearance after a single course [^112GrzCe]. It is a systemic retinoid that reduces sebum, normalizes keratinization, and lowers C. acnes, but is **highly teratogenic** [^116zD6qE]; strict pregnancy prevention is mandatory [^111sW4xJ]. Common adverse effects include dryness, cheilitis, and transient acne flare [^115FZBzG]; serious risks include depression, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia, and IBD [^11221Lkq]. Monitoring includes baseline and periodic lipids, LFTs, and pregnancy tests [^117QVWEk]; patients must enroll in risk programs (iPLEDGE, PPP) [^111sW4xJ] [^115FZBzG]. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy, hypersensitivity, and with tetracyclines; typical dosing is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 16–20 weeks, with food to optimize absorption [^111qyZtH] [^113yMbGY] [^11221Lkq].

---

## Mechanism of action

Isotretinoin **reduces sebaceous gland size and sebum output**, normalizes keratinization to prevent microcomedones, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects that lower C. acnes colonization [^112GrzCe].

---

## Indications

Isotretinoin is indicated for **severe nodular acne, acne at risk of permanent scarring, or acne unresponsive to adequate courses of systemic antibiotics and topical therapy** [^115FZBzG] [^115sg9Qn]. It is also used for severe papulopustular or conglobate acne and for significant psychosocial burden or quality-of-life impairment [^1176kFJD] [^115sg9Qn].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Standard dose**: 0.5–1 mg/kg/day in two divided doses with food for 16–20 weeks [^111qyZtH].
- **Severe cases**: up to 2 mg/kg/day if tolerated [^111qyZtH].
- **Absorption**: take with fatty meals; without food, absorption drops by ~60% [^112GrzCe].
- **Cumulative dose**: 120–150 mg/kg is associated with lower relapse [^notfound].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Approximately 80% achieve **long-term clearance** after one course [^112GrzCe], and relapse rates are about 20–30% — often manageable with topical therapy or a second course [^notfound].

---

## Adverse effects

### Common adverse effects (> 10%)

- **Monthly monitoring**: pregnancy test, symptom review, and labs as indicated [^113ZD45r].
- **Psychiatric screening**: at each visit; monitor for mood changes [^11221Lkq].
- **Bone health**: caution in adolescents; monitor for musculoskeletal symptoms [^115STDrs].

---

## Regulatory programs

In the US, **iPLEDGE** mandates prescriber certification, monthly pregnancy tests, and two forms of contraception for those who can become pregnant [^113ZD45r]. In the UK, the **Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP)** requires prescriber expertise, pregnancy testing, and contraception counseling [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients on **adherence, food requirements, and side effects** [^112GrzCe]. Emphasize **strict contraception** and the need to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for one month after [^111sW4xJ]. Provide mental health resources and advise on sun protection and moisturizers [^112GrzCe].

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternatives include **topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, hormonal therapy (COCs, spironolactone), and procedural options (chemical peels, lasers)** [^115hFhYh] [^117B1Tyi].

---

Roaccutane is **highly effective for severe acne** but requires rigorous safety measures, monitoring, and counseling due to its teratogenicity and potential adverse effects [^112GrzCe].

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115FZBzG]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin

The oral retinoid isotretinoin is used for treating severe acne. It was originally marketed under the brand name Roaccutane. The MHRA licensed indication for isotretinoin is for severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne, or acne that is at risk of permanent scarring) that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy. The licence states that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. The MHRA has defined the groups of healthcare professionals who can take the role of Lead Prescriber in making the decision to initiate isotretinoin treatment following a face-to-face assessment with the patient.

Acne conglobate (severe nodular cystic acne) and acne fulminans (acne conglobate with systemic symptoms) require urgent specialist dermatology review and potentially earlier treatment with isotretinoin. Otherwise, it is first necessary to follow the stepwise management of acne recommended in the NICE guidance.

Isotretinoin is an effective treatment for severe acne. There are a number of known and potential adverse effects associated with treatment. Most people will experience dryness of the skin and lips, which can be helped by emollients and lip balm, and a flare in acne is common at the start of treatment. Both of these adverse effects are dose dependent. Blood abnormalities are reasonably common, but in healthy people are usually not serious.

Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic, and therefore, pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and for 1 month after stopping. All people with childbearing potential (people who may be able to become pregnant) must be entered into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP).

### Is routine laboratory testing in healthy young patients taking isotretinoin necessary: a critically appraised topic [^116TWmEa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Is monitoring of liver function, lipids and full blood count necessary in healthy people taking isotretinoin?

Background

Routine blood testing was recommended in the original licence for Roaccutane™ (isotretinoin) in 1983. In recent years, less frequent monitoring has been suggested by various authors.

Data Sources

We performed four individual systematic searches of the MEDLINE database, via PubMed, from origin to 2 May 2021, supplemented by a hand search of all references in the identified papers.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria were any description of clinical symptoms, laboratory abnormalities and/or physical findings, and any paper that explicitly described the patients as asymptomatic, during treatment with oral isotretinoin.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (J. A. and D.J.) assessed articles for eligibility of inclusion. Evaluation of the data was done also by two of the authors (A. A. D.J. and J. A.) for each section, with the aim to use the presented evidence including guidelines, databases, case series, case reports, cohort studies and randomized clinical trials to delineate the clinical presentation and frequency of adverse events that might be amenable to laboratory monitoring.

Results

We identified 407 papers in our searches and reviewed 125 papers in four sections. Overall, reported adverse events were very rare (< 1 in 10000) and were either idiosyncratic or not preventable by monitoring, accompanied by symptoms, or seen in identifiable predisposed individuals who might benefit from monitoring because of pre-existing conditions.

Recommendation For Clinical Care

We could not find evidence to support the benefit of monitoring to detect adverse events. We suggest that in healthy young people laboratory monitoring for oral isotretinoin is unnecessary and risks detecting nonserious biochemical abnormalities. However, we recognize that new information about adverse events may change that recommendation.

### Risk of suicide and psychiatric disorders among isotretinoin users: a meta-analysis [^113RVsuw]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis follows an a priori systematic review protocol registered with PROSPERO and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The PRISMA checklist and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklistare provided, respectively, in eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1. As this is a meta-analysis of published data, institutional review board approval and informed consent were not required.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We searched 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) from inception until January 24, 2023, using the following free-text search strategy: (isotretinoin OR Accutane OR Roaccutane OR 13-cis-retinoic acid) AND (psychiatric OR psychotic OR mood OR "mental health" OR depression OR anxiety OR bipolar OR manic OR suicide OR suicidal OR self-harm). We also hand searched the bibliographies of included articles and relevant reviews or journals.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two authors (A.T. and N.C.Y.L.M.) independently screened for eligible studies using Rayyan, a web-based collaborative systematic review platform. Studies were screened based on title and abstract, followed by full-text evaluation. We included randomized clinical trials and observational studies that reported the absolute risk and risk factors for psychiatric disorders and suicide among patients with acne taking oral isotretinoin, and the relative risk of these disorders among patients taking oral isotretinoin compared with control participants not treated with isotretinoin. We accepted conference abstracts and other gray literature fulfilling these criteria. We excluded letters, reviews, case reports, and studies published in languages other than English. Using a standardized extraction sheet, 2 authors (A.T. and N.C.Y.L.M.) extracted data comprising first author, year published, study design, study setting, country, sample size, percentage of male participants, median or mean age, intervention or exposure, outcomes, covariates, statistical methods, and key findings. Data on race and ethnicity were not consistently available and were not collected.

### Dyslipidemia and a reversible decrease in insulin sensitivity induced by therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid [^113V8CEM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

13-cis-Retinoic acid (Roaccutan) treatment is associated with disturbances in lipid and sometimes also in glucose metabolism. Thus, we investigated whether 13-cis-retinoic acid treatment decreases insulin sensitivity.

Methods

We studied 11 men [aged 24 ± 2 years (mean ± SEM), body mass index (BMI) 22.1 ± 0.9 kg/m²] who received Roaccutan treatment for acne for a period averaging 5 months but who were otherwise healthy. The insulin sensitivity of the subjects was measured before, during and 1–3 months after the end of treatment using the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique.

Results

Treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid reduced total (59 ± 4 vs 55 ± 4 micromol/kg/min, p < 0.02), oxidative (25 ± 1 vs 22 ± 2 micromol/kg/min, p < 0.05) and non-oxidative (36 ± 3 vs 33 ± 3 micromol/kg/min, p = 0.05) glucose disposal rate, and there was a 4% increase in HbA₁c (from 5.2 ± 0.07 to 5.4 ± 0.07%, p < 0.02). After treatment cessation these values returned to baseline. 13-cis-Retinoic acid treatment also resulted in increased very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increased VLDL triglyceride, and increased VLDL and LDL phospholipid concentrations.

Conclusion

Treatment of acne with 13-cis-retinoic acid reduces insulin sensitivity and induces alterations in lipid metabolism resembling those of the insulin resistance syndrome.

### The effect of silymarin on liver enzymes in patients taking isotretinoin: a randomized clinical trial [^116kLJQ1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of silymarin (Livergol) on liver enzymes in patients taking isotretinoin (Roaccutane). In this double-blind clinical trial, 74 patients with acne and taking isotretinoin were randomly assigned into intervention (N = 37) and control (N = 37) groups. The intervention group received a 140mg Livergol capsule per day for 30days. The control group received a starch-containing capsule as a placebo once a day for 30days. Liver enzyme levels were measured before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using chi-square test, Independent t test, paired sample t test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups at the beginning of study in levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p > .05). At the end of the study, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in levels of AST and ALT (p < .05). Livergol prevented liver enzymes from increasing, so it can be used as an effective, low-cost, and low-complication treatment for the problem of increased levels of liver enzymes following the use of isotretinoin.

### Oral isotretinoin for acne, adjusting treatment according to patient's response [^114EMSyU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Oral isotretinoin is an established effective therapy for acne. No published data is available on the efficacy and side effects of this drug in Iranian patients.

Patients and Methods

A total of 132 acne patients with a mean age of 22.9 ± 6.2 years were treated with oral isotretinoin (Roaccutane) and followed-up from 1999 through 2005. Each patient was started with a dose of 0.75 mg/kg per day until all active lesions healed, followed by a maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg per day for one more month. Laboratory tests were done at monthly intervals. Evaluation of clinical response was based on Leeds technique. Patients were followed-up for a mean period of 4.4 years.

Results

Most of the patients had severe nodulocystic acne involving both trunk and face. Treatment was continued for 6.6 ± 2.5 months with a cumulative dose of 111.5 mg/kg ± 33.9. The mean final improvement rate was 96.7% (95% CI, 84.9% to 108.5%). There was no correlation between improvement rate and age, sex, duration of acne, length of treatment, or cumulative dose. Side effects were generally mild and treated conservatively. In the follow-up, period 18.35% experienced relapse after a mean interval of 1.28 years, 9.17% required a second course of isotretinoin, and only one case needed 3 courses of treatment.

Conclusion

Isotretinoin is an effective and safe treatment for acne in Iranian patients. Starting treatment with a high dose and modifying the length of treatment based on the therapeutic response in each patient, might lead to a rapid and good response rate with minimal side effects.

### Isotretinoin (Accutane) [^111qyZtH]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accutane should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients).

The recommended dosage range for Accutane is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day,8it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects — some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take Accutane with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions.

The safety of once daily dosing with Accutane has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of Accutane, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Accutane be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of Accutane on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal closure).

Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Isotretinoin (Absorica) [^11221Lkq]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of isotretinoin PO (also known as Absorica, Accutane, Amnesteem, Claravis, Zenatane, Epuris, Myorisan):

- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels.
- **Arthralgia, hyperostosis, premature epiphyseal closure**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of these musculoskeletal adverse events.
- **Corneal opacity, night blindness, dry eyes**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of these ocular abnormalities.
- **Hearing loss**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of hearing impairment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of hepatitis and mild-to-moderate elevations of liver enzymes.
- **IBD**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has has been associated with an increased risk of IBD (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders.
- Increased serum triglycerides, increased serum cholesterol, decreased serum HDL: use caution in patients at high risk of hypertriglyceridemia, such as with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder, or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder. Obtain fasting lipid profile in all patients before initiating treatment and then at intervals until the lipid response to isotretinoin is known (usually within 4 weeks). Obtain more frequent monitoring in patients at higher risk of hypertriglyceridemia.
- **Intracranial hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as isotretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension, some of which associated with concomitant use of tetracyclines.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^116Z9EP4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^115exQMQ]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

These medicines should not be used with Sotret unless your doctor tells you it is okay.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your doctor and pharmacist. Do not take any new medicine without talking with your doctor.

How should I take Sotret?

You must take Sotret exactly as prescribed. You must also follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program. Before prescribing Sotret, your doctor will:
explain the iPLEDGE program to you
have you sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients). Female patients who can get pregnant must also sign another consent form.

You will not be prescribed Sotret if you cannot agree to or follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program.

You will get no more than a 30-day supply of Sotret at a time. This is to make sure you are following the Sotret iPLEDGE program. You should talk with your doctor each month about side effects.
The amount of Sotret you take has been specially chosen for you. It is based on your body weight, and may change during treatment.
Take Sotret 2 times a day with a meal, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Swallow your Sotret capsules whole with a full glass of liquid. Do not chew or suck on the capsule. Sotret can hurt the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach (esophagus) if it is not swallowed whole.
If you miss a dose, just skip that dose. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.
If you take too much Sotret or overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away.
Your acne may get worse when you first start taking Sotret. This should last only a short while. Talk with your doctor if this is a problem for you.
You must return to your doctor as directed to make sure you don't have signs of serious side effects. Your doctor may do blood tests to check for serious side effects from Sotret. Female patients who can get pregnant will get a pregnancy test each month.
Female patients who can get pregnant must agree to use 2 separate forms of effective birth control at the same time 1 month before, while taking, and for 1 month after taking Sotret. You must access the iPLEDGE system to answer questions about the program requirements and to enter your 2 chosen forms of birth control. To access the iPLEDGE system, go to www.ipledgeprogram.com or call 1–866–495–0654.

### Isotretinoin and timing of procedural interventions: a systematic review with consensus recommendations [^113yWTey]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The notion that systemic isotretinoin taken within 6 to 12 months of cutaneous surgery contributes to abnormal scarring or delayed wound healing is widely taught and practiced; however, it is based on 3 small case series from the mid-1980s.

Objective

To evaluate the body of literature to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the safety of procedural interventions performed either concurrently with, or immediately following the cessation of systemic isotretinoin therapy.

Evidence Review

A panel of national experts in pediatric dermatology, procedural/cosmetic dermatology, plastic surgery, scars, wound healing, acne, and isotretinoin was convened. A systematic PubMed review of English-language articles published from 1982 to 2017 was performed using the following search terms: isotretinoin, 13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane, retinoids, acitretin, surgery, surgical, laser, ablative laser, nonablative laser, laser hair removal, chemical peel, dermabrasion, wound healing, safety, scarring, hypertrophic scar, and keloid. Evidence was graded, and expert consensus was obtained.

Findings

Thirty-two relevant publications reported 1485 procedures. There was insufficient evidence to support delaying manual dermabrasion, superficial chemical peels, cutaneous surgery, laser hair removal, and fractional ablative and nonablative laser procedures for patients currently receiving or having recently completed isotretinoin therapy. Based on the available literature, mechanical dermabrasion and fully ablative laser are not recommended in the setting of systemic isotretinoin treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Physicians and patients may have an evidence-based discussion regarding the known risk of cutaneous surgical procedures in the setting of systemic isotretinoin therapy. For some patients and some conditions, an informed decision may lead to earlier and potentially more effective interventions.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1172tDwu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

4. I understand that some patients, while taking isotretinoin or soon after stopping isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, "anxious" or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down, or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking isotretinoin have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if isotretinoin caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take isotretinoin. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking isotretinoin (see #7 below).

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^111sXWYh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^117Ts8oJ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe lipid abnormalities and hepatotoxicity with the use of systemic retinoids are very rare. A serum lipid panel and liver function testing should be performed at baseline and, if in an acceptable range, repeated 1‐2 months after starting treatment. If the levels remain within the acceptable range, subsequent testing can be done every 6‐12 months. Prescribers should routinely document concomitant medications as well. Combined oral contraceptives, commonly used to adhere to contraceptive requirements in patients of childbearing potential, can also increase serum lipids. Patients on a long‐term systemic retinoid with persistent, abnormal, clinically significant elevations in serum lipids may continue retinoid treatment with effective lipid management if the risk: benefit assessment is deemed acceptable. Recommendations on the management of hyperlipidemia are provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics and cardiovascular risk reduction in high‐risk pediatric patients (which includes chronic inflammatory disorders but does not specify retinoid use) is detailed by the American Heart Association. 112, 113 Long‐term effects on overall cardiovascular health are unknown. Consensus recommendations are listed in Table 10.

### Isotretinoin (Zenatane) [^111m3WnN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Zenatane should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients).

The recommended dosage range for Zenatane is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day,8it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects — some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take Zenatane with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions.

The safety of once daily dosing with Zenatane has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended.

If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of Zenatane, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Zenatane be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of Zenatane on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal closure).

Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Treatment considerations for inflammatory acne: clinical evidence for adapalene 0.1% in combination therapies [^115BX3jh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an exceptionally common, chronic, and recurring disease. It involves multiple etiological factors including follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, Propionibacterium acnes proliferation, and inflammation. Presently, oral isotretinoin is the only single agent that is effective against all 4 major pathophysiologic features. However, this drug is also responsible for several serious side effects, including teratogenicity. Therefore, it should be used in only the most severe cases and alternative treatment approaches for inflammatory acne, such as initial combination therapy, should be considered first. Combination therapy in inflammatory acne simultaneously targets multiple pathogenic factors. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of combination therapy with a topical retinoid and antimicrobials for mild to moderate inflammatory acne and topical retinoids with oral antibiotics (with or without the use of benzoyl peroxide) for moderate to severe cases of acne, followed by maintenance therapy with topical retinoids. This review evaluates the rationale and clinical evidence for the use of adapalene in combination therapy for inflammatory acne.

Pregnancy Test

- Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Claravis prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Claravis. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

- For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

Lipids: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Claravis is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Claravis therapy (see WARNINGS, Lipids).
Liver Function Tests: Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Claravis has been established (see WARNINGS, Hepatotoxicity).
Glucose: Some patients receiving Claravis have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Claravis therapy, although no causal relationship has been established.
CPK: Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Claravis therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial.

### The role of isotretinoin in acne therapy: why not as first-line therapy? facts and controversies [^1121JoCW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acne is one of the most prevalent diseases in dermatology: Millions of people worldwide experience this distressing condition. To determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy, there is a strong need for a standardized classification system of acne. The exact molecular mechanism of action of isotretinoin is not completely understood; however, oral isotretinoin targets simultaneously at all major mechanisms of acne pathogenesis. Various mass media reports about the risk of teratogenicity and depression from isotretinoin usage as well as the creation of intense prevention programs have created an obstacle to the use of the most active available drug against acne, presenting isotretinoin as a very dangerous regimen. According to recommendations of several international experts, which we share, oral isotretinoin may be prescribed not only to patients with severe disease but indications should be broadened to also include patients with less severe forms of acne, especially in cases with scarring, significant psychologic stress, or failure to respond to conventional therapy.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^115WGumd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, 0.3% A/BPO may fill a gap as a single-agent treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Pediatric guidelines recommend that an oral antibiotic be started concomitantly with topical combination therapy (i.e. topical retinoid and BPO) promptly to prevent scarring in severe acne, when there is evidence of scarring even in moderate acne, or as a step-up regimen if initial therapeutic response with topical therapy is not adequate. European guidance suggests that for moderate acne, an oral antibiotic should be initiated upon the presentation of more widespread disease. Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be able to substitute antibiotics in the interest of minimizing antibiotic resistance in cases where the addition of systemic antibiotic therapy is considered, particularly as its mechanism of action includes prevention of microcomedone formation. International guidelines for acne management stipulate that oral isotretinoin remains the gold standard for severe acne treatment. Recent guidance for the pediatric population suggests that oral isotretinoin is no longer indicated as first-line treatment, but instead only after inadequate response with initial treatment using combination therapy (topical treatment associated with oral antibiotic). Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be an appropriate treatment, alone or in combination with other therapies, prior to the potential need for step-up treatment to oral isotretinoin, or while enrolling the patient in the required programs to obtain access to oral isotretinoin. Furthermore, 0.3% A/BPO may be seen as a replacement for existing topical combination therapies used with oral antibiotics in not only moderate acne but also in severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne (although, perhaps not exclusively).

### Psychiatric reactions to isotretinoin in patients with bipolar disorder [^1141tT5E]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Isotretinoin (Accutane(R)) has been available for the treatment of severe cystic acne for about twenty-five years. There have been several reports of adverse psychiatric reactions to isotretinoin, including depressive symptoms and suicide. However, there have been only three case reports of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) who experienced an untoward psychiatric side effect while receiving isotretinoin treatment. In this study, the psychiatric side effects from isotretinoin were assessed in a larger group of BD patients than has previously been reported.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 300 BD outpatients identified ten patients treated with isotretinoin.

Results

Nine of these ten patients experienced a significant worsening of mood symptoms, and three developed suicidal ideation. Eight experienced a reversal of the relapsed mood symptoms when the isotretinoin was discontinued, whether prematurely or after a full course.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include small sample size, retrospective data collection, absence of double-blind controlled design, and inability to control for spontaneous mood episodes in patients with BD.

Conclusions

These results indicate that BD patients treated with isotretinoin for acne are at risk for clinically significant exacerbation of mood symptoms, including suicidal ideation, even with concurrent use of psychiatric medicines for BD. The clinical implications of this study are especially relevant to the treatment of patients with BD because acne usually occurs during adolescence, which is often the age of onset of BD and because a common side effect of lithium (a standard treatment for BD) is acne.

9 CONTRACEPTION CONSIDERATIONS OF LONG‐TERM SYSTEMIC RETINOID USE

Systemic retinoids are known teratogens, with a "black box" warning of extreme risk to the exposed fetus for severe birth defects. Adolescents of childbearing potential taking systemic retinoids should be counseled about their options for contraception, inclusive of highly effective methods such as intrauterine devices (levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system, intrauterine copper contraceptive) and subcutaneous injection (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) and implants (etonogestrel‐releasing contraceptive implants). The failure rates of these long‐acting reversible contraceptives are less than 1%. 122 In the United States, all patients of childbearing potential on isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE program contraceptive regulations; specifically, those who are sexually active must use two forms of contraception, including one highly effective form, while on isotretinoin. Acitretin does not have a mandated risk management program, but contraceptive counseling should be as rigorous as for isotretinoin and include long‐term contraceptive planning, given the prolonged half‐life of the drug. The acitretin package insert also states that two forms of contraception are required. Teratogenicity resulting from male retinoid use has not been reported. Table 12 summarizes the pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids.

Table 12
Pharmacokinetics of systemic retinoids

While isotretinoin is cleared within several months, acitretin has a much longer half‐life. In addition, acitretin taken with ethanol converts to etretinate, which is stored in fat and has a prolonged elimination and release into circulation. 123 Therefore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 years after cessation of acitretin therapy. When choosing a systemic retinoid for treatment of DOC, isotretinoin should be considered preferentially for patients of reproductive potential. In addition, because of the prolonged half‐life of acitretin, clinicians should consider transitioning patients of childbearing potential from acitretin to isotretinoin at the onset of puberty or at least consider long‐acting, reversible forms of contraception.

In adolescent patients continuing on a systemic retinoid from childhood, or those just starting a systemic retinoid with abstinence as the chosen form of contraception, discussions regarding contraception should be undertaken early and reviewed each visit. Providers, in shared decision‐making with patients, should have a plan to start contraception either at a specific age (eg, 16 years of age) or before sexual debut, employing the assistance of a gynecologist or other provider with expertise in contraception as needed.

### Evidence-based medicine for all: what we can learn from a programme providing free access to an online clinical resource to health workers in resource-limited settings [^1132B9u2]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our work demonstrates that removing the subscription fee barrier enabled almost 2000 health workers from 100 countries to access and use UpToDate, a leading EBCR. The fact that the majority of users accessed UpToDate very frequently (more than once a week) and read a wide spectrum of topics supports the hypothesis that there is demand for EBCRs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). While users shared salient examples of how UpToDate helped them improve their clinical practice, it will be important for future research to test more formally the health outcome gains associated with EBCRs in RLS and whether the quality of care provided by global health professionals using EBCRs is better than the quality of those who do not. Measuring care outcomes, surveying patients and providers, and using clinical vignettes and audit patients to understand providers' knowledge and practice are possible ways in which these questions could be addressed.

There are several limitations to our analysis that merit discussion: First, according to WHO estimates, there are more than 100 000 physicians working in low-income countries; yet, only 1948 health workers applied for access to our programme. Our programme did not address the demand side of the information bottleneck. A lack of training on use of EBCRs, absence of an evidence-driven culture in medical education and potential lack of relevance of existing EBCRs to local clinical challenges, are important to note and to explore in future research (table 4). The relevance, or lack thereof, of EBCRs in general, and UpToDate in particular, to LMIC clinical needs has not been evaluated: It is possible that UpToDate's recommendations on clinical care are different from, and even in conflict with, local practice and guidelines. It is also possible that UpToDate recommends the use of diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions that are unavailable in LMICs due to high cost or other constraints. In those cases, use of UpToDate might not be helpful to the practising clinician. As access to mobile and broadband internet across Africa and other developing regions increases and the prices of internet-capable devices fall, demand generation will be a more significant barrier. Potential interventions to increase demand could include introducing EBCRs in the context of medical education, using incentives or 'nudges' to promote use of EBCRs by clinicians, or creating locally specific EBCR content to increase its relevance.

Question 3: Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this disease?
A. Methotrexate
B. Azathioprine
C. Ibuprofen
D. Infliximab
E. Clindamycin

Answers:

A. Methotrexate – Incorrect. The immunosuppressant effects of methotrexate are primarily driven by adenosine accumulation and inhibition of immune cell function. It is often used as a steroid-sparing agent in refractory SAPHO.
B. Azathioprine – Incorrect. Azathioprine causes immunosuppression by inhibiting de novo purine synthesis and is also often used as a steroid-sparing agent for cases refractory to Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
C. Ibuprofen – Correct. SAPHO syndrome treatment is mostly supportive. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen are used for pain and isotretinoin for acne treatment. Isotretinoin may cause a dose- and duration-dependent hyperostosis similar to that seen in SAPHO syndrome called retinoid hyperostosis (RH).RH is most commonly asymptomatic and seen after long-duration therapy. RH is unlikely in our patient given her short duration of isotretinoin therapy (≤ 6 months) and the long delay from retinoid exposure to symptom onset.
D. Infliximab – Incorrect. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors (eg, infliximab) are not considered first-line treatments but have been used in refractory SAPHO given high levels of TNF-α found in bone specimens and the involvement of TNF-α in neutrophilic dermatoses–like palmar pustulosis. A 7-day course of prednisone and the TNF-α inhibitor, etanercept, resolved many of our patient's skin and musculoskeletal complaints.
E. Clindamycin – Incorrect. Clindamycin is a first-line antibiotic for treating acne vulgaris. Propionibacterium acnes has been isolated from 67% of skin and bone biopsies in patients with SAPHO syndrome, and although remission has been seen with oral antimicrobial treatment of P acnes, disease activity returned to baseline levels within 3 months after the discontinuation of therapy.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^114yDPQf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Combining a topical retinoid with BPO is supported by the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne guidelines and European guidelines for acne treatment. To date, topical therapies alone, including 0.1% A/BPO, have been recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular acne, and in combination with an oral antibiotic for moderate to severe papulopustular acne. According to more recent pediatric treatment guidance from Eichenfield et al. the recommendations diverge for treatment of moderate acne, where topical combination therapy (topical retinoid and BPO with or without a topical antibiotic) is advised as an additional option to the traditional oral antibiotic with topical retinoid and BPO. All of these guidelines suggest the following limited choices in severe, non-nodulocystic acne treatment: either oral isotretinoin or a topical combination (retinoid and BPO) with oral antibiotics used for all but the most severe forms of acne. Thus, a topical therapy in a single formulation that is strong enough to improve severe inflammatory acne as a standalone or adjunct alternative treatment choice for a significant number of acne patients without the need for oral isotretinoin (and its associated side effects) or concomitant antibiotic therapy (to reduce microbial resistance) represents a substantial unmet need.

Data from three RCTs among 3855 subjects in total, of whom 983 received 0.1% A/BPO, demonstrated that it provided synergistic and significantly greater efficacy than its monotherapies in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with an acceptable safety profile. Synergism was defined as the benefit of the combination greater than the sum of benefits of adapalene and BPO monotherapies. Furthermore, the benefit of A/BPO relative to vehicle has been shown to increase with higher lesion counts at baseline. A synergistic and potent anti-inflammatory effect could thus be inferred with a higher concentration of adapalene combined with BPO, which would be essential in a more severe population.

To date, topical treatments alone are not perceived as suited for treatment of the severe papulopustular, non-nodulocystic acne population. To evaluate the potential for a higher concentration of adapalene in a fixed-dose combination with BPO in meeting this need in a broader segment of patients, the current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.3%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% (0.3% A/BPO) gel as single-agent therapy in subjects with moderate and severe inflammatory acne.

### Is It safe to operate on patients taking isotretinoin? [^111eaDzA]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Oral isotretinoin is increasingly being used to treat acne and other dermatological conditions. The number of patients who take isotretinoin and wish or need to undergo plastic surgery may be following a similar pattern. Although skin healing is an important concern in the case of patients who use isotretinoin, it is definitely not the only relevant issue when planning surgical intervention.

Methods

Eleven important points regarding surgery safety in patients taking oral isotretinoin were defined. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted by employing the keywords isotretinoin OR 13-cis-retinoic acid. This returned the largest possible number of studies about isotretinoin.

Results

Forty-seven studies matched the selection criteria. Most animal experimental models suggested that isotretinoin at doses commonly used to treat acne is not detrimental to wound healing. Human studies are controversial. However, healing of skeletal muscle could be at increased risk of necrosis.

Conclusions

Association between isotretinoin and problematic skin healing after surgery is being challenged. Also, recommended time between discontinuation of isotretinoin and surgery should be reviewed. While muscle flaps may be endangered in patients taking isotretinoin, healing of other tissues and systemic effects that could compromise surgery safety are rare or detectable before surgery.

### Depression and acitretin: a true association or a class labeling? [^114APhYz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The potential relationship between systemic retinoids used in dermatology and affective disorders is controversial. Acitretin, which is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis is part of this controversy secondary to its chemical relation to isotretinoin, a drug which has been associated with a large number of anecdotal case reports of depression and suicidal ideation. Moreover, an FDA package insert precaution regarding acitretin's association with depression and suicide has elevated the level of concern for patient safety. The objective of this article is to review the evidence in the literature regarding acitretin's association with affective disorders. After 12 years of worldwide use only two cases involving acitretin have been reported in the literature. In addition, despite many anecdotal cases involving isotretinoin, there have been no clinical studies that have proven a causal relationship between isotretinoin and depression or suicidal ideation. For acitretin there have been no systematic clinical studies that examine such a relationship. Moreover, it is notable that the FDA precaution regarding depression and suicide on the package insert of acitretin predates the publication of the aforementioned two cases. This suggests that a relationship between acitretin and affective disorders is a class labeling rather than a scientifically proven association.

### Acne, isotretinoin and depression [^116Ue4f4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

At any one time, most 16–18-years-old and up to half of adults have acne. In 60% of all teenagers, the condition will be sufficiently severe for them to self-treat or seek medical advice. Up to half of 12–20-year-olds with acne develop psychological or social problems. Oral isotretinoin, which is used for the treatment of severe acne, might be expected to improve psychological functioning. However, there have been suggestions that the drug itself might cause depression and suicide. Here we consider these concerns, and the implications for the use of isotretinoin when managing patients of all ages.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115qGETQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Topical retinoids — retinoids are the core of topical therapy for acne because they are comedolytic, resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are antiinflammatory, but use may be limited by dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation, which can be mitigated by reduced frequency of application; some formulations of tretinoin are not photostable and should be applied in the evening, and tretinoin may be oxidized and inactivated by coadministration of BP, so it is recommended that the 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category C, while tazarotene is category X; data suggest that adapalene is better tolerated than multiple concentrations of tretinoin (based on older formulations), and overall, the limitations of existing studies prohibit direct efficacy comparisons of topical retinoids; topical retinoids have been associated with increased photosensitivity, and concurrent daily sunscreen can be used to reduce the risk of sunburn.

### Comparison of topical retinoids in the treatment of acne [^112SFkuH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids are been used to successfully treat acne for almost 3 decades. At the beginning, a retinoid was a compound of similar structure and action to retinol (vitamin A).(1) Changes at the carboxylic end group, the polyene chain, and the aromatic ring can result in the modification of the original molecule. To date, three generations of retinoids have been developed: the nonaromatics (retinol, tretinoin, and isotretinoin), the monoaromatics (etretinate and acitretin), and the polyaromatics (arotinoid, adapalene, and tazarotene). The new synthetic retinoid molecules have little resemblance with retinol but nonetheless are included in this family because they have the ability to bind with or activate retinoid receptors. Therefore, retinoids are vitamins and also hormones.(3)

Acitretin with broadband ultraviolet B (UVB) — efficacy, scheduling, and dose adjustment: A consensus conference determined that combining acitretin with UVB or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) enhances efficacy and limits treatment frequency, duration, and cumulative doses. With broadband UVB, a 74% improvement in psoriasis severity score was shown with acitretin 50 mg/d plus broadband UVB compared with 35% with broadband UVB only or 42% with acitretin only. Another study used acitretin (35 mg/d) for 4 weeks followed by broadband UVB plus acitretin (25 mg/d), with the median cumulative broadband UVB dose to achieve 75% improvement being 41% lower than UVB monotherapy. The preferred schedule is acitretin monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by phototherapy; in patients already receiving UVB with a suboptimal response, acitretin 25 mg/d may be added, and it is prudent to decrease the UVB dose by 30% to 50% for 1 week.

### Cosmeceuticals: the evidence behind the retinoids [^113XrayM]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A wide range of cosmeceutical products are available on the market currently, but evidence to support their use is often lacking in the literature. Specifically, there is a substantial amount of evidence supporting the efficacy of tretinoin in photoaging, but the evidence supporting retinoid-based cosmeceuticals remains sparse. The authors review the current data in the literature related to vitamin A-derived cosmeceutical products and conclude that cosmeceuticals containing retinaldehyde have been shown in large randomized, controlled trials to have the most beneficial effect on aging skin.

### Cosmeceuticals in the pediatric population part I: a review of risks and available evidence [^116D3zAD]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.5.4 Sunscreen

Sunscreen is essential to treating hyperpigmentation and should be encouraged as a first‐line intervention for PIH. Broad spectrum sunscreens (especially tinted sunscreens) prevent further hyperpigmentation and optimize the fading of existing hyperpigmentation.

1.6 Anti‐Aging Agents

The intent of many cosmeceutical products is to slow or reverse signs of aging such as dyspigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles. While the "anti‐aging" claims of products are heavily used as a marketing tactic, this supposed benefit makes little sense for pediatric consumers who have yet to accumulate signs of skin aging. Additionally, the studies that exist even in the adult population are generally not robust randomized control trials and the endpoints are often not clinically meaningful or appreciable. It is important to be aware of the uses and risks of these ingredients as they are widely incorporated into all types of cosmeceutical products.

1.6.1 Topical Vitamin A Derivatives

Active retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative, has anti‐aging activity through inhibition of collagen degradation and stimulation of collagen synthesis and cell growth and differentiation. Unlike prescription forms of retinoic acid, many of the retinoids found in cosmeceuticals (especially retinol and retinyl esters) are inactive and there is insufficient data to assume clinical efficacy. Retinoids can cause irritation and photosensitivity.

1.6.2 Topical Vitamin C Derivatives

Vitamin C, or L‐ascorbic acid in its active form, acts as an antioxidant in the skin. Vitamin C theoretically protects from UVB damage and reduces thymine dimer formation, a cause of skin cancer. Additionally, vitamin C in the skin promotes collagen production and has anti‐inflammatory properties. However, topical L‐ascorbic acid is unstable and is poorly absorbed in the skin, limiting its efficacy in vivo. Cosmeceutical products may also contain other vitamin C derivatives that are theoretically converted to L‐ascorbic acid in the skin, although further research on these derivatives is necessary. Very little research has been conducted on the use of topical vitamin C in the pediatric population and many of the trials of topical vitamin C in adults have significant study bias and lack clinical evidence of efficacy. Some people may experience skin irritation at higher concentrations of vitamin C; those with sensitive skin or eczema should be instructed to use products with a lower concentration (less than 10%).

### Isotretinoin for treatment of acne-JAMA dermatology… [^112GrzCe]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Isotretinoin is a medication for acne that is so severe that it does not go away with other treatments or that greatly affects quality of life. It is considered the most effective treatment for acne and can help prevent acne scars. About 4 out of 5 patients who complete a course of isotretinoin treatment have long-term improvement of their acne. This is different from most other acne treatments, which only help while you are taking them. Isotretinoin is a pill taken once or twice daily. It should be taken with fatty food to help your body absorb it. Isotretinoin can cause severe birth defects. In the US, a program called iPLEDGE regulates use of isotretinoin. Its goal is to prevent pregnancies during isotretinoin treatment. Everyone taking isotretinoin must follow the rules of this program. Any person who could become pregnant must get monthly pregnancy tests and answer questions online before they can fill their prescription. Isotretinoin works in several ways.

First, it shrinks oil glands in your skin. Skin oil can block pores and cause acne bacteria to grow. Second, isotretinoin keeps skin cells from sticking together and clogging pores. Third, it may lower inflammation. Less commonly, isotretinoin could make your joints or muscles hurt. This usually goes away if you lower the dose or after treatment. Isotretinoin can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. You need to use sunscreen and protect yourself from the sun while taking it. When you first start taking isotretinoin, your acne might actually get worse for a little while. Your physician will adjust the dose and make recommendations to help prevent this from happening. Some blood tests may be required while taking isotretinoin, including monitoring your liver function and triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Rarely, isotretinoin can cause more serious side effects, such as mood changes or trouble seeing at night.

It might also cause hair changes, but these usually get better after treatment. Several studies have looked at whether isotretinoin is linked to bowel problems, with most not finding a link. While there have been reports of sexual dysfunction after isotretinoin treatment, more research is needed to understand if this is a risk of isotretinoin. Prior to starting treatment, your physician will review side effects with you and answer your questions.
