## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding at 10 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound shows an intrauterine pregnancy without fetal cardiac activity and no obvious fetal parts. She undergoes surgical evacuation of the uterus. The tissue obtained is sent to the pathology department. The junior doctor asks whether histological examination of the tissue is necessary in this case.

Based on current RCOG guidelines, should histological examination be performed on the tissue obtained from this patient's surgical evacuation? Justify your answer according to the guideline recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether histological examination of the tissue obtained from surgical evacuation is necessary in a 29-year-old woman with a 10-week intrauterine pregnancy without fetal cardiac activity and no obvious fetal parts on ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical detail that no fetal parts were identified on ultrasound. Then, I should verify the RCOG guideline language on when histology is indicated versus when it can be omitted. Next, I will apply that language to this case and confirm the recommendation. Finally, I should consider the rationale and any exceptions or follow-up implications, including hCG surveillance if molar disease is suspected [^6823ceda] [^a2aafecc].

> Let me first confirm the pivotal clinical detail: the ultrasound reported an intrauterine pregnancy without fetal cardiac activity and, crucially, no obvious fetal parts, which means fetal tissue was not identified at any stage of the pregnancy, and that is the trigger for histology per RCOG guidance [^a2aafecc].

> Wait, let me verify the exact guideline language before concluding. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 38 states that histological assessment of material from medical or surgical management of miscarriage should be performed to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia if no fetal parts are identified at any stage of pregnancy, whereas routine histology is not required when fetal parts have been identified at the time of surgical abortion or on prior ultrasound [^a2aafecc] [^6823ceda].

> I should confirm the rationale to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The reason for histology in the absence of identifiable fetal parts is to detect gestational trophoblastic disease, including molar pregnancy, which carries different management and surveillance needs; RCOG also notes that histological examination is used for definitive diagnosis of molar pregnancy, reinforcing the indication in this scenario [^6e4bd2b5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exceptions. I initially wondered if the absence of cardiac activity alone might change the need for histology, but I need to check that. The guideline exception pertains to when fetal parts are identified, not to the presence or absence of cardiac activity, so the absence of fetal parts here still mandates histology regardless of cardiac activity status [^6823ceda] [^a2aafecc].

> Next, I should review practical implications. If histology confirms molar change, management typically includes hCG surveillance and consideration of central pathology review in atypical cases, and if heavy bleeding complicates evacuation, technical guidance emphasizes experienced operators and strategies to minimize hemorrhage, but none of that negates the need for histology in this case [^3262c613] [^37b3dfe3] [^f45b124d].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my conclusion. Because no fetal parts were identified on ultrasound or at evacuation, RCOG recommends histological examination of the evacuated tissue to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia, so yes, histology is necessary here [^a2aafecc].

---

Histological examination is **required** in this case because no fetal parts were identified on ultrasound or at evacuation, which raises concern for gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) [^a2aafecc]. RCOG guidelines mandate histology to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia when no fetal parts are seen, whereas routine histology is not needed if fetal parts are identified [^6823ceda]. If histology confirms molar pregnancy, arrange hCG surveillance and refer to a GTD center for management [^836bbc76].

## RCOG guidelines on histological examination of pregnancy tissue

RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 38 provides **clear recommendations** on when histological examination of pregnancy tissue is indicated:

- **Routine histological examination**: Not recommended after therapeutic abortion if fetal parts are identified at the time of surgical abortion or on prior ultrasound [^6823ceda].

- **Histological assessment**: Recommended for all miscarriages (medical or surgical) when no fetal parts are identified at any stage of pregnancy, to exclude trophoblastic neoplasia [^a2aafecc].

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Histological examination is recommended for definitive diagnosis of molar pregnancy [^6e4bd2b5].

---

## Application of RCOG guidelines to the clinical scenario

In this case, the ultrasound showed an intrauterine pregnancy without fetal cardiac activity and no obvious fetal parts, and the surgical evacuation yielded tissue with no identified fetal parts. According to RCOG guidelines, **histological examination is required** because no fetal parts were identified, to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease [^a2aafecc].

---

## Rationale for histological examination in the absence of identified fetal parts

Histological examination is essential in this context to:

- **Exclude gestational trophoblastic disease**: Including complete or partial hydatidiform mole, which carries risks of persistent trophoblastic disease and requires specific management and follow-up [^6e4bd2b5].

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Provide definitive diagnosis of molar pregnancy, guiding appropriate management and surveillance [^6e4bd2b5].

- **Guide management**: Inform decisions regarding further investigations, surveillance, and referral to specialized centers for gestational trophoblastic disease management [^836bbc76].

---

## Clinical implications of histological findings

Histological examination may reveal:

| **Histological finding** | **Clinical implication** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal pregnancy tissue | Confirms miscarriage | Routine follow-up |
| Complete hydatidiform mole | Risk of persistent trophoblastic disease | - hCG surveillance <br/> - Referral to GTD center |
| Partial hydatidiform mole | Risk of persistent trophoblastic disease | - hCG surveillance <br/> - Referral to GTD center |
| Invasive mole or choriocarcinoma | Malignant gestational trophoblastic disease | - Urgent oncology referral <br/> - Chemotherapy |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on RCOG guidelines, **histological examination of the evacuated tissue is required** in this case because no fetal parts were identified. This is necessary to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease and to guide appropriate management and follow-up. If histology confirms molar pregnancy, arrange hCG surveillance and refer to a specialized GTD center for further management [^836bbc76].

### Pathologic examination of fetal and placental tissue obtained by dilation and evacuation [^5b131f15]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is an alternative method to induction of labor for pregnancy termination and intrauterine fetal demise, and it is the most common mode of second-trimester uterine evacuation in the United States. Many D&E specimens are examined in surgical pathology, and there is little information available in surgical pathology textbooks or the literature to assist pathologists in these examinations.

Objective

To provide an overview of the D&E procedure, discuss related legal issues, provide guidelines for routine pathologic examination of D&E specimens, and demonstrate the importance of careful pathologic examination of D&E specimens.

Data Sources

Case-derived material and literature review.

Conclusions

Pathologic examination of D&E specimens has been understudied. However, the available literature and our experience support the fact that careful pathologic examination of D&E specimens can identify significant fetal and placental changes that can confirm clinical diagnoses or provide definitive diagnosis, assist in explaining the cause of intrauterine fetal demise, and identify unexpected anomalies that may provide further clues to a diagnostic syndrome or mechanism of anomaly formation.

### Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation [^9a2ec3ef]. Contraception (2013). Medium credibility.

Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation — recommendations based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B) indicate that surgical abortion can be performed successfully and safely as early as 3 weeks from the onset of last menses if a protocol includes sensitive pregnancy testing, immediate and meticulous examination of the aspirate, and assiduous follow-up to rule out ectopic pregnancy or continuing gestation; in contrast to vacuum methods, sharp or blunt curettage (dilation and curettage) is associated with a modest increase in blood loss, uterine or cervical injury, and retained tissue, with no studies available to assess long-term risks; and when trained staff routinely examine pregnancy tissue and no external pathology mandate exists, routine outside pathologic referral of tissue aspirates adds little diagnostic value.

### Bimanual examination for clot evacuation: a retrospective cohort study of women with postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal delivery [^c2450c6e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrest of bleeding in the immediate postpartum phase is related to the ability of the uterus to fully contract with myometrial fibres acting as 'physiological ligatures' on the blood supply to the placental bed. In addition to mechanical haemostasis, local haemostatic (tissue factor, type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor) and systemic coagulation (platelets, circulating clotting factors) factors are also activated to induce haemostasis. Any space-occupying tissue (clot or retained placenta or membrane) may prevent full uterine contraction, with surgical intervention needed to control the bleeding. Bimanual clot evacuation (BCE) may be a viable surgical intervention. BCE involves 'cupping' the fundus of the uterus with one hand whilst performing a vaginal examination to digitally break down and expel any blood clots. This is hypothesised to enhance the effect of uterotonic agents on myometrial tissue by facilitating emptying of the uterine cavity. This procedure, generally performed under maternal analgesia obtained with nitrous oxide or a pre-existing epidural, is traditionally taught by more senior obstetricians and midwives, though has received limited academic attention. Of four contemporary national College PPH guidelines from the United Kingdom (RCOG), United States of America (ACOG), Australia and New Zealand (RANZCOG), and Canada (SOGC), none discuss the role of BCE, though a previous SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline did describe use of an initial exploration of the uterus, without a clear description of BCE. The 2012 World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations do mention the role of a similar procedure, bimanual uterine compression, as a temporizing measure for PPH until further definitive management can be applied, however this is a distinctly different procedure to BCE, where only physical pressure is applied for compression to aid haemostasis. Whilst this has shown potential benefit there are only a limited number of randomised controlled trials, with both a Cochrane Systematic Review and a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis being inconclusive.

End-points for PPH that may be used to evaluate efficacy of management include volume of blood loss with associated physiological compromise and need for advanced surgical procedures that may require operative intervention. Given the lack of published information on this commonly performed and relatively simple procedure, our primary aim was to compare rates of surgical intervention among women receiving vs not receiving BCE in the setting of severe PPH post-vaginal delivery.

### Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation [^41e17605]. Contraception (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for termination of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to pathological examination, SFP 2013 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining routine pathological assessment of tissue aspirates as they add little diagnostic value in settings where gross or microscopic examination of pregnancy tissue is routinely carried out by well-trained and experienced staff members, and where local or regional laws mandating outside pathologic examination do not supervene.

### Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation [^5abd9ad5]. Contraception (2013). Medium credibility.

Early first-trimester surgical abortion — specimen verification and completion protocols include immediate on-site evaluation of the fresh tissue aspirate; at gestations prior to 7 weeks, definitive visual identification must include both the gestational sac or membranes and placental elements. The NAF Clinical Policy Guidelines state that "Completion of abortion must be confirmed prior to the woman leaving the facility", and specify that "[i]n first trimester termination, flotation of tissue with backlighting should be used to identify products of conception, including gestational sac", while the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists instructs that protocols include safeguards such as "magnification of aspirate and follow-up serum beta-hCG estimation". Evidence also notes that "MVA for early abortion confers no benefit over EVA in detecting early products of conception in the aspirate" and that there was "no clinical benefit to routine pathology review of the tissue" when experienced staff confirm products at the procedure.

### Ectopic pregnancy: diagnosis and management… [^c2cc7d01]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside of the uterine cavity. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy in the United States is estimated to be 1% to 2%, but this may be an underestimate because this condition is often treated in the office setting where it is not tracked. Making the Diagnosis SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Ectopic pregnancy should be considered in any pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain when intrauterine pregnancy has not yet been established. 10 Vaginal bleeding in women with ectopic pregnancy is due to the sloughing of decidual endometrium and can range from spotting to menstruation-equivalent levels. 10 This endometrial decidual reaction occurs even with ectopic implantation, and the passage of a decidual cast may mimic the passage of pregnancy tissue. Thus, a history of bleeding and passage of tissue cannot be relied on to differentiate ectopic pregnancy from early intrauterine pregnancy failure.

The nature, location, and severity of pain in ectopic pregnancy vary. It often begins as a colicky abdominal or pelvic pain that is localized to one side as the pregnancy distends the fallopian tube. The pain may become more generalized once the tube ruptures and hemoperitoneum develops. Other potential symptoms include presyncope, syncope, vomiting, diarrhea, shoulder pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, rectal pressure, or pain with defecation. 11 The physical examination can reveal signs of hemodynamic instability in women with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum. 12 Patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancy often have cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. 13 Sometimes the ectopic pregnancy itself can be palpated as a painful mass lateral to the uterus. There is no evidence that palpation during the pelvic examination leads to an increased risk of rupture.
10.

15 A slower-than-expected rate of increase or a decrease in β-hCG levels suggests early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy. The rate of increase slows as pregnancy progresses and typically plateaus around 100, 000 mIU per mL at 10 weeks' gestation. 16 A decrease in β-hCG of at least 21% over 48 hours suggests a likely failed intrauterine pregnancy, whereas a smaller decrease should raise concern for ectopic pregnancy.
17. The discriminatory level is the β-hCG level above which an intrauterine pregnancy is expected to be seen on transvaginal ultrasonography; it varies with the type of ultrasound machine used, the sonographer, and the number of gestations. A combination of β-hCG level greater than the discriminatory level and ultrasonography that does not show an intrauterine pregnancy should raise concern for early pregnancy loss or an ectopic pregnancy.

TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY Intrauterine pregnancy visualized on transvaginal ultrasonography essentially rules out ectopic pregnancy except in the exceedingly rare case of heterotopic pregnancy. 5 The definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be made with ultrasonography when a yolk sac and/or embryo is seen in the adnexa; however, ultrasonography alone is rarely used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy because most do not progress to this stage. 5 More often, the patient history is combined with serial quantitative β-hCG levels, sequential ultrasonography, and, at times, uterine aspiration to arrive at a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. PREGNANCY OF UNKNOWN LOCATION Ultrasonography showing neither intrauterine nor ectopic pregnancy in a patient with a positive pregnancy test is referred to as a pregnancy of unknown location. In a desired pregnancy, β-hCG levels and serial ultrasonography combined with patient reports of pain or bleeding guide management.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — histological examination of extrapulmonary specimens: We suggest that histological examination be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Accuracy studies indicate that histological examination has a sensitivity of 69%–97%, 86%–94%, 60%–70%, 79%–100%, and 73%–100% in pleural tissue, urologic tissue, endometrial curettage, lymph node biopsy, and pericardial tissue, respectively, and the specificity of mycobacterial culture microscopy tends to be low because necrotizing and nonnecrotizing granulomas are seen in other infectious and noninfectious diseases. Remarks state that both positive and negative results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario because neither false-positive nor false-negative results are rare.

### Diagnostic surgical pathology in lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^32d7263d]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — In a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of patients with lung cancer, pathologic examination provides precise diagnosis, staging information, and histologic correlation with clinical behavior, management options; and biologic insights of the tumor. The surgical pathology report should contain a synoptic database to inform the clinical team about the multiparameter aspect of the tumor diagnosis. The surgical pathologist should address, within a collaborative team effort, challenging diagnostic issues, such as differentiating pleural-based adenocarcinoma from malignant mesothelioma, separating small cell carcinoma from non-small cell carcinoma, discriminating between invasive adenocarcinoma and favorable subtypes of AIS and MIA, distinguishing between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and identifying primary vs metastatic carcinomas. The pathologist should be provided with the clinical information and radiographic findings and incorporate those data with the histopathologic evaluation. The pathologist should also collaborate with the clinical team to enhance specimen acquisition and testing so that optimal information can be obtained from the available tissue. Much information can be determined from routine histopathologic analysis; additional information will be gained from a limited panel of immunohistochemical reactivity.

### Is pathology examination useful after early surgical abortion? [^027e2a8a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study if the pathologist's examination of surgical abortion tissue offers more information than immediate fresh tissue examination by the surgeon. Immediate examination of the fresh tissue aspirate after surgical abortion helps reduce the risk of failed abortion and other complications. Regulations in some states also require a pathologist to analyze abortion specimens at added cost to providers. We conducted this study to evaluate the incremental clinical benefit of pathology examination after surgical abortion at less than 6 weeks' gestation.

Methods

As part of a prospective case series of women who had early surgical abortions at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts during a 32-month period, we collected data on clinical outcomes and the results of postoperative tissue examinations. Using outcomes verified by in-person follow-up as the "gold standard", we calculated the validity of the tissue examinations by the surgeons and the outside pathologists.

Results

A total of 676 women had documented outcomes and complete tissue examination data. The sensitivity (ability of the examiner to detect an outcome other than complete abortion) was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35, 76) for the surgeons' tissue inspections and 22% (95% CI 8, 44) for the pathologists' examinations. The predictive value of a positive (abnormal) tissue screen was 14% (95% CI 8, 24) and 7% (95% CI 3, 17) for the surgeons and pathologists, respectively.

Conclusion

Routine pathology examination of the tissue aspirate after early surgical abortion confers no incremental clinical benefit. Although the surgeons' tissue inspections predicted abnormal outcomes poorly, the pathologists did no better. Our results challenge the rationale for state regulations requiring pathologic analysis of all surgical abortion specimens.

### Macroscopic examination of gynaecological specimens: a critial and often underemphasised aspect of pathological reporting [^c356b37e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathological examination of surgical specimens and compilation of a surgical pathology report comprises a series of events which includes macroscopic examination and tissue sampling, either complete or selected. This step is critical but often overlooked in the literature and not given the attention it deserves. In this review, we discuss the macroscopic examination and grossing of gynaecological pathology specimens, with reference to national and international protocols. We provide guidance as to the degree of sampling necessary in different scenarios and stress that a common-sense approach is necessary with flexibility in the degree of sampling depending on a variety of factors.

### Is microscopic examination of hysterectomy specimens removed for clinically benign disease necessary? [^561a8e43]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The likelihood of finding significant pathology in a hysterectomy specimen undertaken for clinically benign disease is low. Some data indicate that microscopic examination of these specimens may be abandoned. While this approach may seem attractive, the authors believe that there are a number of practical and clinical governance issues associated with this. Instead a pragmatic approach is advocated, with two tissue blocks (cervix and endomyometrium) being adequate in most cases.

### Diagnostic surgical pathology in lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1942e7fe]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Histopathologic identification of lung tumors — The histopathologic identification of lung tumors includes clinical history and presentation, radiographic features and patterns, diagnostic surgical pathology and cytopathology, and immunohistochemical and molecular studies. A multidisciplinary team approach ensures accurate and meaningful diagnostic information, appropriate staging, and relevant prognostic information for disease management. Information from the pathologic examination should be organized in a form usable by the treating team of clinicians and may be presented in the pathology report as a synoptic database. In certain cases, the pathologic examinations may be enhanced by histochemical and immunohistochemical assays as well as by electron microscopic ultrastructural, cytogenetic, and molecular studies, and the need for selective studies should be communicated to the pathologist in advance of specimen acquisition so that special handling and processing techniques are administered in a timely manner.

### Surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation [^613c9376]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

The following guidelines reflect a collation of the evaluable medical literature about surgical abortion prior to 7 weeks of gestation. Early surgical abortion carries lower risks of morbidity and mortality than procedures performed later in gestation. Surgical abortion is safe, practicable and successful as early as 3 weeks from the start of last menses (no gestational sac visible on vaginal ultrasound) provided that (a) routine sensitive pregnancy testing verifies pregnancy, (b) the tissue aspirate is immediately examined for the presence of a gestational sac plus villi and (c) a protocol to identify ectopic pregnancy expeditiously — including calculation of readily obtained serial serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin titers when clinically appropriate — is in place and strictly adhered to. Manual and electric vacuum aspiration methods for early abortion demonstrate comparable efficacy, safety and acceptability. Current data are inadequate to determine if any of the following techniques substantially improve procedure success or safety: use of rigid versus flexible cannulae, light metallic curettage following uterine aspiration, uterine sounding or routine use of intraoperative ultrasound.

Pelvic examination — recommendations and shared decision making for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women note that "Data from these studies are inadequate to support a recommendation for or against performing a routine screening pelvic examination among asymptomatic, nonpregnant women who are not at increased risk of any specific gynecologic condition" and "Data on its effectiveness for screening for other gynecologic conditions are lacking", so "the decision to perform a pelvic examination should be a shared decision between the patient and her obstetrician–gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider", and "Counseling should include a discussion about the uncertainty of the benefits and harms of the procedure and the lack of evidence for the screening pelvic examination". "A study of 452 women (aged 21–65 years)… reported that 94% of women thought the potential benefits and harms of the pelvic examination should be discussed before an examination takes place". "It is recommended by ACOG that pelvic examinations be performed when indicated by medical history or symptoms", with "Examples of symptoms that indicate a woman should receive a pelvic examination include but are not limited to the following: abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, vaginal dryness, vaginal bulge, urinary issues, or inability to insert a tampon", and "Other indications include patients undergoing a pelvic procedure (eg, endometrial biopsy or intrauterine device placement)". Additionally, "Women with current or a history of cervical dysplasia, gynecologic malignancy, or in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure should be screened and managed according to guidelines specific to those gynecologic conditions", and "Obstetrician–gynecologists should make efforts to obtain accurate and complete medical, surgical, and family histories and to conduct thorough reviews of systems as part of a well-woman visit", with the note that "When an asymptomatic, nonpregnant patient presents for a well-woman visit, the obstetrician–gynecologist should explain the lack of data and potential benefits".

### Influence of surgical evacuation on pregnancy outcomes of subsequent embryo transfer cycle following miscarriage in an initial IVF cycle: a retrospective cohort study [^d03b2bfa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

When a pregnancy ends in first trimester miscarriage, the common treatments are expectant management, medical evacuation or surgical evacuation. Surgical evacuation remains a common treatment for miscarriage when other methods fail. There were 76.7% patients in present study received surgical evacuation. Such a high surgical evacuation rate may be due to embryo developmental arrest in IVF. Embryo developmental arrest typically manifests as embryonic death or intrauterine fetal death on ultrasound, which results in delayed miscarriage due to the difficulty of completely expelling the products of conception, while about four-fifths miscarriage patients with embryonic or fetal death in present study. According to the guidelines (WHO Clinical Practice Handbook for Safe Abortion; ACOG guideline), surgical evacuation is warranted when women have heavy bleeding, fever or retained products of conception beyond 3–4 h. A retrospective review showed that 92.5% miscarriage patients chose surgical evacuation in hospital treatment and 51% in family physicians treatment in Canada. It was considered in a study that the surgical evacuation was the standard management of early pregnancy failure, and surgical curettage had great advantages in complete evacuation rate and the bleeding time. Some clinicians proposed surgical evacuation as an effective method that prevented prolonged course to avoid the negative emotion of patients.

### Depth of invasion, tumor budding, and worst pattern of invasion: prognostic indicators in early-stage oral tongue cancer [^60782c67]. Head & Neck (2014). Low credibility.

One of the arguments against the usefulness of the conventional histological and morphological parameters is that they can be best evaluated only after the patient has undergone surgical treatment of the tumor. Therefore, the treatment already planned may in some cases have to be modified based on the results obtained from the surgical resection specimen. However, a preoperative determination of tumor depth through MRI and ultrasonography has been suggested by several groups. Measurement of tumor depth may therefore be advocated as part of a routine clinical workup of the patient. It may be helpful toward stratification of patients in early-stage oral tongue SCC and in treatment planning with further reassurance by examining the tumor budding and WPOI from the surgical specimen. In addition, based on this study, we suggest that the predictive value of measuring tumor depth, budding, or WPOI from frozen sections of T1/T2 N0 oral tongue SCC during the surgery should be studied. The results obtained should then be compared with those of postoperative surgical paraffin-embedded tumors. In case this unrefined estimation of the above parameters from a frozen section assigns an outcome similar to that in the evaluation of the paraffin sections, it could be used in treatment planning. Specifically, in aggressive T1/T2 N0 cases (ie, depth of ≥ 4 mm, budding of ≥ 5 clusters at the invasive front or high-risk WPOI), evacuation of the neck lymph nodes during the primary surgery should be considered as a routine treatment plan. Furthermore, the use of multimodality treatment, including radiation and/or chemotherapy, should also be considered in these latter patients.

In conclusion, there are patients with T1/T2N0M0 SCC with aggressive high-risk disease for whom the use of multimodality treatment would be beneficial regardless of treatment approaches. Those patients could be selected by evaluating the depth of invasion, tumor budding, or WPOI, all parameters that can be easily and rapidly analyzed from the routine hematoxylin-eosin–stained tumor. Moreover, this study was based on a large patient material from the central university hospitals in Finland, and our findings may be a step forward in individualized patient management in early tongue cancer.

Retroperitoneal/intra-abdominal soft tissue sarcomas — evaluation and workup: This workup involves a history and physical examination (H&P) with appropriate imaging, and computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be utilized; chest imaging should be performed for histologies with potential for lung metastases and, if possible, a multidisciplinary sarcoma panel should review the patient. Pre-resection biopsy is not necessary for all patients, but confirmation of a sarcoma diagnosis including histologic subtype is required when neoadjuvant therapy is being considered; image-guided core needle biopsy (CT or ultrasound) is preferred over open surgical biopsy and should be performed if neoadjuvant therapy is being considered or for suspicion of malignancy other than sarcoma. If a retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma is encountered unexpectedly at laparotomy, a core needle biopsy should be done to establish the diagnosis as well as the histopathologic type and grade of tumor; then, the optimal subsequent resection could be performed at a center with sarcoma expertise.

Retroperitoneal/intra-abdominal soft tissue sarcomas — evaluation and workup includes a thorough history and physical examination with imaging; computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging modality, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be utilized in certain situations, and chest imaging should be performed for histologies that have the potential for lung metastases. If possible, a multidisciplinary sarcoma panel should review the patient. Pre-resection biopsy is not necessary for all patients; however, confirmation of a sarcoma diagnosis, including histologic subtype, is required for patients being considered for neoadjuvant therapy.

### The role of histopathologic examination of intracranial blood clots removed for hemorrhage of unknown etiology: a clinical pathologic analysis of 31 cases [^539065ff]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage is a well recognized cause of morbidity and mortality. Often, the etiology of the hemorrhage is known before surgical intervention, ie, evacuation of the hematoma. In a subset of patients, however, no known cause for the hemorrhage has been found in either history (eg, trauma) or radiographic findings (eg, tumor) before surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 54 blood clot evacuation specimens received in the surgical pathology department over a 16-year period (1983–1999). Cases were excluded in which the hemorrhage was attributed to or associated with prior trauma or for which there was a prior known cause of the hemorrhage. Thirty-one cases fulfilled the study requirements and comprised the study group. Thirty-one patients (aged 7 to 79 years; mean 54 years), including 16 females and 15 males, formed the study group. In 14 cases (45%), only blood clot was identified in the tissues examined. Of the remaining 17 cases, specific pathologic diagnoses were made in nine instances including cerebral amyloid angiopathy in three cases, arteriovenous malformations in three cases, and tumors in three cases. Tumor types included metastatic non-small cell carcinoma in two cases and low-grade astrocytoma in one case. Examination of blood clot evacuation specimens can lead to a discovery of the etiology of the hemorrhage in a subset of cases, particularly if neural tissue is part of the specimen. The quantity of neural tissue submitted for histologic evaluation seems to correlate with a higher likelihood of making a diagnosis. The routine use of Congo red stain in all adult cases in which brain tissue is present proved to be of diagnostic utility in screening for amyloidosis.

### Mifepristone and misoprostol versus misoprostol alone for uterine evacuation after early pregnancy failure: study protocol for a randomized double blinded placebo-controlled comparison (triple M trial) [^7fbc9254]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

In our trial, ultrasonography will be performed between day 15 and 20 to evaluate the first treatment effect (Fig. 1). In case of an expulsed gestational sac, and an total endometrial thickness (TED) < 15 mm by ultrasonography, no further evaluation is necessary and treatment is considered as successful. In case of expulsed sac but possible retained products of conception (TED > 15 mm) expectant management is advised, with consent from the patient, for another 4 weeks. Patients are able to contact their hospital 24 h a day in case of any questions, complaints or emergencies. During these weeks of expectant management, clinical signs and symptoms should determine whether additional treatment (e.g. curettage) may be necessary. If successful curettage has been performed after medical treatment, no further examinations for the purposes of the study project are necessary. Six weeks after treatment, ultrasonography will be performed to evaluate endometrial thickness. In case of an endometrial thickness > 15 mm 6 weeks after treatment, further treatment will be according to local protocol and patient preferences. Additional treatment may be expectant, medical or surgical (hysteroscopy or D&C).

Anti-D prophylaxis will be given if necessary as part of the standard treatment, following the NVOG-guideline "Erytrocytenimmunisatie en zwangerschap".

### Practice bulletin no. 149: endometrial cancer [^724df105]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Endometrial cancer — diagnostic and management recommendations (Level A) include outpatient sampling and hysteroscopy-based evaluation, selective imaging, comprehensive surgical staging, minimally invasive surgery, and specified adjuvant therapies. Based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A), outpatient endometrial sampling with disposable devices is reliable and accurate and is the method of choice; hysteroscopy, although not required, is recommended with directed dilation and curettage (D&C), and this combination provides the best opportunity to confirm a true premalignant lesion and exclude carcinoma. Routine preoperative imaging for metastasis is not necessary. Initial management should include comprehensive surgical staging with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and collection of peritoneal cytology, with exceptions only after consultation with a gynecologic oncology specialist. Minimally invasive surgery should be embraced as the standard surgical approach. For adjuvant therapy in select stage I–II cases, radiation reduces local recurrence but does not affect overall survival; in high-intermediate–risk patients, vaginal brachytherapy should be the adjuvant treatment of choice over whole pelvic irradiation. In advanced disease, the use of chemotherapy improves patient outcomes.

### Postmenopausal endometriosis [^f156e958]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The TVS has been considered the first-line examination for pelvic endometriosis due to its highly accessible, inexpensive and well-accepted nature. Endometriomas, as in our case, have specific characteristics on USG, namely unilocular cysts with a ground glass appearance. However, TVS is operator dependent and only offers a very restricted field of view. MRI has offered a solution to these limitations and has become very useful in helping diagnose ovarian endometriotic cysts and deep infiltrating endometriosis. Moreover, MRI might also be useful when expanded pelvic adhesion is suspected. CT scans help in diagnosing patients with suspected bowel endometriosis or those with genitourinary involvement.

There is no specific serum biomarker for endometriosis. Several biomarkers, including CA-125, cytokines, angiogenic and growth factors, are known to increase in women with endometriosis. However, these biomarkers are non-specific and can also be found in other pathologies, including malignancies.

Surgery is the mainstay first-line treatment for endometriosis, particularly in cases of new-onset endometriosis. According to the RCOG Green-top Guideline No 62, adnexal masses of 5 cm or more require evaluation and excision if they do not resolve spontaneously in postmenopausal women. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guideline on endometriosis states that laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, even in postmenopausal women.

Surgery followed by histological examination is currently the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, regardless of age and menopausal status. This approach allows for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of endometriotic lesions. However, recurrences are common following surgical therapy; therefore, second-line drugs (such as progestogens, aromatase inhibitors, etc) should be considered. Postmenopausal endometriosis carries a risk of malignant transformation. According to Kobayashi et al, approximately 0.72% of patients with ovarian endometriomas develop ovarian cancer, with a higher risk in postmenopausal women. This risk increases with age, with studies showing that up to 2–3% of ovarian endometriomas in postmenopausal women may undergo malignant transformation. Therefore, comprehensive follow-up after surgery is recommended in such cases.

### Is routine histological reporting of doughnuts justified after anterior resection for colorectal cancer? [^c2e85b1a]. Colorectal Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

'Doughnuts' of colonic tissue which remain on a circular stapler after firing are routinely examined histologically. However, Royal College of Pathologists' guidelines state that this is not necessary. The aim of this study was to examine current practice among pathologists in one region in the UK and to determine the incidence of clinically significant pathology within colonic doughnuts.

Methods

Current practice in all pathology Departments within the South-west Region was examined and 100 doughnuts from anterior resection specimens were reviewed for the presence of abnormal pathology.

Results

Practice varied between hospitals with only 15% following guidelines for examination of doughnuts and 38% following guidelines for reporting of resection margins. Review of pathology specimens demonstrated no incidence of colonic adenocarcinoma in a doughnut. Benign pathology was present in 9% and dysplasia in 3% but in no case was patient management altered as a result of the pathology report.

Conclusion

Application of recommended guidelines is inconsistent. We have demonstrated a low incidence of clinically significant pathology in doughnuts and more economical guidelines could therefore be safely applied without detriment to patient care.

### Influence of surgical evacuation on pregnancy outcomes of subsequent embryo transfer cycle following miscarriage in an initial IVF cycle: a retrospective cohort study [^74babd46]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There was no significant difference in the pregnancy outcomes of subsequent embryo transfer cycle between surgical evacuation patients and no surgical evacuation patients. However, surgical evacuation led to the decrease of EMT, especially when the EMT < 8 mm, which was associated with a lower live birth rate. Unnecessary surgical evacuation should be avoided when possible. However, the miscarriage management should not be unduly conservative when there is the evidence of requisite surgical evacuation.

### Clinical utility of pathology data: endometrial and tubo-ovarian carcinomas [^76dbdd53]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cancer resection specimens are usually reported using standardised proformas that consist of a list of elements, which include core (required) and non-core (recommended) items. Although all elements are generally included in the reports, the clinical importance of a particular parameter often depends on a variety of factors, including the clinical setting, local management guidelines and other pathological parameters. In this review, we briefly outline how histopathology data are used to guide management of patients with endometrial and tubo-ovarian cancers, the most common gynaecological malignancies, and provide advice as to which data elements are important in particular scenarios.

### Accuracy of diagnosis of retained products of conception after dilation and evacuation [^5224cba6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Uterine re-evacuation samples taken in cases of suspected residua after curettage are occasionally negative for gestational tissue. We aimed at evaluating the occurrence of such postcurettage re-evacuation-negative samples and at exploring factors that may influence their occurrence.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional comparative retrospective study of 69 consecutive women who underwent uterine re-evacuation for suspected postcurettage gestational remnants. Pathologic reports of samples drawn during re-evacuations were reviewed to determine whether the extracted tissue contained gestational tissue. The presence of factors that may influence the rate of a positive or negative sample (eg, sonographic findings, gestational age at initial procedure, and presenting symptom) was noted and compared between women with and without histologically verified remnants.

Results

Twenty-eight (41%) of the re-evacuation samples were histopathologically positive for gestational remnants. Residual tissue was more commonly found when the initial evacuation was performed at a more advanced gestational age (> 15 weeks). Women referred by emergency department attendants had significantly fewer positive samples. Normal expert sonographic examination practically excluded yielding samples. Conversely, no negative samples were preceded by sonographic reports mentioning residua.

Conclusions

Most re-evacuation samples taken during a re-evacuation procedure for suspected residua are negative for gestational tissue. Parameters that are likely related to histologically confirmed gestational residual tissue are advanced gestational age at initial evacuation, level of the sonographer's skill, persistent bleeding as the presenting symptom, and a sonographic report specifically mentioning retained gestational tissue.

Postmenopausal bleeding — persistent bleeding and incidental endometrial thickening management. Because rare cases of endometrial carcinoma can present with an endometrial thickness of less than 3 mm, persistent or recurrent uterine bleeding should prompt a histologic evaluation of the endometrium regardless of endometrial thickness, whereas an endometrial measurement greater than 4 mm incidentally discovered without bleeding need not routinely trigger evaluation; reliability of measurement can be affected by an axial uterus, obesity, coexisting myomas, adenomyosis, or previous uterine surgery.

Other glandular abnormalities — benign-appearing endometrial and glandular cells: Approximately 0.5% to 1.8% of cervical cytology specimens from women 40 years old and older will have endometrial cells. Benign-appearing exfoliated endometrial cells in premenopausal women identified during either the first or the second half of the menstrual cycle are rarely associated with significant pathology, whereas benign-appearing endometrial cells in postmenopausal women are not infrequently associated with significant endometrial pathology. In a study of postmenopausal women with benign-appearing endometrial cells on routine cytology who underwent endometrial biopsy, 8% had significant pathology identified including endometrial adenocarcinoma in 5% of the women. After total hysterectomy, benign-appearing glandular cells derived from small accessory ducts, foci of benign adenosis, or prolapse of the fallopian tube into the vagina have no clinical significance.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations — use and indications for pelvic examination state that pelvic examinations should be performed when indicated by medical history or symptoms, and based on the current limited data on potential benefits and harms and expert opinion, the decision to perform a pelvic examination should be a shared decision between the patient and her obstetrician–gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider. Women with current or a history of cervical dysplasia, gynecologic malignancy, or in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure should be screened and managed according to guidelines specific to those gynecologic conditions.

### Treatment of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^45c80725]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Stage I NSCLC — SBRT vs surgical resection: Refinements in radiation targeting and delivery have resulted in several platforms that deliver stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for local tumor control, and SBRT differs from standard radiation therapy by delivering shorter, more convenient regimens that involve smaller fields and higher delivered doses to the field; because SBRT is well tolerated, does not require general anesthesia, and results in minimal damage to surrounding lung, it has been used primarily for early-stage lung cancers in patients who could not tolerate surgical resection. However, although it is attractive to consider SBRT as the radiation equivalent of wedge resection, there are caveats: tissue diagnosis prior to SBRT is typically obtained by bronchoscopy or needle biopsy, many patients are treated based on radiographic characteristics without any tissue diagnosis, and specific histologic information is currently less critical for stage IA and smaller IB NSCLC because management relies solely on local therapy.

### Mastectomy scars following breast reconstruction: should routine histologic analysis be performed? [^254b1347]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There is some debate in the recent literature regarding the routine submission of mastectomy scars for histologic analysis when performing delayed breast reconstructions. The aim of this study was to review the relevant publications and evaluate the practice of routine histologic examination of mastectomy scars.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective review, across three regional plastic and reconstructive surgery units, of 433 patients who had 455 scars routinely sent for histologic examination following delayed breast reconstruction between January of 2000 and December of 2006. Patients with clinical evidence of recurrent carcinoma were excluded.

Results

Data from 433 patients revealed an average age at reconstruction of 49.9 years (range, 25 to 77 years). The mean interval from primary breast surgery to reconstruction was 3.9 years (range, 2 months to 32 years), and the average length of patient follow-up, from primary surgery, was 6.4 years (range, 1 to 40 years). The majority of the initial operations were carried out for invasive carcinoma (89 percent). Four mastectomy scars in three patients were positive for carcinoma recurrence.

Conclusions

The publications related to the practice of routine histologic analysis of mastectomy scars provide conflicting conclusions. As a proportion of patients may benefit from the early detection and treatment of locoregional recurrence, the authors suggest that the routine submission of mastectomy scars will allow for the earlier detection of soft-tissue recurrences that may affect long-term outcome. In keeping with cancer surgery principles, the authors recommend routine histologic examination of mastectomy scars following delayed breast reconstruction.

Gynecological tissues

The role of immunotherapy has been shown to be promising in several cancers given its durable response and lower toxicities. However, in gynecological cancer, these results have been underwhelming as monotherapy, except in endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair. The response rates in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and recurrent endometrial cancer with proficient MMR are low, ranging from 11% to 15% compared with up to 53% in recurrent endometrial cancer with dMMR. Several combination approaches are currently under investigation. Ovarian cancer and the majority of endometrial cancers (except dMMR subtype) are characterized by an immunosuppressive TME and therefore, targeting the immunosuppressive factors within the TME is a potential attractive approach.

To optimize biomarker data, it is important to have rational translational objectives and a standardized approach to collection of gynecological samples (including blood, tissue and ascitic fluid). One approach is to collect these samples at the time of surgery, which will be our focus here. Another approach is to use interventional radiology with image-guided approaches, especially in recurrent settings where surgery is not indicated. At time of surgery, tumor tissue tends to be bulky, especially in patients with ovarian cancer, but it is critical to collect viable tumor with surrounding tissue and avoid necrotic tumor tissue as much as possible. Transferring tissue into culture media might be better than normal saline especially if cell dissociation and single-cell analyses are planned.

Obtaining high-quality tissue is important especially with recent technological advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing. Tissue obtained at the time of surgery can be immediately processed by dissociating cells, including both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells for future analyses using RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing and/or flow cytometry. Further, ascitic fluid, which is common in ovarian cancer, is an important resource to analyze the TME as it tends to be rich with immune and tumor cells, as well as cytokines. Collection of ascitic fluid can be done not only at the time of surgery but also from patients with recurrent disease with an abdominal catheter placed to drain ascites for palliative symptomatic indications.

### Neuroblastoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^445a78bf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroblastoma — biopsy and tissue acquisition guidance states that surgical resection should be considered in the setting of localized disease, particularly in the absence of image-defined risk factors (IDRFs), and when biopsy rather than upfront resection is indicated, minimally invasive biopsy techniques can be used; however, open biopsy may be preferred when adequate tissue cannot be obtained by less invasive means. Multiple core biopsies may provide adequate tissue and clinicians should consider the amount of tissue needed for full histologic and molecular evaluation; fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is not recommended by the Panel, and an experienced pathologist should review frozen sections to determine specimen adequacy. Bilateral bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies can be used for diagnostic purposes when marrow is the only source of tumor material, and every attempt should be made to obtain adequate material for the full complement of molecular testing. Patients < 2 months of age with existing or evolving hepatomegaly and infants in whom safety considerations preclude biopsy should not undergo a biopsy until after initiation of therapy and clinical stabilization, with biopsy performed when it is safe to do so to obtain tissue for histologic evaluation and molecular testing. Patients < 6 months of age with L1 adrenal tumor with maximum diameter ≤ 3.1 cm if solid or 5 cm if at least 25% cystic do not require an initial biopsy or resection.

Needle gauge and number of passes

Studies have clearly demonstrated improved diagnostic yield with an increased number of needle passes. However, three or more passes significantly increased the risk of complications and morbidity. No association was seen between the number of passes and severity of complications in at least two large studies. Factors associated with severe complications were patient age, hepatic malignancy and elevated INR.

All the common medical liver diseases have an inherent heterogeneity in the distribution of the histological features that are required to establish a diagnosis and to assess disease severity. The resultant sampling variability may therefore limit the accuracy of histological assessments, particularly if the sample obtained is small or fragmented. To ensure that the sample is representative, various studies have suggested that longer sample size, and consequentially, increased number of visualised complete portal tracts (CPTs), strongly influences eventual diagnosis and staging of liver disease. In 2014, the Royal College of Pathologists updated guidelines suggested minimum adequacy requirement for samples to be at least 10 mm long and containing six portal tracts. However, there is good evidence that the disease severity (both fibrosis stage and grade of inflammation) tends to be underestimated in biopsies that include fewer than 11 portal tracts per tissue section. To obtain an intact core with sufficient tissue, the current recommendation is for a biopsy of a minimum length of 20 mm, obtained with a 16-gauge needle. Assessment of shorter biopsies may be compromised, and an additional pass should be considered if the sample obtained by the first pass is less than 10 mm in length, or is between 10 and 20 mm in length if the purpose of the biopsy is to establish the fibrosis stage or investigate biliary disease.
