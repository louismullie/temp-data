## Question

A 42-year-old man with a 10-year history of well-controlled HIV infection (CD4 count 420 cells/μL, undetectable viral load) presents with several weeks of fevers, night sweats, generalized lymphadenopathy, and unintentional weight loss. Laboratory studies reveal anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. Excisional lymph node biopsy demonstrates features consistent with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). The patient is otherwise stable and has no contraindications to immunotherapy.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended first-line treatment for this patient's multicentric Castleman's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended first-line treatment for a 42-year-old man with HIV and biopsy-proven multicentric Castleman's disease, and how to sequence rituximab, antiretroviral therapy, and any adjuncts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the disease subtype. Then, I should verify the patient's HIV status and whether it changes first-line choices. Next, I will review guideline-backed first-line regimens for HHV8-positive MCD in people with HIV. After that, I need to consider disease severity and whether to add chemotherapy. Finally, I should plan for monitoring, Kaposi sarcoma surveillance, and relapse management, and I will double-check any conflicting statements about IL-6 blockade in HHV8-positive disease before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and subtype. Multicentric Castleman's disease is a lymphoproliferative disorder with systemic inflammatory features; in people with HIV, it is typically HHV8-associated, driven by viral IL-6 and plasmablasts, and diagnosed by excisional lymph node biopsy showing monotypic lambda-restricted plasmablasts that are HHV8 LANA-positive, often in mantle zones or abutting germinal centers, which fits this presentation of fever, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, anemia, and elevated CRP [^95de3d3a] [^d82093e9].

> Wait, let me verify the HIV-specific implications. The patient has well-controlled HIV with CD4 420 and undetectable viral load; importantly, HHV8-associated MCD can occur even with good immune control, so HIV control does not obviate the need for MCD-directed therapy, though maintaining ART is essential for overall outcomes and may reduce recurrence risk, so I should ensure ART continuation and optimization as part of care [^a52f6e34] [^ba0d19c9].

> Next, I should review authoritative first-line recommendations. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on rituximab as the preferred initial therapy for HHV8-positive MCD in people with HIV: NCCN lists rituximab as preferred first-line, EHA/ESMO recommends rituximab as first-line, and HIV OI guidelines recommend ART plus rituximab for MCD without concurrent KS, with rituximab plus liposomal doxorubicin if KS is present, so rituximab monotherapy is appropriate here given no mention of KS [^79d08d96] [^0620e66d] [^317b68b7] [^ce806b95].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding chemotherapy. I initially thought to add etoposide because of the cytokine storm, but wait, I should verify severity. EHA/ESMO suggests adding etoposide or liposomal doxorubicin in severe disease or when KS is present; this patient is hemodynamically stable without organ failure, so rituximab monotherapy is sufficient initially, with escalation if he deteriorates or if KS emerges, and I should monitor closely for clinical worsening [^12d4217b] [^2fa5f5d5].

> I need to ensure supportive and preventive steps are explicit. All patients with HIV-associated MCD should continue combination antiretroviral therapy, and I should screen for occult Kaposi sarcoma before rituximab because rituximab can unmask or exacerbate KS; if KS is found or develops, I should add liposomal doxorubicin to rituximab and continue ART, and I should continue KS-directed therapy for about 3 months after the last rituximab dose to mitigate flare risk [^a52f6e34] [^da694f85] [^317b68b7].

> Let me consider alternatives and why they are not first-line here. High-dose zidovudine plus ganciclovir or valganciclovir is an alternative regimen, but it is generally less effective than rituximab-based therapy and is reserved for selected cases or when rituximab is contraindicated; similarly, IL-6 blockade with siltuximab or tocilizumab is effective for idiopathic MCD but is not the standard for HHV8-associated MCD in people with HIV, so I should avoid substituting it as first-line here [^79d08d96] [^e552ab3e] [^834c8cfd].

> I should double-check dosing and schedule. Rituximab is typically administered at 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 4 weeks as induction; this regimen has shown high remission rates and durable responses in HIV-associated MCD, with the main toxicity being infection risk and potential KS flare, which we will mitigate with screening and vigilant follow-up [^85937125] [^681cb9b3].

> Next, I should review monitoring and relapse planning. I will assess symptomatic response and CRP trends to gauge efficacy, and I should consider periodic HHV8 viral load monitoring in remission because rising plasma HHV8 DNA has been associated with relapse risk, which can prompt earlier intervention; if relapse occurs, retreatment with rituximab-based therapy remains effective, and multiple rechallenges are reasonable given high salvage rates [^687dc113] [^0ec24a24] [^dc10cad8] [^2e96a7ce].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is rituximab monotherapy as first-line treatment for this HIV-associated, HHV8-positive multicentric Castleman's disease, with continuation and optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy, baseline assessment for occult Kaposi sarcoma, and close monitoring for response and KS emergence; I will escalate to rituximab plus liposomal doxorubicin if KS is diagnosed or if the patient develops severe organ-threatening disease, and I will avoid IL-6 blockade or antiviral monotherapy as substitutes for rituximab in this setting [^79d08d96] [^0620e66d] [^317b68b7] [^a52f6e34].

---

The recommended first-line treatment for HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease is **rituximab plus combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)** [^79d08d96] [^0620e66d]. Rituximab is the **preferred agent** because it targets HHV-8–infected B cells and improves survival [^ae5f4ad4] [^681cb9b3]; cART should be continued or optimized to suppress HIV and HHV-8 replication [^a52f6e34]. If Kaposi sarcoma is present, add **liposomal doxorubicin** to rituximab to reduce KS progression [^317b68b7] [^d26e3f9c]. Monitor for rituximab-related infections and KS flare, and consider HHV-8 viral load monitoring to guide follow-up [^687dc113] [^0ec24a24].

---

## Recommended first-line treatment

### Rituximab

- **Mechanism of action**: Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, depletes B cells, including HHV-8–infected plasmablasts, thereby reducing cytokine production and systemic inflammation [^d82093e9].

- **Clinical evidence**: Rituximab achieves high response rates and durable remissions in HIV-associated MCD, with 2- and 5-year overall survival rates of 94% and 90%, respectively, in prospective cohorts [^681cb9b3].

- **Regimen**: Standard dosing is 375 mg/m² IV weekly for 4 weeks; retreatment is effective at relapse [^85937125] [^dc10cad8].

---

### Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)

- **Role of cART**: cART suppresses HIV and HHV-8 replication, reducing disease activity and recurrence risk; it should be continued or initiated in all patients with HIV-associated MCD [^a52f6e34] [^d6e23714].

- **Clinical evidence**: cART alone is insufficient to control MCD but is essential adjunctive therapy to rituximab [^c3026a26] [^a52f6e34].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and modifications

### Concurrent Kaposi sarcoma (KS)

In patients with concurrent KS, **add liposomal doxorubicin** to rituximab to mitigate KS progression, as rituximab alone can exacerbate KS [^317b68b7] [^d26e3f9c]. The **regimen** is rituximab 375 mg/m² IV weekly for 4 weeks plus liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.

---

### Alternative therapies

Alternative options include **ganciclovir or valganciclovir** with or without high-dose zidovudine for patients unable to receive rituximab or when rituximab is contraindicated, though efficacy is limited compared with rituximab-based therapy [^317b68b7] [^d26e3f9c]. Immunomodulators such as **thalidomide or bortezomib** are reserved for refractory or relapsed disease due to limited evidence [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment of symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly; monitor for infections and KS progression [^da694f85].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC, renal and hepatic function, CRP, and HIV viral load; consider HHV-8 viral load monitoring to predict relapse risk [^687dc113] [^0ec24a24].

- **Imaging**: Periodic CT or PET-CT to assess disease response and detect relapse [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Infections**: Rituximab-related hypogammaglobulinemia and increased infection risk; monitor closely and provide prophylaxis as indicated [^notfound].

- **Kaposi sarcoma flare**: Rituximab can unmask or worsen KS; baseline assessment and close monitoring are essential [^da694f85].

- **Relapse**: MCD is relapsing-remitting; rituximab retreatment remains effective at relapse [^dc10cad8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| Rituximab | First-line therapy for HIV-associated MCD | 375 mg/m² IV weekly × 4 weeks |
| cART | All patients with HIV-associated MCD | Continue or initiate cART |
| Liposomal doxorubicin | Concurrent KS with MCD | 20 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks × 6 cycles with rituximab |
| Ganciclovir/valganciclovir ± zidovudine | Alternative therapy if rituximab contraindicated | Per guideline protocols |

---

The recommended first-line treatment for HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease is **rituximab plus cART**, with liposomal doxorubicin added if Kaposi sarcoma is present. This approach improves survival, reduces relapse, and controls systemic inflammation, with close monitoring for infections and KS progression [^79d08d96] [^0620e66d] [^681cb9b3].

### Siltuximab for multicentric Castleman's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^834c8cfd]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Multicentric Castleman's disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder driven by dysregulated production of interleukin 6. No randomised trials have been done to establish the best treatment for the disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of siltuximab-a chimeric monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6-in HIV-negative patients with multicentric Castleman's disease.

Methods

We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at 38 hospitals in 19 countries worldwide. We enrolled HIV-negative and human herpesvirus-8-seronegative patients with symptomatic multicentric Castleman's disease. Treatment allocation was randomised with a computer-generated list, with block size six, and stratification by baseline corticosteroid use. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to siltuximab (11 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) or placebo; all patients also received best supportive care. Patients continued treatment until treatment failure. The primary endpoint was durable tumour and symptomatic response for at least 18 weeks for the intention-to-treat population. Enrolment has been completed. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01024036.

Findings

We screened 140 patients, 79 of whom were randomly assigned to siltuximab (n=53) or placebo (n=26). Durable tumour and symptomatic responses occurred in 18 (34%) of 53 patients in the siltuximab group and none of 26 in the placebo group (difference 34·0%, 95% CI 11·1-54·8, p=0·0012). The incidence of grade 3 or more adverse events (25 [47%] vs 14 [54%]) and serious adverse events (12 [23%] vs five [19%]) was similar in each group despite longer median treatment duration with siltuximab than with placebo (375 days [range 1-1031] vs 152 days [23-666]). The most common grade 3 or higher were fatigue (five vs one), night sweats (four vs one), and anaemia (one vs three). Three (6%) of 53 patients had serious adverse events judged reasonably related to siltuximab (lower respiratory tract infection, anaphylactic reaction, sepsis).

Interpretation

Siltuximab plus best supportive care was superior to best supportive care alone for patients with symptomatic multicentric Castleman's disease and well tolerated with prolonged exposure. Siltuximab is an important new treatment option for this disease.

### Improved outcome with rituximab in patients with HIV-associated multicentric castleman disease [^65a546eb]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Although HIV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (HIV-MCD) is not classified as an AIDS-defining illness, mortality is high and progression to lymphoma occurs frequently. At present, there is no widely accepted recommendation for the treatment of HIV-MCD. In this retrospective (1998-2010), multicentric analysis of 52 histologically proven cases, outcome was analyzed with respect to the use of different MCD therapies and potential prognostic factors. After a mean follow-up of 2.26 years, 19 of 52 patients died. Median estimated overall survival (OS) was 6.2 years. Potential risk factors, such as older age, previous AIDS, or lower CD4 T cells had no impact on OS. Treatment was heterogeneous, consisting of cytostatic and/or antiviral agents, rituximab, or combinations of these modalities. There were marked differences in the outcome when patients were grouped according to MCD treatment. Patients receiving rituximab-based regimens had higher complete remission rates than patients receiving chemotherapy only. The mean estimated OS in patients receiving rituximab alone or in combination with cytostatic agents was not reached, compared with 5.1 years (P = .03). Clinical outcome and overall survival of HIV-MCD have markedly improved with rituximab-based therapies, considering rituximab-based therapies (with or without cytostatic agents) to be among the preferred first-line options in patients with HIV-MCD.

### How I treat HIV-associated multicentric castleman disease [^266f4c48]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

HIV-associated plasmablastic multicentric Castleman disease is an increasingly frequent diagnosis. Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus is found in the monotypic polyclonal plasmablasts that characterize this disease. Unlike Kaposi sarcoma, the incidence does not correlate with CD4 cell count or use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is a relapsing and remitting illness, and diagnostic criteria are emerging that define disease activity based on the presence of a fever and raised C-reactive protein coupled with a list of clinical features. Treatment protocols increasingly stratify therapy according to performance status and organ involvement. I advocate rituximab monotherapy for good performance status patients without organ involvement and rituximab with chemotherapy for more aggressive disease. The success of antiherpesvirus agents in controlling active disease is limited, but valganciclovir may have a role as maintenance therapy in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of castleman disease [^245ed3fe]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

Castleman disease is a heterogeneous nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorder. Major distinctions include unicentric versus multicentric presentation; hyaline vascular, plasmacytic, or mixed pathology; and HHV8-associated (typically HIV-positive) versus idiopathic disease. At the NCCN 2019 Annual Congress: Hematologic Malignancies, Dr. Jeremy S. Abramson stated that rituximab is preferred as initial therapy for HHV8-positive disease, and chemotherapy can be added for patients with fulminant disease (antiretrovirals should always be used as well for those who are HIV-positive). Siltuximab is the preferred frontline therapy for idiopathic disease.

HHV8-positive multicentric Castleman disease (HIV-1–negative or HIV-1–positive) treatment—Rituximab monotherapy is included as the preferred first-line treatment option, and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) should be given to all patients with HIV-1–positive disease. In a prospective study, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory, chemotherapy-dependent disease received 4 weekly doses of rituximab at 375 mg/m2, and Twenty-two of the 24 patients were able to become independent of chemotherapy. In another phase II study of 21 patients with plasmablastic MCD, 20 achieved remission of symptoms and 14 (67%) had a radiologic response; the median follow-up was 12 months, and the OS and disease-free survival rates at 2 years were 95% and 79%, respectively, with the main adverse effect being reactivation of KS. A retrospective analysis of 113 patients reported a higher 5-year OS with rituximab compared with chemotherapy alone (90% vs. 47%). Rituximab has also been shown to decrease the risk of lymphoma in patients with HIV-associated disease.

### Idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease: a systematic literature review [^1674b9ad]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Multicentric Castleman's disease describes a group of poorly understood lymphoproliferative disorders driven by proinflammatory hypercytokinaemia. Patients have heterogeneous clinical features, characteristic lymph node histopathology, and often deadly multiple organ dysfunction. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) causes multicentric Castleman's disease in immunosuppressed patients. The cause of HHV8-negative multicentric Castleman's disease is idiopathic; such cases are called idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease. An absence of centralised information about idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease represents a major challenge for clinicians and researchers. We aimed to characterise clinical features of, treatments for, and outcomes of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease.

Methods

We did a systematic literature review and searched PubMed, the Cochrane database, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January, 1995, with keywords including "Castleman's disease" and "giant lymph node hyperplasia". Inclusion criteria were pathology-confirmed Castleman's disease in multiple nodes and minimum clinical and treatment information on individual patients. Patients with HHV8 or HIV infection or diseases known to cause Castleman-like histopathology were excluded.

Findings

Our search identified 626 (33%) patients with HHV8-negative multicentric Castleman's disease from 1923 cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. 128 patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease met all inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Furthermore, aggregated data for 127 patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease were presented from clinical trials, which were excluded from primary analyses because patient-level data were not available. Clinical features of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease included multicentric lymphadenopathy (128/128), anaemia (79/91), elevated C-reactive protein (65/79), hypergammaglobulinaemia (63/82), hypoalbuminaemia (57/63), elevated interleukin 6 (57/63), hepatomegaly or splenomegaly (52/67), fever (33/64), oedema, ascites, anasarca, or a combination (29/37), elevated soluble interleukin 2 receptor (20/21), and elevated VEGF (16/20). First-line treatments for idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease included corticosteroids (47/128 [37%]), cytotoxic chemotherapy (47/128 [37%]), and anti-interleukin 6 therapy (11/128 [9%]). 49 (42%) of 116 patients failed first-line therapy, 2-year survival was 88% (95% CI 81-95; 114 total patients, 12 events, 36 censored), and 27 (22%) of 121 patients died by the end of their observed follow-up (median 29 months [IQR 12-50]). 24 (19%) of 128 patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease had a diagnosis of a separate malignant disease, significantly higher than the frequency expected in age-matched controls (6%).

Interpretation

Our systematic review provides comprehensive information about clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease, which accounts for at least 33% of all cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. Our findings will assist with prompt recognition, diagnostic criteria development, and effective management of the disease.

### Diagnosis and management of castleman disease [^a7e6e951]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

### Multicentric Castleman's disease treated with combination chemotherapy and rituximab in four HIV-positive men: a case series [^7992abe1]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Multicentric Castleman's disease (MDC) is a rare herpesvirus-8-related prelymphomatous condition that may develop in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therapy for MCD is not well established and most often includes: corticosteroids, single or combined chemotherapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and antiretroviral therapy. In order to obtain a rapid and long-lasting clinical response, we are reporting on a short course of anthracycline-based chemotherapy associated with rituximab in HIV-positive patients with MCD. Our study suggests that the combined immuno-chemotherapy approach may represent a valid strategy with acceptable toxicity in patients with severe and extensive MDC. Further studies will be needed to assess the efficacy and safety of such an approach, and to identify risk factors predictive of long-term tolerance in HIV patients with different degrees of immunosuppression.

### Castleman disease [^d82093e9]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Castleman disease (CD), a heterogeneous group of disorders that share morphological features, is divided into unicentric CD and multicentric CD (MCD) according to the clinical presentation and disease course. Unicentric CD involves a solitary enlarged lymph node and mild symptoms and excision surgery is often curative. MCD includes a form associated with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) (also known as human herpesvirus 8) and a KSHV-negative idiopathic form (iMCD). iMCD can present in association with severe syndromes such as TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, ascites, fever, reticulin fibrosis and organomegaly) or POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder and skin changes). KSHV-MCD often occurs in the setting of HIV infection or another cause of immune deficiency. The interplay between KSHV and HIV elevates the risk for the development of KSHV-induced disorders, including KSHV-MCD, KSHV-lymphoproliferation, KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome, primary effusion lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma. A CD diagnosis requires a multidimensional approach, including clinical presentation and imaging, pathological features, and molecular virology. B cell-directed monoclonal antibody therapy is the standard of care in KSHV-MCD, and anti-IL-6 therapy is the recommended first-line therapy and only treatment of iMCD approved by the US FDA and EMA.

Treatment recommendations—HHV-8–associated disease in HIV infection state that ART is recommended for all HIV-infected patients with evidence of active KS and other HHV-8-associated malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. In HIV-infected adults with KS, HHV-8 cellular viremia and higher viral load have been associated with disease progression, and the vast majority of infected cells are not undergoing lytic replication, with anti-herpesvirus medications having had little or no effect on established KS or HHV-8 cellular viremia. In contrast, in Castleman disease many cells support lytic replication of HHV-8, and treatment with anti-herpesvirus drugs has led to substantial clinical improvement in some studies; IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir may be considered for treating multicentric Castleman disease and may be a useful adjunct for treating primary effusion lymphoma, but these diagnoses are exceedingly rare in children and adult guidelines should be consulted.

HHV8-positive multicentric Castleman disease and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) considerations—Occult KS is prevalent in HIV-1/HHV8-positive MCD and may flare after treatment with rituximab or prednisone; rituximab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin may reduce the incidence of KS exacerbation and may be particularly useful for patients with concurrent KS. Zidovudine with valganciclovir has also been shown to be active; in a study including 20 patients with HHV8-MCD alone and 34 with HHV8-MCD and KS, the 5-year PFS rate was 26% for the combination and the median PFS was 6 months. In a pilot study of 14 patients with HHV8-positive MCD, high-dose zidovudine with valganciclovir produced major clinical and biochemical responses in 86% and 50% of patients, respectively.

### FDA approval: siltuximab for the treatment of patients with multicentric castleman disease [^e17cb390]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

On April 22, 2014, the FDA granted full approval to siltuximab (SYLVANT for injection; Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody to IL6, for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. The approval was primarily based on the results of a randomized, double-blind trial in which 79 symptomatic patients with MCD were allocated (2:1) to siltuximab plus best supportive care (BSC) or to placebo plus BSC. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in each arm achieving a durable tumor and symptomatic response that persisted for a minimum of 18 weeks without treatment failure. Tumor response was based on independent review of CT scans using the revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, and symptomatic response was defined as complete resolution or stabilization of 34 MCD-related signs and symptoms as reported by the investigator. Thirty-four percent of patients in the siltuximab arm and no patients in the placebo arm met the primary endpoint (P = 0.0012). The most common adverse reactions (>10% compared with placebo) during treatment with siltuximab were pruritus, increased weight, rash, hyperuricemia, and upper respiratory tract infection.

### International, evidence-based consensus treatment guidelines for idiopathic multicentric castleman disease [^ccc308e9]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of heterogeneous hematologic disorders with characteristic histopathological features. CD can present with unicentric or multicentric (MCD) regions of lymph node enlargement. Some cases of MCD are caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), whereas others are HHV-8-negative/idiopathic (iMCD). Treatment of iMCD is challenging, and outcomes can be poor because no uniform treatment guidelines exist, few systematic studies have been conducted, and no agreed upon response criteria have been described. The purpose of this paper is to establish consensus, evidence-based treatment guidelines based on the severity of iMCD to improve outcomes. An international Working Group of 42 experts from 10 countries was convened by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network to establish consensus guidelines for the management of iMCD based on published literature, review of treatment effectiveness for 344 cases, and expert opinion. The anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab (or tocilizumab, if siltuximab is not available) with or without corticosteroids is the preferred first-line therapy for iMCD. In the most severe cases, adjuvant combination chemotherapy is recommended. Additional agents are recommended, tailored by disease severity, as second- and third-line therapies for treatment failures. Response criteria were formulated to facilitate the evaluation of treatment failure or success. These guidelines should help treating physicians to stratify patients based on disease severity in order to select the best available therapeutic option. An international registry for patients with CD (ACCELERATE, #NCT02817997) was established in October 2016 to collect patient outcomes to increase the evidence base for selection of therapies in the future.

Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)—The use of either IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir are options for treatment of MCD (CII). A 3-week course of twice-daily IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir was associated with remissions in MCD in one report, and a combination of valganciclovir and high-dose zidovudine has led to durable clinical remissions (CII). Rituximab has also emerged as an important adjunctive treatment for MCD (CII), although up to one-third of patients receiving rituximab may have subsequent exacerbations or emergence of KS. For patients with concurrent diagnoses of KS and MCD, use of both rituximab and liposomal doxorubicin is recommended (BII). Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting either interleukin-6 (IL-6) or the IL-6 receptor have also proven effective for some patients with MCD and may be utilized in some situations (BII). At this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend monitoring IL-6 levels for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Although corticosteroids are potentially effective as an adjunctive therapy for MCD, they should be used with caution or avoided, especially in patients with concurrent KS, given potential for exacerbation of life-threatening KS (AIII).

### Clinical characteristics and healthcare utilization of patients with multicentric castleman disease [^b09e550b]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease. Little is known about how patient clinical features and healthcare utilization varies by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and disease subtype. Data of MCD patients identified between 2000 and 2009 were collected from medical records at two United States treatment centres. Clinical, demographic, and biochemical characteristics, drug therapies and medical utilization were descriptively reported by HIV status and cell histology, and statistically compared with the Fisher's Exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Patients (n = 59) had a pathologically and clinically confirmed MCD diagnosis: plasmacytic (42%), hyaline vascular (29%) and mixed (15%); 10% had HIV infection. In the first year after diagnosis, MCD patients on average saw a healthcare provider more than six times, were hospitalized at least once and underwent frequent radiological and laboratory testing. Rituximab was the most commonly used drug therapy, followed by corticosteroids and conventional chemotherapy. One- and 2-year survival was excellent in HIV-negative patients (100% and 97%, respectively) but inferior for HIV-positive cases (67% and 67%, respectively). Heterogeneous treatment decisions were observed in this MCD study; HIV status was the only distinguishing clinical criteria associated with pharmacotherapies. Additional research is necessary to guide treatment of this rare lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Clinical features and outcome in HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease [^681cb9b3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe clinical features, treatment outcomes and relapse rates in HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) in a sizeable mature cohort.

Methods

From a prospective database, we identified 61 HIV-seropositive patients with histologically confirmed MCD (median follow-up, 4.2 years). Since 2003, 49 patients with newly diagnosed MCD have been treated with rituximab with (n = 14) or without (n = 35) etoposide.

Results

At MCD diagnosis, 55 (90%) of 61 patients met proposed clinical criteria defining an attack. Four patients (7%) had histologic evidence of coexisting lymphoma, and one developed lymphoma 2 years after treatment. The incidence of lymphoma is 28 per 1,000 patient years. With rituximab-based treatment, the overall survival was 94% (95% CI, 87% to 100%) at 2 years and was 90% (95% CI, 81% to 100%) at 5 years compared with 42% (95% CI, 14% to 70%) and 33% (95% CI, 6% to 60%) in 12 patients treated before introduction of rituximab (log-rank P < .001). Four of 49 rituximab-treated patients have died; three died as a result of MCD within 10 days of diagnosis, and one died as a result of lymphoma in remission of MCD. Eight of 46 patients who achieved clinical remission suffered symptomatic, histologically confirmed MCD relapse. The median time to relapse was 2 years, and all have been successfully re-treated and are alive in remission. The 2- and 5-year progression-free survival rates for all 49 patients treated with rituximab-based therapy were 85% (95% CI, 74% to 95%) and 61% (95% CI, 40% to 82%), respectively.

Conclusion

HIV-associated MCD is a remitting-relapsing disease. The outlook has improved dramatically in recent years with the introduction of rituximab-based therapy and yields high overall survival rates.

Siltuximab for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) that is HIV-1 and HHV8 negative is FDA approved based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international trial. In this trial, 79 patients with iMCD were randomized to siltuximab (n = 53) or placebo (n = 26), and siltuximab resulted in a significantly improved durable tumor and symptomatic response rate compared to placebo (34% vs. 0%; P = .0012). Long-term follow-up data, after a median follow-up of 6 years, established efficacy and safety, and siltuximab was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival compared to placebo (median PFS was not reached for siltuximab compared to 15 months for placebo; P = .0001). Adverse events of grade ≥3 were reported in 60% of patients, with hypertension (13%), fatigue (8%), nausea (7%), neutropenia (7%), and vomiting (5%) being most common. Responses were predominant in plasmacytic or mixed histologic variants and not seen in the hyaline vascular variant, although secondary analyses demonstrated similar clinical benefit across histopathologic subtypes, confirming efficacy in the hyaline vascular variant. Because the trial used placebo as the control arm, it is unknown whether siltuximab is superior to chemoimmunotherapy; therefore, chemoimmunotherapy can be considered as an appropriate treatment option in selected patients, particularly for patients with fulminant/severe disease.

Discussion

In 1956, Benjamin Castleman first reported 13 cases presenting with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and described a heterogeneous non-malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, later named Castleman disease.The disease is classified depending on whether it is localised to a single lymph node (unicentric Castleman disease) or extended to multiple areas (MCD). MCD causes systemic inflammatory symptoms, lymphoproliferation, cytopenias and multiple organ damage due to the excess of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6. Histopathological features of MCD include plasma cell hyperplasia and hypervascularity of the affected tissues.MCD is further divided into two subtypes according to the presence or absence of HHV-8 infection. MCD associated with HHV-8 is also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and frequently found in patients with HIV infection. HHV-8 produces viral IL-6, which is similar to human IL-6 and causes HHV-8-associated MCD.The other subtype, which is not associated with HHV-8 infection but its clinical and histopathological features are identical to those of HHV-8-associated MCD, is called iMCD.

Consensus diagnostic criteria for iMCD established by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network in 2013 added dermatological findings of ‘eruptive cherry hemangiomatosis or violaceous papules’ to the clinical minor criteria after the accumulation of iMCD cases presenting with skin lesions in the form of cutaneous and systemic plasmacytosis (CSP), mostly reported from Asian countries.Histopathology of CSP is identical to that of plasma-cell-type MCD, and both diseases partially share the same pathogenesis and have high levels of cytokinaemia, including IL-6. Suggestion was, therefore, made that CSP was a variant of plasma-cell-type MCD.

The consensus guideline recommends an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, siltuximab, with or without corticosteroid as the first-line therapy for iMCD regardless of disease severity.Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, is also recommended as an alternative if siltuximab is not available. Corticosteroid monotherapy is not recommended because of its high treatment failure rate and frequent relapses. There is no specific recommendation for the treatment of iMCD preceded by cutaneous manifestations.

Purpose

Single-agent chemotherapy is usually effective in HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). However, in most patients, chemotherapy cannot be discontinued.

Patients and Methods

To evaluate the efficacy of four weekly rituximab infusions (375 mg/m(2)) after discontinuation of chemotherapy in HIV-associated MCD, 24 patients were enrolled onto a prospective open-label trial.

Results

At study entry, the median time from MCD diagnosis was 21 months. All patients had stable disease on chemotherapy and were dependent on chemotherapy for a median time of 13 months. The median CD4 cell count was 270 x 10(6)/L, and the plasma HIV RNA was less than 50 copies/mL in 18 patients. One patient died with progressive disease at day 15, and 23 patients completed the four cycles of rituximab. Sustained remission (SR) off treatment at day 60 (primary end point) was achieved in 22 patients (92%). From day 60 to day 365, one patient died with acute respiratory failure of undetermined origin, and four patients experienced relapse. Seventeen patients (71%) were alive in SR at day 365 without specific treatment, and the overall survival rate was 92% (95% CI, 71% to 98%). Rituximab was well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate infections. Mild exacerbation of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions was observed in eight of 12 patients with previous KS.

Conclusion

Rituximab was both effective and safe in HIV-infected patients with chemotherapy-dependent MCD.

### Treatment consistent with idiopathic multicentric castleman disease guidelines is associated with improved outcomes [^c312d59f]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a rare hematologic disorder with an unknown etiology. Clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from mild constitutional symptoms with lymphadenopathy to life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction. International, consensus treatment guidelines developed in 2018 relied upon a limited number of clinical trials and small case series; however, to our knowledge, real-world performance of these recommendations has not been subsequently studied. Siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 (IL6), is approved for the treatment of iMCD and recommended first-line, and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL6 receptor, is recommended when siltuximab is unavailable. Chemotherapy, rituximab, and immunomodulators are recommended as second- and third-line treatments based on limited evidence. Corticosteroid monotherapy is used by clinicians, although not recommended. Here, we draw upon the ACCELERATE Natural History Registry to inventory regimens and evaluate regimen response for 102 expert-confirmed iMCD cases. Siltuximab with/without (w/wo) corticosteroids was associated with a 52% response, whereas corticosteroid monotherapy was associated with a 3% response. Anti-IL6-directed therapy with siltuximab or tocilizumab demonstrated better response and more durability than was observed with rituximab w/wo corticosteroids. Cytotoxic chemotherapy was associated with a 52% response and was predominantly administered in patients characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal failure/reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Our results provide evidence in support of current recommendations to administer anti-IL6 as first-line treatment, to administer cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with severe refractory disease, and to limit corticosteroid monotherapy. Evidence remains limited for effective agents for patients who are refractory to anti-IL6-directed therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02817997.

### Multicentric Castleman's disease treated with antivirals and immunosuppressants [^0c5aba94]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

A patient negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) developed multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with active human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection. He was treated with sequential antiviral therapy, chemotherapy, and corticosteroids. HHV-8 levels were monitored throughout the course of the patient's illness, and were found to rise on relapse. No consistent change in HHV-8 levels was found with antiviral therapy. We demonstrate that in this patient antiviral therapy was clinically ineffective, and did not alter HHV-8 levels, but that corticosteroid and combination chemotherapy led to clinical improvement. Despite the implication of HHV-8 as a cause of MCD, few studies have correlated HHV-8 levels with clinical response.

### Human immunodeficiency virus-associated multicentric castleman disease refractory to antiretroviral therapy: clinical features, treatment and outcome [^c3026a26]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2015). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a lymphoproliferation associated with human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8). Optimal treatment in patients not responding to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is undefined. We report 12 patients with ART refractory HIV-MCD. Patients with HIV-MCD were identified and baseline characteristics, treatment and outcome considered. Median CD4 count at HIV-MCD diagnosis was 295 (60-950) cells/mL. All patients had waxing and waning systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in three. Treatment included: anti-HHV-8 therapy, n = 8; alone, n = 4; with systemic chemotherapy (CT) ± immunotherapy (IT), n = 4; CT ± IT only, n = 2. Initial median HHV-8 viral load (VL) was 7 × 10(4) copies/mL and at follow-up < 40 in 6/7 survivors; and 403-7.2 × 10(6) in 4/5 who died. One patient developed NHL despite an HHV-8 VL < 40. HIV-MCD is challenging to treat. Suppression of plasma HHV-8 VL did not prevent development of NHL. Anti-HHV-8 therapy should probably be considered adjunctive to cytotoxic therapies.

Our study of 102 confirmed patients with iMCD demonstrates support for the current treatment guidelines. We found a 50% response to anti-IL6 w/wo corticosteroids and showed that objective laboratory metrics and time-to-event data support the use of anti-IL6–directed regimens and limiting corticosteroid monotherapy. These results also demonstrate that additional agents are needed for patients with refractory disease, who have few options and are at risk of death because of progression.

### Treatment consistent with idiopathic multicentric castleman disease guidelines is associated with improved outcomes [^a90bdc3c]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment guidelines for iMCD were developed by an international expert panel in 2018 based on review of a limited number of clinical trials and small case series, and recommendations were stratified by disease severity.In both severe and mild/moderate disease, siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL6 that is the only medication approved for the treatment of iMCD in the United States and Europe, is recommended first-line. This was based on evidence from its registrational phase 2 trial, which demonstrated a 34% response,together with data supporting its long-term safety.Adjunctive corticosteroids are recommended as needed.Tocilizumab, which has a similar mechanism of action but targets the IL6 receptor, is recommended as an alternative when siltuximab is not available.The addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended for patients with severe disease who progress on anti-IL6 therapy. Data are more limited for alternative treatments outside of IL6-directed therapy. For patients with mild/moderate disease who are not responding to IL6 blockade or do not exhibit cytokine-driven symptomatology, rituximab with/without (w/wo) immunomodulators is recommended as second-line treatment. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, is highly effective for human herpesvirus 8–associated MCD but has never been studied in a clinical trial in iMCD. Corticosteroid monotherapy is not recommended because of limited data in support of its use, anecdotal experience from the expert panel, and historically high rates of complications.A number of immunomodulators are listed as possible second- and third-line treatments, but there are limited available data on use of these drugs to treat iMCD.

Considering that iMCD is a rare disease, diagnosed in ∼1000 to 1200 individuals in the United States annually,it is difficult to conduct additional clinical trials that might inform treatment. Consequently, real-world data or data collected from patients treated in clinical practice and not on treatment trials have become increasingly important for understanding the natural history of, and effective treatments for, a rare disease.Although clinical trials are the gold standard, real-world data can contribute to the understanding of treatment effectiveness using clearly defined response criteria.

Herein, we present comprehensive treatment data from a cohort of 102 patients with iMCD enrolled in the ACCELERATE Natural History Registry (NCT02817997) and provide a large-scale evaluation of treatment effectiveness in this vulnerable population.

### HIV-STI treatment guidelines (...) [^d9859fbc]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file HIV Infection: Detection, Counseling, and Referral Infection with HIV causes an acute but brief and nonspecific influenza-like retroviral syndrome that can include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, arthritis, or skin rash. Most persons experience at least one symptom; however, some might be asymptomatic or have no recognition of illness. Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic illness that progressively depletes CD4+ T lymphocytes crucial for maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, persons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, life-threatening immunodeficiency. Effective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable levels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and prevents sexual transmission of HIV to others. Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are essential for achieving these goals.

Guidelines from both the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and the International AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all persons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon as possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to prevent HIV transmission.
- Acute HIV infection can occur among persons who report recent sexual or needle-sharing behavior or who have had an STI diagnosis.
- Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according to the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC is negative or indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV infection.
- Providers should not assume that a laboratory report of a negative HIV Ag/Ab or antibody test indicates that the requisite HIV RNA testing for acute HIV infection has been conducted. They should consider explicitly requesting HIV RNA testing when concerned about early acute HIV infection.
- Providers should assess eligibility of all persons seeking STI services for HIV PrEP and PEP. For persons with substantial risk whose results are HIV negative, providers should offer or provide referral for PrEP services, unless the last potential HIV exposure occurred <72 hours, in which case PEP might be indicated. Diagnostic Considerations HIV infection can be diagnosed by HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab combination immunoassays. All FDA-cleared HIV tests are highly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can detect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect HIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1. According to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC recommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratory-based HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if repeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay with a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay.

This algorithm confers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 antibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is uncommon in the United States, accurate identification is vital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from that for HIV-1. RNA testing should be performed on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative supplemental antibody test results to determine whether the discordance represents acute HIV infection. Rapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a preliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in <20 minutes. The majority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the course of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based assays and thus can produce negative results among persons recently infected. Furthermore, HIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore will not detect acute HIV infection.

### Plasma HHV8 DNA predicts relapse in individuals with HIV-associated multicentric castleman disease [^0ec24a24]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

HIV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (HIV-MCD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8. The disease follows a relapsing and remitting clinical course, with marked systemic symptoms during an active attack, which can prove fatal. Its incidence is rising, and new data indicate the utility of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab at inducing remissions in both first- and second-line settings, although biomarkers associated with relapse have not been previously identified. In 52 individuals with a histologic diagnosis of HIV-MCD, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses to predict factors associated with an HIV-MCD attack. Although a younger age (< 50 years) was associated with an attack, the strongest association was observed with plasma levels of human herpesvirus-8 DNA. Rising levels predicted an attack (hazard ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.7), and maintenance therapy with rituximab should be considered in these individuals.

### Relapse of HHV8-positive multicentric castleman disease following rituximab-based therapy in HIV-positive patients [^dc10cad8]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of HIV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (HIV+MCD) with rituximab-based approaches has dramatically improved survival and reduced the risk of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)-associated lymphoma. Longer term outcomes including relapse rates have not been described and are important to establish the potential role of maintenance therapy. A prospective cohort of 84 patients with biopsy-proven HIV+MCD were treated with risk-stratified rituximab-based therapy. Four patients (5%) died of refractory HIV+MCD and 80 achieved clinical remission. The median follow-up for the 80 patients was 6.9 years and their 5-year overall survival was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85 to 99). Eighteen have relapsed (all histologically confirmed), including 5 with concomitant HHV8-associated lymphoma and MCD at relapse. The 5-year relapse-free survival is 82% (95% CI, 72 to 92). No clinical or laboratory findings that were present at MCD diagnosis predicted subsequent relapse, and the median time to first relapse was 30 months (maximum, 10 years). There were no significant differences in clinicopathological features at initial diagnosis and at relapse. All patients were successfully retreated at relapse with rituximab-based therapy. Only 1 patient died of relapsed MCD (at fifth relapse 9.4 years after initial diagnosis). Despite the use of rituximab, the risk of developing HHV8-associated lymphoma was significantly elevated in this cohort, with an incidence of 11.4/1000 person-years. The relatively low relapse rate and high salvage rates at relapse reduce the potential benefit of maintenance therapy; this should only be advocated in the context of a clinical trial.

Methods

Patients were enrolled in the registry from the National Reference Center for Castleman disease. All patients gave informed consent, and the registry was approved by the local ethics committee and institutional review board. Enrolled patients had been diagnosed with biopsy-proven HHV8-associated MCD or KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS), tested for HIV between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2020, and treated with rituximab-based therapy as a first- or second-line therapy. For this study, we then selected the patients who achieved complete remission after rituximab therapy, excluding patients with initial treatment failure. A complete response to rituximab was defined as the resolution of constitutional symptoms, including fever, regression of peripheral lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, correction of cytopenia (hemoglobin > 10g/dL and platelets > 100 × 10 9 /L), and serum CRP level below 20 mg/L, and the absence of requirement of additional therapy. Computed tomography or positron emission tomography–computed tomography were not systematically performed in patients who were asymptomatic. Clinical and biological data, including CD19 + B-cell count using flow cytometry, whole blood HHV8 DNA using polymerase chain reaction, and serum CRP, were collected during follow-up.

Discussion

This study provides new insights on the outcome of HHV8 + Castleman disease in a large population of patients who were HIV + or HIV – and treated with rituximab. To our knowledge, this is the first series evaluating rituximab therapy in patients who were HIV –. Rituximab-based therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis of HHV8 + MCD and reduced the risk of developing HHV8-associated lymphoma in the context of HIV infection. However, despite this huge therapeutic advance and the excellent OS achieved (above 90% at 5 years), HHV8 + MCD remains a relapsing-remitting disease. The present report describes the patterns of progression after rituximab-based therapy not only in patients who were HIV + but also in those who were HIV –. The population that was HIV + is very similar to that a large cohort series in the United Kingdom and United States in terms of demographics and immune deficiency at baseline. However, in the series from the United States, almost all patients had an undetectable HIV viral load at baseline, and most patients were treated with rituximab in association with liposomal doxorubicin. In many patients from the current series, the diagnosis of MCD was simultaneous with the diagnosis of HIV infection, explaining why only 25% had already achieved complete HIV replication control under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

Methods

Study design and participants

We performed post hoc analyses of data obtained from the phase 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of siltuximab. The details of the trial have been described previously.

Eligible adults age ≥18 years with symptomatic iMCD were diagnosed based on detailed patient history, physical examination, assessment of laboratory abnormalities, pathologic diagnosis, radiologic imaging, and histologically confirmed diagnosis from an excisional lymph node biopsy acquired before enrollment. Patients included in the study were confirmed to be HIV seronegative and human herpesvirus-8 negative, as determined by a polymerase chain reaction test. Written informed consent was obtained from participants. The institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site approved the protocol. The study was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive siltuximab or placebo every 3 weeks along with best supportive care. Best supportive care could include up to 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone, as well as other supportive measures such as antipruritic, antihistamine, antipyretic, and analgesic drugs and clinical management of effusions, transfusions, infections, and infusion reactions. Not permitted was use of other biologic treatments, antitumor agents, or erythropoietin-stimulating agents or an increase in steroid dose from baseline or initiation of new steroid treatment. Treatment continued until treatment failure, discontinuation of treatment, withdrawal from the study, or 48 weeks after the last patient started treatment. Patients assigned to siltuximab discontinued study treatment at treatment failure. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo and had treatment failure were able to cross over to siltuximab.

Clinical outcomes

We compared progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with siltuximab and placebo. PFS was defined as the time from randomization until death resulting from any cause or clinical and/or radiologic progression assessed by a computerized tomography (CT) scan, as measured by the modified Cheson criteria.

Overall survival, lymph node response, durable symptomatic response, durable tumor (radiologic) and symptomatic responses, and treatment failure were also analyzed as part of these exploratory analyses and are defined in the data supplement.

Multicentric Castleman’s disease—diagnosis requires a lymph node biopsy; histology demonstrates monotypic, lambda restricted plasmablasts that are HHV-8-infected (LANA positive) and are primarily located in the mantle cell zones and/or abutting the germinal centers, and lymph node biopsies may also demonstrate concurrent KS. Research studies examining peripheral blood and effusions during episodes of flare have shown HHV-8 positive lambda restricted plasmablasts or viroblasts that may be indicative of this diagnosis, and histologic biopsy of lymph nodes remains the standard for MCD diagnosis.
