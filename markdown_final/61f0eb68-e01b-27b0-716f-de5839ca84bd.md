## Question

A 55-year-old man is scheduled for elective knee replacement surgery. During the preoperative assessment, the surgical nurse notes that the patient has thick hair around the operative site. The junior doctor asks whether the hair should be removed, and if so, what method should be used. The operating room has both razors and electric clippers available.

Based on current guidelines, what is the appropriate approach to preoperative hair removal for this patient, and what method should be used if hair removal is deemed necessary?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether preoperative hair removal is necessary for a 55-year-old man undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty, and if so, which method should be used and when it should be done. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of whether hair removal is routinely indicated or should be avoided. Then, I should verify the comparative safety and effectiveness of clippers versus razors. Next, I will consider timing and logistics, including whether to perform hair removal in the preoperative area versus the operating room. Finally, I should integrate this into a concise, actionable recommendation and ensure it aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: routine preoperative hair removal is not recommended unless the hair will interfere with the operation, because unnecessary hair removal can increase infection risk, particularly with razors. This is consistently advised by ACOG, WHO-aligned summaries, and contemporary surgical infection prevention reviews, and it is echoed by anesthesia and pain medicine consensus statements for device and joint procedures [^c57680bf] [^3f3acb7e] [^ce9f7771].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative methods before jumping to a conclusion. Multiple high-quality syntheses show that shaving with a razor increases surgical site infection risk compared with both no hair removal and clipping, whereas clipping does not increase SSI and may be comparable to no removal. Specifically, the 2021 Cochrane review found razor shaving increased SSI versus no removal and versus clipping, while clipping showed no significant difference versus no removal, and a 2016 JACS randomized noninferiority trial found similar SSI rates between clipping and no removal, supporting the safety of clipping when hair must be removed [^bf29f61e] [^6019baf6]. I should also note that a 2024 colorectal guideline explicitly recommends clipping or no removal and advises against razors, reinforcing the hierarchy of options across surgical domains [^30443f23].

> I need to check timing and setting next. If hair removal is necessary, it should be done as close to the time of surgery as possible, ideally on the day of surgery, to minimize bacterial regrowth and contamination risk. Performing it in the preoperative area rather than the operating room reduces OR contamination and improves workflow, and this approach is reflected in quality improvement bundles and contemporary practice statements [^c57680bf] [^8fb91442] [^ce9f7771].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any orthopedic-specific guidance contradicts this. I do not find orthopedic guidelines recommending routine hair removal for knee arthroplasty; instead, infection-prevention frameworks emphasize avoiding razors and using clippers if hair removal is needed, aligning with the broader SSI prevention literature and multispecialty guidance, so the general principle applies here as well [^3f3acb7e] [^30443f23].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows: do not remove hair routinely. If the hair at or around the incision site will interfere with exposure, visualization, or draping, then remove it on the day of surgery using electric clippers in the preoperative area, and avoid razors entirely. If the hair will not interfere, leave it intact. I should double-check that this matches the evidence hierarchy: yes, this aligns with moderate-certainty evidence that razors increase SSI, low-certainty evidence that clipping is comparable to no removal, and strong specialty recommendations to prefer clippers or no removal when hair removal is necessary [^bf29f61e] [^6019baf6] [^c57680bf] [^30443f23].

Do not remove hair routinely before knee replacement surgery [^c57680bf]. If hair interferes with the operation, **use electric clippers on the day of surgery** [^bf29f61e]; avoid razors because they increase SSI risk [^3f3acb7e]. If clippers are not available, a depilatory cream is an acceptable alternative [^bf29f61e]. Educate the patient not to shave the site at home [^c57680bf].

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

- **Routine hair removal**: Not recommended unless hair will interfere with the operation [^c57680bf] [^ce9f7771].

- **If hair removal is necessary**: Use electric clippers on the day of surgery [^bf29f61e]; avoid razors [^3f3acb7e].

- **Alternative method**: Depilatory cream is acceptable if clippers are unavailable [^bf29f61e].

- **Patient education**: Instruct patients not to shave the operative site at home [^c57680bf] [^f163b3f5].

---

## Rationale for recommendations

- **Increased infection risk with razors**: Razors cause microtrauma, increasing SSI risk [^3f3acb7e] [^7fde90df].

- **Clippers vs razors**: Clippers reduce SSI risk compared with razors [^bf29f61e] [^3d221372].

- **Timing**: Same-day clipping minimizes bacterial regrowth and contamination [^bf29f61e].

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACOG | - Do not remove hair unless it interferes with the operation <br/> - If needed, use clippers immediately before surgery <br/> - Avoid razors [^c57680bf] [^f163b3f5] |
| Cochrane review | - Clippers or depilatory cream preferred over razors <br/> - Razors increase SSI risk [^bf29f61e] [^3d221372] |
| WHO | - No routine hair removal <br/> - If needed, use clippers or depilatory cream [^833e1e4c] |

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not remove hair routinely before knee replacement surgery [^c57680bf]. If hair interferes with the operation, **use electric clippers on the day of surgery** [^bf29f61e]; avoid razors because they increase SSI risk [^3f3acb7e]. If clippers are unavailable, a depilatory cream is an acceptable alternative [^bf29f61e]. Educate the patient not to shave the site at home [^c57680bf].

### The effect of hair removal on intraoperative contamination… [^d2c12efa]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

A prospective, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial with the purpose of investigating, whether preoperative electrical clipping of body hair affects the risk of intraoperative contamination. The primary investigators hypothesis is this: Preoperative electrical clipping of body hair in the operative field lowers the risk of intraoperative contamination. 200 male participants, 18 years or older, with a planned primary knee replacement surgery, will be enrolled. During surgery, four microbiological samples will be taken from each participant. The primary outcome is whether there is intraoperative contamination of the surgical site or not, determined by identification of any grown bacteria from the samples.

If this study finds, that the contamination rate is lowered by preoperative electrical clipping of body hair, it will provide a cost-effective method of reducing the risk of intraoperative contamination and consequent postoperative infection, a solid argument for a change of current guidelines for preoperative hair removal, and provide additional information pointing towards body hair as a possible explanation for the increased infection rate in men. Detailed Description. A late ph. d. -study conducted at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital has shown a 15 percentage difference in contamination rates when comparing participants who had their body hair removed preoperatively, and those who did not. Based on the finds in the aforementioned study, the hypothesis for this study is that preoperative electrical clipping of body hair in the operative field lowers the risk of intraoperative contamination.

The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether preoperative electrical clipping of body hair affects the risk of intraoperative contamination. A prospective, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be performed. The study population consists of 200 male patients, 18 years or older, with a planned primary knee replacement surgery. The study population consists of only male patients, since males generally have denser body hair and a higher contamination rate than females. Exclusion criteria include known skin disease, use of antibiotics 4 weeks prior to surgery, if patients due to mental reasons, a language barrier or other reasons are unable to participate in the study, as well as no body hair in the surgical field. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or the control group using a 1: 1 randomization ratio.

The randomization is performed electronically by a medical student or the operating surgeon and the pre-assessment consultation. Clipping is performed by hospital staff on the day of surgery. The degree of body hair on both knees is photo-documented for all participants, for the intervention group after the clipping of body hair on the relevant knee has been performed. During the surgery, biological material from every participant is collected as four microbiological samples, taken using Copan ESwabs. The first swab is taken before the skin is surgically prepared, the second immediately after incision of the skin, the third swab is taken just prior to the change of gloves performed before cementation of the prothesis, and the last swab is taken after closure of the joint capsule before closure of the skin. Samples will be collected at Orthopedic Departments of Gentofte Hospital. All samples will be sent to Department of Clinical Microbiology, Herlev Hospital, for culturing.

### Preoperative hair removal to reduce surgical site infection [^bf29f61e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hair has traditionally been removed from the surgical site before surgery; however, some studies claim that this increases surgical site infections (SSIs) and should be avoided. This is the second update of a review published in 2006 and first updated in 2011.

Objectives

To determine whether routine preoperative hair removal (compared with no removal) and the method, timing, or setting of hair removal effect SSI rates.

Search Methods

In November 2019, for this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies plus reviews to identify additional studies. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials that compared: · hair removal with no hair removal; · different methods of hair removal; and · hair removal at different times before surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the relevance of each study. Data were extracted independently by both review authors and cross-checked. We carried out 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the certainty of evidence according to GRADE. Sensitivity analyses excluding studies at high risk of bias were conducted.

Main Results

We included 11 new studies in this update resulting in a total of 19 randomised and 6 quasi-randomised trials (8919 participants). Clipping compared with no hair removal Low certainty evidence suggests there may be little difference in risk of SSI when no hair removal is compared with hair removal using clippers (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.39; three studies with 1733 participants). Shaving with a razor compared with no hair removal Moderate certainty evidence suggests the risk of SSI is probably increased in participants who have hair removal with a razor compared with no removal (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.14; seven studies with 1706 participants). In terms of absolute risk this represents 17 more SSIs per 1000 in the razor group compared with the no hair removal group (95% CI 1 more to 45 more SSI in the razor group). Based on low-certainty evidence, it is unclear whether there is a difference in stitch abscesses between hair removal with a razor and no hair removal (1 trial with 80 participants; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66). Based on narrative data from one trial with 136 participants, there may be little difference in length of hospital stay between participants having hair removed with a razor compared with those having no hair removal (low-certainty evidence). Based on narrative data from one trial with 278 participants, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in cost between participants having hair removed by shaving with a razor compared with no hair removal (very low certainty evidence). Depilatory cream compared with no hair removal Low certainty evidence suggests there may be little difference in SSI risk between depilatory cream or no hair removal, although there are were wide confidence intervals around the point estimate that included benefit and harm (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.31; low-certainty evidence; 1 trial with 267 participants). Based on narrative data from one trial with 267 participants, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in cost between participants having hair removed with depilatory cream compared with no hair removal (very low certainty evidence). Shaving with a razor compared with clipping Moderate-certainty evidence from 7 studies with 3723 participants suggests the risk of SSI is probably increased by shaving with a razor compared with clipping (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.33). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests the risk of skin injury is probably increased in people who have hair removal with a razor rather than clipping (3 trials with 1333 participants; RR 1.74, CI 95% 1.12 to 2.71). Shaving with a razor compared with depilatory cream Moderate-certainty evidence from 9 studies with 1593 participants suggests there is probably more SSI risk when razors are used compared with depilatory cream (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.65). Low-certainty evidence suggests the risk of skin injury may be increased when using a razor rather than depilatory cream for hair removal (RR 6.95, CI 95% 3.45 to 13.98; 5 trials with 937 participants). Based on narrative data from three trials with 402 participants, it is uncertain whether depilatory cream is more expensive than shaving (very low certainty evidence). Hair removal on the day of surgery compared with one-day preoperatively Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be a small reduction in SSI risk when hair is removed on the day of surgery compared with the day before surgery although there are were wide confidence intervals around the point estimate that included benefit and harm (one trial, 977 participants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30).

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with no hair removal, there may be little difference in risk of SSI when clippers or depilatory cream are used (low-certainty evidence). However, there are probably fewer SSIs when hair is not removed compared with shaving with a razor (moderate-certainty evidence). If hair has to be removed, moderate-certainty evidence suggests using clippers or depilatory cream probably results in fewer SSIs and other complications compared with shaving using a razor. There may be a small reduction in SSIs when hair is removed on the day of, rather than the day before, surgery.

### Impact of hair removal on surgical site infection rates: a prospective randomized noninferiority trial [^6019baf6]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite substantial prevention efforts, surgical site infections (SSIs) remain the most common health care-associated infection. It is unclear whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to leave hair intact preoperatively reduces SSIs.

Study Design

A single-center, prospective, randomized, clinical trial was conducted from October 2009 to February 2015 in a 325-bed multispecialty, tertiary care teaching hospital to test the noninferiority of clipping hair to no hair removal in the prevention of SSIs. A total of 4,908 adults scheduled for elective general surgical procedures were screened for study participation. Of these, 600 were approached but refused, and 2,630 were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either the clipped group (n = 834) or the not-clipped group (n = 844). The clipped group had hair at the surgical site removed using disposable electric clippers. Of the randomized patients, 1,543 (768 in the clipped group and 775 in the not-clipped group) completed follow-up. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who could be evaluated and who had no SSI, as defined by CDC criteria.

Results

Baseline demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics were similar between groups. The overall rate of SSI in the per-protocol analysis was 6.12% (47 of 768) in the clipped group and 6.32% (49 of 775) in the not-clipped group (absolute risk difference -0.20%; 95% CI -2.61% to 2.21%), p = 0.037). Because the absolute risk difference confidence interval included the prespecified noninferiority margin of 2%, we were unable to definitively demonstrate noninferiority for clipping hair.

Conclusions

Surgical site infection rates were similar whether hair was clipped or not in patients undergoing general surgical procedures.

### Preoperative hair removal to reduce surgical site infection [^3d221372]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although preparation of people for surgery has traditionally included removal of hair from the incision site, some studies claim that preoperative hair removal is harmful, causes surgical site infections (SSIs), and should be avoided.

Objectives

To determine if routine pre-operative hair removal (compared with no removal) and the timing or method of hair removal influence rates of SSI.

Search Methods

For this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 12 August 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to August Week 1 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations August 11, 2010); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 31) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 11August 2011). No date or language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi randomised trials (QRCTs) that compared:1) hair removal with no hair removal; 2) different methods of hair removal; 3) hair removal at different times before surgery; and, 4) hair removal in different settings (e.g. ward, anaesthetic room).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed relevance and quality of each trial. Data were extracted independently by two authors and cross-checked.

Main Results

We included 14 trials (17 comparisons) in the review; three trials involved multiple comparisons. Six trials, two of which had three comparison arms, (972 participants) compared hair removal (shaving, clipping, or depilatory cream) with no hair removal and found no statistically significant difference in SSI rates however the comparison is underpowered. Three trials (1343 participants) that compared shaving with clipping showed significantly more SSIs associated with shaving (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.80). Seven trials (1213 participants) found no significant difference in SSI rates when hair removal by shaving was compared with depilatory cream (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.21), however this comparison is also underpowered. One trial compared two groups that shaved or clipped hair on the day of surgery compared with the day before surgery; there was no statistically significant difference in the number of SSIs between groups however this comparison was also underpowered. We identified no trials that compared clipping with depilatory cream; or investigated application of depilatory cream at different pre-operative time points, or hair removal in different settings (e.g. ward, anaesthetic room).

Authors' Conclusions

Whilst this review found no statistically significant effect on SSI rates of hair removal insufficient numbers of people have been involved in this research to allow confidence in a conclusion. When it is necessary to remove hair, the existing evidence suggests that clippers are associated with fewer SSIs than razors. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between depilatory creams and shaving, or between shaving or clipping the day before surgery or on the day of surgery however studies were small and more research is needed.

### Preoperative hair removal to reduce surgical site infection [^75c0e9d4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The preparation of people for surgery has traditionally included the routine removal of body hair from the intended surgical wound site. However, there are studies which claim that pre-operative hair removal is deleterious to patients, perhaps by causing surgical site infections (SSIs), and should not be carried out.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to determine if routine pre-operative hair removal results in fewer SSIs than not removing hair.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (October 2005), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), and the ZETOC database of conference proceedings (1993 to 2005). We also contacted manufacturers of hair removal products.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hair removal with no hair removal, different methods of hair removal, hair removal conducted at different times prior to surgery and hair removal carried out in different settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the relevance and quality of each trial. Data was extracted independently by one author and cross checked for accuracy by a second author.

Main Results

Eleven RCTs were included in this review. Three trials involving 625 people compared hair removal using either depilatory cream or razors with no hair removal and found no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of surgical site infections. No trials were identified which compared clipping with no hair removal. Three trials involving 3193 people compared shaving with clipping and found that there were statistically significantly more SSIs when people were shaved rather than clipped (RR 2.02, 95%CI 1.21 to 3.36). Seven trials involving 1213 people compared shaving with removing hair using a depilatory cream and found that there were statistically significantly more SSIs when people were shaved than when a cream was used (RR 1.54, 95%CI 1.05 to 2.24). No trials were found that compared clipping with a depilatory cream. One trial compared shaving on the day of surgery with shaving the day before surgery and one trial compared clipping on the day of surgery with clipping the day before surgery; neither trial found a statistically significant difference in the number of SSIs. No trials were found that compared depilatory cream at different times or that compared hair removal in different settings.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence finds no difference in SSIs among patients who have had hair removed prior to surgery and those who have not. If it is necessary to remove hair then both clipping and depilatory creams results in fewer SSIs than shaving using a razor. There is no difference in SSIs when patients are shaved or clipped one day before surgery or on the day of surgery.

### Practices and attitudes of surgeons toward the prevention of surgical site infections: a provincial survey in Alberta, Canada [^2ec89b19]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

We surveyed 589 surgeons in Alberta, Canada, about the prevention of surgical site infections and compared their practices to the recommendations of evidence-based guidelines. Of the 247 (42%) who responded, most (156 [63%]) were not in compliance with guideline recommendations for preoperative bathing, hair removal, antimicrobial prophylaxis, or intraoperative skin preparation (although 91 [37%] state they are following guidelines).

### Hair removal policies in clean surgery: systematic review of randomized, controlled trials [^d096ec95]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether certain hair removal policies are better than others to prevent surgical-site infections in patients undergoing clean surgery.

Methods

Publications were retrieved by a systematic search of Medline, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE up to February 2005. Additionally, the reference lists of all identified trials were examined. All randomized trials, quasi-randomized trials, and systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing hair removal policies in clean surgery were selected. Trials involving patients undergoing cranial neurosurgery were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Data from the original publications were used to calculate the relative risk or risk difference of surgical-site infection. Data for similar outcomes were combined in the analysis, where appropriate, with the use of a random effects model.

Results

Four trials were included in the review. No eligible systematic review or meta-analysis of randomized or quasi-randomized trials was found. The quality of the trials and how they were reported were generally unsatisfactory. Evidence regarding whether preoperative hair removal has any effect was inconclusive. When hair removal was considered necessary, evidence about the best time for removal was inconclusive. There was some evidence that hair removal by clipper is superior to removal by razor.

Conclusions

Because of insufficient evidence as a basis for recommendations, the practical consequences for ward management were essential when the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention formulated its recommendations for hair removal policies. Large randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal policy for preoperative hair removal.

Regarding specific circumstances for surgical site infection, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing gynecologic surgery (surgical field preparation), ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend to do not remove hair preoperatively unless the hair at or around the incision site will interfere with the operation. Perform any necessary hair removal immediately before the operation, preferably with electric clippers. Do not use razors. Instruct patients not to shave the operative site themselves because shaving with a razor increases their risk of infection.

### Surgical site infection prevention: a review [^3f3acb7e]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 0.5% to 3% of patients undergoing surgery will experience infection at or adjacent to the surgical incision site. Compared with patients undergoing surgery who do not have a surgical site infection, those with a surgical site infection are hospitalized approximately 7 to 11 days longer.

Observations

Most surgical site infections can be prevented if appropriate strategies are implemented. These infections are typically caused when bacteria from the patient's endogenous flora are inoculated into the surgical site at the time of surgery. Development of an infection depends on various factors such as the health of the patient's immune system, presence of foreign material, degree of bacterial wound contamination, and use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Although numerous strategies are recommended by international organizations to decrease surgical site infection, only 6 general strategies are supported by randomized trials. Interventions that are associated with lower rates of infection include avoiding razors for hair removal (4.4% with razors vs 2.5% with clippers); decolonization with intranasal antistaphylococcal agents and antistaphylococcal skin antiseptics for high-risk procedures (0.8% with decolonization vs 2% without); use of chlorhexidine gluconate and alcohol-based skin preparation (4.0% with chlorhexidine gluconate plus alcohol vs 6.5% with povidone iodine plus alcohol); maintaining normothermia with active warming such as warmed intravenous fluids, skin warming, and warm forced air to keep the body temperature warmer than 36 °C (4.7% with active warming vs 13% without); perioperative glycemic control (9.4% with glucose < 150 mg/dL vs 16% with glucose > 150 mg/dL); and use of negative pressure wound therapy (9.7% with vs 15% without). Guidelines recommend appropriate dosing, timing, and choice of preoperative parenteral antimicrobial prophylaxis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Surgical site infections affect approximately 0.5% to 3% of patients undergoing surgery and are associated with longer hospital stays than patients with no surgical site infections. Avoiding razors for hair removal, maintaining normothermia, use of chlorhexidine gluconate plus alcohol-based skin preparation agents, decolonization with intranasal antistaphylococcal agents and antistaphylococcal skin antiseptics for high-risk procedures, controlling for perioperative glucose concentrations, and using negative pressure wound therapy can reduce the rate of surgical site infections.

Preoperative preventive measures — Treat remote infection: all infections remote to the surgical site, such as skin or urinary tract infections, should be identified and treated before an elective operation, and elective operations on patients with remote site infections should be postponed until the infection has resolved. Do not shave incision site: hair should not be removed preoperatively unless it will interfere with the operation; any necessary hair removal should be done immediately before the operation, preferably with electric clippers; a razor should not be used; and patients should be instructed not to shave the operative site themselves because shaving with a razor increases their risk of infection.

Orthopedic surgery

Because orthopedic procedures are performed in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, increased vigilance, strict adherence to aseptic technique, attention to adequacy of reprocessing and management of intraoperative breaches of sterile technique are vitally important to ensure a safe and consistent standard of care.

According to the National Healthcare Safety Network report, which includes data from 2006 to 2008 in the USA, the total number of patients who develop SSIs following any type of orthopedic surgery is somewhere between 31,000 and 35,000. SSIs in orthopedic surgery prolong total hospital stay by a median of 2 weeks per patient, approximately double readmission rates, and increase health care costs by more than 300%. Moreover, patients with SSIs have substantially greater physical limitations and significant reductions in their quality of life.

The rates of SSIs following orthopedic procedures appear to be increased when certain risk factors are present. Risk factors can be either patient modifiable or not modifiable and/or procedure-specific, in which case they may again be modifiable or not modifiable.

Hair removal, perioperative normothermia, preoperative skin preparation, nasal decolonization, health problems and situations predisposing the patient to infection, skin antisepsis, surgical hand antisepsis, antibiotic prophylaxis, air quality, double gloves, traffic pattern gowns and drapes, bone cement, and sterility assurance are key factors for controlling the risk of infections.

Although the use of antimicrobial sutures is not routine practice, the benefits of this strategy are becoming increasingly apparent. Likewise, advances in antimicrobial coatings for implants, instruments, equipment and the environment may provide additional support to reach the goal of no SSIs. The practice of prescreening patients prior to surgery is recommended, as part of a comprehensive program to eliminate SSIs in orthopedic surgery, especially in cases involving an implantable device.

### Surgical site infection incidence and risk factors in knee arthroplasty: a 9-year prospective cohort study at a university teaching hospital in Spain [^d6ab5aaa]. American Journal of Infection Control (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the complications posed by knee replacement surgery. Hospital-based infection surveillance systems may provide indicators of improvement and allow the characterization of risk factors critical to reduce infection. The aims of this study were to compare the incidence of SSI in our center with rates in the Madrid Region, Spain, and the United States, and to evaluate any possible SSI-related risk factor in knee replacement surgery.

Methods

All patients who underwent knee replacement surgery at a tertiary hospital in 2008–2016 were included. SSI was defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Infection rate was calculated. The association between risk factors and SSI incidence was assessed by reference to odds ratio (OR) with multivariate analysis.

Results

The study population (n = 1969) had a global SSI risk of 1.0%. We found a declining trend in the follow-up period, from an SSI risk of 1.8% in 2009 to 0.4% in 2016. Independent risk factors included hair removal (OR: 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27–7.50) and National Healthcare Safety Network risk index ≥ 2 (OR: 9.37, 95% CI: 2.90–30.26).

Conclusion

This study identified risk factors that showed the necessity to strictly comply with wound decontamination and patient preparation protocols, reduce surgery duration, and identify patients who require comprehensive monitoring.

### Intravenous sedation vs general anesthesia for pediatric otolaryngology procedures… [^01250a75]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Objective To compare efficacy, safety, and hospital charges for common pediatric otolaryngology procedures with the use of intravenous sedation vs general anesthesia. Design Retrospective chart study. Setting Hospital-based pediatric otolaryngology practice. Patients Patients younger than 18 years who underwent tympanostomy tube removal and/or patch myringoplasty with absorbable gelatin sponge, nasal ciliary biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, or other minor procedures between September 1, 1998, and August 31, 2001. Interventions Procedures performed in 2 settings: outpatient clinic with IVS or operating room with GA. Main Outcome Measures Procedure completion rate, tympanic membrane perforation rate after ear procedures, complications, and hospital charges. Results. Of 103 procedures, 54 were performed with IVS and 49 with GA. Within the GA group, 32 of 49 patients had additional operations performed and were excluded from analysis of safety and hospital charges.

Procedure completion rate was 100% in both groups. The most common procedure was tympanostomy tube removal with patch myringoplasty. Several procedures encountered in a pediatric otolaryngology practice have traditionally required general anesthesia because of their painful and anxiety-provoking nature in a subset of patients. Examples include removal of tympanostomy tubes, patch myringoplasty, foreign body removal from the ear or nose, fine-needle aspiration, and nasociliary biopsies. Since September 1998, the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery at Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, has used the Pediatric Sedation Service for many of these procedures. This service, staffed full-time by dedicated pediatric anesthesiologists and nurses, was established at OHSU in 1995 to provide sedation for a variety of pediatric procedures.

We believe this service provides a safe, effective, and cost-saving alternative to performing such procedures in the operating room. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with use of the Pediatric Sedation Service to perform minor procedures in the outpatient clinic. All procedures in which IVS was used in the pediatric otolaryngology clinic at OHSU during a 3-year period between September 1, 1998, and August 31, 2001, were reviewed. Procedures were identified through a database maintained by one of us and correlated with records provided by the Pediatric Sedation Service. The most common procedures were tympanostomy tube removal with patch myringoplasty using absorbable gelatin sponge, GPM alone, tube removal alone, and biopsies. Other procedures performed are listed in Table 1. All patients were younger than 18 years, and all procedures were performed by a single surgeon.

To compare efficacy between groups, procedure completion rate and outcomes were determined. In patients who underwent tube removal with or without GPM, outcomes were assessed by evaluating tympanic membrane status at follow-up visits. A patient was deemed as having a persistent perforation if the eardrum had not healed within 6 months of the procedure. Biopsy outcomes were assessed by reviewing the final pathology report for each specimen. Nasociliary biopsies were considered nondiagnostic if no cilia were identified with electron microscopy, thus preventing ultrastructural analysis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsies were deemed nondiagnostic when inadequate cellular material was obtained to establish a diagnosis. Procedures using IVS or GA in the category of "other" in Table 1 were not compared with respect to outcomes because of the small number of cases. Several factors determine whether a minor otolaryngologic procedure is performed with IVS or GA.

### Minimizing hair dispersal: is this an opportunity for improvement in health care-acquired infection prevention? [^64d1f8aa]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

We performed a study to understand common practices in surgical site hair removal and barriers to guideline compliance in surgical site hair removal. We found most health care providers in the United States do not remove hair outside of the operating room. Our findings reveal minimizing hair dispersal in the operating room, including improved and innovative ways for collecting clipped loose hair, is a significant area for improvement in surgical quality and health care-acquired infection prevention.

### Evidence update on prevention of surgical site infection [^3cae114b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common healthcare-associated infection and complicates up to 10–20% of operations with considerable strain on healthcare resources. Apart from the widely adopted use of appropriate hair removal, antibiotic prophylaxis, avoidance of hypothermia and perioperative glycaemic control to reduce SSIs, this review has considered new research and systematic reviews, and whether their findings should be included in guidelines.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of preoperative bathing/showering, antibiotic prophylaxis for clean surgery and perioperative oxygen supplementation to reduce the risk of SSI is still in doubt. By contrast, the use of 2% chlorhexidine in alcohol skin preparation, postoperative negative pressure wound therapy and antiseptic surgical dressings do show promise. Antimicrobial sutures in independent meta-analyses were found to reduce the risk of SSI after all classes of surgery (except dirty) whereas the use of wound guards, or diathermy skin incision (compared with scalpel incision), did not.

Summary

The incidence of SSI after surgery is not falling. Based on this review of published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews some advances might be included into these care bundles. More research is needed together with improved compliance with care bundles.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^ce9f7771]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ASRA Pain Medicine — screening, decolonization, hygiene, antibiotics, and hair removal to reduce surgical site infections: Perioperative blood glucose should ideally be maintained at ≤ 150 mg/dl for implantable device surgeries. Patients should be tested for Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA) using a nasal swab, and decolonization should be performed in colonized patients prior to pain device implantation. In individuals known previously to be carriers, decolonization should be repeated prior to additional procedures beyond 90 days from initial decolonization, and decolonization should occur no earlier than 10 days prior to the planned surgery. When performing decolonization, use mupirocin nasal application and chlorhexidine body wash. Hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub prior to the first case of the day, before and after glove use, before and after patient contact, and any time hands are visibly soiled is directed, with use of alcohol-based scrub for manufacturer recommended time or surgical hand scrub for at least 2 min. Appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis administered within 1 hour prior to surgical incision (2 hours for vancomycin) is recommended; prophylactic intradiscal and intravenous antibiotics have not been shown to conclusively decrease the rate of discitis in humans. Vancomycin should only be used in patients colonized with MRSA or who are at high risk for MRSA. Do not perform hair removal routinely prior to procedures, and if hair is removed, use electric clippers immediately before surgery.

### Perioperative antibiotic use in cutaneous surgery [^64322b5f]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral antibiotic prophylaxis is overly prescribed for procedures involving the integumentary system (skin, hair, nails, and related subcutaneous tissue) and mucosa. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis preventing infective endocarditis or hematogenous prosthetic joint infection is recommended only when operating on infected or mucosal sites of select, high-risk patients. There are limited data supporting oral antibiotic use to prevent surgical site infections, and antibiotics are not recommended for routine use. Alternatives to oral antibiotics that may reduce infection risk, such as wound antisepsis, are sought. Altogether, risk stratification and antibiotic stewardship are both necessary for appropriate perioperative oral antibiotic use for dermatologic surgery.

### Reducing surgical risks for hair replacement surgery [^52c208b7]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hair loss is a common problem among men and women. Hair replacement surgery (HRS) has become increasingly popular as technological advancements have been made producing remarkably natural results when performed by a skilled surgeon. Although complications from HRS are low compared with other esthetic surgeries, they can still occur even with the best-trained and qualified surgeon or staff. The process of hair restoration can be a long road for some patients and active patient participation and education is key for successful results. In this article, we seek to discuss the surgical risks of HRS and discuss methods to prevent them in your practice.

### Role of antiseptics in the prevention of surgical site infections [^f2ff84e9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antiseptics are chemical agents used to reduce the microbial population on the surface of the skin and are used in nearly every surgical procedure today. Despite this, there are currently no definitive guidelines on surgical preoperative antisepsis that indicate a specific regimen based on demonstration of superior efficacy.

Objective

This review serves to examine preoperative antisepsis, including cutaneous bacteriology, preoperative hair removal, preoperative decolonization, surgical attire, and the antiseptic agents themselves.

Materials and Methods

A review of the literature on surgical antiseptics was performed.

Results

Although numerous studies have demonstrated differences in bacterial colonization rates, few well-controlled investigations have demonstrated superiority of a given regimen. The alcohol-based iodophor and chlorhexidine products seem to exhibit greater efficacy than their aqueous counterparts.

Conclusion

More randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine if any specific regimen is most effective. At this point in time, product usage should be based on specific attributes relating to the products, such as iodophors around the eyes and/or ears to avoid irritation and aqueous-based solutions in hair bearing areas because of concern for flammability. Ultimately, it is up to the individual surgeon to tailor the optimal antiseptic regimen for their specific scope of practice.

### New WHO recommendations on preoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^833e1e4c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most preventable health-care-associated infections and are a substantial burden to health-care systems and service payers worldwide in terms of patient morbidity, mortality, and additional costs. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations of national guidelines have been identified. Given the burden of SSIs worldwide, the numerous gaps in evidence-based guidance, and the need for standardisation and a global approach, WHO decided to prioritise the development of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSIs. The guidelines take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences. On the basis of systematic literature reviews and expert consensus, we present 13 recommendations on preoperative preventive measures.

Intraoperative interventions for colorectal surgery — on the day of surgery, patients should have their hair removed from the surgical site using a clipper or not removed at all. Shaving with a razor before surgery is discouraged. Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence. Evidence indicates clipping versus no hair removal does not reduce overall SSI (RR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.65–1.39), while razor shaving increases overall SSI compared to no shaving (RR 1.82; 95% CI, 1.05–3.14) and compared to clipping (RR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.16–2.33).

Upon arrival on the day of the procedure, the patient is brought to the preoperative area, where an updated history and physical is obtained, bloodwork is performed to evaluate CBC, INR, blood chemistry panel, urine pregnancy test, and blood glucose level, and an IV access is secured. A temperature over 100°F is considered a fever and should lead to procedure postponement for further evaluation of a possible infection source. Otherwise, skin in the incision area is carefully examined for rash, eruptions, or evidence of infection. The hair should be removed with an electric clipper with care taken to avoid abrasions, followed by the use of tape to removed clipped hair.

### Exploration of a quality improvement process to standardised preoperative tests for a surgical procedure to reduce waste [^e63bf83e]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Preoperative tests, along with history and physical examination, determine patients' fitness for anaesthesia and surgery. Preoperative tests in an asymptomatic individual do not predict complications. Routine preoperative tests are defined as those done in the absence of any specific clinical indication or purpose; they are conducted in all patients undergoing a given procedure, regardless of their medical history or other clinical features. Tests are unnecessary when they do not contribute to the care or positive clinical outcomes in a patient before or after surgery. Currently, several medical authorities discourage extensive, non-selective routine testing in patients undergoing elective surgeries. Instead, tests are recommended based on the patients' medical comorbidities.

According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, 62 000 hip replacements and 75 000 knee replacements were performed in Canada in 2018–2019; a total of more than 1.4 billion dollars were spent on these surgeries. Given the significant number of procedures performed every year, unnecessary testing may significantly burden the patients, both physically and emotionally. In addition, it may strain financial, human and operational resources within provincial health systems. Also, unnecessary testing may result in the postponement of a surgery that could affect the health of a patient and their quality of life. Furthermore, unnecessary testing in an asymptomatic individual can cause false-positive results. False-positive results can lead to a battery of further unnecessary tests and consultations, which can result in a delay of surgery and additional cost to the system.

### Preoperative skin antiseptics for preventing surgical wound infections after clean surgery [^ffc2a4e5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection rates in the month following clean surgery vary from 0.6% (knee prosthesis) to 5% (limb amputation). Due to the large number of clean surgical procedures conducted annually the costs of these surgical site infections (SSIs) can be considerable in financial and social terms. Preoperative skin antisepsis using antiseptics is performed to reduce the risk of SSIs by removing soil and transient organisms from the skin where a surgical incision will be made. Antiseptics are thought to be toxic to bacteria and therefore aid their mechanical removal. The effectiveness of preoperative skin preparation is thought to be dependent on both the antiseptic used and the method of application, however, it is unclear whether preoperative skin antisepsis actually reduces postoperative wound infection, and, if so, which antiseptic is most effective.

Objectives

To determine whether preoperative skin antisepsis immediately prior to surgical incision for clean surgery prevents SSI and to determine the comparative effectiveness of alternative antiseptics.

Search Methods

For this third update we searched just the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 27 January 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 12).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of preoperative skin antiseptics applied immediately prior to incision in clean surgery. There was no restriction on the inclusion of reports based on language of publication, date or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were undertaken independently by two review authors.

Main Results

There were no new studies added to the review in the third updateThirteen studies were included in this review (2,623 participants). These evaluated several different types of skin antiseptics - leading to 11 different comparisons being made. Although the antiseptics evaluated differed between studies, all trials involved some form of iodine. Iodine in alcohol was compared to alcohol alone in one trial; one trial compared povidone iodine paint (solution type not reported) with soap and alcohol. Six studies compared different types of iodine-containing products with each other and five compared iodine-containing products with chlorhexidine-containing products. There was evidence from one study suggesting that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits led to a reduced risk of SSI compared with an alcohol based povidone iodine solution: RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.82). However, it is important to note that the trial does not report important details regarding the interventions (such as the concentration of povidone iodine paint used) and trial conduct, such that risk of bias was unclear. There were no other statistically significant differences in SSI rates in the other comparisons of skin antisepsis. Overall the risk of bias in included studies was unclear. A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis was conducted and this suggested that alcohol-containing products had the highest probability of being effective - however, again the quality of this evidence was low.

Authors' Conclusions

A comprehensive review of current evidence found some evidence that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits was associated with lower rates of SSIs following clean surgery than alcohol-based povidone iodine paint. However this single study was poorly reported. Practitioners may therefore elect to consider other characteristics such as costs and potential side effects when choosing between alternatives. The design of future trials should be driven by the questions of high priority to decision makers. It may be that investment in at least one large trial (in terms of participants) is warranted in order to add definitive and hopefully conclusive data to the current evidence base. Ideally any future trial would evaluate the iodine-containing and chlorhexidine-containing solutions relevant to current practice as well as the type of solution used (alcohol vs. aqueous).

Strategy

PDCA cycle 1: To clarify current knowledge, the multidisciplinary team members met and researched the possible causes of surgical site infection. The 72 cases with SSI were analyzed and 14 factors were identified as noncompliance with prevention of SSI. In light of this, the team planned the following:

Communicate the project aim and objectives to all key stakeholders of surgical service
Revise the clinical practice guidelines about surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis based on scientific evidence
Educate all surgical specialties about the recommended clinical practice guidelines
Implement the hospital-approved antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines and monitor compliance
Review the intraoperative practice about surgical scrub and site preparation
Develop SSI bundle, and educate all surgical service members on the bundle
Implement the bundle, evaluate and monitor compliance
Develop preoperative education material for surgical patients
Report and feedback monthly SSI rate to surgical specialties
Carry out root cause analysis (RCA) for reported SSI.

The following prevention strategies were implemented:

Preoperative screening to ensure patients is medically fit for surgery
Reinforcement of the preoperative patient education regarding hair removal using clippers (if hair removal is required) and the use of an antiseptic agent for bathing (ie, chlorhexidine gluconate) prior surgery
Observation of the skin preparation technique followed pre surgery in the operating room (OR)
Administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis in accordance with evidence based standards and guidelines
Limit OR traffic when operative procedure is ongoing
Maintenance of normothermia of all post-operative patients in the pre holding area, intra operatively and during the recovery phase
Improve communication of SSI rates with key stakeholders
Performing surgical wound dressing under strict aseptic technique.

Noncompliance with the above identified factors was observed among the surgical team. Hence, OR leadership took ownership to reinforce the implementation of the SSI Bundle. The assistant director of surgical services, OR manager, and OR nurse educator reinforced the SSI bundle and the recommended clinical practice guidelines during the surgical department meeting, and the strategies were then trialled again as PDCA cycle 2.

### Wound hygiene practices after total knee arthroplasty: does it Matter? [^880ed073]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current literature is limited with regard to standardized postoperative surgical site hygiene after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With little guidance from the literature, the timing of permissible postoperative cleaning is a decision made by the individual surgeon using anecdotal evidence. A standardized wound care regimen is of particular interest to minimize the risk of infection.

Methods

To examine what species of bacteria recolonize the surgical site postoperatively, a randomized controlled trial was performed of 16 TKA patients who were allowed to shower at 2 days postoperatively and of 16 patients who were asked to wait until 2 weeks postoperatively before showering after TKA. Culture swabs of skin adjacent to the incision were performed preoperatively, just after incision closure, at dressing removal, and at 2 weeks postoperatively. Bacteria were speciated and compared between groups. A swab of the contralateral knee was performed at 2 weeks as a control. A survey of patient's preference regarding early and late showering was also carried out.

Results

No difference was found between the groups in rate of colonization or bacterial type, and no patients developed infection. Patients overwhelmingly preferred early showering rather than late (P = 0.28-.99).

Conclusion

There is no difference in surgical site bacterial recolonization between early and delayed showering after primary TKA.

### Assessment of risk factors associated with surgical site infection following abdominal surgery: a systematic review [^b28a1be4]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

It is important to mention that many modifiable risk factors in abdominal surgery such as wound care, operating room environment, preoperative hair removal, and bowel preparation are common risk factors for SSI; we believe that the preoperative prevention interventions for these factors are carried out routinely in the surgical institutions.

Limitations and strengths

As we noted previously, generating pooled estimates across studies is challenging due to many variations in the included studies, we assessed the risk factors focusing on the achievement of statistical significance.

The strengths of this systematic review include the comprehensive nature of risk factor considerations and study eligibilities. However; the lack of sufficient data on some risk factors and the various definitions used were some limitations to this review. We recommend that future studies should aim to specifically and clearly define risk factors; this would improve the impact of the clinical research.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for preventing surgical site infection [^d5885818]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Table 2 — preventing surgical site infection (SSI) in colorectal surgery — states that implementing an SSI bundle can decrease the incidence of SSI (Recommendation strength Strong; GRADE quality Moderate). It adds that oral antibiotics in combination with mechanical bowel preparation have been shown to decrease the incidence of SSI after elective colorectal resection (Strong; Moderate) and that, if mechanical bowel preparation is contraindicated or omitted, preoperative oral antibiotic preparation alone can reduce the incidence of SSI (Conditional; Moderate). It reports that showering with chlorhexidine before colorectal surgery does not significantly impact SSI rates (Strong; Moderate). Smoking cessation before surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of SSI (Conditional; Moderate). On the day of colorectal surgery, patients should have their hair removed using a clipper or not removed at all, and shaving with a razor before surgery is discouraged (Strong; Moderate). Patients undergoing colorectal resection should have parenteral antibiotics administered within 60 min of incision, with dosing and redosing based on the pharmacokinetic profile of the antibiotic (Strong; Low). Patients who report a penicillin allergy may be evaluated and potentially delabeled to facilitate appropriate preoperative prophylactic beta-lactam use and improve outcomes (Conditional; Low). For most clean and clean-contaminated cases, prophylactic parenteral antibiotics should be limited to the initial 24h postoperatively (Strong; Moderate).

### Measures to prevent surgical site infections: what surgeons (should) do [^3301c331]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The present study was designed to evaluate surgeons' strategies and adherence to preventive measures against surgical site infections (SSIs).

Materials and Methods

All surgeons participating in a prospective Swiss multicentric surveillance program for SSIs received a questionnaire developed from the 2008 National (United Kingdom) Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines on prevention and treatment of SSIs. We focused on perioperative management and surgical technique in hernia surgery, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colon surgery (COL).

Results

Forty-five of 50 surgeons contacted (90%) responded. Smoking cessation and nutritional screening are regularly propagated by 1/3 and 1/2 of surgeons, respectively. Thirty-eight percent practice bowel preparation before COL. Preoperative hair removal is routinely (90%) performed in the operating room with electric clippers. About 50% administer antibiotic prophylaxis within 30 min before incision. Intra-abdominal drains are common after COL (43%). Two thirds of respondents apply nonocclusive wound dressings that are manipulated after hand disinfection (87%). Dressings are usually changed on postoperative day (POD) 2 (75%), and wounds remain undressed on POD 2–3 or 4–5 (36% each).

Conclusions

Surgeons' strategies to prevent SSIs still differ widely. The adherence to the current NICE guidelines is low for many procedures regardless of the available level of evidence. Further research should provide convincing data in order to justify standardization of perioperative management.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 195 — Level C recommendations for infection prevention emphasize management of remote infections, hair removal, vaginal preparation, and antibiotic timing and dosing: all infections remote to the surgical site should be identified and treated before an elective operation and such operations postponed until the infection has resolved; hair should not be removed preoperatively unless it will interfere with the operation, with any necessary hair removal immediately before the operation, preferably with electric clippers, and patients should be instructed not to shave the operative site themselves because shaving with a razor increases risk of infection; vaginal cleansing with either 4% chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone–iodine should be performed before hysterectomy or vaginal surgery; for most antibiotics, including cefazolin, prophylaxis should be administered within 1 hour before skin incision, and if quinolones or vancomycin are necessary, up to 2 hours is allowable; prophylactic antibiotic dosage should be increased in obese patients; for lengthy procedures, additional intraoperative doses at intervals of two times the half-life of the drug measured from the initiation of the preoperative dose, not from the onset of surgery, are recommended to maintain adequate levels, and in surgical cases with excessive blood loss, a second dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be appropriate.

Rationale The operating room and surrounding exchange areas must be sanitised as soon as possible after each procedure, with particular attention paid to all objects used in caring for patients. Similarly, all areas where SARS-COV-2 patients have transited must be carefully sanitised, too. All personnel must contribute to maintaining a clean environment, including washing floors and surfaces in general. All potentially infected single-use materials should be disposed of in IRHW containers. Reusable materials should be decontaminated, washed, dried and disinfected or sterilised, based on the likelihood of infection. Electromedical equipment (i.e. ventilator, radiological equipment) must be cleaned with a chloro-derivate solution, rinsed and dried, and then disinfected with a chloro-derivate solution in a concentration of ≥ 0.1% or 1000 ppm (parts per million) with contact time superior to 1 min, or as mandated by local guidelines. Full PPE must be worn during the sanitising procedure. Only disposable materials should be used for cleaning (i.e. double gloves, paper towels). Anything disposable kept inside the operating theatre during the procedure must be disposed of in IRHW containers, even if it was not used.

According to the American College of Surgeons, facility cleaning policies must be considered in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Cleaning (in all areas) needs to be addressed along the continuum of care (e.g. clinic, preoperative, ORs, workrooms, path-frozen, recovery rooms, wards, ICUs, ventilators, scopes, etc.).

ECDC-Europe recommends regular cleaning followed by disinfection, using hospital disinfectants active against viruses; cleaning in patient rooms is particularly important for frequently touched surfaces. If there is a shortage of hospital disinfectants, decontamination may be performed with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (dilution 1:50 if household bleach at an initial concentration of 5% is used) after cleaning with a neutral detergent, although no data are available on the effectiveness of this approach against SARS-CoV-2. Surfaces that may become damaged by sodium hypochlorite can be cleaned with a neutral detergent, followed by disinfecting with a 70% ethanol solution.

### Complications in hair-restoration surgery [^25a81053]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Most complications associated with hair restoration are completely preventable and arise from variables that are directly controlled by the surgeon and the patient. Physicians who thoroughly grasp the nuances of modern surgical techniques and fully understand the physiologic dynamics of the balding process are least likely to generate a physician-controlled error. Highly motivated, well-educated patients who carefully follow instructions and take an active role in the postoperative recovery process minimize the chance of patient-controlled errors. This article discusses potential complications associated with surgical hair restoration, and the roles of the patient and physician in minimizing the risk of complications.

### Focus on the prophylaxis, epidemiology and therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections and a position paper on associated risk factors: the perspective of an Italian group of surgeons [^d611a102]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis

The prevention of SSIs is an important issue in surgery. Besides general strategies aimed at reducing the rate of SSIs (hair removal, asepsis of the operating room, glucose control, blood transfusions, and smoking cessation) antibiotic prophylaxis plays a pivotal role in reducing SSIs.

The degree of bacterial contamination during surgery, together with the ASA score and duration of surgery, define the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis: surgical procedures are classified, as well-known, into clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty.

Dirty surgery should be treated as therapy of the infection involved (no prophylaxis).

Clean surgery usually does not need prophylaxis, unless comorbidities are present and/or prostheses are used.

The main indication for prophylaxis is, therefore, clean-contaminated or contaminated surgery. The purpose of antibiotic prophylaxis is only to avoid SSIs, not to prevent any other post-operative infectious complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).

The choice of antibiotic for prophylaxis should be directed towards the more probable pathogens for the particular type of surgery. Furthermore, antibiotics with a broad spectrum of action should not be used, because such these are the drugs of choice to treat an infection empirically.

Prophylaxis should be administered intravenously, half an hour before the start of surgery and should not be continued for more than 24 h.

Table 6 lists the recommended antibiotics for antimicrobial prophylaxis according to the type of surgery, and the alternative drugs in case of allergy to penicillin and/or cephalosporins. It is clear that the most frequently used antibiotic is cefazolin alone, combined with metronidazole when anti-anaerobe coverage is required and with vancomycin in selected cases of cardiovascular, orthopedic or neurosurgery when devices and/or prostheses are used.

Table 6
The recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis

According to the guidelines, if the surgical procedure lasts more than 3–4 h, there is an indication to administer another dose of prophylactic antibiotic, during surgery. In the case of renal impairment, this interval should be modified according to the creatinine clearance.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^05bc0533]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Stimulation of erythropoiesis

Recommendation 5: We suggest that ESA be used for anaemic patients in whom nutritional deficiencies have been ruled out, corrected, or both (Grade 2A).

The use of ESA therapy in patients undergoing major, elective surgery is well established on the basis of controlled, randomized trials and is approved for use in this setting. However, recent concerns regarding the RR/benefit of these agents and their appropriate use in patients with chronic renal disease, – in patients with anaemia related to cancer or chemotherapy, – and in patients undergoing elective surgeryhave resulted in a Grade 2 or 'suggested' recommendation.

The use of ESAs in patients with anaemia undergoing elective orthopaedic (hip, knee, and spine) surgery was reviewed under the auspices of NATA. A meta-analysis of 41 published studies [eight studies of ESA alone, – 22 studies of ESA augmented with preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD), – seven studies of ESA compared with PABD, – and four studies of ESA and other comparators] – was performed. Pooled estimates of transfusion exposure demonstrated clinically important benefit for both rHuEPO alone (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31–0.64) and rHuEPO augmented by PABD (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49–0.75). Although sufficient data were available for patients undergoing hip surgery, a large number of studies performed in patients undergoing a mixture of surgical procedures, and a failure to report indication-specific associations with the intervention, limit the ability to make judgement on the effectiveness of rHuEPO in patients undergoing non-hip procedures such as knee and spinal surgery. Taking account of all the studies, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was increased with the use of rHuEPO [Peto OR of 1.66 (95% CI 1.10–2.48)] but was inconclusive on the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents due to their low incidence.

Gender-affirming surgery — perioperative preparation, shared decision-making, and aftercare: Additional procedures and/or interventions such as hair removal (prior to facial and/or genital surgery) may be required as part of the preoperative process, and consultation with pelvic floor physical therapy may be important (or required) both before and after surgery. It is important surgeons understand the indication(s) and the timing for GAS, and it is important the surgeon and the patient participate in a shared decision-making approach that includes 1) a multidisciplinary approach; 2) an understanding of the patient's goals and expectations; 3) a discussion regarding the surgical options and associated risks and benefits; and 4) an informed plan for aftercare. Appropriate aftercare is essential for optimizing outcomes, it is important patients are informed about postoperative needs (including local wound care, activity restrictions, time off from work or school, etc.), and it is important the surgeon is available to provide and facilitate postoperative care, refer to specialty services, or both as needed, which may include ongoing support from the primary care provider and mental health professionals (MHPs) and routine primary care (i.e., breast/chest cancer screening, urologic/gynecologic care, etc.).

### Intraoperative surgical site infection control and prevention: a position paper and future addendum to WSES intra-abdominal infections guidelines [^c030a7cf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infections (SSI) are a common type of healthcare-associated infections and frequent complication of hospitalization, responsible for prolonged hospital stay, increased intensive care unit admissions, hospital readmissions after surgery, significantly increased costs (1300–5000 USD per SSI), and delays to adjuvant systemic therapy; they occur in 2 to 5% of patients undergoing surgery in the USA.

Approximately 160,000 to 300,000 SSI are diagnosed and treated every year and represent a considerable burden for healthcare systems in terms of re-operation, increased post-surgical pain, poor wound healing, prolonged hospital stay, cosmetic appearance, and decreased quality of life.

SSI has also been shown to be an independent risk factor in the development of incisional hernia.

The incidence of all types of SSI following abdominal surgery can reach 14% of all hospital-acquired infections and the most common form is the incisional superficial SSI, which is often the first to appear and is easy to diagnose.

While more data are available from Western healthcare settings, SSI was the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection in a systematic review of studies in low- and middle-income countries.

They also a result in deleterious softer endpoints such as patient psychosocial distress, loss of income, and decreased productivity.

Multiple interventions have been proposed and employed over the past decades in an attempt to prevent SSI. These include skin cleansing protocols, hair removal, the maintenance of intraoperative normothermia, the preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis administration, the use of plastic adhesive skin barriers, the high flow oxygen supplementation, the wound protection, the sterility of instruments, the bowel preparation, the length of the incision, and the delayed primary incision closure.

The development of SSI is multifactorial, and it may be related to patient's risk factors such as age, comorbidities, smoking habit, obesity, malnutrition, immunosuppression, malignancies, and the class of contamination of the wound.

### Hair loss and hair restoration in women [^84214cdc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Hair restoration in women involves mastering both the medical and the surgical treatment. Preoperatively, women should be thoroughly evaluated for biochemical causes of hair loss along with a complete history and physical examination taken. The physician must recognize the clinical presentation of scarring alopecias and maintain a low threshold for biopsy to rule out this condition. Postoperative hair shock loss is a common feature following hair transplant in women, and the surgeon should understand the preoperative counseling and preventative measures needed, the intraoperative methods to reduce the incidence, and the postoperative strategies to handle the situation.

Hair removal of surgical site

Complete removal of hair preoperatively is important as the hair may harbor bacteria which could result in postoperative infection. Although many institutes and operating room personnel prefer electric clippers for other surgical procedures, this is a less desirable option for the male genitalia due to the elastic skin of the scrotum. Grober et al. randomized 215 men undergoing surgery of their genitalia to shaving with a razor or clipping with electric razors. They found razors provided more complete removal of hair with less skin trauma. However, they were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in postoperative infection rate. This study may have been underpowered to detect differences in surgical site infection. Their results provide a rationale to support the use of razors. The Sexual Medicine Society of North America gives surgeons freedom to choose either method preoperatively in their guidelines.

### Use of feedback data to reduce surgical site infections and optimize antibiotic use in surgery: a systematic scoping review [^261047be]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention Characteristics Reported Across Studies (Supplementary File -1 Table A)

Among the included studies, the most commonly reported interventions were studies focusing on reducing SSI rates using surveillance methods (45%, 9/20), followed by audits on surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) (40%, 8/20). Prevention measures included hair removal techniques (15%, 3/20), normothermia (10%, 2/20), skin preparation (5%, 1/20), use of the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist (5%, 1/20), antithrombotic (5%, 1/20), and fluid and electrolyte management (5%) were also reported. Of all the studies included, most (75%, 15/20) but not all provided direct data on SSI rates. Out of those 15 studies, 73% (11/15) reported a significant reduction in SSI rates with the applied intervention based on statistical P -values and/or confidence intervals, 13% (2/15) reported no statistically significant change, and in 13% (2/15) of studies statistical significance could not be traced.

Of the 10 studies reporting on antibiotic usage in surgery, 9 mentioned SAP interventions, with most reporting data on compliance with SAP recommendations (77.9%, 7/9). In addition to SAP measures, the daily defined dose, antibiotic cost per procedure and the proportion of new colonization or calculation of the percentage of patients having methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection were also reported.

### Summary of best evidence for perioperative management practices in hair transplantation patients: facial skeleton [^408cab37]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To integrate and summarize the best evidence on perioperative management practices for hair transplantation patients, providing an evidence-based reference for clinical.

Methods

An exhaustive literature search was conducted to identify the best evidence for managing patients undergoing hair transplantation during the perioperative period. The databases searched included Up To Date, BMJ Best Practice, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, National Guideline Clearing House, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, Guidelines International Network, Cochrane Library, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, PubMed, Web of Science, European Dermatology Forum, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Medlive Guideline Network, and Sinomed. The search spanned publications from February 2013 to February 2024, focusing on clinical decisions, evidence summaries, guidelines, and expert consensus.

Results

We finally identified 22 articles with high-quality results (consisting of 9 clinical decisions, 6 guidelines, 7 expert consensuses), providing 41 pieces of evidence across seven categories: assessment of transplantation conditions, transplant planning and preoperative preparation, anesthetic preparations, surgical methods and operation skills, postoperative wound management, medication-related guidance, optimization of nursing and treatment strategies. Special emphasis has been placed on the sections covering anesthesia preparation, surgical methods, and operational techniques, with detailed explanations provided.

Conclusion

The summarized best evidence on perioperative management practices for hair transplantation patients can serve as evidence-based guidelines for clinical. It is recommended that clinical staff adopt evidence-based recommendations to improve and optimize patient outcomes and promote postoperative recovery. As these evidences came from different countries, factors such as the clinical environment should be evaluated before application.

### Improved surgical site infection (SSI) rate through accurately assessed surgical wounds [^c5d0a66b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Strategy

Our SSI taskforce made several recommendations as: Patients will be asked to take a shower with chlorhexidine prior to surgery; we will only use electric clippers to shave the hair and this will not happen in the operating room (as we did in our previous practice) but in the preoperative admission area; an alcohol based prep will be used in the operating room; and in the operating room, only nurses will be allowed to prep the surgery site.

In addition, the competency of skin prepping was reviewed for all the nurses.

A specific lactic antibiotic was chosen for each surgical division after discussion with microbiology pharmacy and the concerned surgeons. Furthermore, it was expressed to Anesthesia that they will have to give the antibiotics prior to induction and re-dose the antibiotics if necessary, and that the surgeons were made responsible for stopping the antibiotics less than 24 hours from surgery and continue temperature monitoring in recovery room for all patients.

We followed the best practice guidelines of the ACS NSQIP. In addition (because the risk adjustment for patients is done based on the perioperative risk factors) we felt that accurate wound classification is important in assessing our patients risk for SSI appropriately. In regards to wound classification, this meant that all default wound classifications were reviewed in the EMR Cerner. In addition, we started auditing the accuracy of wound classification assignment by the nursing staff. Furthermore, we added a mandatory pop-up window on the nursing documentation menu for the operating room nurses. This pop-up window asked the nurse, the comment and click affirmatively that the accuracy of the wound classification was discussed with the surgeon.

### A preoperative decolonization protocol for Staphylococcus aureus prevents orthopaedic infections [^4fd78c27]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an independent risk factor for orthopaedic surgical site infection (SSI). To determine whether a preoperative decolonization protocol reduces S. aureus SSIs, we conducted a prospective observational study of patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) at our institution, with two control groups. The concurrent control group comprised patients of surgeons who did not participate in the intervention study. The preintervention control group comprised patients of participating surgeons who had undergone elective TJA during the year before the study. Patients in the intervention group were screened preoperatively for S. aureus by nasal swab cultures. S. aureus carriers were decolonized with mupirocin ointment to the nares twice daily and chlorhexidine bath once daily for 5 days before surgery. All 164 of 636 participants (26%) who tested positive completed the decolonization protocol without adverse events and had no postoperative S. aureus SSIs at 1-year followup. In contrast, 1330 concurrent control patients had 12 S. aureus infections. If these infections had occurred in the 26% of patients expected to be nasal carriers of S. aureus at a given time, the infection rate would have been 3.5% (12 of 345) in the control group. In addition, the overall infection rate of the participating surgeons, including nonstaphylococcal infections, decreased from 2.6% during the preintervention period to 1.5% during the intervention period, translating to an adjusted economic gain of $231,741 for the hospital. The data suggest a preoperative decolonization protocol reduces S. aureus SSIs in patients undergoing TJA.

### Prevention of health care-associated infections [^26c73de6]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Health care-associated infections cause approximately 75,000 deaths annually, in addition to increasing morbidity and costs. Over the past decade, a downward trend in health care-associated infections has occurred nationwide. Basic prevention measures include administrative support, educating health care personnel, and hand hygiene and isolation precautions. Prevention of central line- or catheter-associated infections begins with avoidance of unnecessary insertion, adherence to aseptic technique when inserting, and device removal when no longer necessary. Specific recommendations for preventing central line-associated bloodstream infections include use of chlorhexidine for skin preparation, as a component of dressings, and for daily bathing of patients in intensive care units. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common device-related health care-associated infection. Maintaining a closed drainage system below the patient reduces the risk of infection. To prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is associated with high mortality, mechanically ventilated patients should be placed in the semirecumbent position and receive antiseptic oral care. Prevention of surgical site infections includes hair removal using clippers, glucose control, and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Reducing transmission of Clostridium difficile and multidrug-resistant organisms in the hospital setting begins with hand hygiene and contact precautions. Institutional efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing are also strongly recommended. Reducing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection can be achieved through active surveillance cultures and decolonization therapy with mupirocin.

### Adherence to international and national recommendations for the prevention of surgical site infections in Italy: results from an observational prospective study in elective surgery [^4e3561b1]. American Journal of Infection Control (2012). Low credibility.

Background

An observational prospective study of the perioperative procedures for prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) was carried out in a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Liguria, Italy, to evaluate their adherence to international and national standards.

Methods

A 1-month survey was performed in all surgical departments, monitored by turns by trained survey teams. Data regarding presurgical patient preparation and intraoperative infection control practices were collected.

Results

A total of 717 elective interventions were actively monitored in 703 patients who underwent surgery. Hair-shaving was performed mainly using a razor (92%) by the nurses (72.8%) on the day before the operation (83.5%). All of the patients showered, either with a common detergent (87%) or with an antiseptic solution (13%). Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered properly in 75.7% of the patients at induction of anaesthesia; however, according to current Italian guidelines, inappropriate prophylaxis was provided in 55.2% patients. Appropriate antisepsis of the incision area was done in 97.4% of the operations, and nearly 90% of the interventions lasted less than the respective 75th percentile. The doors of the operating theatres were mostly open during the duration of the operation in 36.3% of the cases.

Conclusions

This review of infection control policies identified significant opportunities for improving the safety and the quality of routine surgical practice.

### Multi-institution analysis of infection control practices identifies the subset associated with best surgical site infection performance: a Texas alliance for surgical quality collaborative project [^3c28a8d9]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

In an effort to reduce surgical site infection (SSI) rates, a large number of infection control practices (ICPs), including operating room attire policies, have been recommended. However, few have proven benefits and many are costly, time-consuming, and detrimental to provider morale. The goal of this multi-institution study was to determine which ICPs are associated with lower postoperative SSI rates. Twenty American College of Surgeons NSQIP and Texas Alliance for Surgical Quality-affiliated hospitals completed this Quality Improvement Assessment Board-approved study. Surgeon champions at each hospital ranked current surgery, anesthesia, and nursing adherence to 38 separate ICPs in 6 categories (attire, preoperative, intraoperative, preoperative, intraoperative, antibiotics, postoperative, and reporting) on 4-point scales for general surgery cases. These data were compared with the risk-adjusted general surgery SSI odds ratios contained in the July 2016 American College of Surgeons NSQIP hospital-level, risk-adjusted reports. Compliance rates were compared between the 7 best (median SSI odds ratio, 0.64; range, 0.56 to 0.70) and 7 worst (median SSI odds ratio, 1.16; range, 0.94 to 1.65) performers using ANOVA. Nearly all hospitals reported maximal adherence to hair removal with clippers (Surgical Care Improvement Project measure Inf-6) and to best-practice prophylactic antibiotic metrics (Surgical Care Improvement Project measure Inf-1-3). Variable adherence was identified across many ICPs and more frequent compliance with 8 ICPs correlated with lower SSI odds ratios, including preoperative shower; skin preparation technique; using clean instruments, gowns, and gloves for wound closure and dressing changes; and transparent internal reporting of SSI data. Operating room attire ICPs, including coverage of nonscrubbed provider head and arm hair, did not correlate with SSI rates. This analysis suggests that the subset of ICPs that focus on perioperative patient skin and wound hygiene and transparent display of SSI data, not operating room attire policies, correlated with SSI rates. Implementation of this subset of evidence-based ICPs may improve SSI rates at lower-performing hospitals.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary of surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee [^e00af689]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis of the knee — risk factors: smoking — Smoking cessation should be attempted before total knee arthroplasty, as a history of smoking may result in higher complications, lower functional scores, higher pain scores, and SSIs. Quality of evidence is Low and the strength of option is Consensus (downgraded), with the guideline work group stating that in the absence of reliable evidence they are making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. Patients who smoke have higher rates of complications after total knee arthroplasty, and smoking has been shown to increase complications such as SSIs which would increase use of resources such as antibiotics and the need for consulting services which may increase the cost. The risks associated with performing total knee arthroplasty on patients with heavy smoking history may include lower functional scores and higher SSIs. The recommendation comes with high acceptability, and since smoking may increase complications in patients after total knee arthroplasty, it is reasonable to achieve smoking cessation before surgery. Additional prospective studies are needed to evaluate functional outcomes and surgical complications long term, and further studies in smoking cessation preoperatively and its effects on outcomes should also be undertaken.

Perioperative Antisepsis Protocols

Many interventions for the prevention of perioperative infections with differing degrees of evidence have been implemented. Recommended interventions with the highest degree of evidence are: (1) administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis according to evidence-based standards and guidelines, (see Perioperative antibacterial reflow skin-preparatory agents if no contraindication exists over povidone iodine,(3) maintenance of normothermia during the perioperative period,(4) optimization of tissue oxygenation by administering supplemental oxygen during and immediately after surgical procedures involving mechanical ventilation, and (5) use of a checklist based on the World Health Organization recommendations to ensure compliance with best practices and thus improve surgical patient safety. Recommended interventions with a moderate degree of evidence are: (1) avoidance of hair removal or use of razors at the operative site unless the presence of hair will interfere with the operation, (2) control of blood glucose levels during the immediate postoperative period,(3) sterilization of all surgical equipment according to published guidelines,(4) surveillance for SSIs through the use of automated data with ongoing feedback to health care providers and leadership, and (5) implementation of policies and practices aimed at reducing the risk of SSIs that align with evidence-based standards (such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America). Recommended interventions with the lowest degree of evidence but that have also been found to be successful are: (1) educating both surgeons and perioperative personnel plus patients and their families about SSI prevention; (2) observing and reviewing personnel, practices, and the environment of care in the operating room, postanesthesia care unit, surgical intensive care unit, and surgical wards; (3) measuring and providing feedback to providers regarding rates of compliance with process measures; and (4) using an Environmental Protection Agency-approved hospital disinfectant to clean contaminated surfaces, following the American Institute of Architects' recommendations for proper air handling, and minimizing operating room traffic.

### Risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus colonization in a presurgical orthopedic population [^7f768286]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) increases risk of surgical site infection. Screening for SA followed by skin and nasal decolonization can help to reduce the risk of postoperative infections. Risk factors for colonization are, however, not completely understood.

Methods

A case-control study using questionnaires and patient demographics specifically designed to observe SA colonization risk factors in a presurgical orthopedic population. A total of 115 subjects with a positive preoperative screen for SA nasal colonization prior to orthopedic surgery completed a questionnaire to assess for SA risk factors: these subjects served as our cases. An additional 476 controls completed similar questionnaires. Data collected included demographic, health, and lifestyle information. Multivariable logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios (OR) for risk of SA colonization.

Results

Several risk factors were identified. Male sex (OR 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.4–3.8]) and diabetes (OR 3.8 [1.8–7.8]) significantly increased the risk of SA colonization. Older age, visiting public places (OR 0.2 [0.1–0.3]), recent antibiotic use (OR 0.2 [0.1–0.6]), and the presence of facial hair (OR 0.3 [0.1–0.6]) significantly lowered the risk of SA colonization.

Conclusions

By identifying patients who may be at greater risk of SA colonization, we can better streamline our presurgical techniques to help reduce risk of surgical site infections and improve patient outcomes.

### Preoperative hair removal on the male genitalia: clippers vs. razors [^17793ddc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In an effort to reduce the incidence of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs), many hospitals have adopted a strict practice of preoperative hair removal using clippers, as opposed to razors. However, the skin of the male genitalia is delicate, elastic with irregular skin folds and may be ill-suited for clippers.

Aim

To compare shave quality and the degree of skin trauma using two methods of preoperative hair removal on the scrotal skin: clippers vs. razors.

Methods

Patients undergoing surgery involving the male genitalia requiring preoperative hair removal were randomized to hair removal using clippers or a razor. Immediately following hair removal, a standardized digital photograph was taken of the male genitalia. All digital photos were evaluated in a blinded fashion by groups of urologic surgeons and surgical nurses using a standardized five-point global rating scale. The incidence of SSIs was monitored.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes included blinded global ratings of (i) the completeness of the preoperative hair removal within the surgical field and (ii) degree of skin trauma following hair removal. The incidence of SSIs within 3 months of surgery was monitored throughout the study period.

Results

Two hundred fifteen consecutive patients were randomized (107 clipper, 108 razor). Overall, preoperative hair removal on the male genitalia using a razor resulted in significantly less skin trauma (P = 2.5E-10) and a more complete hair removal within the surgical field (P = 0.017) compared with clippers. SSIs were identified in four patients during follow-up (1.8% — two using clippers; two, razors).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that preoperative hair removal on the scrotal skin using a razor results in less skin trauma and improved overall shave quality with no apparent increased risk of SSIs. Based on these findings, surgeons should be permitted their choice of razors or clippers for preoperative preparation of the male genitalia.

### Resuming elective hip and knee arthroplasty after the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the European Hip Society and European knee associates recommendations [^eded1d33]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The Dutch Medical Federation states in their guidelines that patients reporting no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 after a thorough history taking may be either without infection, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. An asymptomatic patient carries the SARS-CoV2 virus but never experiences noticeable symptoms. A pre-symptomatic patient experiences no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of evaluation but will go on to subsequently develop SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the future. When a patient reports no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 during preoperative screening, it is therefore impossible to make a clinically relevant distinction between the three categories of no SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. This means that patients who are initially asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic can subsequently develop moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, placing them at significant risk for adverse post-operative outcomes, that is, ICU admittance or increased mortality.

Concerning the chest CT, the Dutch Medical Federation's recent advice is outlined as follows. The committee's primary aim for the work-up for SARS-CoV-2 is to identify SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (high sensitivity) to limit transmission by rescheduling surgery, if possible, or allowing necessary precautions to be taken. Therefore, the committee initially advised that all adult patients requiring a surgical procedure under general anaesthesia undergo preoperative screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection through the use of SARS-CoV-2 PCR of a deep nasopharyngeal swab, in conjunction with a low-dose chest CT (without i.v. contrast). Preliminary data show 1–2% SARS-CoV-2 infection among preoperative patients reporting no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. This may seem a low percentage. However operative health care workers undergo repeated exposure during aerosol-generating swab. However, the added value of chest CT is low. Therefore, the committee is of the opinion that there is no longer an indication procedures and other risk-bearing procedures. The cumulative exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients for these health care workers through aerosolisation is therefore assumed to be high. In addition, transmission to other patients remains an unknown risk factor. The committee's opinion is that this percentage justifies preoperative testing through the use of SARS-CoV-2 PCR of a deep nasopharyngeal for the use of chest CT in preoperative testing of asymptomatic patients.

### AUGS-IUGA joint clinical consensus statement on enhanced recovery after urogynecologic surgery: developed by the joint writing group of the international urogynecological association and the American Urogynecologic Society. individual writing group members are noted in the acknowledgements section [^fb139b8d]. Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Urogynecologic surgery — surgical site infection (SSI) prophylaxis defines SSI and outlines prevention measures: SSI is defined as superficial when it occurs within 30 days and involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue and deep when it occurs within 30 days when no implant is left in place or within 1 year if an implant is in place and involves deep soft tissues; risk factors include obesity (BMI ≥ 30 or BMI Prime ≥ 1.2) and depth of subcutaneous tissue ≥ 3 cm. For skin and mucous membrane preparation, alcohol and aqueous-based solutions of chlorhexidine respectively, are first choices and povidone-iodine is considered if chlorhexidine is contraindicated. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces postoperative infection after hysterectomy from about 34% to 7–14%; a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is frequently used, with a recommended dose of 2 g intravenously within 1 h of skin incision, increased to 3 g for patients > 120 kg; in case of prolonged intervention or heavy bleeding (> 1500 mL), a second dose should be administered after two times the half-life of the chosen antibiotic, e.g., 4 h after the first dose for cefazolin; alternatives for severe beta-lactam allergy include clindamycin or metronidazole plus gentamicin or aztreonam. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision has been closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. No RCT has been conducted comparing use of vaginal mesh for prolapse surgery with or without antibiotics, and a national Norwegian registry study on midurethral slings concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced postoperative infections and pain, but not tape exposure. A Cochrane review showed no difference between preoperative skin washing with chlorhexidine solution versus usual soap or placebo but demonstrated efficacy of showering with some cleansing method versus no showering. Routine hair removal does not reduce SSI, and if hair should be removed to improve access to surgical site or to allow draping, it is preferable to use hair clippers instead of a razor, with depilating cream also an option that should be used by the patient the day before surgery.

### Infirmity and injury complexity are risk factors for surgical-site infection after operative fracture care [^f5cedf91]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Medical records were reviewed retrospectively by an investigator (AB) not involved in the patients' care. The following were recorded: gender, age, ASA score, presence of SSI, number of preoperative stay days, wound classification, injury site, side of injury, temporary use of external fixation before definitive surgery, polytrauma, associated injury, hair removal (yes/no and technique), the solution used to clean and prepare the skin, attending surgeon, use of a drain, use of wound packing, type of fixation, diabetic status, CHF, infection at another site preoperatively or postoperatively, and total number of operations at the same site during admission.

Patients were classified according to the ASA score as follows: (1) normal healthy patient, (2) patient with mild systemic disease, (3) patient with severe systemic disease (4) patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life, (5) moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation, (6) a patient declared brain-dead whose organs are being removed for donor purposes. One thousand three hundred-sixty-eight cases were classified by the anesthesia staff at the time of surgery, the remaining 415 were classified by an investigator (AB) using the operative report and discharge summaries as the scores were not readily available in the anesthesia database.

Does preoperative hair removal increase the risk of surgical site infection (SSIs)?

Statements

Recommendations

Specific studies in hernia surgery are not available, but studies in general surgery have demonstrated no difference in SSIs among patients who have had hair removed before surgery and those who have not [18]. Clipping results in fewer SSIs than razor shaving using a razor. Three trials involving 3,193 people compared shaving with clipping and found that there were statistically significantly more SSIs when hair is shaved rather than clipped (relative risk (RR), 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21–3.36) [18–20].

There is insufficient evidence regarding depilatory cream compared with razor shaving. Three trials involving 625 people compared hair removal using depilatory cream or razors with no hair removal and found no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of surgical site infections. Seven trials involving 1,420 people compared shaving with removing hair using a depilatory cream but found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in SSI rates [20].

There is no difference in SSIs when hair is shaved or clipped 1 day before surgery or on the day of surgery [21]. A significant drawback of these studies is that the evidence does not derive from studies in laparoscopic hernia repair.

Information before surgery

Statements

Recommendations

The informed consent of the patient is an important part of any surgical act. The patient must be provided with information not only on the details of the procedure or on the different operative methods but also be informed of the possibility of a negative outcome [22]. Correct information helps to prevent unfulfilled expectations. Unexpected bilaterality is reported in 10–25% [23–26]. Up to 28.6% of these patients will progress to a symptomatic hernia within 1 year [26].

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary of surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee [^0f82baf0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis of the knee — preop opioids feasibility and research needs are outlined: The feasibility of this recommendation varies, and it may be difficult for some surgeons to control opioid use preoperatively when they are not the primary prescribers or when patients have pain sources other than their knee. Future research should include collaborative studies with pain management providers and/or primary care physicians because there is consistent evidence to show poorer outcomes in patients on preop opioids compared to opioid naïve patients; however, there is the need for more higher quality level one studies, and ethical considerations include that such studies would require patients to be blinded and randomized to narcotic use preoperatively and carries the risk of long-term addiction.

### Surgical technical evidence review for elective total joint replacement conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^f294dbe7]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative VTE prophylaxis

Rationale

Chemical venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective total joint replacement. Questions remain however about whether VTE prophylaxis should be initiated preoperatively (focus of this section) and for how long prophylaxis should be continued postoperatively (focus of upcoming section titled extended duration VTE prophylaxis). Intraoperative stasis may contribute to the development of VTE; therefore, preoperative prophylaxis may reduce this risk, but potentially at the expense of increased bleeding.

Evidence

The literature search identified 235 articles, of which 7 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 2 SRs and 5 RCTs. A 2002 SR showed no difference in major bleeding and VTE rates comparing preoperative and postoperative low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) strategies in patients undergoing THA. Further, while they found that patients started on therapy perioperatively (ie, within 2–4 hours before or after surgery) did have slightly lower VTE rates (10.0% vs 15.3%), they also experienced much higher rates of major bleeding (3.5% vs 0.9%). Subsequent RCTs have randomized patients to preoperative versus postoperative regimens but using different agents, rendering direct comparisons difficult. Finally, a recent large registry study found no difference in bleeding, thromboembolic events, or complications when comparing preoperative and postoperative LMWH regimens.

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines for orthopedic VTE management do not favor preoperative or postoperative initiation but do recommend that therapy be started at least 12 hours before or after surgery as opposed to < 4 hours before or after surgery.

Summary and recommendations

While chemical VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective joint replacement, there is no convincing evidence favoring preoperative or postoperative initiation. There is evidence that immediate perioperative administration (within 2–4 hours before or after surgery) may increase bleeding disproportionately to the VTE risk reduction. Upcoming section titled extended duration will address extended duration of VTE prophylaxis.

### Results and lessons from a hospital-wide initiative incentivised by delivery system reform to improve infection prevention and sepsis care [^d11fb8d5]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Specific interventions to reduce CAUTI

A maintenance care bundle was developed and staff educated. Elements of bundle included urethral catheter medically indicated; catheter secured with StatLock device to reduce meatal irritation; positioned to promote drainage; and closed system maintained and a separate container used to empty urine bag. A nurse-driven discontinuation protocol was launched. Maintenance audits were implemented initially daily and progressed to a monthly frequency. The need to maintain a closed urine collection system was emphasised and opportunities for breaking the closed system were minimised. Patients' bath basins were made single-use items to prevent cross contamination. Chlorhexidine-based wipes were used for perineal and incontinence care.

Specific interventions to reduce SSI

We addressed SSI prevention by optimising perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis through implementation of standardised 'smart' order sets in our electronic medical record that allowed cascading of information. We implemented chlorhexidine bath the night before and the day of surgery for patients undergoing elective procedures. In year 3, we implemented interventions that included glucose control in patients with diabetes, smoking cessation prior to procedure and negative pressure wound therapy in select populations. A colorectal SSI reduction multidisciplinary workgroup was formed in year 4 which designed and implemented a reduction bundle that included hair removal in preoperative area, use of antimicrobial incision drape for all cases, and use of a separate closing set with change of gloves, gown and separate drape if visibly contaminated.

### Categories of evidence and methods in surgical decision-making [^e42c4a22]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical decision-making is a continuum of judgments that take place during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. The fundamental, and most challenging, step is determining whether a patient will benefit from an intervention given the dynamic interplay of diagnostic, temporal, environmental, patient-centric, and surgeon-centric factors. The myriad combinations of these considerations generate a wide spectrum of reasonable therapeutic approaches within the standards of care. Although surgeons may seek evidenced-based practices to support their decision-making, threats to the validity of evidence and appropriate application of evidence may influence implementation. Furthermore, a surgeon's conscious and unconscious biases may additionally determine individual practice.

### Neurosurgery and shaving: what's the evidence? [^c1093559]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Many neurosurgeons remove their patients' hair before surgery. They claim that this practice reduces the chance of postoperative surgical site infections, and facilitates planning, attachment of the drapes, and closure. However, most patients dread this procedure. The authors performed the first systematic review on shaving before neurosurgical procedures to investigate whether this commonly performed procedure is based on evidence. They systematically reviewed the literature on wound infections following different shaving strategies. Data on the type of surgery, surgeryrelated infections, preoperative shaving policy, decontamination protocols, and perioperative antibiotics protocols were collected. The search detected 165 articles, of which 21 studies-involving 11,071 patients-were suitable for inclusion. Two of these studies were randomized controlled trials. The authors reviewed 13 studies that reported on the role of preoperative hair removal in craniotomies, 14 on implantation surgery, 5 on bur hole procedures, and 3 on spine surgery. Nine studies described shaving policies in pediatric patients. None of these papers provided evidence that preoperative shaving decreases the occurrence of postoperative wound infections. The authors conclude that there is no evidence to support the routine performance of preoperative hair removal in neurosurgery. Therefore, properly designed studies are needed to provide evidence for preoperative shaving recommendations.

### Results and lessons from a hospital-wide initiative incentivised by delivery system reform to improve infection prevention and sepsis care [^2ec21620]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Intervention

The intervention team consisted of over a dozen multidisciplinary, interprofessional teams including nursing, medical and operational, informatics and other leaders, with facilitation and oversight provided by the system-wide infection prevention committee. The change was implemented in multiple small steps throughout the institution and several steps occurred in parallel. The overall change strategy was innovation and system redesign using a combination of horizontal approaches, that is, processes that are foundational to improving all outcomes of interest in this initiative, and vertical approaches, that is, processes that are specific to a single outcome of interest. Using such a combination of approaches using technical (a solution that is concrete and visible; eg, implementing a dressing change kit) and adaptive (a solution intended to enable critical thinking and problem-solving; eg, conducting interviews using open-ended questions) solutions to improve care is well supported in published literature. The theoretical framework of improvement was engaging stakeholders, standardising curriculum, training and workflows to reduce variation in care and 'raise the floor' per the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research, and continuous quality improvement using plan-do-study-act methodology and quality improvement tools such as process maps, run charts and defect analysis tools. Individual services were allowed latitude to implement evidence-based interventions specific to the patient population they served (eg, vascular surgery service implemented chlorhexidine-based preoperative skin preparation; colorectal service implemented a reduction bundle that included hair removal in the preoperative area, use of antimicrobial incision drape for all cases, and use of a separate closing set with change of gloves, gown and separate drape if visibly contaminated).

### Resuming elective hip and knee arthroplasty after the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the European Hip Society and European knee associates recommendations [^2d5d2ae1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement It is reasonable to assume that patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should not be operated on and should be discharged from the hospital. These patients should remain in quarantine at least 14 days and until a subsequent test turns out negative (two confirmed negative PCR swab tests with a 24 h interval) and they are free of fever, cough or other symptoms.

Rationale Obviously, if patients show a positive result for the PCR test, they should be isolated, the national SARS-CoV-2 public health protocols should be followed (including protocols for exposed staff) and the operation should be postponed. There is no exact advice at this point with regard to the length of the postponement. Noting that hip and knee arthroplasty is elective surgery and that the patient's safety should be optimised, then 3 weeks should be adequate, provided they do not become symptomatic.

The American College of Surgeons' advice is to have facility-specific SARS-CoV-2 testing policies which would then account for how a facility will respond to a SARS-CoV-2-positive worker, SARS-CoV-2-positive patient (identified preoperative or identified post-operative), a 'person under investigation' (PUI) worker or a PUI patient.

The CDC protocol is that if an asymptomatic patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, their operation should be rescheduled/cancelled until at least 10 days after their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, assuming they do not subsequently develop symptoms. If they have symptoms, their operation should be rescheduled or cancelled until it has been at least 3 days since the resolution of their fever without fever-reducing medications and 3 days since any respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, etc.) have improved and they either:
Test negative from at least two consecutive NP swab specimens collected > 24 h apart or
At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^5a358d01]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — feasibility and practice patterns — recognizes that while seemingly feasible, the treatment of major extremity trauma is frequently not an isolated entity and may not always be the most pressing issue in the setting of severe trauma. It is important that the healthcare professionals responsible for the musculoskeletal care of patients with major lower extremity trauma be aware of and advocates for the appropriate use of pre-operative skin preparation techniques, including nasal decolonization, pre-operative skin cleansing prior to surgery, and surgical skin preparation. Preoperative skin cleansing and surgical skin preparation are widely used and are well accepted, and nasal decolonization is not universally practiced but is acceptable to most clinicians.

### Surgical technical evidence review for elective total joint replacement conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^8b560fbd]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

A vast and growing body of literature exists to help guide clinicians as they implement ERPs in elective joint replacement. Institutions that have introduced ERPs have been able to improve patient outcomes including reduced complications and shorter LOS. – This ultimately translates to lower costs, — a factor especially relevant to orthopedic surgeons in the era of episode-based payments. This review includes 16 surgical components potentially relevant to developing a total joint ERP, supported through primary literature, clinical practice guidelines, and/or expert consensus. While the level of support varies in its strength from one bin to the next, there is clear evidence that a number of interventions can improve patient outcomes.

Many of the interventions outlined in this review should be a part of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion with patients before surgery. While the ultimate goal should be reducing adverse events and enhancing recovery, setting appropriate expectations for patients and their families is critical. Screening for anemia, DM, obesity, tobacco use, and opiate dependence can identify cohorts who may have increased risk of transfusion, postoperative infections, wound complications, reoperations, chronic opioid use, and possibly, higher mortality. The literature supporting and optimizing these criteria is, unfortunately, limited, but there is some evidence that correcting preoperative anemia, encouraging smoking cessation through education and nicotine replacement, and opiate weaning prior to surgery can mitigate risk. These assessments should be considered a part of comprehensive preoperative evaluation and included as a part of the ERP.

Key ERP components beyond the preoperative risk assessment include those related to SSI prevention, VTE reduction, and enhancing mobility. Preoperative bathing with soap and water should be routine, and protocols should be developed to screen/decolonize those individuals colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Routine use of drains should be discouraged. Mobilizing patients as soon as possible appears to decrease LOS and should be incorporated into an ERP in lieu of CPM. Chemical VTE prophylaxis should begin either 12 hours prior to or 12 hours following surgery and should be continued for 4 to 5 weeks postoperatively. Finally, it should be acknowledged that practices beyond those discussed here are also likely beneficial to perioperative care. Examples of these practices include guideline-based administration of prophylactic antibiotics (with discontinuation at the end of the procedure), intraoperative skin prep with an alcohol-based solution, and early discontinuation of Foley catheters.

### Building consensus: development of a best practice guideline (BPG) for surgical site infection (SSI) prevention in high-risk pediatric spine surgery [^a52999c2]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative surgical site infection (SSI) after pediatric spine fusion is a recognized complication with rates between 0.5% and 1.6% in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and up to 22% in "high risk" patients. Significant variation in the approach to infection prophylaxis has been well documented. The purpose of this initiative is to develop a consensus-based "Best Practice" Guideline (BPG), informed by both the available evidence in the literature and expert opinion, for high-risk pediatric patients undergoing spine fusion. For the purpose of this effort, high risk was defined as anything other than a primary fusion in a patient with idiopathic scoliosis without significant comorbidities. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to decrease the wide variability in SSI prevention strategies in this area, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs.

Methods

An expert panel composed of 20 pediatric spine surgeons and 3 infectious disease specialists from North America, selected for their extensive experience in the field of pediatric spine surgery, was developed. Using the Delphi process and iterative rounds using a nominal group technique, participants in this panel were as follows: (1) surveyed for current practices; (2) presented with a detailed systematic review of the relevant literature; (3) given the opportunity to voice opinion collectively; and (4) asked to vote regarding preferences privately. Round 1 was conducted using an electronic survey. Initial results were compiled and discussed face-to-face. Round 2 was conducted using the Audience Response System, allowing participants to vote for (strongly support or support) or against inclusion of each intervention. Agreement > 80% was considered consensus. Interventions without consensus were discussed and revised, if feasible. Repeat voting for consensus was performed.

Results

Consensus was reached to support 14 SSI prevention strategies and all participants agreed to implement the BPG in their practices. All agreed to participate in further studies assessing implementation and effectiveness of the BPG. The final consensus driven BPG for high-risk pediatric spine surgery patients includes: (1) patients should have a chlorhexidine skin wash the night before surgery; (2) patients should have preoperative urine cultures obtained; (3) patients should receive a preoperative Patient Education Sheet; (4) patients should have a preoperative nutritional assessment; (5) if removing hair, clipping is preferred to shaving; (6) patients should receive perioperative intravenous cefazolin; (7) patients should receive perioperative intravenous prophylaxis for gram-negative bacilli; (8) adherence to perioperative antimicrobial regimens should be monitored; (9) operating room access should be limited during scoliosis surgery (whenever practical); (10) UV lights need NOT be used in the operating room; (11) patients should have intraoperative wound irrigation; (12) vancomycin powder should be used in the bone graft and/or the surgical site; (13) impervious dressings are preferred postoperatively; (14) postoperative dressing changes should be minimized before discharge to the extent possible.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we present a consensus-based BPG consisting of 14 recommendations for the prevention of SSIs after spine surgery in high-risk pediatric patients. This can serve as a tool to reduce the variability in practice in this area and help guide research priorities in the future. Pending such data, it is the unsubstantiated opinion of the authors of the current paper that adherence to recommendations in the BPG will not only decrease variability in practice but also result in fewer SSI in high-risk children undergoing spinal fusion.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^dda30f64]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Pilonidal disease — nonoperative hair removal states that elimination of hair from the gluteal cleft and surrounding skin, by shaving or laser epilation, may be used for both acute and chronic pilonidal disease in the absence of abscess as a primary or adjunct treatment measure, with the stated Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Shaving or laser epilation can serve as an adjunct treatment in active disease, as the sole agent of therapy, or as a preventative tool in the setting of chronic disease to avoid recurrent flares and abscess formation. In acute pilonidal disease, limited lateral incision and drainage (I&D) or cyst excision combined with surgeon-performed shaving along the intergluteal fold and surrounding region promotes healing and prevents disease recurrence, and shaving should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until healing occurs and used in combination with hygiene enforcement.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^2cd6cd8f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Pilonidal disease — hair removal and laser epilation — shaving can be used around wound healing with timing and frequency qualified, and laser epilation shows low recurrence but lacks sufficient evidence for a general recommendation. Surgeon-performed hair shaving every 1 to 2 weeks until healing and subsequent patient-performed shaving after healing have been reported as beneficial, but patient-performed shaving in the immediate postoperative period has been associated with increased pilonidal recurrence; given uncertainty in optimal frequency, we suggest at least weekly. As an adjunct to surgical treatment, laser epilation has resulted in minimal (≤ 13%) recurrence, and as a primary treatment has achieved durable healing in 44% to 100% of patients, yet current evidence is insufficient to provide a general recommendation for this technique.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^9668adae]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — cost effectiveness/resource utilization and acceptability — notes that skin preparation with an antiseptic and preoperative bathing with soap are simple, inexpensive and widely available measures. Mupirocin is readily available and although it is a relatively expensive drug, application is easy. The cost of nasal decolonization, pre-operative skin cleansing prior to surgery, or surgical skin preparation is significantly less than what is required for treatment of surgical site or deep infection. Acceptability is described as highly acceptable with very few contraindications.
