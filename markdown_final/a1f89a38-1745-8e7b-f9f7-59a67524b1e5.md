## Question

What's the range of platelets for gestational thrombocytopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the platelet count range for gestational thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how gestational thrombocytopenia is defined and diagnosed. Then, I should verify the typical lower bound of platelet counts seen in gestational thrombocytopenia. Next, I will check whether there is a recognized lower limit below which gestational thrombocytopenia is no longer considered likely. After that, I should review the upper bound and how it relates to the general definition of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful range and note any exceptions or caveats that might modify interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Gestational thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, accounting for roughly 75–80% of cases, and is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by mild, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia that typically resolves postpartum, with no history of thrombocytopenia outside pregnancy and no bleeding tendency [^f91b8dd7] [^27ba4228].

> Now, I should verify the typical lower bound. Most cases of gestational thrombocytopenia have platelet counts above 75 × 10^9/L, although some cases have been described as low as 43 × 10^9/L; importantly, counts below about 50 × 10^9/L are uncommon and should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis and evaluation for alternative etiologies such as immune thrombocytopenia or hypertensive disorders [^f91b8dd7] [^db1105fa].

> Wait, let me verify the practical clinical threshold used to separate gestational thrombocytopenia from immune thrombocytopenia. In asymptomatic pregnant patients with no bleeding history, platelet counts between 100 and 149 × 10^9/L are usually due to gestational thrombocytopenia, whereas counts less than 100 × 10^9/L are more suggestive of ITP, and counts less than 50 × 10^9/L are almost certainly due to ITP or another pathologic process rather than gestational thrombocytopenia [^db1105fa] [^9d17f49d].

> I need to check the upper bound carefully. By definition, gestational thrombocytopenia is a platelet count less than 150 × 10^9/L, so the upper limit of the range is 149 × 10^9/L; counts at or above 150 × 10^9/L are not considered thrombocytopenic and therefore do not meet criteria for gestational thrombocytopenia [^35cbbd1b] [^75538241].

> Hold on, I should synthesize this into a clinically usable statement. The platelet count range for gestational thrombocytopenia is approximately 43–149 × 10^9/L, with the vast majority of cases falling between about 75 and 149 × 10^9/L; counts below 100 × 10^9/L are atypical for gestational thrombocytopenia and warrant evaluation for alternative diagnoses, and counts below 50 × 10^9/L are incompatible with gestational thrombocytopenia and should be managed as pathologic thrombocytopenia rather than physiologic gestational changes [^f91b8dd7] [^db1105fa] [^35cbbd1b].

> But wait, what if the patient presents earlier in pregnancy or has a rapid decline in platelets? I should double-check that timing and trajectory matter. Gestational thrombocytopenia typically presents in the late second or third trimester and is usually mild and stable; early-onset thrombocytopenia or a rapidly falling platelet count should raise suspicion for ITP or hypertensive disorders rather than gestational thrombocytopenia, reinforcing the need to correlate with clinical context and exclude other causes before labeling a case as gestational thrombocytopenia [^4db06113] [^1ac85f0c].

---

Gestational thrombocytopenia is defined by a **platelet count of 100–149 × 10⁹/L** [^9d17f49d] in asymptomatic pregnant women with no bleeding history, typically arising in the late second or third trimester and resolving postpartum [^f91b8dd7]. Counts below 100 × 10⁹/L are uncommon and should prompt evaluation for other causes, such as ITP or hypertensive disorders [^db1105fa] [^de35d844]. The condition is benign, requires no intervention, and does not increase maternal or fetal bleeding risk [^fdafd89e].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Gestational thrombocytopenia is a **benign, self-limited condition** characterized by mild thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, typically resolving after delivery [^f91b8dd7]. The following criteria are commonly used to diagnose GT:

- **Platelet count**: 100–149 × 10⁹/L (100,000–149,000/µL) [^9d17f49d].
- **Timing**: Usually occurs in the late second or third trimester [^4db06113].
- **Resolution**: Platelet counts return to normal within 1–2 months postpartum [^f91b8dd7].
- **Exclusion**: No history of thrombocytopenia outside pregnancy, no bleeding symptoms, and no identifiable secondary causes (e.g. ITP, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, viral infections, drug-induced thrombocytopenia) [^f91b8dd7].

---

## Platelet count range in gestational thrombocytopenia

The platelet count range in gestational thrombocytopenia is **typically 100–149 × 10⁹/L** (100,000–149,000/µL) [^9d17f49d]. Although some cases have been reported with counts as low as 43 × 10⁹/L, these are rare and considered atypical [^f91b8dd7]. Counts below 100 × 10⁹/L are uncommon and should prompt further evaluation for alternative etiologies, such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^db1105fa] [^de35d844].

---

## Physiological mechanisms underlying gestational thrombocytopenia

Several physiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the **mild thrombocytopenia** observed in gestational thrombocytopenia:

- **Hemodilution**: Plasma volume expansion during pregnancy leads to relative dilution of platelets [^92b14317].
- **Increased platelet activation and consumption**: Enhanced platelet activation and consumption, particularly in the third trimester, contribute to lower platelet counts [^dc2ef35e].
- **Genetic factors**: Recent studies have identified genetic variants, particularly in the PEAR1 gene, associated with increased susceptibility to gestational thrombocytopenia [^9ea68b26] [^e227e692].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Gestational thrombocytopenia is considered a benign condition with **no significant maternal or fetal complications**. It does not increase the risk of maternal bleeding, fetal thrombocytopenia, or neonatal hemorrhage [^f91b8dd7]. Therefore, no specific intervention or treatment is required. Management typically involves:

- **Monitoring**: Regular platelet counts during pregnancy to ensure stability and resolution postpartum [^fdafd89e].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Thorough evaluation to rule out other etiologies of thrombocytopenia, such as ITP, preeclampsia, or HELLP syndrome [^1ac85f0c].
- **Postpartum follow-up**: Platelet counts should be rechecked 1–3 months postpartum to confirm resolution [^fdafd89e].

---

## Differentiation from other causes of thrombocytopenia

It is essential to differentiate gestational thrombocytopenia from other causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, including:

| **Condition** | **Platelet count** | **Clinical features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Gestational thrombocytopenia | 100–149 × 10⁹/L | - Asymptomatic <br/> - No bleeding history <br/> - Resolves postpartum | Observation and monitoring [^fdafd89e] |
| Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) | < 100 × 10⁹/L | - History of thrombocytopenia <br/> - May present with bleeding | - Corticosteroids <br/> - IVIG <br/> - Close monitoring [^45ae985f] |
| Preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome | < 100 × 10⁹/L | - Hypertension <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Elevated liver enzymes | Delivery and supportive care [^3ff72a0a] |
| Drug-induced thrombocytopenia | Variable | Recent exposure to offending drug | Discontinuation of drug [^notfound] |

---

Gestational thrombocytopenia is characterized by a **platelet count of 100–149 × 10⁹/L** and is a benign, self-limited condition requiring no intervention. It is essential to differentiate GT from other causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy to ensure appropriate management and avoid unnecessary interventions [^c9e5cc7b].

### Thrombocytopenia in small-for-gestational-age infants [^3cfaced3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia is common among small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates (birth weight < 10th percentile reference range), but several aspects of this thrombocytopenia are unclear, including the incidence, typical nadir, duration, association with preeclampsia, mechanism, and risk of death.

Methods

Using 9 years of multihospital records, we studied SGA neonates with ≥ 2 platelet counts < 150,000/μL in their first week.

Results

We found first-week thrombocytopenia in 31% (905 of 2891) of SGA neonates versus 10% of non-SGA matched controls (P < .0001). Of the 905, 102 had a recognized cause of thrombocytopenia (disseminated intravascular coagulation, early-onset sepsis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). This group had a 65% mortality rate. The remaining 803 did not have an obvious cause for their thrombocytopenia, and we called this "thrombocytopenia of SGA". They had a mortality rate of 2% (P < .0001) and a mean nadir count on day 4 of 93,000/μL (SD 51,580/μL, 10th percentile 50,000/μL, 90th percentile 175,000/μL). By day 14, platelet counts were ≥ 150,000/μL in more than half of the patients. Severely SGA neonates (< 1st percentile) had lower counts and longer thrombocytopenia duration (P < .001). High nucleated red cell counts at birth correlated with low platelets (P < .0001). Platelet transfusions were given to 23%, and counts typically more than tripled. Thrombocytopenia was more associated with SGA status than with the diagnosis of maternal preeclampsia.

Conclusions

SGA neonates with clearly recognized varieties of thrombocytopenia have a high mortality rate. In contrast, thrombocytopenia of SGA is a hyporegenerative condition of moderate severity and 2 weeks' duration and is associated with evidence of intrauterine hypoxia and a low mortality rate.

### Platelet counts in women with normal pregnancies: a systematic review [^1bff3128]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

The occurrence of thrombocytopenia in 5% of pregnant women at delivery, described as gestational thrombocytopenia, is well documented. A commonly believed concept is that gestational thrombocytopenia is the result of gradually decreasing platelet counts in all women during pregnancy. The goal of our study was to evaluate the data supporting this concept. To learn what is known about platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies, we systematically reviewed all publications describing platelet counts during pregnancy. We identified 3,039 studies; 46 reporting ≥ 30 women with normal pregnancies were included in our analyses. The combined mean platelet counts from all studies supported the concept that platelet counts decrease during pregnancy and increase postpartum: first trimester, 251,000/µL (95% CI, 238,000–264,000/µL); second trimester, 238,000/µL (95% CI, 222,000–253,000/µL); third trimester, 224,000/µL (95% CI, 213,000–235,000/µL); delivery, 237,000/µL (95% CI, 209,000–264,000/µL); 4–8 weeks postpartum, 247,000/µL (95% CI, 207,000–287,000/µL). However, individual studies were inconsistent. Eleven longitudinal studies compared platelet counts on the same women at different times during gestation: seven reported a decrease; four reported no change. Ten cross-sectional studies compared platelet counts of different women at different times during gestation: five reported a decrease; five reported no change. Five studies compared platelet counts of pregnant to nonpregnant women: three reported that platelet counts were lower in pregnant women; one reported no difference; one reported that platelet counts were higher in pregnant women. These inconsistent data emphasize the need to accurately describe platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies. Accurate data are essential for evaluating the clinical importance of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy.

### Diagnosis and management of maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^27ba4228]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 7–10% of pregnancies. It may be a diagnostic and management problem, and has many causes, some of which are specific to pregnancy. Although most cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are mild, and have no adverse outcome for either mother or baby, occasionally a low platelet count may be part of a more complex disorder with significant morbidity and may be life-threatening. Overall, about 75% of cases are due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 15–20% secondary to hypertensive disorders; 3–4% due to an immune process, and the remaining 1–2% made up of rare constitutional thrombocytopenias, infections and malignancies. In this review, a diagnostic approach to investigating thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is presented, together with antenatal, anaesthetic and peri-natal management issues for mother and baby, followed by a detailed discussion on the specific causes of thrombocytopenia and the management options in each case.

### Gestational thrombocytopenia: a case-control study of over 3, 500 pregnancies [^92fedd01]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gestational thrombocytopenia (GT) affects an estimated nine million women annually. Women with GT have recurrent episodes on subsequent pregnancies suggesting that GT is related to a maternal factor rather than a factor unique to the individual pregnancy. We performed a case-control study of over 3 500 pregnancies at a single hospital during 2017. We defined GT as any pregnancy with a platelet count < 150 000/µl during the 100 days prior to delivery. We excluded women with platelet counts < 50 000/µl or with conditions known to cause thrombocytopenia. GT was present in 12% of pregnancies. The median platelet count at delivery was 134 500/µl in cases versus 208 000/µl in controls, P < 0·0001. During the pregnancy, the platelet count declined 31·8% in cases compared with 18·3% in controls (P < 0·0001) in association with a significant increase in mean platelet volume during each trimester. Among women with GT, platelet counts rapidly increased during the first week postpartum, consistent with a mechanism directly related to high blood flow rates in the gravid uterus. GT, a recurrent condition of at-risk women, is a common haematological disorder of pregnancy. Future research may focus on genetic gain-of-function polymorphisms resulting in increased turnover of platelets uncovered only during periods of high-shear blood flow.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^75538241]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Definition of thrombocytopenia — reference ranges in pregnancy and nonpregnancy: The normal platelet count in nonpregnant individuals is 165–415 × 10^9/L, and in pregnant women thrombocytopenia has traditionally been defined as a platelet count less than 150 × 10^9/L. During pregnancy, laboratory ranges vary by trimester with a gradual decrease as pregnancy progresses, and women in the third trimester have significantly lower mean platelet levels than nonpregnant women. The definition is described as somewhat arbitrary and not necessarily clinically relevant; in two prospective observational trials of more than 11,000 pregnant women, mean platelet count in the last month of pregnancy at or delivery ranged from 213 × 10^9/L to 228 × 10^9/L, with lower normal limits varying from 116 × 10^9/L to 123 × 10^9/L.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^f91b8dd7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 207 — gestational thrombocytopenia is the most common etiology of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy and accounts for 80% of cases. It affects 5–11% of pregnant women. Onset can occur at any point in pregnancy, with most cases having a platelet count more than 75 × 10^9/L, although some cases have been described with platelet counts as low as 43 × 10^9/L. Women are asymptomatic with no history of bleeding and have no history of thrombocytopenia outside of pregnancy, and platelet counts usually return to normal within 1–2 months after giving birth. A retrospective cohort found the risk of gestational thrombocytopenia was 14.2 times as high among women with previous gestational thrombocytopenia. The incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia has been reported to range from 0.1% to 2.3%. Thus, women with gestational thrombocytopenia are not at risk of maternal or fetal hemorrhage or bleeding complications. There are no specific laboratory tests to confirm gestational thrombocytopenia, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^db1105fa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 207 — platelet count thresholds for gestational thrombocytopenia versus ITP: In asymptomatic pregnant women with no history of bleeding problems, maternal thrombocytopenia between 100 × 10^9/L and 149 × 10^9/L is usually due to gestational thrombocytopenia, whereas a platelet count less than 100 × 10^9/L is more suggestive of ITP and a platelet count less than 50 × 10^9/L is almost certainly due to ITP. Gestational thrombocytopenia typically manifests later in pregnancy, and in the third trimester or postpartum the sudden onset of significant maternal thrombocytopenia should lead to consideration of preeclampsia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, acute fatty liver, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^20d1ca58]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is most frequently a benign process that does not require intervention. However, 35% of cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are related to disease processes that may have serious bleeding consequences at delivery or for which thrombocytopenia may be an indicator of a more severe systemic disorder requiring emergent maternal and fetal care. Thus, all pregnant women with platelet counts less than 100,000/μL require careful hematological and obstetric consultation to exclude more serious disorders.

### Platelet counts during pregnancy [^de35d844]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Platelet counts of less than 150,000 per cubic millimeter during uncomplicated pregnancies are described as gestational thrombocytopenia if no alternative cause is identified. Platelet counts may be even lower in women with pregnancy-related complications. However, the occurrence and severity of thrombocytopenia throughout pregnancy are not defined.

Methods

We evaluated platelet counts throughout pregnancy in women who delivered at Oklahoma University Medical Center between 2011 and 2014. These platelet counts were compared with those of nonpregnant women who were included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 through 2012.

Results

Among the 15,723 deliveries that occurred during the study period, 7351 women had sufficient data for our analyses. Of these women, 4568 had uncomplicated pregnancies, 2586 had pregnancy-related complications, and 197 had preexisting disorders associated with thrombocytopenia. Among the women who had uncomplicated pregnancies, the mean platelet count in the first trimester (mean gestation, 8.7 weeks) was 251,000 per cubic millimeter, which was lower than the mean platelet count in the 8885 nonpregnant women (273,000 per cubic millimeter) (P < 0.001). At the time of delivery, 9.9% of the women with uncomplicated pregnancies had a platelet count below 150,000 per cubic millimeter. During the course of the uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries, only 45 women (1.0%) had a platelet count below 100,000 per cubic millimeter. Among the 12 women with uncomplicated pregnancies who had a platelet count below 80,000 per cubic millimeter, only 5 (0.1%, among whom the range of platelet counts was 62,000 to 78,000 per cubic millimeter; median, 65,000) were identified by medical record review as having no alternative cause for the thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts of less than 150,000 per cubic millimeter at the time of delivery were more common among women who had pregnancy-related complications than among women who had uncomplicated pregnancies (11.9% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.01). Throughout their pregnancies and deliveries, 59 women (2.3%) with pregnancy-related complications had a platelet count below 100,000 per cubic millimeter, and 31 (1.2%) had a platelet count below 80,000 per cubic millimeter.

Conclusions

Mean platelet counts decreased during pregnancy in all the women, beginning in the first trimester. In women who have a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter, a cause other than pregnancy or its complications should be considered.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^fc8905de]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematologists are often consulted for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially when there is a concern for a non-pregnancy-specific etiology or an insufficient platelet count for the hemostatic challenges of delivery. The severity of thrombocytopenia and trimester of onset can help guide the differential diagnosis. Hematologists need to be aware of the typical signs of preeclampsia with severe features and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to help distinguish these conditions, which typically resolve with delivery, from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or complement-mediated TMA). Patients with chronic thrombocytopenic conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, should receive counseling on the safety and efficacy of various medications during pregnancy. The management of pregnant patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are refractory to first-line treatments is an area that warrants further research. This review uses a case-based approach to discuss recent updates in diagnosing and managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^fdafd89e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Gestational thrombocytopenia — obstetric management and follow-up: Pregnancies with gestational thrombocytopenia are generally not at increased risk of maternal bleeding complications or fetal thrombocytopenia, so interventions such as cesarean delivery and the determination of the fetal platelet count are not indicated, and women do not generally require any additional testing or specialized care, except follow-up platelet counts. No evidence is available to guide frequency of platelet counts and, therefore, the schedule of follow-up laboratory tests should be based on clinical reasoning; if diagnosed antepartum, expert opinion suggests that a platelet count be checked at each routine prenatal visit, and after childbirth, the platelet count should be repeated in 1–3 months to determine if resolution of the thrombocytopenia has occurred.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^9d17f49d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that maternal thrombocytopenia 100–149×10⁹/L in asymptomatic pregnant females with no history of bleeding problems is usually due to gestational thrombocytopenia.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^c9e5cc7b]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy, encountered in ∼10% of pregnancies. There are many possible causes, ranging from benign conditions that do not require intervention to life-threatening disorders necessitating urgent recognition and treatment. Although thrombocytopenia may be an inherited condition or predate pregnancy, most commonly it is a new diagnosis. Identifying the responsible mechanism and predicting its course is made challenging by the tremendous overlap of clinical features and laboratory data between normal pregnancy and the many potential causes of thrombocytopenia. Multidisciplinary collaboration between hematology, obstetrics, and anesthesia and shared decision-making with the involved patient is encouraged to enhance diagnostic clarity and develop an optimized treatment regimen, with careful consideration of management of labor and delivery and the potential fetal impact of maternal thrombocytopenia and any proposed therapeutic intervention. In this review, we outline a diagnostic approach to pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia, highlighting the subtle differences in presentation, physical examination, clinical course, and laboratory abnormalities that can be applied to focus the differential. Four clinical scenarios are presented to highlight the pathophysiology and treatment of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy: gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, and immune thrombocytopenia.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy: is this immune thrombocytopenia or..? [^0599cc79]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy. Establishing the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in a pregnant patient is similar to doing so in a nonpregnant patient, except that the evaluation must specifically rule out other disorders of pregnancy associated with low platelet counts that present different risks to the mother and fetus and may require alternate distinct therapy. Many of the same treatment modalities are used to manage the pregnant patient with ITP, but others have not been determined to be safe for the fetus, are limited to a particular gestational period, or side effects may be more problematic during pregnancy. The therapeutic objective differs from that in chronic ITP in the adult because many pregnant patients recover or improve spontaneously after delivery and therefore maintenance of a safe platelet count, rather than prolonged remission, is the goal. Thrombocytopenia may the limit choices of anesthesia, but does not guide mode of delivery, and the fetus is rarely severely affected at birth. Patients should be advised that a history of ITP or ITP in a previous pregnancy is not a contraindication to future pregnancies and that, with proper management and monitoring, positive outcomes can be expected in the majority of patients.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^323beef5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia develops in 5% to 10% of women during pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period. A low platelet count is often an incidental feature, but it might also provide a biomarker of a coexisting systemic or gestational disorder and a potential reason for a maternal intervention or treatment that might pose harm to the fetus. This chapter reflects our approach to these issues with an emphasis on advances made over the past 5 to 10 years in understanding and managing the more common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Recent trends in the management of immune thrombocytopenia translate into more women contemplating pregnancy while on treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists, rituximab, or mycophenylate, which pose known or unknown risks to the fetus. New criteria to diagnose preeclampsia, judicious reliance on measurement of ADAMTS13 to make management decisions in suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, new evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of anticomplement therapy for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome during pregnancy, and implications of thrombotic microangiopathies for subsequent pregnancies are evolving rapidly. The goals of the chapter are to help the hematology consultant work through the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy based on trimester of presentation, severity of thrombocytopenia, and coincident clinical and laboratory manifestations, and to provide guidance for dealing with some of the more common and difficult diagnostic and management decisions.

### Platelet reference ranges for neonates, defined using data from over 47, 000 patients in a multihospital healthcare system [^f515b63b]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Identifying a platelet count as abnormal (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) can facilitate recognizing various disease states. However, the published reference ranges for platelet counts in neonates may be imprecise, as they were generated from relatively small sample sizes and compiled before modern platelet enumeration methods.

Study Design

We derived new neonatal reference ranges for platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) measurements using electronic data accumulated during a recent 6-year period from a multihospital healthcare system.

Result

Platelet counts were obtained between the first and the 90th day after birth, from 47,291 neonates delivered at 22 to 42 weeks gestation. The first platelet counts obtained in the first 3 days of life, increased over the range of 22 to 42 weeks gestation. In those born ≤ 32 weeks gestation, the lower reference range (5th percentile) was 104,200 microl(-1), but it was 123,100 microl(-1) in late-preterm and -term neonates. Advancing postnatal age had a significant effect on platelet counts; during the first 9 weeks, the counts fit a sinusoidal pattern with two peaks; one at 2 to 3 weeks and a second at 6 to 7 weeks. The upper limit of expected counts (95th percentile) during these peaks were as high as 750,000 microl(-1).

Conclusion

The figures herein describe reference ranges for platelet counts and MPV determinations of neonates at various gestational ages during their first 90 days. Expected values differ substantially from the 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1) range previously used to define neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis. The new definitions will render the diagnoses of neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis less commonly than when the old definitions were used, because the new ranges are wider than 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1).

### Patterns of thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia in hospitalized neonates [^332066a9]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to identify changes in platelet (PLT) counts over time, and to evaluate the patterns of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis in hospitalized infants 23.8 weeks to term gestation.

Study Design

Neonates were divided into four gestational age groups and their PLT counts were retrospectively compared for prevalence of thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, and associated conditions.

Results

Postconceptional age, postnatal age, and sepsis (among other factors) affected PLT counts. When counts from noninfected appropriately grown infants were evaluated, the risk of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were highest in the most preterm infants, and these risks changed with corrected gestational age. PLT counts increased weekly over the first 4 weeks of life for all but the most preterm infants.

Conclusions

These data characterize the incidence of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis across a wide range of gestational ages and show that, even in noninfected neonates, these conditions are common, and risk decreases with increasing maturity. The age-related changes in PLT patterns may reflect maturation of platelet regulation.

### Updated International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^1ce45d94]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to considerations for delivery, ICR 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that a platelet count of 20–30×10⁹/L in a non-bleeding patient is safe for most pregnancies. Attempt ensuring a platelet count ≥ 50×10⁹/L for delivery.

Platelet counts change during pregnancy in GT case and control

A total of 100 186 pregnant women with at least 1 platelet count record during pregnancy and the postpartum period were included in our analysis. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria detailed in "Methods", we identified 10 908 pregnancies as GT cases and 82 523 individuals as controls. Among the GT cases, 870 were classified as severe GT cases and the remaining 10 038 individuals as mild GT. Information on prenatal screening indicators and maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with GT is provided in supplemental Notes.

As illustrated in Figure 2 and supplemental Table 1, the platelet counts of all pregnancies displayed a gradual decline throughout gestation, reaching their lowest point at the time of delivery, and subsequently showing signs of recovery during the postpartum period. These trends align with the changes in mean platelet counts during pregnancy from prior large-scale studies involving European population(N = 15 723) and a case-control study on GT(N = 3500). After adjusting for maternal age, gestation day, and hospital, the mean platelet counts of mild GT cases and severe GT cases were 75 × 10 9 /L and 110 × 10 9 /L lower than those of controls, respectively (P < 2 × 10–16; supplemental Table 2). On average, platelet counts of pregnant women decline by 11 × 10 9 /L in each trimester (P < 2 × 10 − 16). The platelet count declined by 27.1% in mild GT cases and 37.5% in severe GT cases from the first trimester to delivery, compared with a 16.4% decline in controls. The mean decline rate of platelet count in mild and severe GT cases was 3.55 and 3.77 times higher than that of controls (supplemental Table 3). Both the declining percentage and the mean decline rate of platelet count from the first trimester to the time of delivery increased with the severity of GT (P = 0.022; and P = 0.015). The mean platelet counts of severe and mild GT cases dropped by 7.13 × 10 9 /L and 4.51 × 10 9 /L per trimester more than controls (both P < 2 × 10 −16; supplemental Table 4). The same pattern was observed when we restricted the analysis to 14 712 participants with platelet counts measured at all 5 periods and when we analyzed and visualized the individual changes in platelet counts (supplemental Notes).

### Genetic basis of pregnancy-associated decreased platelet counts and gestational thrombocytopenia [^92b14317]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets contribute to various physiological processes, including bleeding and thrombosis. Platelets also play an important role in pregnancy by activating chemokine receptorand releasing platelet-derived factors such as epidermal growth factorin the first trimester, promoting trophoblast infiltration of maternal spiral arteries for sufficient placental perfusion. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a progressive decline in platelet count from the first trimester to delivery during pregnancy. However, the biological mechanism underlying this phenomenon remain elusive, although hypotheses such as increased blood volume causing platelet dilution and platelet accumulation in the spleen and placental intervillous, have been proposed.

Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count < 150 × 10 9 /L, 6 is a common hematological disorder during pregnancy, affecting 5% to 12% of all pregnancies. The most common cause of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy is gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), accounting for 75% to 76% of the cases. GT affects > 9 million worldwide annually. Despite its high prevalence, the pathogenesis of GT remains unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including plasma volume expansion leading to dilution, inadequate thrombopoietin response, platelet autoantibody formation, changes in von Willebrand factor expression and survival, alterations in ADAMTS13 activity, and enhanced platelet adhesion under high-shear blood flow.

Notably, platelet count is highly heritable, with an estimated heritability of 0.45 to 0.54 across diverse ethnicities. Furthermore, the risk of recurrent GT in subsequent pregnancies is 14.2 times higher than that of normal pregnancies, highlighting a potential genetic component in platelet count variations during pregnancy and GT development. However, because of financial and logistical challenges of human genetic study, no prior studies have explored the genetic basis of platelet count during pregnancy and GT.

In this study, we leveraged advanced methods previously developed for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using sequencing data from noninvasive prenatal tests (NIPTs). We integrated NIPT data and time-dependent platelet count measurements in 5 periods of pregnancy and conducted, to the best of our knowledge, the first and the hitherto largest-scale GWAS on platelet count and GT during pregnancy, among 100 186 Chinese pregnant women from 2 hospitals at Shenzhen, China. We focus on identifying genes (1) associated with platelet count during pregnancy, (2) contributing to altering platelet counts, and (3) involved in GT development during pregnancy.

### Genetic basis of pregnancy-associated decreased platelet counts and gestational thrombocytopenia [^9ea68b26]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Platelet count reduction occurs throughout pregnancy, with 5% to 12% of pregnant women being diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), characterized by a more marked decrease in platelet count during pregnancy. However, the underlying biological mechanism behind these phenomena remains unclear. Here, we used sequencing data from noninvasive prenatal testing of 100186 Chinese pregnant individuals and conducted, to our knowledge, the hitherto largest-scale genome-wide association studies on platelet counts during 5 periods of pregnancy (the first, second, and third trimesters, delivery, and the postpartum period) as well as 2 GT statuses (GT platelet count < 150 × 109/L and severe GT platelet count < 100 × 109/L). Our analysis revealed 138 genome-wide significant loci, explaining 10.4% to 12.1% of the observed variation. Interestingly, we identified previously unknown changes in genetic effects on platelet counts during pregnancy for variants present in PEAR1 and CBL, with PEAR1 variants specifically associated with a faster decline in platelet counts. Furthermore, we found that variants present in PEAR1 and TUBB1 increased susceptibility to GT and severe GT. Our study provides insight into the genetic basis of platelet counts and GT in pregnancy, highlighting the critical role of PEAR1 in decreasing platelet counts during pregnancy and the occurrence of GT. Those with pregnancies carrying specific variants associated with declining platelet counts may experience a more pronounced decrease, thereby elevating the risk of GT. These findings lay the groundwork for further investigation into the biological mechanisms and causal implications of GT.

### Haemostatic monitoring during postpartum haemorrhage and implications for management [^09cecdda]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Platelet count in PPH

The clinical significance of gestational thrombocytopenia and whether decreases in platelet number are counterbalanced by increased platelet reactivityare not fully understood. One study has suggested low platelet count to be an independent risk factor for PPH. A retrospective analysis of 797 pregnancies found that a platelet count < 100×10 9 litre −1 on admission to the labour ward was associated with increased PPH incidence in some women. A large retrospective analysis also demonstrated an inverse association between lowest platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement. Subsequent prospective studies showed that at diagnosis of haemorrhage, platelet counts in PPH patients were significantly lower than those in healthy parturients, and that decreasing platelet count during obstetric bleeding may be associated with progression to severe PPH.

These findings suggest that platelet transfusion or desmopressin may be valid haemostatic therapies for PPH. However, they raise concerns about recommended transfusion triggers. Data suggest that platelet count should be maintained ≥ 100×10 9 litre −1 during ongoing PPH, but a prospective analysis of 30 patients with coagulopathy after abruptio placentae had platelet counts ∼90×10 9 litre −1 at 0 and 4 h postpartum. However, current PPH guidelines recommend platelet transfusion only when the platelet count decreases below 50×10 9 litre −1, although in other massive haemorrhage guidelines, a trigger of 75×10 9 litre −1 is recommended. Studies are required to confirm the validity of current approaches.

### Thrombocytopenia [^90c7cfb2]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10(3) per µL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10(3) per µL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 × 10(3) per µL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 × 10(3) per µL may cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 × 10(3) per µL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency. Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy, preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia worsens despite initial treatment.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy — therapy initiation and delivery-related platelet targets: Treatment should be initiated when the patient has symptomatic bleeding, when platelet counts fall below 30 × 10^9/L, or to increase platelet counts to a level considered safe for procedures, and at the time of delivery management is based on maternal bleeding risks with minimum platelet counts of 70 × 10^9/L for epidural placement and 50 × 10^9/L for cesarean delivery. Because the platelet function of these patients usually is normal, it is not necessary to maintain their counts in the normal range, and no evidence for a specific platelet threshold at which pregnant patients with ITP should be treated is available. The goal of medical therapy during pregnancy in women with ITP is to minimize the risk of bleeding complications that can occur with regional anesthesia and delivery associated with thrombocytopenia.

### The prevalence of thrombocytopenia among pregnant women in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dc2ef35e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematological changes, including significant changes in blood volume, take place throughout pregnancy to meet the needs of the growing fetus and placenta. The direct effects of progesterone and estrogen on the kidney, which result in the release of renin and the activation of the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system, cause an average rise in plasma volume of 40 to 45%. As a result, there is an increase in body water overall and renal sodium retention. However, due to hemodilution, increased platelet activation, and consumption, especially in the third trimester, the platelet count drops during pregnancy. According to studies, pregnant women are four times more likely than non-pregnant women to have low platelet count.

Thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a decreased platelet count. Between 6 and 15% of pregnancies are affected by it, which is the second most common cause of hematological abnormalities during pregnancy next to anemia. Human platelet counts typically range from 150,000 to 450,000/ mm 3. Platelet counts below 150,000 cells/mcL are considered to be indicative of thrombocytopenia, which can be mild (100,000–150,000/ mm 3), moderate (50,000–100,000/ mm 3), or severe (less than 50,000/mm 3).

Most low platelet counts during pregnancy are brought on by gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), or preeclampsia. Other causes include illnesses such as leukemia and aplastic anemia as well as infections such as malaria or a folate deficiency.

Pregnant women with thrombocytopenia are more likely to experience excessive bleeding during or after delivery, especially if they require a cesarean section or other type of medical procedure during pregnancy or labor. When the platelet count is less than 50,000/mm 3, such bleeding issues are more prone to occur.

Pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia has led to needless, frequently invasive extra tests and cesarean deliveries. The diagnosis and care for this ailment can be costly, upsetting for the patient, and have unfavorable effects. Pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia is poorly recognized and treated. Although it has been discussed in numerous types of research, it is crucial to conduct a more thorough analysis, such as a meta-analysis, to clarify the pooled prevalence and variability between various samples due to the variety of the numbers discovered in different studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of thrombocytopenia among pregnant women in Ethiopia.

### Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies at term [^5aa48e3d]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate platelet counts at delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

Platelet counts in women 16 to 45 years of age from August 1, 2011, through May 15, 2018, with a singleton pregnancy that delivered from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation. Women with pregnancy-related complications, preexisting disorders, or on medications that could affect platelet counts were excluded.

Results

A total of 18,526 women had uncomplicated pregnancies with mean platelet count from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation of 220×10 9 /L. The lower limit 95th percentile (2.5% quantile) was 120×10 9 /L. Platelet counts decreased weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation, becoming significant at 39 weeks of gestation and beyond, compared with 37 weeks (p < 0.01). Mean platelet counts: 225×10 9 /L at 37 weeks, 223×10 9 /L at 38 weeks, 219×10 9 /L at 39 weeks, 218×10 9 /L at 40 weeks, and 216×10 9 /L at 41 weeks of gestation. Platelet counts of less than 150×10 9 /L occurred in 9.7%.

Conclusion

Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies decrease weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. This will be important to consider when serial platelet values are monitored for other indications.

Preeclampsia or HELLP-associated thrombocytopenia — delivery timing, transfusion thresholds, and postpartum course: The primary treatment of maternal thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100 × 10^9/L) associated with severe features of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome is delivery, and delivery is recommended when gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed at or beyond 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, after maternal stabilization or with labor or rupture of membranes; delivery should not be delayed for the administration of corticosteroids in the late preterm period and the mode of delivery should be determined by routine obstetric considerations. Platelet transfusions are best reserved for patients with thrombocytopenia with active bleeding, with an exception for cesarean delivery in which consensus guidelines recommend platelet transfusion to increase the maternal platelet count to more than 50 × 10^9/L before major surgery; transfusions may be needed if platelet count is less than 50 × 10^9/L or with suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation. After birth, platelet counts often decrease for 24–48 hours followed by rapid recovery, and most patients will achieve a platelet count greater than 100 × 10^9/L within 2–6 days; although corticosteroids or uterine curettage may improve thrombocytopenia, no differences have been noted in maternal mortality or morbidity with these treatments.

### Pre-and postpregnancy platelet counts: evaluating accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenia purpura diagnoses [^f256a793]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the overlapping clinical indicators and lack of diagnostic testing, misdiagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and gestational thrombocytopenia in pregnancy may be common. Current recommendations suggest utilizing platelet nadir during pregnancy to guide diagnosis.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses using pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura from January 2017 to December 2019. Platelet counts were extracted from charts and evaluated at several time periods, namely prepregnancy (within 5 years), during pregnancy, and postpartum (> 6 weeks to 5 years). A diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia was considered inaccurate if platelet counts were < 150,000/µL pre- or postpregnancy with no other apparent causes or if the platelet nadir dropped below 100,000/µL during pregnancy. A diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura was deemed inaccurate if pre- or postpregnancy platelet counts were > 150,000/µL. The primary outcome was accuracy of gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses in patients. Secondary outcomes included mean platelet counts during pregnancy and difference in mean platelet counts for patients with an accurate vs inaccurate diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia. Outcomes were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared using Student t tests.

Results

A total of 116 patients met the inclusion criteria of which 111 (96%) and 5 (4%) had gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura diagnoses, respectively. Platelet counts outside of pregnancy were available for 91 (82%) of the patients, and 66 (57%) had prepregnancy platelet counts available. Of the 91 patients, the diagnosis was considered accurate in 61 (67%) and 5 (100%) patients with gestational thrombocytopenia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura, respectively. Conversely, 30 of 35 (86%) patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura were found to be inaccurately diagnosed with gestational thrombocytopenia after application of platelet thresholds. Among these 30 patients, 10 had a prepregnancy platelet count < 150,000/µL, 12 had a postpartum platelet count < 150,000/µL, 3 had a platelet count nadir < 100,000/µL during pregnancy, and 7 met more than 1 criterion. Pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts and platelet count nadir differed significantly for patients with an accurate vs inaccurate diagnosis of gestational thrombocytopenia (P < .001).

Conclusion

When pre- and postpregnancy platelet counts were checked, one-third of cases of gestational thrombocytopenia met the criteria for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and were thus incorrectly diagnosed during pregnancy. Prepregnancy platelet counts, available for most patients, should be considered when diagnosing gestational thrombocytopenia vs immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Linking maternal platelet counts with neonatal platelet counts and outcomes using the data repositories of a multihospital health care system [^597288ce]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether neonates born to women with thrombocytopenia during pregnancy are themselves at increased risk for thrombocytopenia at birth. In the current retrospective study, platelet count reference ranges were developed for pregnant women according to trimester, and correlations were sought between the platelet counts of mothers at delivery and their neonates. During the study period, 92,518 platelet counts were recorded on 41,887 pregnant women. A progressive shift toward lower platelet counts in a similarly shaped histogram occurred during pregnancy, with the lower reference range (2.5 percentile) for platelets during the third trimester being 113 × 10(9)/L. Among 11,797 maternal-neonatal pairs following delivery, no correlation was observed between maternal and neonatal counts. However, if the mother's lowest count was < 50 × 10(9)/L, the relative risk of any degree of thrombocytopenia in their neonate was 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 33.3) and the relative risk of severe neonatal thrombocytopenia was 7.8 (95% CI, 1.8 to 33.3). The results of the current study demonstrate that platelet counts > 75 × 10(9)/L in pregnant women were not associated with an increased risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia, and maternal platelet counts of < 50 × 10(9)/L were accompanied by an almost fivefold risk increase of neonatal thrombocytopenia.

Thrombocytopenia occurs commonly during pregnancy, and may result from diverse etiologies. Awareness of these many causes facilitates proper diagnosis and management of thrombocytopenia in the pregnant setting. Some causes of thrombocytopenia are unique to pregnancy and may not be familiar to hematologists. In the review, we will discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, and the pathogenesis of selected thrombocytopenic disorders. Considerations for optimal management of the pregnant patient with thrombocytopenia will also be described.

General evaluation components include comparison of platelet counts before and during pregnancy and a thorough evaluation of bleeding history and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and knowing that 25%–46% of healthy patients without a bleeding diathesis will have at least 1 symptom normally associated with a bleeding diathesis supports determining whether further workup is needed before admission for delivery.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^19fdecd3]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

A mild thrombocytopenia is relatively frequent during pregnancy and has generally no consequences for either the mother or the fetus. Although representing no threat in the majority of patients, thrombocytopenia may result from a range of pathologic conditions requiring closer monitoring and possible therapy. Two clinical scenarios are particularly relevant for their prevalence and the issues relating to their management. The first is the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia and the differential diagnosis between primary immune thrombocytopenia and gestational thrombocytopenia. The second is thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia and its look-alikes and their distinction from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In this review, we describe a systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these disease entities using a case presentation format. Our discussion includes the antenatal and perinatal management of both the mother and fetus.

### Assessment of post-partum haemorrhage risk among women with moderate thrombocytopenia [^012fcb9e]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Post‐partum haemorrhage (PPH) is still the leading cause of maternal mortality, both in developing and advanced countries. Worldwide, it is estimated that > 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPHand the incidence is increasing.PPH is traditionally defined as a loss of blood from the genital tract of ≥ 500 mL in the case of vaginal birth and ≥ 1000 mL in caesarean deliveries.

Maternal, fetal and childbirth‐related factors have been internationally recognised as risk factors for the development of PPH. Uterine atony accounts for the majority of PPH cases (70%–75%). Other acknowledged risk factors include a previous history of PPH, fetal macrosomia (> 4000 g at birth), an increased maternal body mass index, an advanced maternal age (> 35 years), nulliparity or grand multiparity (> four pregnancies), genital tract injuries, placenta accrete spectrum (PAS) disorders, labour induction, caesarean delivery and maternal coagulopathy.,

Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet (PLT) count of < 150 × 10 9 /l, occurs in ~12% of all pregnancies and can either be physiological or being a sign of an underlying pathological condition. Gestational thrombocytopenia is a benign condition that accounts for ~75% of thrombocytopenia cases and resolves with delivery. In the remaining 25% of cases, thrombocytopenia could be an indicator of a disease arising during pregnancy. In only ~1% of all pregnancies PLT counts at delivery are < 100 × 10 9 /l, being between 100 and 50 × 10 9 /l most of the time, but the consequences of this moderate thrombocytopenia on the maternal bleeding risk are unknown.

Thrombocytopenia is a known risk factor for post‐procedural bleeding in any type of surgery. In clinical practice, different PLT count thresholds have been recognised for distinct types of surgical procedures. When considering pregnancy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), experts consensus suggests a PLT count of ≥ 50 × 10 9 /l for delivery and ≥ 80 × 10 9 /l for neuraxial anaesthesia as safe thresholds. However, to date it is not known which PLT count exposes pregnant healthy women without a history of thrombocytopenia to an increased risk of PPH. A recent study has investigated the risk of developing PPH in previously unknown thrombocytopenic patients but considering only patients delivering via caesarean section or vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC).

Methods

Study population

The study population encompassed 70 739 pregnancies from Longgang District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital of Shenzhen City (referred to as Longgang) and 50 948 pregnancies from Shenzhen Baoan Women's and Children's Hospital (referred to as Baoan). All participants received NIPT and provided written informed consent. After excluding women potentially involving multiple gestations and without available platelet count measurements, our study included 100 186 pregnant women who had at least 1 platelet count assessment during pregnancy (Figure 1). Detailed information on the study population can be found in the supplemental Methods, available on the Blood website.

Figure 1.
Flowchart summarizing the study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants. HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HELLP syndrome, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; ITP, primary immune thrombocytopenia; MPV, mean platelet volume; PLT_delivery, platelet counts at delivery; PLT_postpartum, platelet counts during the postpartum period; T1_PLT, platelet counts during the first trimester; T2_PLT, platelet counts during the second trimester; T3_PLT, platelet counts during the third trimester.

Phenotype definition

Platelet counts were determined using complete blood count tests conducted during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

GT was defined as having at least 1 platelet count < 150 × 10 9 /L in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. In routine clinical practice in China, 100 × 10 9 /L is the typical cutoff value for clinical attention. In supplemental Figure 1, we confirm that 100 × 10 9 /L represents the 99th percentile for platelet counts among pregnant women during the third trimester in our study population. Therefore, we further categorized pregnant women with at least 1 platelet count < 100 × 10 9 /L during pregnancy as severe GT cases. Pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; primary immune thrombocytopenia; HIV infection; hepatitis B virus infection; and hepatitis C virus infection or with ≥ 1 incidences of platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /L during pregnancy were excluded. This resulted in a final cohort of 11 138 GT cases and 85 294 controls as well as 906 severe GT cases and 97 283 controls.

See supplemental Methods for details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of GT.

GWAS of platelet count during pregnancy, at delivery, and during the postpartum period

We conducted 3 separate GWASs on platelet count during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy for 72 816 Chinese pregnant women from the 2 distinct hospitals. Additionally, we performed GWASs of platelet counts at delivery and during the postpartum period, involving 33 553 and 34 457 Chinese pregnancies (Figure 1).

Although the genomic inflation factor (λ GC) surpassed 1 (supplemental Figure 2), the LD scoreregression intercepts closely approached 1, indicating a polygenic genetic architecture rather than statistical inflation due to population stratification(supplemental Table 5). The SNP heritability of platelet count during the 3 pregnancy periods was 32.3% to 33.3%, consistent with previously reported values in Europeans (30.2%)and Hispanic/Latino Americans (29.4%). High genetic correlations, ranging from 0.883 to 0.996, were observed between platelet counts during any 2 periods, indicating a consistent genetic influence throughout pregnancy (supplemental Table 6).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^cbe719db]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Preeclampsia-associated thrombocytopenia — maternal detection and neonatal risk: Platelet count may decrease before other signs of preeclampsia, and when an incidental platelet count less than 150 x 10^9/L is discovered, close clinical observation may be warranted. A cross-sectional study reported an increased risk (1.8%) of neonatal thrombocytopenia in hypertensive disorders, but these infants were delivered "before term" and 60% were small-for-gestational age. Prematurity and fetal growth restriction are associated with an increased likelihood of neonatal thrombocytopenia independent of maternal platelet count, and large observational studies at term did not note any cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia in women with preeclampsia associated with maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 207 — preeclampsia and hypertension in pregnancy contribute substantially to thrombocytopenia; hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is the etiology in 5–21% of cases of maternal thrombocytopenia. During pregnancy, in the presence of new-onset hypertension, a platelet count less than 100 × 10^9/L is a hematological diagnostic criterion for preeclampsia. Clinical hemorrhage is uncommon unless the patient develops disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and in some cases microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and elevated liver function tests are associated with thrombocytopenia in pregnant women with preeclampsia.

### Platelet count and indices as postpartum hemorrhage risk factors: a retrospective cohort study [^f4a30db1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The World Health Organization defines PPH as > 500 mL of blood loss and severe PPH (SPPH) as > 1000 ml. In the Netherlands, 4%–6% of pregnancies are complicated by SPPH, and this percentage has increased in high income countries over the past decade.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of < 150 × 10 9 /L. In nonpregnant populations, thrombocytopenia is a well‐known risk factor for bleeding, particularly in the lower ranges of the platelet count (< 10–50 × 10 9 /L). It is the second most common hematologic anomaly in pregnant women, occurring in 7%–12% of pregnancies. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy can have multiple causes. Approximately 75% is due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 20% to preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, and 3%–5% to other causes. Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, and HELLP syndrome severity, are established risk factors for PPH.

One half of the pregnancies showed at least a 30% decrease in platelet counts from the first trimester to delivery with the median platelet count at delivery ranging from 85 x 10^9/L to 110 x 10^9/L. Women with severe ITP, defined as a platelet count of less than 50 x 10^9/L at any point in the pregnancy or when a clinical decision was made to treat before delivery, had a 21% incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (1,000 mL or more).

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy — fetal platelet count determination notes that no evidence is available to support the routine use of intrapartum fetal platelet counts. Scalp sampling is fraught with inaccuracies and technical difficulties, and cordocentesis carries a risk of fetal loss per procedure of 0.6%–1.3% depending on indication, gestational age, and placental penetration. Given the low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and lack of demonstrated difference in neonatal outcome between vaginal and cesarean deliveries, the determination of fetal platelet count is generally unwarranted for ITP.

### Genetic basis of pregnancy-associated decreased platelet counts and gestational thrombocytopenia [^ef35b9e5]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations in our studies. First, platelet counts of patients with GT usually return to normal within 1 to 2 months after delivery. Because we do not have access to platelet counts before pregnancy and there are missing platelet counts during the postpartum period for many pregnancies, we are unable to diagnose GT exactly as the guideline suggested. However, it should be noted that the guideline itself may not be entirely accurate, because there was a limited biological understanding of GT before this study. In addition, the median measurements of longitudinal platelet count during pregnancy are 5 to 6 in the 2 hospitals. The limited number of longitudinal repeated measurements throughout pregnancy reduces the ability of TrajGWAS to identify more variants associated with within-subject variability. In this study, we report the 2 most prominent genetic associations. However, we cannot conclude that we have found all the influential genetic factors of altered platelet count, GT, and severe GT in our study. Despite being, to the best of our knowledge, the largest GWAS on platelet count and GT during pregnancy, our study did not account for the entire phenotypic variation. We have made full GWAS summary statistics and PRS models publicly available for future research. Because GT lacks specific laboratory tests for diagnosis, our predictive models built with PRS may assist in preconception risk assessment of GT.

Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation into the genetic basis of platelet counts in pregnant women and GT, revealing a robust and strong association between platelet count and the PEAR1 locus at 1q23.1. The time-dependent genetic effects of PEAR1 and other associated loci provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of GT, paving the way for further investigations into the biological mechanisms underlying this condition and the establishment of causal relationships using methodologies such as Mendelian randomization.

Between 8% and 15% of neonates will be treated for thrombocytopenia, and severe hemorrhagic complications are rare (less than 1%). In affected newborns, the platelet count usually decreases after delivery with the nadir occurring within the first 2 weeks of life.

Discussion

To explore the genetic basis of platelet count during pregnancy and GT, a long-known but illy characterized clinical condition, we conducted a large-scale GWASs on platelet counts during 5 periods of pregnancy among 100 186 pregnancies from 2 hospital cohorts and identified 138 independent genomic loci with significant associations. The high consistency of genetic effect between the 2 independent cohorts implies high fidelity of the genetic discoveries. Comparing our findings with the GWAS of platelet count in the general population (BBJ), we observed that 89.7% of the lead SNPs demonstrated consistent genetic effects, and 48.3% were colocalized with BBJ loci, suggesting both shared and distinct genetic basis of platelet count between pregnant women and the general population. The discrepancies can be attributed to differences in age, sex, ancestry, LD structure, and physiological status between the 2 cohorts.

### Neonatal thrombocytopenia: causes and management [^a2356222]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Neonatal thrombocytopenia is a common clinical problem. Thrombocytopenia presenting in the first 72 hours of life is usually secondary to placental insufficiency and caused by reduced platelet production; fortunately most episodes are mild or moderate and resolve spontaneously. Thrombocytopenia presenting after 72 hours of age is usually secondary to sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis and is usually more severe and prolonged. Platelet transfusion remains the only treatment. There is a need for trials to define the safe lower limit for platelet count and which neonates will benefit from treatment.

### Randomized trial of platelet-transfusion thresholds in neonates [^01dd52a0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Platelet transfusions are commonly used to prevent bleeding in preterm infants with thrombocytopenia. Data are lacking to provide guidance regarding thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusions in preterm neonates with severe thrombocytopenia.

Methods

In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation in whom severe thrombocytopenia developed to receive a platelet transfusion at platelet-count thresholds of 50,000 per cubic millimeter (high-threshold group) or 25,000 per cubic millimeter (low-threshold group). Bleeding was documented prospectively with the use of a validated bleeding-assessment tool. The primary outcome was death or new major bleeding within 28 days after randomization.

Results

A total of 660 infants (median birth weight, 740 g; and median gestational age, 26.6 weeks) underwent randomization. In the high-threshold group, 90% of the infants (296 of 328 infants) received at least one platelet transfusion, as compared with 53% (177 of 331 infants) in the low-threshold group. A new major bleeding episode or death occurred in 26% of the infants (85 of 324) in the high-threshold group and in 19% (61 of 329) in the low-threshold group (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 2.32; P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to rates of serious adverse events (25% in the high-threshold group and 22% in the low-threshold group; odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.67).

Conclusions

Among preterm infants with severe thrombocytopenia, those randomly assigned to receive platelet transfusions at a platelet-count threshold of 50,000 per cubic millimeter had a significantly higher rate of death or major bleeding within 28 days after randomization than those who received platelet transfusions at a platelet-count threshold of 25,000 per cubic millimeter.

### Predictors of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnant women presenting with thrombocytopenia [^a40a8e23]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and gestational thrombocytopenia (GT) are common causes of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. Despite an ever-increasing experience with these disorders, differentiation between the two entities still remains a diagnostic challenge. The current study attempted to identify the antenatal predictors of ITP for pregnant women.

Methods

Between January 1999 and June 2005, a total of 58 pregnant women with a presumptive diagnosis of either ITP or GT were recruited for the study. All of them had platelet counts of less than 100 x 10(9)/L. The predictors of ITP were evaluated by comparison between the two disorders.

Results

The detection of thrombocytopenia prior to 28 weeks of gestation and platelet counts < 50 x 10(9)/L at its diagnosis remained independently predictive of ITP (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). The combined analysis of these two factors provided a 96.0% sensitivity and a specificity of 75.8%.

Conclusion

The onset time of thrombocytopenia and platelet count at its presentation remain the strongest predictors of ITP for pregnant women. The combination model using these factors may be useful for the early prediction of ITP.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^574a56b7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Fetal–neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia — management and delivery guidance states that early cordocentesis (20–24 weeks of gestation) was determined unnecessary, and a noninvasive approach involving weekly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), with or without corticosteroids, is equally effective compared with intrauterine platelet transfusions in preventing fetal and neonatal bleeding. Consensus guidelines propose early empiric initiation of therapy (IVIG with later addition of oral prednisone) and recommend reserving fetal blood sampling until 32 weeks of gestation in women planning for a vaginal delivery. For delivery, labor and vaginal delivery are not contraindicated when fetal platelet counts are greater than 50 × 10^9/L, whereas a cesarean delivery is recommended below this level, and delivery should be accomplished in a setting equipped to care adequately for a neonate with severe thrombocytopenia.

### Predictors for neonatal thrombocytopenia in infants of thrombocytopenic mothers during pregnancy [^add2de43]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although maternal thrombocytopenia during pregnancy is common, its effect on neonatal platelets has not yet been fully evaluated.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the rate of thrombocytopenia among 767 healthy term neonates (gestational age 37–42 weeks) born to 723 mothers with pregnancy-induced thrombocytopenia to define risk factors predicting thrombocytopenia in this group.

Results

Thrombocytopenia was diagnosed in 2.2% of the infants. Multivariate analysis showed that infants with thrombocytopenia were more likely to be male, to be born at lower gestational age and to have lower birth weight associated with lower maternal platelets counts. Maternal platelet counts of 100–149 x 10(9)/L, 50–99 x 10(9)/L, and < 50 x 10(9)/L corresponded respectively to 1.7%, 4.3%, and 12.5% of neonatal thrombocytopenia (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Routine blood counts are recommended, in particular for male infants with low birth weight born to mothers with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia.

Common etiologies of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy and postpartum — incidence and distinguishing features — are summarized as follows: gestational thrombocytopenia has an incidence of 5–11 with common onset during late second or third trimester, normal platelet count outside of pregnancy; immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has incidence < 1 with onset at any trimester, thrombocytopenia outside of pregnancy possible; preeclampsia has incidence 5–8 with onset in late second or third trimester (> 20 wk of gestation) and diagnostic laboratory and clinical criteria including ≥ 300 mg urine protein in 24 h or protein/creatinine ratio of ≥ 0.3 and systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg; HELLP syndrome has incidence < 1 with 70% onset in late second or third trimester, 30% onset postpartum, and any or all signs of preeclampsia may be present, in 15%–20% of cases no hypertension or proteinuria is present, and platelet count nadir occurs 24–48 h after delivery.

### Dynamic prediction of bleeding risk in thrombocytopenic preterm neonates [^e63eb0be]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Over 75% of severely thrombocytopenic neonates receive platelet transfusions, though little evidence supports this practice, and only 10% develop major bleeding. In a recent randomized trial, giving platelet transfusions at a threshold platelet count of 50x10 9 /L compared to a threshold of 25x10 9 /L was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding or mortality. This finding highlights the need for improved and individualized guidelines on neonatal platelet transfusion, which require accurate prediction of bleeding risk. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a dynamic prediction model for major bleeding in thrombocytopenic preterm neonates. This model allows for calculation of bleeding risk at any time-point during the first week after the onset of severe thrombocytopenia. In this multicenter cohort study, we included neonates with a gestational age < 34 weeks, admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, who developed severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50x10 9 /L). The study endpoint was major bleeding. We obtained predictions of bleeding risk using a proportional baselines landmark supermodel. Of 640 included neonates, 71 (11%) had a major bleed. We included the variables gestational age, postnatal age, intrauterine growth retardation, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, platelet count and mechanical ventilation in the model. The median cross-validated c-index was 0.74 (interquartile range, 0.69–0.82). This is a promising dynamic prediction model for bleeding in this population that should be explored further in clinical studies as a potential instrument for supporting clinical decisions. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03110887).

Fetal–neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia — determining fetal platelet count: There are no adequate indirect methods to determine the fetal platelet count, maternal antiplatelet antibody titers correlate poorly with the severity of the disease, and characteristics such as the outcome of previously affected siblings do not reliably predict severity. Currently, the only accurate means of estimating the fetal platelet count is to measure it directly by percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling, and serious complications such as emergent preterm cesarean delivery have been reported in 11% of fetal blood sampling procedures in this setting.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1ac85f0c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Maternal thrombocytopenia — initial workup is outlined as follows: The differential diagnosis in pregnancy includes gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, pseudothrombocytopenia, viral infection, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and congenital thrombocytopenias. These disorders usually can be determined with a detailed medical and family history and a physical examination, with attention to current medication use, blood pressure, splenomegaly, viral serology, and adjunctive laboratory studies as appropriate, and a complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear generally are indicated in the evaluation of maternal thrombocytopenia; a CBC helps to exclude pancytopenia, evaluation of the peripheral smear serves to rule out platelet clumping that may be a cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy to distinguish between inadequate platelet production and increased destruction generally is not indicated.

### Mild thrombocytopenia indicating maternal organ damage in pre-eclampsia: a cross-sectional study [^7bc5165f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, there is a disagreement between guidelines regarding platelet count cut-off values as a sign of maternal organ damage in pre-eclampsia; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines state a cut-off value of < 100 × 10 9 /L; however, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy guidelines specify a cut-off of < 150 × 10 9 /L. We evaluated the effect of mild thrombocytopenia: platelet count < 150 × 10 9 /L and ≥ 100 × 10 9 /L on clinical features of pre-eclampsia to examine whether mild thrombocytopenia reflects maternal organ damage in pre-eclampsia.

Methods

A total of 264 women were enrolled in this study. Participants were divided into three groups based on platelet count levels at delivery: normal, ≥ 150 × 10 9 /L; mild thrombocytopenia, < 150 × 10 9 /L and ≥ 100 × 10 9 /L; and severe thrombocytopenia, < 100 × 10 9 /L. Risk of severe hypertension, utero-placental dysfunction, maternal organ damage, preterm delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were analyzed based on platelet count levels. Estimated relative risk was calculated with a Poisson regression analysis with a robust error.

Results

Platelet counts indicated normal levels in 189 patients, mild thrombocytopenia in 51 patients, and severe thrombocytopenia in 24 patients. The estimated relative risks of severe thrombocytopenia were 4.46 [95% confidence interval, 2.59–7.68] for maternal organ damage except for thrombocytopenia, 1.61 [1.06–2.45] for preterm delivery < 34 gestational weeks, and 1.35 [1.06–1.73] for neonatal intensive care unit admission. On the other hand, the estimated relative risks of mild thrombocytopenia were 0.97 [0.41–2.26] for maternal organ damage except for thrombocytopenia, 0.91 [0.62–1.35] for preterm delivery < 34 gestational weeks, and 0.97 [0.76–1.24] for neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Conclusions

Mild thrombocytopenia was not associated with severe features of pre-eclampsia and would not be suitable as a sign of maternal organ damage.

Because up to 12% of obstetric patients meet criteria for the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, it is not infrequent that the anesthesiologist must decide whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure in an affected patient. Given the potential morbidity associated with general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, thoughtful consideration of which patients with thrombocytopenia are likely to have an increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma with neuraxial procedures, and when these risks outweigh the relative benefits is important to consider and to inform shared decision making with patients. Because there are substantial risks associated with withholding a neuraxial analgesic/anesthetic procedure in obstetric patients, every effort should be made to perform a bleeding history assessment and determine the thrombocytopenia etiology before admission for delivery. Whereas multiple other professional societies (obstetric, interventional pain, and hematologic) have published guidelines addressing platelet thresholds for safe neuraxial procedures, the US anesthesia professional societies have been silent on this topic. Despite a paucity of high-quality data, there are now meta-analyses that provide better estimations of risks. An interdisciplinary taskforce was convened to unite the relevant professional societies, synthesize the data, and provide a practical decision algorithm to help inform risk-benefit discussions and shared decision making with patients. Through a systematic review and modified Delphi process, the taskforce concluded that the best available evidence indicates the risk of spinal epidural hematoma associated with a platelet count ≥ 70,000 × 106/L is likely to be very low in obstetric patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to gestational thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the absence of other risk factors. Ultimately, the decision of whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure in an obstetric patient with thrombocytopenia occurs within a clinical context. Potentially relevant factors include, but are not limited to, patient comorbidities, obstetric risk factors, airway examination, available airway equipment, risk of general anesthesia, and patient preference.

eFigure 3. WHO grade 3–4 bleeding for randomized trials comparing restrictive versus liberal platelet transfusion strategies across clinical settings with available data eReferences. PLTs; Heddle et al, 2009: low-dose, 1. 5–3. 0 × 1011 PLTs/product; standard dose,
3. 0–6. 0 × 1011 platelets/transfusion; Slichter et al, 2010: low-dose,

1. 1 × 1011 platelets/m2; high dose, 4. 4 × 1011 platelets/m2. HPT indicates hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia; ICH, intracranial hemorrhage. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 25 × 103/μL.

In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50 × 103/μL for high-risk procedures. The panel strongly recommends restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion strategies based on high- or moderate-certainty evidence in the 4 populations defined below. Table 2 provides the summary of findings and Table 3 summarizes all recommendations. Recommendation 1. 1: in nonbleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia actively receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1.

2: in preterm neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 25 × 103/μL. Recommendation 1. 3: in patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia — hematologic changes — thrombocytopenia and hemolysis can occur (including as part of HELLP syndrome), with thrombocytopenia arising from increased platelet activation, aggregation, and consumption and serving as a marker of disease severity; a platelet count less than 150,000 × 10^9/L occurs in approximately 20% of patients with preeclampsia, varying from 7% without severe manifestations to 50% with severe manifestations; interpretation of hematocrit should consider concurrent hemolysis and hemoconcentration, and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations (more than 600 IU/L) may signify hemolysis.

Maternal immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — definitions and classification: ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 100 x 10^9/L in the absence of other etiologies. Primary ITP is an acquired immune-mediated disorder with isolated thrombocytopenia without an obvious initiating or underlying cause, whereas "secondary" ITP includes immune-mediated thrombocytopenia due to an underlying disease or drug exposure. ITP is classified by duration into newly diagnosed, persistent (3–12 months), and chronic (12 months or more), and in pregnancy it affects approximately 1 in 1,000–10,000 pregnancies.

The obstetric patient with a known etiology of thrombocytopenia or confirmed hypertensive disorders — assessment steps and neuraxial procedure recommendations are as follows: assess for history of bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia and confirm no visible signs of DIC such as bleeding from intravenous (IV) sites, catheters, wounds, or new mucocutaneous bleeding. For confirmed gestational thrombocytopenia, ITP, or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, if concern exists for a history of bleeding or DIC, then it may be reasonable to avoid neuraxial procedures or seek expert hematologic evaluation before proceeding with the neuraxial procedure (class IIb and level C-LD). If the platelet count is ≥ 70,000 × 10^6/L, then there is likely to be a low risk of spinal epidural hematoma and it is reasonable to proceed with a neuraxial procedure if clinically indicated (class IIa and level C-LD). If the platelet count is between 50,000 and 70,000 × 10^6/L, then there may be scenarios when competing risks/benefits justify proceeding with a neuraxial procedure (class IIb and level C-LD). Assumptions include that the patient has no additional risk factors, and clinical context and competing risks might include high-risk comorbidities or difficult airway, need for urgent or emergent general anesthesia, or the choice of neuraxial technique.
