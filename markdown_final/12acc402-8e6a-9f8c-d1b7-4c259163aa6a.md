## Question

How to cure hemorrhoids that keep returning and are getting worse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to cure hemorrhoids that keep returning and are getting worse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should grade the hemorrhoids and correlate with symptoms. Next, I will reinforce first-line conservative measures and explain why they often fail in advanced disease. After that, I should compare office-based procedures versus surgery for durability. Then, I will examine surgical options and their trade-offs, including stapled hemorrhoidopexy, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation, and excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Finally, I will integrate patient-specific factors, cost-effectiveness, and a practical decision framework, and I will double-check where the evidence is strong versus conditional before concluding with a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because recurrent or worsening symptoms may reflect misclassification or alternate pathology such as fissure, fistula, malignancy, or inflammatory bowel disease. I need to ensure a careful anorectal exam with visualization at rest and with strain, digital rectal exam, and anoscopy, and I should consider colonoscopy when red flags exist or when bleeding persists despite treatment, since rectal bleeding should not be automatically attributed to hemorrhoids without evaluation for other causes [^0b60fbe0].

> Next, I should review grading and symptom mapping, because management hinges on this. Internal hemorrhoids are graded I to IV by degree of prolapse, and external hemorrhoids present with pain, especially when thrombosed. Mixed disease is common in advanced cases, and I need to check for concomitant external components, as this changes procedural choice and recurrence risk [^34d2d88e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "curing" with conservative therapy alone in recurrent, worsening disease. I should confirm that dietary and behavioral measures remain foundational for all patients, but I must also be transparent that their effect size wanes with higher grades. Increased fiber and fluids and avoidance of straining reduce persistent symptoms and bleeding by roughly 50% in early disease, yet recurrence after phlebotonics can approach 80% within 3 to 6 months after stopping, and more than half of conservatively managed patients ultimately require surgery over time, which explains why symptoms persist or worsen despite adherence [^24385904] [^34d2d88e] [^592447ee].

> I will now examine office-based procedures, and I need to ensure I weigh efficacy against durability. Rubber band ligation is the most effective office-based option for grade I to III internal hemorrhoids, with about 89% initial symptom resolution, but up to 20% require repeat banding and recurrence can be substantial in grade III disease. Sclerotherapy and infrared coagulation are alternatives, yet both have higher retreatment needs than banding, and long-term remission is limited, which matters for patients with recurrent disease [^5ff5caf7] [^34d2d88e] [^3ad17d1d].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of recurrence with banding in higher grades. In a randomized noninferiority trial of grade III hemorrhoids, recurrence at 12 months after rubber band ligation was 48.8% versus 6.1% after hemorrhoidectomy, with an absolute risk difference around 41% and more than half of RBL patients needing additional treatment, which is clinically meaningful for someone whose disease keeps returning and worsening [^6d4e914b] [^97a942af].

> Now, I should review surgical options and their trade-offs, and I need to be careful to distinguish short-term pain from long-term control. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy achieves the lowest recurrence, typically 2% to 10% at one to two years, but carries more postoperative pain and a recovery of about 9 to 14 days. Energy devices and closed techniques can reduce pain and bleeding, and serious complications are uncommon when performed by experienced surgeons, though urinary retention and rare incontinence or stenosis can occur [^34d2d88e] [^974a38ca].

> But wait, what if a less painful stapled approach is offered as a "minimally invasive" alternative. I should double-check the long-term data. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has less early pain and faster recovery, yet multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show higher recurrence and more additional procedures than excisional hemorrhoidectomy, so it is not routinely recommended as first-line surgery for internal hemorrhoids when durability is the priority [^365b388b] [^0838836d] [^e8ae3200].

> Let me consider Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation, and I should confirm its niche. HAL may reduce pain compared with excisional surgery but has higher recurrence than hemorrhoidectomy, and in head-to-head data versus rubber band ligation, recurrence was lower with HAL than RBL yet still notable, so HAL can be considered when pain mitigation is prioritized and patients accept the possibility of retreatment [^2be04a19] [^94375292].

> I need to ensure I address emerging options. Laser hemorrhoidoplasty is a promising, less painful modality with growing experience, and expert recommendations suggest it as a viable option after recurrence, often combined with hemorrhoidal artery ligation or mucopexy in selected cases, but I should emphasize that high-quality comparative long-term data are still evolving, so shared decision-making is essential [^6691fa5e] [^c0949fc2].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that tilt the balance. Younger patients with high activity demands may prioritize faster recovery and accept retreatment, whereas patients with frequent recurrences, large external components, or high-grade prolapse often benefit from definitive excisional surgery. Anticoagulation, pregnancy status, and comorbidities also shape procedural choice and timing, and I should confirm these before recommending a path [^notfound].

> I should confirm the economic perspective, because cost-effectiveness influences real-world decisions. Although rubber band ligation has lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy reduces recurrence so substantially that it becomes cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds when quality-adjusted outcomes and recurrence avoidance are considered, reinforcing the value of definitive surgery in appropriately selected patients with recurrent grade III disease [^4813e20e] [^62465a32].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check that it aligns with guidelines. For recurrent, worsening hemorrhoids, I should first confirm the diagnosis and grade, optimize conservative measures, and then pivot to durable therapy if symptoms persist. For grade I to II disease, repeat banding or alternative office therapies are reasonable, but for grade III to IV or mixed disease with external components, excisional hemorrhoidectomy offers the most reliable long-term control, with HAL or laser approaches as alternatives when pain minimization is paramount and patients understand retreatment risks [^b761971f] [^974a38ca] [^6691fa5e].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make it actionable. In patients with recurrent, worsening hemorrhoids — particularly grade III to IV or mixed disease — excisional hemorrhoidectomy provides the highest likelihood of durable cure, albeit with more pain and recovery time, whereas office banding trades lower invasiveness for substantially higher recurrence and retreatment needs. Shared decision-making that weighs symptom burden, prior failures, activity goals, and cost-effectiveness is essential, and I need to ensure patients understand that "minimally invasive" does not always mean "minimally recurrent" in this context [^34d2d88e] [^6d4e914b] [^4813e20e].

For recurrent, worsening hemorrhoids, **excisional hemorrhoidectomy** is the most effective definitive treatment [^974a38ca], with the lowest recurrence (2–10%) [^34d2d88e] and durable symptom control, though it requires a longer recovery and has more postoperative pain [^c63740f7]. Rubber band ligation is less invasive but has a **higher recurrence (20–50%)** [^94375292] and often needs repeat sessions [^6d4e914b]. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is not first-line due to higher recurrence and complications [^365b388b] [^0838836d]. Conservative measures (fiber, fluids, avoiding straining) are essential but insufficient alone for advanced disease [^24385904] [^592447ee]. Choose surgery for grade III–IV, mixed disease, or failed office therapy; reserve banding for grade I–II or select grade III when surgery is undesirable [^b761971f] [^5ff5caf7].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line for mild disease** [^b761971f] but often fails in advanced or recurrent cases [^592447ee].

- **Dietary modifications**: Increase fiber (25–30 g/day) and fluids to soften stools and reduce straining [^notfound].
- **Behavioral modifications**: Avoid straining, limit toilet time, and respond promptly to urge [^notfound].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Topical agents (e.g. lidocaine, hydrocortisone) and flavonoids (e.g. diosmin) can reduce symptoms but have high recurrence after cessation [^34d2d88e] [^9db0bb79].

---

## Office-based procedures

Office-based procedures are **minimally invasive** options for grade I–III hemorrhoids, especially when surgery is undesirable [^5ff5caf7].

| **Procedure** | **Effectiveness** | **Recurrence rate** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rubber band ligation (RBL) | High initial success (80–90%) | 20–50% at 1–2 years [^94375292] | Pain, bleeding, thrombosis |
| Sclerotherapy | Moderate success (70–85%) | 30–50% at 1–2 years | Pain, bleeding, infection |
| Infrared coagulation | Moderate success (70–80%) | 20–30% at 1–2 years | Pain, bleeding |

---

RBL is the **most effective office option** [^5ff5caf7] but often requires repetition and has higher recurrence in advanced disease [^6d4e914b].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery offers the **most durable control** for recurrent, worsening hemorrhoids, particularly grade III–IV or mixed disease [^974a38ca].

- **Excisional hemorrhoidectomy**: Gold standard with 2–10% recurrence [^34d2d88e]; effective for grade III–IV, mixed disease, or failed office therapy [^974a38ca]; longer recovery and more pain [^c63740f7].
- **Stapled hemorrhoidopexy**: Less pain and faster recovery [^84977713] but higher recurrence (15–30%) and complications (e.g. incontinence, rectal stenosis) [^0838836d]; not first-line [^365b388b].
- **Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL)**: Less pain than excisional surgery [^2be04a19] but higher recurrence (10–20%); suitable for select grade II–III cases [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options like **laser hemorrhoidoplasty** and rectal artery embolization show promise for less pain and faster recovery, but long-term data are limited and they are not yet standard of care [^6691fa5e] [^8a6c5158].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment should be **individualized** based on:

- **Hemorrhoid grade and anatomy**: Grade III–IV or mixed disease favor excisional hemorrhoidectomy [^974a38ca].
- **Symptom severity and recurrence**: Persistent, recurrent symptoms despite conservative/office therapy warrant surgery [^974a38ca].
- **Patient preferences**: Tolerance for pain, recovery time, and need for repeat procedures [^698cf32c].
- **Comorbidities**: Age, comorbidities, and anticoagulation status affect procedural risk and choice [^2883b675].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For recurrent, worsening hemorrhoids, **excisional hemorrhoidectomy** provides the most definitive control with low recurrence but requires a longer recovery [^974a38ca] [^34d2d88e]. RBL is less invasive but has higher recurrence and often needs repetition [^6d4e914b]. Conservative measures are essential but insufficient alone for advanced disease [^592447ee]. Choose surgery for grade III–IV, mixed disease, or failed office therapy; reserve banding for grade I–II or select grade III when surgery is undesirable [^b761971f] [^5ff5caf7].

Purpose Of Review

Efforts continue to improve the treatment of patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease by interventions designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, including by reducing intraoperative and postoperative pain, decreasing operating times, minimizing blood loss and controlling symptoms and recurrence rates. Simultaneously, there are also renewed efforts to minimize the number of patients who will require procedural intervention by focusing on conservative measures that encourage better bowel regulation and habits. The purpose of this brief report is to review the current status of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hemorrhoidal disease. Overall, new procedures or procedural refinements to existing techniques continue to be introduced with promising short-term outcomes - at least in some instances. In most instances, long-term follow-up or equivalency data are still being accumulated such that a definitive, unequivocal answer to what is truly the best alternative to traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains controversial. One of the challenges is heterogeneity as regards diagnosis, intervention and, especially, outcomes measures such that comparing therapies is too difficult. A recent initiative to standardize metrics has promise.

Recent Findings

Recent studies largely appear to suggest that conservative treatment approaches and managing patient expectations are critically important in which a primary objective should be to minimize the progression to symptomatic disease and complications in patients who are diagnosed with hemorrhoids. The pace of change as regards the development of new or improved surgical techniques appears may be accelerating.

Summary

Progress is being made and the knowledge base is being expanded as regards the treatment options for patients with hemorrhoids and expected outcomes. A key initiative to standardize the approaches to diagnosis and treatment about staging, procedural interventions and outcomes will facilitate comparative analytics, if successful.

Discussion

Hemorrhoids represent a common yet challenging condition to manage, with treatment options ranging from conservative approaches to surgical interventions. This meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of different treatments found that surgery resulted in significantly higher rates of achieving asymptomatic status and better short-term pain relief than conservative treatment. Patients who underwent surgery also had shorter recovery times and lower recurrence rates. Furthermore, considering the limited evidence on the management of hemorrhoids in pregnant women, we analyzed the results of existing studies to provide additional observations that may inform future research.

Our analysis confirmed that surgical treatment was more effective than conservative treatment in achieving a symptom-free state. This superiority may stem from the limited and often transient efficacy of conservative measures, particularly in patients with more advanced disease. A long-term retrospective study pointed out that more than 50% of patients who received conservative treatment required surgical treatment in the following years. Another study showed that up to 30–40% of patients who received conservative treatment may experience symptom recurrence or worsening of the disease, especially when diet and lifestyle habits are not changed. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of symptom-free outcomes, likely due to differences in hemorrhoid grade distribution, treatment protocols, and outcome definitions across the included studies. It is worth noting that the main indications for conservative treatment are patients with grade I and II hemorrhoids. These early stages of hemorrhoids can usually be effectively controlled by increasing dietary fiber intake, improving bowel habits, and local drug treatment. Once hemorrhoids reach the most advanced stage, patients still need surgery. The results of Stratta et al. showed that the success rate of symptom control in patients with grade I-II hemorrhoids treated conservatively can reach 70–80%, but for grade III-IV hemorrhoids, the probability of conservative treatment failure is higher. However, not all included studies reported the hemorrhoid grade of the included patients, which limited our ability to perform subgroup analyses according to disease stage. Lack of information may lead to differences in treatment effects across studies, thus affecting the stability of the overall effect estimate. In addition, the high recurrence rate in conservatively treated patients may be related to the limitations of conservative treatment itself in achieving a symptom-free state. In our results, the recurrence rate after surgical treatment was indeed significantly lower than that in patients treated conservatively, including pregnant women. This shows that surgical treatment fundamentally solves the core cause of symptoms by directly removing the diseased tissue, thereby significantly reducing the possibility of recurrence.

External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation — placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow — resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients.

Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence, although with longer recovery. External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment. Conclusions and Relevance Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics.

In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches.

Recurrence Rate

At 12 months, recurrence was observed in 48.8% of RBL participants versus 6.1% in the hemorrhoidectomy group, with an absolute risk difference (ARD) of 43% (95% CI, 25%–60%; p < 0.001), exceeding the noninferiority limit of 10% (Table 4). Self-reported recurrence was higher in the RBL group (24%) compared to none in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 24%; 95% CI, 10%–37%; p = 0.003). In addition, 26% of RBL participants required more than 1 additional treatment, compared to 3% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 9%–37%; p = 0.006). Specifically, 3 RBL participants (6.5%) underwent multiple RBL sessions (3×, 3×, and 6×), 3 participants (6.5%) underwent 1 extra RBL session followed by hemorrhoidectomy, and 6 participants (13%) underwent immediate hemorrhoidectomy after initial RBL failure. Thirteen RBL participants (28%) underwent 1 repeated RBL session, as was allowed by the study protocol (see Supplemental Table 3 at).

TABLE 4.
Recurrence rate at 12 mo

At 6 weeks, 26% of RBL participants and 4.5% of hemorrhoidectomy participants reported unchanged or worsened symptoms (ARD 22%; 95% CI, 2%–42%). At 6 months, these rates were 7.9% versus 3% (ARD 5%; 95% CI, –5% to +15%). At 24 months, self-reported recurrence was 29.7% in the RBL group versus 6.7% in the hemorrhoidectomy group (ARD 23%; 95% CI, 6%–40%; see Supplemental Table 4 at).

Complications

Postoperative complications were observed in 6% of patients in the RBL group and 12% of patients in the hemorrhoidectomy group (Table 2), with similar rates of serious adverse events. Incontinence scores improved by about 1 unit in both groups, with no significant differences during follow-up (see Supplemental Table 5 at).

Certainty of evidence — GRADE framework determined the final grade of recommendation and level of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent of our confidence in the estimates of effect, and evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) start as high certainty while evidence from observational studies start as low certainty. For each outcome, the evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low, recommendations are influenced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and the certainty of evidence based on observational studies can be rated up when there is a large magnitude of effect or dose–response relationship.

Introduction

Hemorrhoids is one of the most prevalent anorectal conditions globally, significantly affecting the quality of life of millions of patients due to symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and prolapse. the prevalence of hemorrhoids varies significantly, with factors such as obesity, abdominal obesity, depression, and prior pregnancy identified as significant risk factors These physical symptoms can lead to discomfort during daily activities and reduced quality of life, emphasizing the importance of effective management strategies.

Management strategies for hemorrhoidal disease primarily include surgical and conservative treatments. Surgical interventions, such as hemorrhoidectomy, are highly effective for alleviating severe symptoms in the short term. Hemorrhoidectomy remains the gold standard for advanced disease due to its definitive symptom relief; however, it is associated with considerable postoperative pain, urinary retention, and complications such as anal stenosis. On the other hand, conservative management encompasses pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications, and completely non-invasive therapies, offering a less invasive alternative for mild to moderate cases. Dietary and lifestyle modifications, including increased fiber intake, are often the first therapeutic steps for improving symptoms such as bleeding and prolapse. Although some reviews and meta-analyses have classified office-based procedures like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation as part of conservative management, the 2024 guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons exclude these modalities from the definition of conservative treatment. Consequently, our study did not included the office-based procedures to ensure a clearer evaluation of conservative management options.

Despite the widespread use of these surgical and conservative interventions, there remains a lack of comprehensive, comparative evidence synthesizing their relative efficacy and safety. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a rigorous meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the outcomes of surgical versus conservative treatments for hemorrhoids. By systematically analyzing data on key outcomes such as symptom relief, recurrence rates, and complication occurence, this research would provide evidence-based insights to guide clinical decision-making and optimize individualized treatment strategies.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^83b92de2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis highlights the trade-offs between surgery and conservative treatment. Although surgical intervention provides better symptom relief, faster recovery, and less recurrence, it also carries some specific post-treatment complications. On the other hand, conservative treatment is a safer and less invasive approach, but it provides slower symptom relief and higher recurrence rates. For special populations such as pregnant women with hemorrhoids, the decision to undergo surgical treatment remains a clinical challenge. Due to concerns about fetal safety and limited evidence, further research is needed to guide optimal treatment strategies in this group.

Limitation

Although this study provides valuable evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of surgical and conservative treatments in hemorrhoid management, it has certain limitations. First, the hemorrhoid grading of included patients was not uniformly and explicitly reported, the duration and definition of follow-up also varied across studies. This heterogeneity might introduce confounding effects on the study results, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. Second, although our initial goal was to include more RCTs to enhance methodological rigor, only seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and among them, only three were strictly randomized controlled trials. The scarcity of RCTs directly comparing surgical and completely non-invasive conservative treatments likely reflects ethical and practical challenges in randomizing patients to treatment options. As a result, we included high-quality observational studies to ensure sufficient sample size and comprehensive outcome assessment. While this approach broadens the evidence base, it may also introduce inherent biases associated with non-randomized study designs, despite our efforts to rigorously assess study quality. Moreover, because the overall number of included studies was limited (< 10), formal assessment of publication bias was not conducted. However, we qualitatively reviewed study characteristics and found no obvious indications of selective reporting, though the possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out. Besides, among the included studies, only one article investigated TEH in an acute setting. Other studies focused on symptomatic hemorrhoids without specifying whether treatment was elective or emergent. Therefore, the majority of our analysis pertains to mixed clinical settings, and findings may not be directly extrapolated to acute thrombosed cases. Lastly, there was considerable variation in the follow-up periods of the studies included, which could lead to bias in interpreting conclusions across different timeframes. These issues highlight directions for future research.

Objectives

Hemorrhoids, a common anorectal condition, can be managed through surgical or conservative treatments. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted from of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from their inception to September 25, 2024. Eligible studies compared surgical treatments with non-invasive conservative treatments in hemorrhoids. Statistical analyses included pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs)/standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Seven studies, including 760 patients, were analyzed. Surgery achieved higher rates of complete symptom resolution than conservative therapy (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.66–5.28, p < 0.001). Overall pain scores favored surgery (SMD = -0.93, 95% CI: 1.73 to -0.13, p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed clear superiority within four days (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.68) but parity beyond ten days (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.44; p = 0.99). Comparable patterns were observed in pregnant women with thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Rates of postoperative bleeding (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.82, p = 0.86; I2 = 41%, p = 0.15) and urinary retention (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 10.31, p = 0.54; I2 = 45%, p = 0.18) did not differ significantly between groups. Surgical-specific adverse events were infrequent (incontinence 3%, persistent pain 5%, watery discharge 6%). Surgery shortened recovery in pregnant thrombosed cases by approximately seven days (MD: -6.80; 95% CI: -7.64 to -5.96, p < 0.001; I2 = 55%, p = 0.14) and reduced overall recurrence (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.37, p < 0.001; I2 = 0%, p = 0.97).

Conclusion

Surgical treatments provide superior symptom relief, faster recovery, and lower recurrence but with some specific post-treatment complications, while conservative treatments are safer and less invasive but with provides slower symptom relief and higher recurrence rates. Individualized treatment should consider symptom severity, patient preferences, and risk tolerance.

### Fiber for the treatment of hemorrhoids complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^775c73c9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

Methods

We searched using the following sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL, BIOSIS, AMED, Papers First and Proceedings; study authors, industry, and experts in the field. We included all published and unpublished parallel group randomized controlled trials comparing any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, retrieved all potentially relevant studies, and extracted data on study population, intervention, prespecified outcomes, and methodology.

Results

Seven trials randomized 378 patients to fiber or a nonfiber control. Studies were of moderate quality for most outcomes. Meta-analyses using random effects models suggested that fiber has an apparent beneficial effect. The risk of not improving/persisting symptoms decreased by 47% in the fiber group (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38–0.73) and the risk of bleeding by 50% (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.89). Studies with multiple follow-ups, usually at 6 wk and at 3 months, showed consistent results over time. Results are also compatible with large treatment effects in prolapse, pain, and itching, but even in the pooled analyses confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.37–1.67; RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.07–1.65; and RR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.24–2.10, respectively). One study suggested a decrease in recurrence. Results showed a nonsignificant trend toward increases in mild adverse events in the fiber group (RR = 6.0, 95% CI 0.57–64.8).

Conclusions

Trials of fiber show a consistent beneficial effect for symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.

CONCLUSIONS

Although the present study did not achieve the planned sample size, it provides several key insights. Patients with grade III hemorrhoids may benefit from knowing that although hemorrhoidectomy may involve a longer waiting period, it generally offers a more durable solution with a lower risk of recurrence. However, this procedure is associated with significantly more pain in the initial week, higher analgesic use, and a longer recovery period. Both treatments are deemed safe, but hemorrhoidectomy tends to result in a better QoL and symptom scores, according to patient reports, although these differences were not statistically significant.

### Hemorrhoids: diagnosis and treatment options [^836b3c1b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e., proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess for risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued. Medical management (e.g., stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, topical nitroglycerine), dietary modifications (e.g., increased fiber and water intake), and behavioral therapies (sitz baths) are the mainstays of initial therapy. If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation. Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential postoperative complications. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation may be useful in grade II or III hemorrhoids because patients may experience less pain and recover more quickly. Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids can greatly reduce pain if performed within the first two to three days of symptoms.

Methods

Search strategy

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from their inception to September 25, 2024. The search strategy combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms related to hemorrhoids, surgical interventions, and completely non-invasive conservative treatments. Keywords included "hemorrhoids", "surgery", "hemorrhoidectomy", "Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation", "conservative treatment", "non-surgical", "medical therapy", "diet", and "fiber". The full search strategy for each database was presented in Table S1.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The literature screening process was conducted independently by two authors (L.Q. and X.B.), any discrepancies resolved through consultation with a third author (F.C.). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) Studies with patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hemorrhoids; (2) Studies with comparison between surgical treatments (e.g. hemorrhoidectomy, Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation) and completely non-invasive conservative treatments (e.g. pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications); (3) Studies are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational cohort studies; (4) Studies published in English. Exclusion criteria were: (1) duplicate publications; (2) non-clinical studies, including reviews, expert opinions, case reports, conference abstracts, and animal studies; (3) Studies without a control group or single-arm studies; (4) Studies with inaccessible full texts or incomplete/unextractable data; (5) Studies employing minimally invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or infrared coagulation.

Data extraction

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers (L.Q. and X.B.). The following information was collected: First author, publication year, study design, sample size, age, type of surgical procedure, specifics of conservative treatment, symptom resolution, pain reduction, types and rates of complication, recovery, and recurrence. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus. The methods and time points of measuring pain scores were presented in Table S2.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^7c456fec]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the design of this trial, we initially hypothesized that "up to 2 RBL treatments are noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in terms of quality of life and recurrence risk, whereas being more cost-effective." Our findings challenge this assumption, showing that while RBL offers lower upfront costs, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced recurrence and improved quality of life. For patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy may be more cost-effective than RBL, and therefore, caution is needed before discarding it as a routine first-line treatment solely based on rising health care costs or limited operating room availability.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^365b388b]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) is not routinely recommended as a first-line surgical treatment for internal hemorrhoids given its marginal efficacy and significant risk profile. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on moderate-quality evidence. SH uses a circular stapling device to create a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis by excising the submucosa proximal to the dentate resulting in cephalad fixation of the anal cushions and interruption of the feeding arteries, and although effective for prolapsing internal hemorrhoids, it does not address external hemorrhoids. In a randomized trial of 777 patients, SH produced less pain and better quality of life within 6 weeks (p = 0.02), but the EH group had fewer recurrent symptoms (OR 2.96; 95% CI, 2.02–4.32), lower tenesmus/incontinence rates (p = 0.01), and higher 24‑month quality of life. A Cochrane review showed SH patients were more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids than those with excisional hemorrhoidectomy (12 trials, 955 patients; OR 3.22; 95% CI, 1.59–6.51), and more symptomatic prolapse at all time points (13 studies, 1191 patients; OR 2.65; 95% CI, 1.45–4.85).

Importance

Hemorrhoidal disease, pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. Hemorrhoidal disease may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

Observations

Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (eg, flavonoids [thought to improve venous tone]) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation-placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow-resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term (weeks to months) among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients. Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence (2%-10%), although with longer recovery (9–14 days). External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment (eg, stool softeners, oral and topical analgesics such as 5% lidocaine).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics. In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches.

BACKGROUND:

Long-term outcomes and efficacy of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy are not known.

OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy with circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy.

DESIGN:

This was a parallel group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial.

SETTINGS:

The study was conducted at a single academic center.

PATIENTS:

Patients with grade III/IV hemorrhoids between August 2011 and November 2013 were included.

INTERVENTIONS:

Three hundred patients were randomly assigned to undergo either partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy (group 1, n = 150) or circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (group 2, n = 150).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

The primary outcome was the rate of recurrent prolapse at a median follow-up period of 5 years with a predefined noninferiority margin of 3.75%. Secondary outcomes included incidence and severity of postoperative pain, fecal urgency, anal continence, and the frequency of specific complications, including anorectal stenosis and rectovaginal fistula.

RESULTS:

The visual analog scores in group 1 were less than those in group 2 (p < 0.001). Fewer patients in group 1 experienced postoperative urgency compared with those in group 2 (p = 0.001). Anal continence significantly worsened after both procedures, but the difference between preoperative and postoperative continence scores was higher for group 2 than for group 1. Postoperative rectal stenosis did not develop in patients in group 1, although it occurred in 8 patients (5%) in group 2 (p = 0.004). The 5-year cumulative recurrence rate between group 1 (9% (95% CI, 4%–13%)) and group 2 (12% (95% CI, 7%–17%)) did not differ significantly (p = 0.137), and the difference was within the noninferiority margin (absolute difference, –3.33% (95% CI, –10.00% to 3.55%)).

LIMITATIONS:

The study was limited because it was a single-center trial.

CONCLUSIONS:

Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy is noninferior to circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for patients with grade III to IV hemorrhoids at a median follow-up period of 5 years. However, partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy was associated with reduced postoperative pain and urgency, better postoperative anal continence, and minimal risk of rectal stenosis. See Video Abstract at.

Hemorrhoidal disease — dietary and behavioral modification first-line therapy: Dietary and behavioral modifications are the primary first-line therapies for patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease (Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence). Constipation and abnormal bowel habits can play a significant role, with a systematic review of 17 case-controlled and 2 cohort studies showing a significantly higher prevalence of constipation in patients with hemorrhoids versus controls (OR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.27–3.44). Increased fiber and fluid intake should be recommended to all patients with hemorrhoids, and a Cochrane review of 7 RCTs (n = 378) comparing fiber to a nonfiber control found the risk of persistent symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (relative risk [RR] 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32–0.68) with a significant reduction in bleeding (RR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.89) but limited improvement in prolapse, pain, and itching; patients should also be counseled about proper bowel habits such as avoiding straining and limiting time on the commode.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^77d5ec4e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries' of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus and to encourage clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^ae2b68c6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Coughlin et alreported repeated RBL as cost-effective, with success rates rising from 57% after 1 session to 91% after 4 sessions, although 6% required surgery. They estimated RBL costs at $723 per patient (range, $382–$4430), with a mean QALY of 0.997, concluding sequential banding remained dominant even after multiple sessions. In comparison, hemorrhoidectomy was reported to be 2.75 times more expensive and associated with 9.45 times lower QALYs. However, these findings contrast with our study, which showed greater QALY gains for hemorrhoidectomy at 2-year follow-up.

Methodological differences likely explain these contrasting results. The retrospective design of their study, reliance on historical banding data, and hypothetical cost estimates may have introduced bias. In addition, their inclusion of heterogeneous patient cohorts across all Goligher grades reduced applicability to grade III hemorrhoids. Although repeated RBL demonstrated lower upfront costs, patients requiring surgery after failed RBL faced higher cumulative costs and reduced quality of life, underscoring the importance of individualized treatment planning and comprehensive cost assessments.

Our study demonstrated that hemorrhoidectomy resulted in fewer recurrences, assessed through additional treatments and self-reported recurrences, rather than prolapse severity alone. However, the severity of hemorrhoids in patients reporting recurrence on questionnaires and its implications for treatment remains unclear, as these patients did not seek further treatment yet.

Study Limitations

Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the intended sample size was not reached, limiting statistical power and precluding broader budget impact analyses. It may also have limited the detection of rare but costly complications, particularly in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This limited sample size was primarily due to high rates of nonparticipation, with many eligible patients declining randomization because of a strong preference for RBL over surgery. Second, reliance on patient-reported outcomes introduces potential recall bias. Third, procedural costs were estimated using average hospital prices rather than detailed bottom-up calculations. Although this approach is reasonable, the lack of pricing transparency and variability in agreements with insurers complicates accurate cost determination in the Dutch health care system. Finally, the number of hemorrhoid piles treated was only systematically recorded in the hemorrhoidectomy group, potentially influencing recurrence comparisons.

Despite these limitations, the use of patient-reported questionnaires to capture health care resource use and societal costs enhances internal validity. The high response rate further minimizes selection bias, strengthening the reliability and generalizability of our findings.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^4813e20e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and health care costs. Although rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.

OBJECTIVE:

To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.

DESIGN:

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

SETTINGS:

Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.

PATIENTS:

Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomly assigned to receive rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy treatment.

INTERVENTIONS:

Rubber band ligation (up to 2 sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.

RESULTS:

Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 for hemorrhoidectomy and 46 for rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a quality-adjusted life year difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%–51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1364; 95% CI, 895–1834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1984; 95% CI, –132 to 4101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per quality-adjusted life year gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year and 83.9% at €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.

LIMITATIONS:

The small sample size may limit generalizability and the ability to detect rare but costly complications. Procedural costs were based on average hospital prices, which is a pragmatic approach but is less detailed than bottom-up costing.

CONCLUSIONS:

In patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including higher quality of life and lower recurrence rates compared to rubber band ligation. However, its cost-effectiveness varies depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is warranted before discarding it as a first-line treatment solely based on health care costs or limited operating room availability. See Video Abstract.

PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN:

Costo por año de vida ajustado a calidad (AVAC) ganado y costo por recurrencia evitada durante 24 meses desde una perspectiva social.

RESULTADOS:

Se analizaron setenta y nueve pacientes (33 hemorroidectomía, 46 ligadura con banda elástica). La hemorroidectomía presentó mejores resultados clínicos, con una diferencia de AVAC de 0,08 (IC del 95%, 0,04–0,13) y una diferencia de recurrencia del 33,5% (IC del 95%, 15,3%-51,7%). Los costes hospitalarios fueron mayores para la hemorroidectomía (1364 €; IC del 95%, 895–1834; p < 0,001), al igual que los costes sociales (1984 €; IC del 95%, -132-4101; p = 0,066). La razón costo-utilidad incremental para la hemorroidectomía fue de 24.042 € por AVAC ganado, y la razón costo-efectividad incremental fue de 5.918 € por recurrencia evitada. La probabilidad de que la hemorroidectomía sea costo-efectiva fue del 45,5% con 20.000 €/AVAC y del 83,9% con 50.000 €/AVAC. Para la prevención de la recurrencia, las probabilidades fueron del 98,3% y del 99,8%, respectivamente.

LIMITACIONES:

El pequeño tamaño de la muestra puede limitar la generalización y la capacidad de detectar complicaciones poco frecuentes pero costosas. Los costos del procedimiento se basaron en los precios hospitalarios promedio, lo cual constituye un enfoque pragmático, aunque menos detallado que el cálculo de costos ascendente.

CONCLUSIONES:

En pacientes con hemorroides de grado III, la hemorroidectomía ofrece mejores resultados clínicos a largo plazo, incluyendo una mayor calidad de vida y menores tasas de recurrencia en comparación con la ligadura con banda elástica. Sin embargo, su costo-efectividad varía en función de los umbrales de disposición a pagar de la sociedad. Se recomienda precaución antes de descartarla como tratamiento de primera línea basándose únicamente en los costos sanitarios o la disponibilidad limitada de quirófanos. (Traducción — Ingrid Melo)

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^02912ea1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-treatment complications

Both surgical and conservative treatments exhibited relatively low rates of post-treatment complications. The comparison revealed no significant differences in the occurrence of bleeding (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.82, p = 0.86; I² = 41%, p = 0.15; Figs. 4 A) or urinary retention (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 10.31, p = 0.54; I² = 45%, p = 0.18). In addition, patients undergoing surgical treatment may experience specific complications. The pooled occurrence of incontinence was 0.03 (95% CI: −0.03 to 0.09), post-treatment pain was 0.05 (95% CI: −0.00 to 0.10), and profuse watery discharge was 0.06 (95% CI: −0.02 to 0.13). Although these events were relatively infrequent, their presence should be considered in clinical decision-making.

Recovery and recurrence

Surgical treatments demonstrated advantages in recovery and recurrence outcomes compared to conservative treatments. Notably, only two studies specifically assessed the recovery time in pregnant women with TEH. In these studies, patients undergoing surgical treatments exhibited a significantly shorter time to full recovery compared to conservative treatments (MD: −6.80; 95% CI: −7.64 to −5.96, p < 0.001; I² = 55%, p = 0.14). Surgical treatments also significantly reduced the recurrence rates compared to conservative treatments, with an OR of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.37, p < 0.001; I² = 0%, p = 0.97) (Fig. 4 B).

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^97a942af]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal management strategy for grade III hemorrhoids remains a subject of ongoing debate. Hemorrhoidectomy is the criterion standard, but rubber band ligation offers a less invasive outpatient alternative. Treatment variability persists due to a lack of consensus on the preferred strategy.

Objective

To directly compare the effectiveness of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids.

Design

Open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled noninferiority trial.

Settings

Multicenter study across 10 Dutch hospitals from October 2019 to September 2022.

Patients

Patients (aged 18 years or older) with symptomatic grade III (Goligher) hemorrhoids were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included prior rectal/anal surgery, more than 1 rubber band ligation/injection within the preceding 3 years, rectal radiation, preexisting sphincter injury, IBD, medical unfitness for surgery (ASA higher than 3), pregnancy, or hypercoagulability disorders.

Interventions

Randomized 1:1 to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy, with up to 2 banding sessions allowed.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes included 12-month health-related quality of life and recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes included complications, pain, work resumption, and patient-reported outcome measures.

Results

Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned (47 rubber band ligation vs 40 hemorrhoidectomy). Rubber band ligation was not noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy in quality-adjusted life years (-0.045; 95% CI, -0.087 to -0.004). Recurrence rate was worse in the rubber band ligation group (47.5% vs 6.1%), with an absolute risk difference of 41% (95% CI, 24%-59%). Complication rates were comparable. Pain scores after hemorrhoidectomy were higher during the first week (visual analogue scale 4 vs 1; p = 0.002). Rubber band ligation group returned to work sooner (1 vs 9 days; p = 0.021). Patient-reported hemorrhoidal symptom scores favored hemorrhoidectomy.

Limitations

The primary limitation of the study was its early termination due to funding constraints, resulting in a relatively small sample size and limited statistical power. Patient recruitment was hindered by significant treatment preferences and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusions

Hemorrhoidectomy may benefit patients with grade III hemorrhoids in terms of quality of life, recurrence risk, and symptom burden, whereas rubber band ligation allows faster recovery with less pain. These findings can guide clinical decision-making. See Video Abstract.

### Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy versus circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for grade III to IV prolapsing hemorrhoids: a randomized, noninferiority trial [^6465544b]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term outcomes and efficacy of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy are not known.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy with circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy.

Design

This was a parallel group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial.

Settings

The study was conducted at a single academic center.

Patients

Patients with grade III/IV hemorrhoids between August 2011 and November 2013 were included.

Interventions

Three hundred patients were randomly assigned to undergo either partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy (group 1, n = 150) or circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy (group 2, n = 150).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the rate of recurrent prolapse at a median follow-up period of 5 years with a predefined noninferiority margin of 3.75%. Secondary outcomes included incidence and severity of postoperative pain, fecal urgency, anal continence, and the frequency of specific complications, including anorectal stenosis and rectovaginal fistula.

Results

The visual analog scores in group 1 were less than those in group 2 (p < 0.001). Fewer patients in group 1 experienced postoperative urgency compared with those in group 2 (p = 0.001). Anal continence significantly worsened after both procedures, but the difference between preoperative and postoperative continence scores was higher for group 2 than for group 1. Postoperative rectal stenosis did not develop in patients in group 1, although it occurred in 8 patients (5%) in group 2 (p = 0.004). The 5-year cumulative recurrence rate between group 1 (9% (95% CI, 4%-13%)) and group 2 (12% (95% CI, 7%-17%)) did not differ significantly (p = 0.137), and the difference was within the noninferiority margin (absolute difference, -3.33% (95% CI, -10.00% to 3.55%)).

Limitations

The study was limited because it was a single-center trial.

Conclusions

Partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy is noninferior to circumferential stapled hemorrhoidopexy for patients with grade III to IV hemorrhoids at a median follow-up period of 5 years. However, partial stapled hemorrhoidopexy was associated with reduced postoperative pain and urgency, better postoperative anal continence, and minimal risk of rectal stenosis.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^846101f7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries' of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus and to encourage clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

Regarding surgical interventions for hemorrhoids, more specifically with respect to hemorrhoidal artery ligation, ASCRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing Doppler-guided hemorrhoid artery ligation in patients with internal hemorrhoids, recognizing that it may lead to decreased pain but increased recurrence rates compared with excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

### Conservative and surgical treatment of haemorrhoids [^82e9241d]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

The management of haemorrhoids has evolved rapidly during the past few decades. Several new treatments have been proposed with the aim of reducing patients' postoperative pain, time to return to normal life, risk of early and late complications, and recurrence rate. Although conservative treatment based on dietary and lifestyle changes can help the majority of patients, and rubber band ligation and phlebotonic drugs can effectively treat grade I and II haemorrhoids, surgery is required for the most advanced stages. Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy is considered to be the gold-standard approach for grade IV haemorrhoids. An increasing number of minimally invasive treatment options, including mucopexy with or without mucosal resection and haemorrhoid artery ligation, have now been proposed for the management of grade III haemorrhoids. These approaches aim to correct the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the aetiology of haemorrhoids. An increased risk of recurrence is the price to pay for these minimally invasive and less painful treatments, but the sparing of the sensitive anoderm and a rapid return to normal life without pain are greatly appreciated by patients. An algorithm for the management of haemorrhoids using evidence-based medicine is also presented here.

### Laser hemorrhoidoplasty versus hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of surgically indicated hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients: a randomized comparative clinical study [^6b35e3a6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Perianal disease is a common complication associated with inflammatory bowel conditions, such as Crohn's, ulcerative, or nonspecific colitis. The manifestations of this condition can vary greatly, encompassing both troublesome and annoying conditions such as fistulas and abscesses, as well as less severe disorders like hemorrhoids, skin tags, and fissures.

Due Anal sepsis and fistulae's significant disease burden and ability to alter the disease's progression have been the primary focus of attention in the literature. Despite their potential to impede a patient's daily activities, hemorrhoids and anal fissures in individuals with inflammatory bowel disorders have been overlooked.

Given the potential for anal disease recurrence, surgeons initially opted for conservative medical treatment as the first choice in managing the course of inflammatory bowel disorders or related conditions. Furthermore, the results of surgical intervention were unsatisfactory, with a high likelihood of symptoms recurring or persisting. As a result, patients were required to continue taking immunosuppressive and corticosteroid medications after the surgery to prevent or slow down the progression of the inflammatory disease, which could potentially lead to delayed or no healing.

Currently, laser hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP) has garnered significant interest. However, to our knowledge, there have been no published studies investigating the effectiveness of laser hemorrhoidoplasty compared to traditional surgery for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe anal disease.

Due to the prevalence of anal disease in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and the challenges associated with treating anal problems in these patients, we aimed to examine a minimally invasive technique for treatment of the disease in patients requiring surgical intervention. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and complications of Laser ablation versus traditional surgery.

We hypothesize that Laser ablation is superior to surgery for hemorrhoids in IBD patients.

This study aims to improve the outcome of surgery in inflammatory bowel conditions.

### Laxatives for the treatment of hemorrhoids [^6096d879]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic hemorrhoids are a common medical condition, which increase in prevalence in women during pregnancy and postpartum. Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures.

Main Results

Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of fiber shows a consistent beneficial effect for relieving overall symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^eab9d9b7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common condition and significantly impacts quality of life and health care costs. – Treatment decisions are often guided by the Goligher classification, with surgical intervention typically recommended when conservative measures fail. – However, for grade III hemorrhoids, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy, leading to variability in clinical practice.

Two common treatment options are rubber band ligation (RBL), a minimally invasive outpatient procedure with relatively low upfront costs, and hemorrhoidectomy, the current criterion standard, which is more invasive and costly but generally provides more durable symptom relief. Although RBL is frequently chosen as a first-line treatment, repeat procedures are often required, raising concerns about cumulative costs and the prolonged impact on quality of life. – These additional costs result not only from additional health care resources but also from indirect costs, such as productivity losses due to prolonged treatment durations and recovery periods.

This variability underscores the need to assess not only clinical outcomes but also economic implications. With rising health care expenses, cost-effectiveness has become a critical consideration in managing hemorrhoidal disease. Logically, recent studies have begun to investigate the cost-effectiveness of various surgical procedures. – However, despite these findings, direct health-economic comparisons of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids are limited. One retrospective study favored repeated banding over hemorrhoidectomy, estimating an average cost of $723 per patient, but it included a heterogeneous cohort and excluded key societal costs.

The HOLLAND trial highlighted important differences between these treatment strategies, showing lower quality-of-life scores and higher recurrence rates for RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy. Given the higher costs and longer recovery of hemorrhoidectomy, further economic evaluation is warranted. The present study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness (cost per recurrence avoided) and cost-utility (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) of RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids during a 2-year period from a societal perspective.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^974a38ca]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy (EH) indications, comparative effectiveness, and complications — 7. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy should typically be offered to select patients with external hemorrhoids or patients with symptomatic combined internal and external hemorrhoids (grades III–IV). Strength of recommendation: strong based on high-quality evidence. Surgical excision is an effective approach for patients who fail, cannot tolerate, or are not candidates for office-based procedures or who have concomitant external hemorrhoidal disease. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n = 1326), the closed approach versus open had decreased postoperative pain, faster wound healing, and decreased risk of postoperative bleeding, with similar postoperative complications, hemorrhoid recurrence, and infectious complications. Energy devices show mixed advantages: a meta-analysis of 5 studies (n = 318) found bipolar energy devices faster, with less postoperative pain and comparable complication rates to closed hemorrhoidectomy using electrocautery; a meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 468) found ultrasonic shears associated with earlier return to work, decreased postoperative pain, and fewer postoperative complications, but an RCT of 60 patients found similar postoperative pain scores and no differences in clinical outcomes versus electrocautery. Serious complications are rare; postprocedural hemorrhage occurs in 1%–2% in most large series, and acute urinary retention occurs in 1% to 15% and is the most common reason for delayed discharge; risk may be mitigated by decreasing intraoperative intravenous fluids to < 750 mL and using adequate analgesia. Long-term complications can include anal stricture and incontinence.

Quality of life, expressed in QALYs, was 1.90 (95% CI, 1.84–1.95) in the hemorrhoidectomy group and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.77–1.87) in the RBL group, with a difference of 0.08 QALYs (95% CI, 0.06–0.16; p = 0.034). The recurrence rate in the RBL group was 45.7% (95% CI, 31.2%–60.8%), compared to 12.1% (95% CI, 4.0–29.1%) in the hemorrhoidectomy group. This corresponds to an absolute risk difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3–51.7%; p = 0.002) in favor of the hemorrhoidectomy group. Further details on self-reported recurrence rates and additional treatments after the index procedure are presented in Table 4.

Recurrence rates

Incremental Cost-Utility and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses

From a societal perspective, over the 24-month time horizon of the trial, the hemorrhoidectomy strategy resulted in an increase of €1984 in costs, 0.08 more QALYs, and a 33.5% lower recurrence rate compared to the RBL strategy.

The point-estimated ICUR, representing the cost per QALY gained, was €24,042 (95% BCa CI, 2453–160,603) in the base-case scenario. Figure 1 presents the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the mean differences in QALYs based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The vast majority (97.2%) of these bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that the hemorrhoidectomy strategy is more effective but also more expensive than RBL.

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^c5be4e10]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhoids significantly impact quality of life and healthcare costs. While rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy are common treatments for grade III hemorrhoids, comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of rubber band ligation compared to hemorrhoidectomy from a societal perspective within the context of the HOLLAND trial.

Design

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using data from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

Settings

Ten Dutch hospitals participating in the HOLLAND trial.

Patients

Adults with symptomatic grade III hemorrhoids randomized to rubber band ligation or hemorrhoidectomy.

Interventions

Rubber band ligation (up to two sessions) or excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

Main Outcome Measures

Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and cost per recurrence avoided over 24 months from a societal perspective.

Results

Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (33 hemorrhoidectomy, 46 rubber band ligation). Hemorrhoidectomy resulted in better clinical outcomes with a QALY difference of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04–0.13) and a recurrence difference of 33.5% (95% CI, 15.3%-51.7%). Hospital costs were higher for hemorrhoidectomy (€1,364; 95% CI, 895–1,834; p < 0.001), as were societal costs (€1,984; 95% CI, -132-4,101; p = 0.066). The incremental cost-utility ratio for hemorrhoidectomy was €24,042 per QALY gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €5,918 per recurrence avoided. The probability of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective was 45.5% at €20,000/QALY and 83.9% at €50,000/QALY. For recurrence avoidance, probabilities were 98.3% and 99.8%, respectively.

Limitations

The small sample size may limit generalizability and the ability to detect rare but costly complications. Procedural costs were based on average hospital prices, which is a pragmatic approach, though less detailed than bottom-up costing.

Conclusions

In patients with grade III hemorrhoids, hemorrhoidectomy provides better long-term clinical outcomes, including higher quality of life and lower recurrence rates compared to rubber band ligation. However, its cost-effectiveness varies depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. Caution is warranted before discarding it as a first-line treatment based solely on healthcare costs or limited operating room availability. See Video Abstract. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT04621695.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^bb43317b]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Recurrence rates at 12 months were notably higher after RBL than after hemorrhoidectomy (48.8% vs 6.1%), with the RBL group showing worse outcomes in self-reported recurrence rates (24% vs 0%) and the need for further treatment (24% vs 3%). Consequently, hemorrhoidectomy appears more effective clinically. However, within our study design constraints, we can only assert that RBL is not noninferior.

We used the dichotomous self-reporting method developed by Shanmugam et al. – Because posttreatment physical examinations often fail to fully capture patient symptoms, self-reported outcomes add to a more comprehensive measure of treatment success. In the present study, 54% of RBL patients required further treatment, with 28% undergoing a second banding as permitted by protocol, reflecting the common practice of repeated RBL for grade III hemorrhoids. Among these patients, 42% reported recurrence at 12 months, highlighting that solely tracking reoperations is not sufficient. This is consistent with the Hubble trial, which reported a 49% recurrence rate for grade II–III hemorrhoids after 1 year. In addition, although self-reported recurrence might be influenced by the lack of blinding because patients who are aware of their less invasive treatment might be more inclined to report symptoms, our findings highlight the importance of including self-reported data alongside reoperations for a comprehensive long-time follow-up. The post hoc analysis in the Hubble trial further demonstrated that reclassification of repeated banding in the RBL group significantly reduced recurrence rates from 49% to 37.5%, underscoring the need to compare repeated RBL with hemorrhoidectomy.

Internal hemorrhoids — initial therapy — gastroenterologists and other providers should treat patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids first with increased fiber intake and adequate fluids (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). A Cochrane review demonstrated the benefit of increased fiber intake in reducing both prolapse and bleeding, and laxatives have a limited role in the initial treatment of hemorrhoids. Patients should be counseled to avoid straining and limit their time spent on the commode, because both are associated with higher rates of symptomatic hemorrhoids, and topical treatments for hemorrhoids, e.g., astringents and anti-inflammatories, are readily available over the counter and are commonly used by patients, but they are of unclear value.

### Haemorrhoidal artery ligation versus rubber band ligation for the management of symptomatic second-degree and third-degree haemorrhoids (hubBLe): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^94375292]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The number of participants with a recurrence at 12 months was 87 (49%) in the RBL group compared with 48 (30%) in the HAL group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·23, 95% CI 1·42–3·51, ICC = 0·000; p = 0·0005). The breakdown of recurrences, overall and by criteria is presented in table 2. The proportion of participants who reported recurrence was similar between groups, with 29% of respondents in both groups stating they believed symptoms from their haemorrhoids were unchanged or worse (aOR for self-reported recurrence 1·06, 0·60–1·85; p = 0·85). The increased recurrence associated with RBL was mainly attributable to the high rate of additional procedures undertaken following initial intervention (32%), compared with 14% in the HAL group by 1 year follow-up (aOR for further procedure 2·86, 1·65–4·93; p = 0·0002). A further three (2%) participants in the RBL group were considered to have symptoms consistent with recurrent haemorrhoids following review of medical contacts and procedures over the 12 month follow-up, which were undertaken blind to treatment group: in two cases the participants were recorded as possibly requiring further treatment at their 6-week visit but were subsequently lost to follow-up; a third had been admitted to hospital twice for excessive bleeding but had not undergone treatment.

Infrared coagulation (IRC) outcomes and comparisons — In 4 RCTs (n = 339), bleeding resolution with IRC was reported as 78% for grade I, 52% for grade II, and 22% for grade III hemorrhoids; postprocedure pain ranged 16% to 100% and postprocedure bleeding 15% to 44%. In an RCT of 133 patients, long-term (> 1 year) satisfaction was 80% with IRC versus 82% with rubber band ligation (RBL) (p = 0.39), while pain after treatment was more common and more severe after RBL (VAS 5.5 ± 3.7) than IRC (VAS 3.3 ± 3.3; p = 0.018). A meta-analysis of 9 RCTs found no significant difference between IRC and RBL for efficacy, postoperative prolapse, recurrence, or postoperative urine retention, but patients undergoing RBL had worse postoperative pain and less postoperative bleeding than patients undergoing IRC.

### Hemorrhoids [^084eefb4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed. Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners plus local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted. Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed in patients with grade 3 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, but has a higher recurrence rate. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a faster postoperative recovery, but a higher recurrence rate. Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be treated conservatively or excised.

### Haemorrhoids [^e5ac7f80]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Haemorrhoids are cushions of submucosal vascular tissue located in the anal canal starting just distal to the dentate line. Incidence is difficult to ascertain as many people with the condition will never consult with a medical practitioner, although one study found 10 million people in the USA complaining of the disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for haemorrhoidal disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: closed haemorrhoidectomy, haemorrhoidal artery ligation, infrared coagulation/photocoagulation, injection sclerotherapy, open excisional (Milligan-Morgan/diathermy) haemorrhoidectomy, radiofrequency ablation, rubber band ligation, and stapled haemorrhoidectomy.

External hemorrhoid thrombosis (EHT) urgent/emergent care — 6. Select patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids may benefit from early surgical excision. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. In a randomized series of 50 patients, hemorrhoid excision reduced pain versus topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.001) or thrombectomy (p < 0.01) on day 4, with no symptomatic difference at 1-month follow-up; at 1 year, recurrence was significantly lower after excision versus thrombectomy (p < 0.05) or topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.05). In a retrospective review, 48.5% were treated surgically and 97.3% of these underwent excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid or thrombectomy, while 51.5% received nonoperative care. Time to resolution of presenting symptoms was shorter with surgery (3.9 vs 24 days; p < 0.001). For nonoperative care in 504 consecutive EHT patients, the median time to symptom improvement was 5 days (range, 1–23 days) and to complete resolution was 8 days (range, 1–45 days).

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^c1ee25b8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, pain, itching, soiling, and prolapse, which can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). In the Netherlands, its prevalence is 13.4 per 1000 patients. The Goligher classification system categorizes hemorrhoids by the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and guides treatment strategies.

Grade III hemorrhoids represent a particularly complex management scenario due to inconclusive guidelines regarding optimal treatment strategy. Although hemorrhoidectomy is traditionally considered the criterion standard, rubber band ligation (RBL) offers a simpler, less invasive outpatient alternative with fewer complications and lower patient burden. However, RBL has a recurrence rate of up to 50%, potentially requiring repeat procedures. Although hemorrhoidectomy generally has lower recurrence rates, it is associated with more postoperative discomfort and a longer recovery period.

A consensus on the best treatment strategy for grade III hemorrhoids is lacking, leading to variability in clinical practice. – In 2016, 2 large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared stapled hemorrhoidopexy with hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidal artery ligation with RBL. However, a direct comparison of RBL with hemorrhoidectomy is still missing. The present study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy in grade III hemorrhoids, focusing on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rates, and incorporating patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) to determine patient preferences.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^fa19823a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe anal pain is the most common symptom associated with acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids; internal anal sphincter hypertonicity is both deriving from and causing this excruciating pain. Furthermore, the spasm of anal sphincter worsens the congestion of the prolapsed piles. For these reasons, the use of muscle relaxant, like topical nitrates and calcium channels antagonists, has been proposed for the treatment of thrombosed hemorrhoids. The role of calcium antagonists was studied in 2001 in a prospective randomized study by Perrotti et al. that enrolled 98 patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids: the study group (50 patients) received topical 0.3% nifedipine and 1.5% lidocaine ointment every 12 h for 2 weeks, while the control group (48 patients) received only topical 1.5% lidocaine ointment. The authors found a sharp increase in resolution rate of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids after 14 days of therapy with topical Nifedipine (92% resolution rate in the study group as opposed to 45.8% in the control group), without observing any systemic side effect. The small number of enrolled patients obviously limits the power of this study, but the results are encouraging. The effects of topical nitrates were analyzed in another prospective study and showed good results, but these drugs are burdened by a high incidence of headache that may limit their use.

The role of topical anti-thrombotic is not yet clear. Only one study focused specifically on the use of topical anti-thrombotic therapy for acute hemorrhoids and heparin treatment was found to significantly improve healing and resolution of acute hemorrhoids. However, the small number of patients included in this study does not consent to make any recommendation regarding the role of this drugs in the treatment of complicated hemorrhoids.

Steroid cream should be applied for no more than 7 days, and a long-term use should be avoided because of potential thinning of perianal and anal mucosa and increasing risk of injury. There are no scientific data evaluating either NSAIDS, cortisone, and its derivates or injection of local anesthetics for the treatment of complicated hemorrhoids.

Injection sclerotherapy for hemorrhoids — Injection sclerotherapy consists of local infiltration of sclerosing agents leading to inflammation and fibrosis with scarring and fixation of mucosa to submucosa, and a 5% phenol solution in almond or vegetable oil is the most commonly used sclerosant. A 2017 systematic review of 5 RCTs (n = 412) described resolution of bleeding in 69% to 88% of patients with grade I hemorrhoids and resolution of grade II hemorrhoidal prolapse in 90% to 100% of patients, with postprocedure pain 24% to 49% and bleeding 0.9% to 6%; recurrence of bleeding 1.5% to 29% and recurrent prolapse 16%. In a recent nonblinded, single-center, RCT (n = 120) evaluating polidocanol foam sclerotherapy (PFS) versus RBL, therapeutic success was equivalent (93.3% PFS vs 85% RBL; p = 0.14), recurrence rates were significantly lower with PFS (16.1% vs 41.2%; p = 0.004), and complications were more frequent with RBL (30% RBL vs 10% PFS; p = 0.01). A prospective single-center study of 2000 patients receiving PFS reported 98% resolution of symptoms at a 4-week follow-up; 10.5% were taking anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of sclerosis, of whom 2 had clinically significant bleeding, and 0.5% had postprocedure complications requiring surgery from thrombosis (0.4%) and perianal abscess (0.1%). A multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase III trial involving 10 tertiary referral centers, including 183 patients, reported a 1-year success rate of overall improvement of symptoms with PFS of 95.6%.

Hemorrhoidal disease evaluation — initial assessment and colonoscopy indications: Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital rectal examination should be performed to rule out other anorectal pathology and evaluate the sphincter tone; anoscopy can be considered to assess the hemorrhoidal anatomy and rule out other pathology of the anal canal. Rectal bleeding should not automatically be attributed to hemorrhoids and, although hemorrhoidal disease is the most common reason for hematochezia, other colorectal disease processes can also result in blood per rectum; rectal bleeding attributed to hemorrhoids represents the most often missed opportunity to establish a cancer diagnosis. Complete endoscopic evaluation of the colon is indicated in select patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding (Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence), and patients should undergo a colonoscopy when no obvious source of anorectal bleeding is observed or when abdominal pain, distention, new onset constipation, or progressive constipation are present at initial evaluation; patients who continue to experience hematochezia after otherwise successful hemorrhoid treatment should undergo further investigation, and those due for colorectal cancer screening should be counseled appropriately.

### Wrist-ankle acupuncture relieves postoperative pain after milligan-morgan hemorrhoidectomy for mixed hemorrhoids: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^d42e6c25]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mixed hemorrhoids, which involve both internal and external components, are a common clinical condition resulting from degeneration of anal cushion tissues, vascular hyperplasia, varicose veins, and other factors. This term is commonly used in Chinese clinical practice to describe such combined presentations. Key symptoms include bleeding, pain, and anal discomfort, which often recur and significantly impair patients' quality of life. Hemorrhoidal disease is the most common anorectal disease, with a prevalence of about 4.4% in the general population, peaking in individuals aged 45–65 years. Surgical intervention, particularly the Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy, is typically considered when conservative treatments fail. Although various pain management protocols have been developed and proven effective, postoperative pain remains the most common complication. This persistence of pain may be partly due to the inherent limitations and adverse effects of conventional analgesics, such as opioids and NSAIDs, which can cause nausea, drowsiness, gastrointestinal irritation, and, in some cases, drug dependence. Studies indicate that 65% of patients experience moderate to severe pain after surgery for hemorrhoidal disease. Postoperative pain may also lead to complications such as urinary retention, constipation, prolonged hospitalization, and increased medical costs. In severe cases, it may even trigger cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, significantly worsening postoperative recovery.

Wrist-ankle acupuncture, a characteristic therapy of traditional Chinese medicine, alleviates pain through subcutaneous superficial stimulation of specific acupoints around the ankle based on the theory of the Three Yin and Three Yang meridians. To further investigate the efficacy of wrist-ankle acupuncture in improving postoperative pain in patients with mixed hemorrhoids undergoing Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy, our research team applied this technique postoperatively. Results demonstrated that wrist-ankle acupuncture significantly reduced postoperative pain, decreased the usage of PCIA, minimized the need for rescue analgesics, and exhibited notable therapeutic benefits with a high safety profile.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^b82dc8c2]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The problem of redundant and overlapping guidelines is similar to that observed in systematic reviews, where variable methodological quality and coverage result in different estimates of effect sizes for the same question. There is often overlap between the scopes of different systematic reviews, without them being coterminous, because some cover broad and other narrow topic areas. In our review even guidelines that were restricted to surgery had different patterns of attention, while other guidelines also covered alternative management strategies. In systematic reviews there are legitimate reasons for overlapping reviews, including differences in purpose, emergence of new evidence, concern about the robustness of previous work and differences in methodological standards. A broader scope does not necessarily equate to quality, because simple clinical guidelines can be more effective than complex guidelines. Like systematic review authors, guideline committees should acknowledge the existence of previous or ongoing work and justify the need for new guidance. Whilst guidelines have the potential to underpin safe practice and provide safeguards for both patients and clinicians, expert and consensus approaches can go beyond high quality evidence, sometimes resulting in inappropriate recommendations. However, evidence‐based medicine demands 'the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values' while basing recommendations on small‐scale or poorly designed trials without the application of expertise and patient values, leading to poor policy.

We hope that journal editors will carefully consider the need for publication of guidelines when adequate guidelines may already exist, and will ensure the guidelines that they publish follow the most rigorous standards available. Professional bodies and journal editors should consider mandatory registration of guidelines using facilities such as the Guidelines International Network library to avoid unnecessary duplication. For 'end users' we urge consideration of available high quality haemorrhoid guidance in preference to mainly national guidelines that do not meet current standards, taking into account availability and affordability in different healthcare systems. Finally given the difficulties in selection of 'expert' panels we encourage further quality research in haemorrhoids to reduce the reliance on 'expert' opinion, allowing more consistent recommendations.

Hemorrhoids — surgical referral criteria and options — gastroenterologists and other providers should refer for surgical operations (hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation) those patients who are refractory to or cannot tolerate office procedures, who have large, symptomatic external tags along with their hemorrhoids, who have large third-degree hemorrhoids, or who have fourth-degree hemorrhoids (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains very effective, stapled hemorrhoidopexy shows slightly lower complication rates but higher long-term recurrence rates compared with standard hemorrhoidectomy and is an established alternative in most cases, and for Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation success rates are comparable to hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy although comparative studies are lacking.

DISCUSSION

This study provides a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and CUA of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids using data from the HOLLAND trial. Although RBL has lower upfront costs (cost savings of €1984 per patient), hemorrhoidectomy offers superior clinical outcomes, and it appears to be the more cost-effective option, with probabilities ranging from 45.5% to 83.9% depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. At these thresholds, the likelihood of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective for recurrence avoidance is close to 100%. These findings underscore the need to balance cost savings against clinical outcomes when considering treatment strategies.

This study is the first prospective cost-effectiveness comparison of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy. Previous studies focused on other treatments, used retrospective designs, or lacked clinical applicability, contributing to the ongoing ambiguity in guidelines. The robust design of this trial, with high patient involvement and response rates, provides valuable insights to guide clinical decisions.

With a growing and aging population, rising health care costs demand attention to both clinical and economic outcomes. Previous literature has reported varying cost-effectiveness results for hemorrhoid treatments. The Hubble trial demonstrated that hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) was not cost-effective compared to RBL, whereas the eTHoS trial favored hemorrhoidectomy over stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Other studies showed that Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation is less effective and more costly than stapled hemorrhoidopexy. However, other research found insufficient evidence to recommend stapled hemorrhoidopexy over RBL, highlighting the ongoing debate about the optimal treatment approach.

These findings are relevant in light of recent policy shifts aimed at reducing hemorrhoidectomy reimbursements to allocate operating room resources for other surgical priorities. For instance, the UK National Health Service limits hemorrhoidectomy access to cut costs, favoring outpatient treatments such as RBL. Although such policies promote cost-saving measures, our findings suggest that the superior clinical outcomes of hemorrhoidectomy should be carefully considered before RBL is adopted as the first-line treatment for grade III hemorrhoids. The potential long-term costs of higher recurrence rates and additional surgeries after RBL, together with the impact on quality of life, must be weighed against the immediate savings.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive methods assessed data quality and homogeneity. Continuous data were presented as mean or median values and categorical data were presented as percentage proportions. A 2-sided p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Primary analyses were conducted in both the intention-to-treat and as-treated populations. The intention-to-treat population included all randomly assigned patients who underwent the intervention and were followed for at least 12 months, excluding those who did not receive any treatment or were lost to follow-up. The as-treated population comprised patients analyzed on the basis of the actual treatment received, including those who crossed over from RBL to hemorrhoidectomy or vice versa. Missing HR-QoL data from the 8 questionnaires over the 2-year period were imputed using predictive mean matching.

For the primary end points, analyses were conducted with a 1-sided alpha value of 0.025. Noninferiority of RBL compared to hemorrhoidectomy was assessed on the basis of QALY difference and recurrence rate. Linear regression with the center as a fixed effect was used to determine noninferiority for HR-QoL, defined as the lower bound of the 95% CI beginning above the –0.05 QALY difference in both the intention-to-treat and as-treated analysis. For recurrence rate, the noninferiority at 12 months postprocedure was assessed against a predefined boundary of a 10% increase of recurrence in the RBL group. Additional comparisons included specific recurrence metrics: further treatments within 12 months and self-reported recurrence up to 24 months.

Secondary outcomes were analyzed using 2-sided t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous data and relative risk ratios with 95% CIs for binary data, applying a 2-sided alpha value of 0.05. A random intercept linear regression model analyzed repeated measures from various questionnaires, including received treatment and center as fixed effects. For secondary outcomes, no additional imputation techniques were applied, so only the available data are presented.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^fa6b1cdb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Dutch guidelines for grade III hemorrhoids include shared decision-making, presenting hemorrhoidectomy or initial RBL as options, and recommending surgery if symptoms persist after 4 RBL sessions. In our study, only 1 patient exceeded this threshold, opting out of surgery.

In the hemorrhoidectomy group, 1 patient required a second Ligasure procedure, which successfully resolved symptoms. No differences in outcomes were observed between open and closed excisional techniques. Self-reported recurrence rates in this study were lower than those reported in the eTHoS trial (0% vs 14% at 12 months and 6.7% vs 25% at 24 months), likely due to our focus on grade III hemorrhoids. Conversely, recurrence rates were higher than those reported in our previous meta-analysis (31% for RBL vs 6% for hemorrhoidectomy). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were of poor quality, particularly in their definitions of recurrence and follow-up periods.

The skewed treatment allocation (47 vs 40) resulted from stratification by the center with permuted blocks of random sizes, but baseline characteristics remained comparable. Notably, 42% of patients met the Rome IV criteria for functional constipation, emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying bowel issues when planning hemorrhoid treatment. The shorter waiting time of the RBL for intervention may provide an advantage in quickly managing severe symptoms. However, the median waiting time for surgery in our study (50 days; IQR, 27–88) was still shorter than reported in other studies.

Both groups experienced minimal complications, indicating that RBL and hemorrhoidectomy are safe treatment options for grade III hemorrhoids. Our findings align with those of previous trials, showing a slight reduction in mean Vaizey scores after both interventions, probably attributed to prolapse correction.

Discussion

Recurrence 12 months after HAL was significantly lower than after RBL. Haemorrhoidal disease is a benign condition with treatment primarily aimed at addressing symptoms. In the absence of a validated symptom scoring system, we felt the most important determinant of treatment success was patient-reported outcome of improvement and the need to avoid additional procedures. Where patients had undergone further intervention for haemorrhoids, they were considered to have recurred. Based on this premise, HAL appears superior. This apparent superiority should be put in practical context. 18% of the participants in the RBL group underwent repeat banding. This is common practice and patients might find this re-banding a more palatable option than having an operation if it has the same potential for improvement. Indeed some clinicians deem RBL as a course of treatment. Including these patients as a success (if they reported improvement at 12 months) resulted in a reduction in recurrence and no statistical difference between the groups.

The choice of patient-defined recurrence as our primary outcome was supported by a robust patient and public involvement exercise carried out during trial design. Clinical experience indicates that the physical appearance of the anal cushions post-treatment correlates poorly with patients' symptoms, meaning anorectal visualisation is not a reliable surrogate of success. We therefore asked participants a question, 12 months after intervention, based on a simple, dichotomised definition of recurrence as described by Shanmugam and colleagues. This definition is not universal — indeed no standardised definition of recurrence exists. This is the most obvious explanation for our recurrence rates following HAL, higher than those reported in systematic reviews (11–17·5%). Some previous studies have relied on clinical examination and patient-reported symptoms, others solely on symptomatology. When considering symptoms only, some investigators consider a patient recurrence-free if they have no perianal symptoms at all; others simply an improvement. An example of variation dependent on this definition is provided by one study reporting a recurrence rate of 60%, 30 months after a HAL procedure, yet 86% of patients simultaneously described a significant improvement in symptoms. Other factors that influence recurrence include duration of follow-up. We chose to assess recurrence at 12 months because published data suggest most recurrences occur in less than 1 year. However, our data indicate that persistent symptoms were lower for both groups at 6 weeks (HAL 9% vs RBL 29%) with major deterioration over the year and it is not clear if or when this deterioration plateaus.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes included 12-month HR-QoL and recurrence rate:

HR-QoL: the study evaluated the difference in quality-adjusted life years between the randomized groups, derived from the HR-QoL scores measured during a 12-month posttreatment period. HR-QoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, utilizing Dutch wording and population norms (range, –0.446 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating optimal health). The primary analysis period was adjusted to 12 months due to early termination.
Recurrence rate: recurrence was determined by self-reported symptoms and subsequent procedures within 12 months, excluding repeat RBL sessions. Self-reported symptoms were assessed using a dichotomous question following established methods.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included symptom severity (PROM-HISS score 0–5; HSS score 0–15; proctoPROM score 0–50, with 0 being optimum); pain intensity (VAS score 0–10); analgesic use; time to resume work; complications; incontinence (Vaizey score 0–24, with 0 being optimum), persistent symptoms at 6 weeks; need for further treatment; and health-state utility score (EQ-5D-5L). The timing of various assessments is outlined in Supplemental Table 2 at.

Sample Size

The sample size calculation was based on the noninferiority design for HR-QoL. It was hypothesized that both treatment groups would exhibit equal quality-adjusted life years. With a 1-sided alpha value of 0.025, power of 80%, SD of 0.15, and noninferiority limit of 0.05, a total of 142 patients were required per group. To accommodate for stratification by center, this number was increased to 162 patients per group. The surgical procedure was standardized; therefore, a low variability between centers was expected and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 was estimated. The total sample size was 360 patients to adjust for a 10% loss to follow-up. However, 87 patients (24%) were enrolled because of early trial termination.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^350968e7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial postoperative pain scores indicate that RBL provides better pain control, reduced analgesic use, and faster recovery compared to hemorrhoidectomy, with patients returning to work much sooner (1 vs 9 days). For those prioritizing a quicker return to normal activities, RBL may be the preferred option, though this must be weighed against its higher recurrence rates.

Although the hemorrhoidectomy group consistently exhibited better symptom scores during follow-up, the differences were not clinically significant. The average PROM-HISS difference was 0.247, below the minimally relevant difference threshold of 0.3. However, long-term treatment effects favor hemorrhoidectomy, with differences slightly exceeding the threshold. HSS scores were 1.1 units lower for the hemorrhoidectomy group, but the minimally relevant difference is not clearly defined. Similarly, a 2-point difference at long-term follow-up was observed, but its clinical relevance remains uncertain. ProctoPROM analysis revealed clinically relevant effects for both treatments, with small differences between groups increasing at 12 to 24 months follow-up. Overall, although hemorrhoidectomy may offer some long-term benefits, the clinical significance of these differences is unclear.

The main limitation of the study was its premature termination due to funding constraints, leading to a smaller sample size and reduced statistical power. This was largely a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on benign proctologic care in the Netherlands, causing a shortage of eligible patients. In addition, patient preference delayed enrollment, with 72% of 303 eligible patients excluded, undermining validity and generalizability of the trial. Many patients were unwilling to undergo surgery as primary treatment, whereas others preferred surgery due to prior RBL failure. Furthermore, the possibility of immediate RBL treatment during initial consultations in Dutch hospitals contributed to the high exclusion rate.

These challenges suggest RCTs may be unsuitable for comparing invasive versus minimally invasive treatments. Considering patient preferences in study designs is crucial because these preferences can lead to reduced recruitment rates and randomization bias, thus compromising the validity of the study. Future studies should explore alternative trial designs, such as partially randomized patient preference trials and other innovative approaches beyond traditional RCTs to overcome recruitment challenges and improve study validity.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^5cfde8be]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Before randomization, all patients received conservative treatments, including dietary counseling, stool hygiene, toilet habits, fiber supplementation, and local therapies such as vasoconstrictors, prescribed at the surgeon's discretion per the pragmatic study design.

Rubber band ligation

The details of the RBL procedure are outlined in the study protocol. In brief, up to 2 RBL sessions were permitted if symptoms persisted after the initial procedure, allowing flexibility in addressing ongoing symptoms, consistent with standard clinical practice. Given that RBL treatment often entails repeated sessions for grade III hemorrhoids, this study hypothesized that repeated RBL (up to 2 sessions) would be noninferior to hemorrhoidectomy regarding HR-QoL and recurrence rates while being more cost-effective.

Hemorrhoidectomy

Hemorrhoidectomy was performed using either the open techniqueor the closed technique, both of which are aimed at excising hemorrhoidal cushions using electrocautery. A more detailed description of both techniques can be found in the published study protocol.

Data Collection

Clinical data were collected at baseline, intervention, and 6-week follow-up, with some assessments conducted by phone due to COVID-19. Data included demographics, medical history, Rome IV criteria for chronic constipation, pelvic floor physiotherapy, symptom duration, and previous treatments. Procedural data covered intervention details and complications. The postoperative period covered the first 90 days after treatment, recording complications such as bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion, urinary retention, wound discharge, anal fissure, anal fistula, emergency surgery, anal stenosis, fecal incontinence, or death. Data on discharge, readmissions, and further treatments were also collected.

Subsequent data collection through questionnaires occurred at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months posttreatment. Assessments included the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) score, self-reported recurrence, pain (visual analog scale [VAS]), analgesic use, return to work, and various PROMs: PROM–hemorrhoidal impact and satisfaction score (PROM-HISS), Hemorrhoid Severity Score (HSS), Vaizey incontinence score, and proctoPROM. These PROMs provided comprehensive evaluations of patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness.

### Rectal artery embolization for hemorrhoidal disease: anatomy, evaluation, and treatment techniques [^8a6c5158]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition that leads to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia, which affects millions of people worldwide and is a significant medical and socioeconomic issue. Rectal bleeding is one of the main chronic symptoms. Recurrent rectal bleeding can alter an individual's quality of life and, more rarely, cause anemia. Pain is less common, occurring only in the event of complications such as congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, or fissures. The most standard treatment involves dietary and hygiene measures, use of phlebotonic drugs, and nonsurgical treatment such as infrared photocoagulation or elastic band ligation. Excisional treatments such as hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidopexy are the reference standards for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease. Embolization of the rectal arteries (ie, emborrhoid) has recently emerged as an effective treatment option, with few reported adverse effects, minimal blood loss, and a same-day hospital procedure. Hemorrhoid embolization is performed by using femoral or radial access. The inferior mesenteric artery and then the superior rectal arteries are catheterized with a microcatheter. Embolization can be performed by using different agents. Studies have shown improvement in symptoms and high technical success rates after treatment. The basic principles of hemorrhoid embolization that must be understood to achieve effective treatment, including those related to patient evaluation, the arterial anatomy, basic embolization, and published results, are reviewed. An invited commentary by Thompson and Kelley is available online. © RSNA, 2022.

### Minimal open hemorrhoidectomy versus transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization: the effect on symptoms: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^5c7c77f1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence on the long-term efficacy of transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization compared with hemorrhoidectomy. Most studies investigated short-term effects with postoperative pain as the primary outcome. Being a benign disease, the long-term goal of treatment for hemorrhoids is the resolution of symptoms and improvement of quality of life.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of minimal open hemorrhoidectomy versus transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization on patient-reported symptoms.

Design

This was an open-label randomized controlled trial.

Settings

This was a single-center study.

Patients

Patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade II to IV (Goligher's classification) were included.

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to minimal open hemorrhoidectomy or transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was symptoms assessed by the Hemorrhoidal Disease Symptom Score 1 year postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, postoperative pain and recovery, adverse events, recurrence, and hospital costs.

Results

Forty-eight patients received minimal open hemorrhoidectomy, and 50 patients received transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization. No difference in symptom score at 1-year follow-up was found. Median (range) symptom score was 3 (0–17) after minimal open hemorrhoidectomy and 5 (0–17) after transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (median difference = -1.0 (95% CI, -3.0 to 0.0); p = 0.15). Residual hemorrhoidal prolapse was reported more frequently (p = 0.008), and more patients had treatment for recurrence after transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (7 vs 0 patients; p = 0.013). Patient satisfaction was higher after minimal open hemorrhoidectomy (p = 0.049). No differences were found in the impact on health-related quality of life, average and peak postoperative pain, recovery, or adverse events (p > 0.05). Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization was more expensive (median difference = &OV0556;555 (95% CI, &OV0556;472-&OV0556;693); p < 0.001).

Limitations

No blinding was included in this study.

Conclusion

No difference was found in symptom score 1 year postoperatively. Minimal open hemorrhoidectomy had a better effect on the hemorrhoidal prolapse and higher patient satisfaction. More patients needed treatment for recurrence after transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization. Minimal open hemorrhoidectomy has an immediate postoperative course similar to transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B152.

Hemorrhoid surgery comparison (stapled hemorrhoidopexy [SH] vs excisional hemorrhoidectomy [EH]) — Compared outcome data show SH had more additional operative procedures than EH (8 studies, 553 patients; OR 2.75; 95% CI, 1.31–5.77), EH patients were more likely to be asymptomatic at follow-up (12 trials, 1097 patients; OR 0.59; CI, 0.40–0.88), and recurrence was more common after SH than after excisional operations (OR 2.62; 95% CI, 1.83–3.75). In SH series, 86 patients with a 10-year follow-up had 39% recurrent hemorrhoidal prolapse and 8% gas leakage, and another series of 194 patients reported recurrence of 41% at 12 years with an overall impaired continence rate of 39% and patient satisfaction in 81% of cases.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^2883b675]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Rubber band ligation (RBL) for hemorrhoids — In a 2005 Cochrane review of 3 RCTs (n = 202), surgical hemorrhoidectomy was associated with increased pain (RR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.62–2.33) and complications (RR 6.32; 95% CI, 1.15–34.89) compared with RBL. A meta-analysis found RBL significantly better than sclerotherapy for treatment response and no different in complication rates (p = 0.35); patients treated with sclerotherapy (p = 0.031) or infrared coagulation (IRC; p = 0.0014) were more likely to require further therapy than those treated with RBL, although pain was greater after RBL (p = 0.03 vs sclerotherapy; p < 0.0001 vs IRC). In a single-center retrospective study of 2635 patients, 86.7% were asymptomatic at their 8- week follow-up visit; 22.5% had complications (16.1% pain; 2.8% mild to significant bleeding), and at 2-year follow-up 15.5% reported symptomatic recurrence with repeat RBL in 66.9% or surgical hemorrhoidectomy in 33.1%. Severe bleeding is noted as a rare (~1%) major complication. For patients on antithrombotic therapy, a 2017 systematic review suggested increased risk of massive bleeding, whereas a retrospective case-control cohort of 82 patients undergoing 153 bandings on clopidogrel found no significant difference in bleeding events (3.7% vs 2.7%; p = 0.73). The risk of bleeding should be weighed against thrombotic risk, and clinicians should consider, when possible, pausing antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy; in selected patients on anticoagulant, alternative treatment such as injection sclerotherapy can be considered.

### Stapled versus conventional surgery for hemorrhoids [^e8ae3200]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan‐Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique used for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current "gold standard". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described by Longo in 1998 as alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Early, small randomized‐controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery have shown it to be less painful and that it is associated with quicker recovery. The reports also suggest a better patient acceptance and a higher compliance with day‐case procedures potentially making it more economical. A previous Cochrane Review of stapled hemorrhoidopexy and conventional excisional surgery has shown that the stapled technique is associated with a higher risk of recurrent hemorrhoids and some symptoms in long term follow‐up. Since this initial review, several more randomized controlled trials have been published that may shed more light on the differences between the novel stapled approach and conventional excisional techniques.

Objectives

This review compares the use of circular stapling devices and conventional excisional techniques in the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids. Its goal is to ascertain whether there is any difference in the outcomes of the two techniques in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

Search Strategy

We searched all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1998 to December 2009.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional excisional hemorrhoidal surgeries with a minimum follow‐up period of 6 months were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on a data sheet. When appropriate, an Odds Ratio was generated using a random effects model.

Main Results

Patients with SH were significantly more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids in long term follow up at all time points than those with CH (12 trials, 955 patients, OR 3.22, CI 1.59‐6.51, p = 0.001). There were 37 recurrences out of 479 patients in the stapled group versus only 9 out of 476 patients in the conventional group. Similarly, in trials where there was follow up of one year or more, SH was associated with a greater proportion of patients with hemorrhoid recurrence (5 trials, 417 patients, OR 3.60, CI 1.24‐10.49, p = 0.02). Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients with SH complained of the symptom of prolapse at all time points (13 studies, 1191 patients, OR 2.65, CI 1.45‐4.85, p = 0.002). In studies with follow up of greater than one year, the same significant outcome was found (7 studies, 668 patients, OR 3.14, CI 1.20‐8.22, p = 0.02). Patients undergoing SH were more likely to require an additional operative procedure compared to those who underwent CH (8 papers, 553 patients, OR 2.75, CI 1.31‐5.77, p = 0.008). When all symptoms were considered, patients undergoing CH surgery were more likely to be asymptomatic (12 trials, 1097 patients, OR 0.59, CI 0.40‐0.88). Non significant trends in favor of SH were seen in pain, pruritis ani, and fecal urgency. All other clinical parameters showed trends favoring CH.

### Management of hemorrhoids and anal fissures [^16b525ba]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoids and anal fissures are two of the most common benign anorectal diseases. Despite their high prevalence, diagnostic accuracy of benign anorectal disease is suboptimal at 70% for surgeons, especially for hemorrhoidal diseases. Once the diagnosis is correctly made, numerous medical and surgical treatment options are available, each with different rates of success and complications. In this article, the authors review each step of patient management, with emphasis on evidence-based treatment options for hemorrhoids and anal fissures. The article discusses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, medical management, and procedures for hemorrhoids followed by a detailed overview on the management of anal fissures.

### Systematic review on the procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) [^84977713]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) has been introduced as an alternative to conventional hemorrhoidectomy. This is a systematic review on stapled hemorrhoidopexy of all randomized, controlled trials that have been published until August 2006.

Methods

All published, randomized, controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional hemorrhoidectomy were identified from Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and all Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, Cochrane Database of Systemic Review, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) between January 1991 and August 2006. Meta-analysis was performed by using the Forest plot review if feasible.

Results

A total of 25 randomized, controlled trials with 1,918 procedures were reviewed. The follow-up duration was from 1 to 62 months. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was associated with less operating time (weighted mean difference, -11.35 minutes; P = 0.006), earlier return of bowel function (weighted mean difference -9.91 hours; P < 0.00001), and shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -1.07 days; P = 0.0004). There was less pain after stapled hemorrhoidopexy, as evidenced by lower pain scores at rest and on defecation and 37.6 percent reduction in analgesic requirement. The stapled hemorrhoidopexy allowed a faster functional recovery with shorter time off work (weighted mean difference, -8.45 days; P < 0.00001), earlier return to normal activities (weighted mean difference, -15.85 days; P = 0.03), and better wound healing (odds ratio, 0.1; P = 0.0006). The patients' satisfaction was significantly higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy than conventional hemorrhoidectomy (odds ratio, 2.33; P = 0.003). Although there was increase in the recurrence of hemorrhoids at one year or more after stapled procedure (5.7 vs. 1 percent; odds ratio, 3.48; P = 0.02), the overall incidence of recurrent hemorrhoidal symptoms — early (fewer than 6 months; stapled vs. conventional: 24.8 vs. 31.7 percent; P = 0.08) or late (1 year or more) recurrence rate (stapled vs. conventional: 25.3 vs. 18.7 percent; P = 0.07) — was similar. The overall complication rate did not differ significantly from that of conventional procedure (stapled vs. conventional: 20.2 vs. 25.2 percent; P = 0.06). Compared with conventional surgery, stapled hemorrhoidopexy has less postoperative bleeding (odds ratio, 0.52; P = 0.001), wound complication (odds ratio, 0.05; P = 0.005), constipation (odds ratio, 0.45; P = 0.02), and pruritus (odds ratio, 0.19; P = 0.02). The overall need of surgical (odds ratio, 1.27; P = 0.4) and nonsurgical (odds ratio, 1.07; P = 0.82) reintervention after the two procedures was similar.

Conclusions

The Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoid (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) is safe with many short-term benefits. The long-term results are similar to conventional procedure.
