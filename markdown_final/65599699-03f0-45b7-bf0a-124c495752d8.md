## Question

what does leukocyte and blood in urine signify

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what leukocytes and blood in urine mean and how to interpret these findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and thresholds for leukocytes (pyuria) and hematuria. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of pyuria across populations, including children, older adults, and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Next, I will examine the differential diagnosis for hematuria and how to distinguish glomerular from non-glomerular sources. After that, I need to integrate both findings when they coexist and outline immediate next steps in testing and stewardship. Finally, I should consider special populations and summarize a practical, risk-stratified approach to evaluation and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misinterpret the findings. Pyuria is the presence of an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in urine. In children, significant pyuria is typically defined as at least 5 white blood cells per high-power field on microscopy of centrifuged urine or at least 10 WBCs per mm³ in uncentrifuged urine, whereas in adults, microscopic hematuria is defined as 3 or more red blood cells per high-power field on a properly collected specimen, and dipstick positivity for blood should always be confirmed microscopically before labeling hematuria [^111qMvi2] [^114yLxJ6].

> Now, I will examine the clinical significance of pyuria. Pyuria reflects a urinary tract inflammatory response and increases the likelihood of a true UTI, but it is not specific; it can also occur with contamination, vaginal or cervical inflammation, fever from nonurinary sources, or sterile inflammatory conditions, and importantly, more than 90% of older women with asymptomatic bacteriuria have pyuria, which makes pyuria alone a poor discriminator in that group [^112KNEot] [^111KXDxU] [^114UFNqx]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic performance: in children, leukocyte esterase or nitrite positivity has moderate sensitivity and specificity, and the absence of pyuria markedly lowers the probability of UTI, whereas in older adults, pyuria thresholds derived from younger populations overcall UTI and lead to overtreatment; in fact, raising the pyuria threshold to around 264–300 leukocytes/µL improves specificity without sacrificing too much sensitivity in older women [^115edraS] [^114UFNqx] [^1145uCfe].

> Next, I should review hematuria. Wait, let me verify the categories: hematuria can be gross (visible) or microscopic (≥ 3 RBCs/hpf), and dipstick blood must be confirmed microscopically because myoglobin, hemoglobin, and oxidizing agents can cause false positives. Once confirmed, I need to consider glomerular versus non-glomerular sources, with dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes, and RBC casts pointing toward glomerular disease, while uniform RBCs suggest lower tract bleeding [^112UvnFL] [^1138LVGd] [^115fzLcz]. I should double-check the differential: causes include infection, stones, malignancy, trauma, and glomerular disease, and in children, evaluation should be tailored to the clinical scenario with ultrasound often first-line imaging when indicated [^114bDi9D] [^113VR3kr].

> Let me consider the coexistence of leukocytes and blood in the same specimen. I need to ensure I don't jump to conclusions: combined pyuria and hematuria most commonly reflects infectious cystitis or pyelonephritis, but it can also signal more serious pathology such as stones, malignancy, or glomerulonephritis; in febrile infants, the quantity of pyuria correlates with the likelihood of true UTI and even with the risk of concomitant bacteremia, so higher WBC counts strengthen the case for treatment while low counts reduce the probability of invasive disease [^115UnMZX] [^113gnUQe] [^112h6cmC]. But wait, what if the patient is an older adult with minimal symptoms? In that case, combined pyuria and hematuria may still reflect asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a clinically significant UTI, so I should integrate symptoms and consider higher pyuria thresholds before treating [^114UFNqx] [^111KXDxU].

> I should confirm the immediate next steps when both are present. First, verify the urinalysis with microscopy to confirm true pyuria and hematuria and to look for casts, dysmorphic RBCs, and bacteria. Second, obtain a urine culture from a properly collected specimen, ideally by catheterization in infants and young children or midstream clean-catch in older children and adults. Third, assess renal function and consider imaging if obstruction, stones, or structural disease is suspected. Finally, avoid reflexively treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures, and tailor therapy to culture results and clinical context [^112KNEot] [^111qMvi2] [^113jyM3S]. Hold on, I should verify stewardship data: WBC count on microscopy has among the best diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens, and stricter reflex thresholds can reduce unnecessary cultures without missing clinically important infections when combined with careful clinical assessment [^116hszcZ] [^115Dno19].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In infants 8–21 days old with fever, I need a catheterized or suprapubic specimen for urinalysis and culture because bagged specimens have high contamination and poor positive predictive value. In older women, I should apply higher pyuria thresholds and avoid overcalling UTI. In patients with indwelling catheters, pyuria is expected and should not trigger treatment in the absence of systemic signs. And in pregnancy, even asymptomatic bacteriuria warrants treatment due to risks of pyelonephritis and preterm birth, so I should maintain a lower threshold for evaluation and treatment [^116fQ3mA] [^114UFNqx] [^112KNEot]. I need to ensure I also account for urine concentration effects: while specific gravity can modestly influence test performance, clinical decision-making is generally robust to these differences, so I should not overcorrect for dilute or concentrated urine when interpreting pyuria or hematuria [^116hGe7J].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If both leukocytes and blood are present with compatible symptoms, I should treat empirically for UTI while awaiting culture, then narrow based on sensitivities. If symptoms are absent or atypical, I should confirm microscopy, obtain a culture, and reassess for alternative diagnoses before treating. If hematuria predominates with dysmorphic RBCs or casts, I should pivot to a glomerular workup and nephrology referral. And if hematuria persists after treating infection, I should follow hematuria evaluation pathways including risk-stratified imaging and cystoscopy as indicated [^112KNEot] [^1138LVGd] [^113VR3kr]. I should double-check that I am not anchoring on a single urinalysis element; integrating pyuria, bacteriuria, symptoms, and risk factors yields safer, more accurate decisions and reduces both missed infections and overtreatment [^112yE1He].

> In summary, leukocytes in urine signify inflammation and increase the likelihood of UTI, but their predictive value varies by population and must be interpreted in clinical context, whereas blood in urine, once microscopically confirmed, broadens the differential to include infection, stones, malignancy, and glomerular disease. When both coexist, prioritize confirming true pyuria and hematuria, obtaining a proper culture, and aligning management with symptoms and patient-specific risks to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics [^112UvnFL] [^112KNEot] [^114UFNqx].

Leukocytes in urine indicate **pyuria**, most often from a UTI [^notfound], but also from inflammation, STIs, or contamination [^115fzLcz]. Blood in urine (**hematuria**) [^112UvnFL] may reflect infection, stones, trauma, or malignancy, and requires confirmation by microscopy [^114yLxJ6] to distinguish true RBCs from dipstick artifacts [^115fzLcz]. Both findings together strongly suggest a UTI [^notfound], but **culture is needed** to confirm infection and guide therapy [^115edraS]. Persistent hematuria after infection, or hematuria without pyuria, warrants urologic evaluation for stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease [^115UnMZX] [^113VR3kr].

## Clinical significance of leukocytes in urine (pyuria)

Leukocytes in urine (**pyuria**) indicate an inflammatory response — most often due to a UTI [^notfound] — but pyuria is not specific and can occur with other inflammatory or infectious conditions [^112JGPME].

---

### Common causes of pyuria

- **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: Most common cause; pyuria is a hallmark of UTI [^111qMvi2].
- **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**: Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis can cause pyuria [^notfound].
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Interstitial cystitis, lupus nephritis, and other inflammatory renal diseases [^116nxLno].
- **Contamination**: Poor collection technique can introduce leukocytes from external sources [^114mXspZ].

---

### Diagnostic thresholds for pyuria

| **Method** | **Threshold for significant pyuria** |
|-|-|
| Microscopic examination (centrifuged urine) | ≥ 5 WBCs/hpf [^111qMvi2] |
| Automated microscopy (uncentrifuged urine) | ≥ 10 WBCs/μL [^111qMvi2] |
| Dipstick leukocyte esterase | Any positive result (trace or higher) [^111qMvi2] |

---

### Clinical implications of pyuria

Pyuria increases the likelihood of UTI [^113eQdWf], but **confirmation with culture** is required to identify the causative organism and guide therapy [^112KNEot]. Sterile pyuria (WBCs without bacteria) may indicate STIs, tuberculosis, or inflammatory renal disease [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of blood in urine (hematuria)

Hematuria is the presence of RBCs in urine and may be **gross (visible) or microscopic (≥ 3 RBCs/hpf)** [^112UvnFL]. It is a **nonspecific** finding with a broad differential, including benign and serious disease [^113VR3kr].

---

### Common causes of hematuria

- **Infection**: UTI is a common cause of transient hematuria [^115UnMZX].
- **Stones**: Urolithiasis often causes hematuria [^114bDi9D].
- **Trauma**: Recent instrumentation or injury [^114bDi9D].
- **Malignancy**: Bladder, renal, or prostate cancer [^113VR3kr].
- **Glomerular disease**: Dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts indicate glomerular bleeding [^1138LVGd].

---

### Diagnostic approach to hematuria

- **Confirm with microscopy**: Dipstick hemoglobin can be falsely positive; confirm RBCs microscopically [^114yLxJ6].
- **Assess RBC morphology**: Dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts suggest glomerular disease [^1138LVGd].
- **Evaluate proteinuria**: Proteinuria with hematuria suggests glomerular disease [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT to evaluate for stones, tumors, or structural lesions [^114bDi9D].
- **Cystoscopy**: For persistent hematuria or risk factors for malignancy [^113VR3kr].

---

## Combined presence of leukocytes and blood in urine

When leukocytes and blood coexist, **UTI is the most likely diagnosis**, particularly if symptoms are present [^notfound]. However, **other causes** must be considered — including stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease — especially if hematuria persists after infection is treated or if proteinuria or dysmorphic RBCs are present [^1138LVGd].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

- **UTI**: Treat with appropriate antibiotics based on culture results [^notfound]; follow-up urinalysis to ensure resolution [^notfound].
- **Persistent hematuria**: Evaluate for stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease with imaging and urologic consultation [^113VR3kr].
- **Asymptomatic hematuria**: Repeat urinalysis; if persistent, pursue urologic evaluation [^114yLxJ6].

---

Leukocytes and blood in urine indicate inflammation and bleeding, most often from a UTI, but **culture is essential** to confirm infection and guide therapy [^112KNEot]. Persistent hematuria or hematuria without pyuria requires further evaluation for stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease [^115UnMZX].

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^115sJyBv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

Pyuria thresholds and assessment — The absence of pyuria in children with true UTIs is rare; common explanations for bacteriuria without pyuria include contaminated specimens, insensitive pyuria criteria, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

Introduction

Hematuria is a common urinary abnormality indicative of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the long asymptomatic early phase of CKD, urinalysis was considered a high priority for evaluating patients with suspected kidney diseases that manifest as hematuria. Urine red blood cells (RBCs) count, a strong indicator of hematuria, has true variability in individual patients ranging from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive stages. Fluctuations in urinary component concentration are affected by water intake, exercise, and improper urine sample collection and are associated with the instability of urinary RBC count (URBC). Although limited data are available regarding the test performance of RBCs count, efforts are being made to clarify urine test competence and identify candidates for enhancing the accuracy of hematuria diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to optimize the URBC based routine urinalysis, explore new urinary indexes, and subsequently improve accuracy and stability in hematuria diagnosis and early detection of CKD.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to urinalysis, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrites, and glucose in all patients as soon as AKI is suspected or detected unless already obtained. Document the results and take appropriate measures if abnormal.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^113yo4Eu]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, which is most often associated with causes such as benign prostatic enlargement, infection or urinary calculi, but is also symptomatic of urothelial carcinoma (UC), is estimated to occur in between 1 and 22% of patients in a general population. Macroscopic (macro-) hematuria is characterized by a visible color change in the urine of patients, while microscopic (micro-) hematuria is defined more precisely as the presence of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-powered field (RBCs/HPF) in three concurrently collected urine samples. The overall prevalence of UC in patients with microhematuria has been reported to be approximately 4%, whereas several studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of UC is much higher in patients with macrohematuria, ranging from approximately 12–23%, yet up to four times as many patients with micro- versus macrohematuria present for urological evaluation. Notably, given that recent changes to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines have seen the threshold for asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH) lowered to ≥ 3 RBCs/HPF in a single sample, and even lower thresholds (≥ 1 RBC/HPF) have been proposed, a consequential increase in the number of patients with hematuria who will undergo a urological work-up to investigate potential UC and a corresponding increase in the overall clinical and financial burden of these patients on healthcare systems is expected.

### Can a simple urinalysis predict the causative agent and the antibiotic sensitivities? [^111dDjxv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was (1) to determine the reliability of urinalysis (UA) for predicting urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile children, (2) to determine whether UA findings can predict Escherichia coli versus non-E. coli urinary tract infection, and (3) to determine if empiric antibiotics should be selected based on E. coli versus non-E. coli infection predictions.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of children from 2 months to 2 years of age who presented to the emergency department with fever (rectal temperature > 100.4°F) and had a positive urine culture. This study was conducted between January 2004 and December 2007. Negative UA was defined as urine white blood cell count less than 5 per high-power field, negative leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrites. Urine cultures were classified into E. coli and non-E. coli groups. These groups were compared for sex, race, and UA findings. Multivariate forward logistic regression, using the Wald test, was performed to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of each variable (eg, sex, race, UA parameters) in predicting UTI. In addition, antibiotic sensitivities between both groups were compared.

Results

Of 749 medical records reviewed, 608 were included; negative UA(-) was present in 183 cases, and positive UA(+) was observed in 425 cases. Furthermore, 424 cases were caused by E. coli, and 184 were due to non-E. coli organisms. Among 425 UA(+) cases, E. coli was identified in 349 (82.1%), whereas non-E. coli organisms were present in 76 (17.9%); in contrast, in 183 UA(-) cases, 108 (59%) were due to non-E. coli organisms versus 75 (41%), which were caused by E. coli. Urinalysis results were shown to be associated with organism group (P < 0.001). Positive leukocytes esterase had an LR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.2), positive nitrites had an LR of 2.8 (95% CI, 1.4–5.5), and urine white blood cell count had an LR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.4) in predicting E. coli versus non-E. coli infections. Antibiotic sensitivity compared between UA groups demonstrated equivalent superiority of cefazolin (94.7% sensitive in UA(+) vs 84.0% in UA(-) group; P < 0.0001), cefuroxime (98.2% vs 91.7%; P < 0.001), and nitrofurantoin (96.1% vs 82.2%; P < 0.0001) in the UA(+) group. In contrast, the UA(-) group showed significant sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (82.2% vs 71.3% in UA(+); P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Urinalysis is not an accurate predictor of UTI. A positive urine culture in the presence of negative UA most likely grew non-E. coli organisms, whereas most UA(+) results were associated with E. coli. This study also highlighted local patterns of antibiotic resistance between E. coli and non-E. coli groups. Negative UA results in the presence of strong suspicion of a UTI suggest a non-E. coli organism, which may be best treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conversely, UA(+) results suggest E. coli, which calls for treatment with cefazolin or cefuroxime.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Noninvasive biomarkers for lupus nephritis [^116nxLno]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary Immune Cells as Biomarkers for LN

Numerous studies have reported that urinary cell phenotype correlates with renal interstitial infiltration, which can reflect the disease activity and kidney damage. Normally, there are no blood cells in the urine of healthy people, but some T cells, B cells, and macrophages may be observed in the urine of LN patients and other patients with proliferative renal diseases. Therefore, the classification and counting of cells in urine may be a potential noninvasive biomarker for identifying and diagnosing of LN. Urine sediment analysis, including erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, as well as morphological analysis, can indicate the presence of renal disease and inflammation. However, this test has a very limited role in the differential diagnosis of renal diseases. Some researchers have introduced flow cytometry to further analyze the urine cell phenotype and preliminarily obtained a urinary cellular profile of SLE patients with LN. Abdelati et alfound that the numbers of CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, and CD14+ cells in the urine of SLE patients with LN were significantly higher than those patients without LN. In particular, CD14+ monocyte counts were much higher in the urine of patients with class IV LN than those with class III LN and could serve as a potentially sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting proliferative LN. In another study, a low CD4/CD8 ratio was found to be a specific manifestation of LN, suggesting that the shift of urinary T cells into CD8+ T cells is a marker that distinguishes LN from other inflammatory kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, both the absolute number and the proportion of urinary CD8+ T cells may be considered as promising biomarkers for assessing renal activity in patients with LN. This finding was supported in the study by Kopetschke et al. They found that the numbers of urinary T cells, B cells, and macrophages were correlated with the disease activity of LN; however, due to the low number of B cells and macrophages in urine, T cells remained the best cellular biomarker for LN. Of course, with the development of laboratory medicine technologies, it is conceivable that there will be more research focus on cells that are less abundant in urine, such as B cells and T follicular helper cells (TFH). Several studies have already confirmed that B cells and TFH cells are elevated in lupus biopsies and their number alterations in urine may be consistent with those in kidney tissue, which deserve further investigation.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^117Cf5Nn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21–1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Results

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient). The urinalysis parameter combination with the highest AUC, WBC plus bacteria, performed worse than WBCs alone (AUC = 0.711 vs. AUC = 0.722, p = 0.001).

Conclusion

WBC on microscopic urinalysis demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens in urine cultures. Stewardship programs should consider prioritizing urinalysis WBC count as the screening tool to optimize urine culture utilization.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115tJ7Au]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptom control

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hour they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials. Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit, but as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infection based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick resultsmight be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

Antibiotic use

A modest reduction in antibiotic use (20–25%) was achieved in all groups except the symptom score group. While these reductions are probably useful for public health, and the effect might plausibly increase with time as patient expectations change, the magnitude of the effect is in contrast to delayed antibiotic prescription among patients with respiratory infections. This is perhaps not surprising given that few respiratory infections are bacterial whereas most suspected urinary tract infections are (66% of the midstream urine group had confirmed infection, similar to the previous study). There was some evidence that delayed prescribing might reduce reconsultation as we hypothesised, but this was not significant, probably because of the relatively low power of this analysis.

### Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 activates normal human granulocytes, protects them from apoptosis, and blocks their transmigration during inflammation [^117WNaEW]. Infection and Immunity (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) higher than those of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) during acute pyelonephritis have previously been associated with a higher degree of acute inflammation and of postinfective renal scarring. The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible mechanisms by which TIMP-1 could affect the scarring process already during the acute phase of inflammation. The growth of Escherichia coli, bactericidal activity of fresh human blood, and respiratory burst, spontaneous apoptosis, and trans-basement membrane migration of normal human granulocytes were studied in vitro in the presence of different concentrations of recombinant human TIMP-1. To imitate the "normal" environment during inflammation in the kidney, granulocytes were also incubated with a conditioned medium from E. coli-stimulated renal epithelial cells. In order to compare our data with the in vivo situation, blood and urinary leukocyte levels were analyzed for 40 children with acute pyelonephritis, together with urinary MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels. TIMP-1 at a concentration of 500 ng/ml increased the bactericidal activity of blood, increased the respiratory burst of granulocytes, decreased phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase 3 activity, which are features of spontaneous apoptosis, and inhibited granulocyte transmigration. Moreover, in the patients with pyelonephritis, MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios in urine correlated with the degree of leukocyte transmigration. Thus, our data suggest that TIMP-1 specifically blocks the transmigration of granulocytes into urine. Entrapped and activated granulocytes, protected from apoptosis, might excessively destroy renal parenchyma and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of renal scarring following acute pyelonephritis.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^116Ciijs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of UTI in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, to guide further decisions:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|

### The accuracy of the sysmex UF-1000i in urine bacterial detection compared with the standard urine analysis and culture [^111WZETU]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

- Urinary tract infections are characterized by the presence of microbial pathogens within the urinary tract. They represent one of the most common infections in hospitalized and clinic patients.

Objectives

- To model the parameters of the Sysmex UF-1000i to the gold standard, urine culture, and to compare the detection of dipstick leukocyte esterase and nitrates to urine cultures and UF-1000i results.

Design

- Data were compared from urine samples collected in sterile containers for bacterial culture and microscopic analysis. One sample was used to inoculate a 5% sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar plate using a 0.001-mL calibrated loop. The second sample was analyzed by urinalysis-associated microscopy. The media plates were investigated for growth after 18 to 24 hours of aerobic incubation at 37°C. The second sample was analyzed for bacteria and leukocytes with the Sysmex UF-1000i according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Three definitions for culture results, sensitivity, and specificity at different cutoff values were calculated for the UF-1000i.

Results

- The negative predictive value for any positive culture in the adult population included in the study was 95.5%, and the negative predictive value for positive cultures containing growth of 100000 or more colony-forming units was 99.3% using the Sysmex UF-1000i.

Conclusions

- Sysmex UF-1000i showed 98% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity with a 95.5% negative predictive value. Thus, a negative screen with the UF-1000i using defined thresholds for white blood cell counts and bacteria was likely to be a true negative, decreasing the need for presumptive antibiotics.

### Urinary cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid correlates with the prognosis of chronic kidney diseases [^116TU3QG]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Free circulating nucleic acids, cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cf-DNA), were discovered in human plasma in 1948 by Mandel and Metais. Some studies showed the damaged mitochondria release their DNA content into the systemic circulation. Thus, cell-free mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (cf-mtDNA) is easily detected in plasma, and has been explored as a biomarker of various diseases. Recently, increased plasma levels of cf-mtDNA have been reported to correlate with the severity of injury in patients sustaining polytrauma and the severity of stroke, be a prognostic marker of acute myocardial infarction and intensive care unit patients. Alterations of cf-mtDNA in the blood also might be associated with several systemic diseases, including primary mitochondrial disorders, carcinogenesis, and hematologic diseases. In a community-based population cohort, higher plasma cf-mtDNA was associated with a lower incidence of CKD independent of traditional risk factors and was associated with a lower prevalence of microalbuminuria. Apart from blood, cf-DNA could also be detected in urine. Urine cf-DNA originates either from cells shedding into urine from genitourinary tract, or from cell free DNA in circulation passing through glomerular filtration. The presence of genetic information in urine has been observed in some clinical studies. For examples, the urinary cf-mtDNA level had statistically significant correlations with the peak serum creatinine level and the duration of hospitalization in a study of acute kidney injury (AKI). Patients who required temporary dialysis also tended to have higher urinary cf-mtDNA levels than those without dialysis, but no relationship between the urinary cf-mtDNA level and renal outcomes has been reported. A recent study showed that urinary cf-mtDNA level was increased in mice after 10–15 min of ischemia, and that the level correlated with the duration of ischemia. Otherwise, platelet and leukocyte counts in samples are important sources of variation when cf-DNA is measured in DNA extracted from whole blood. Emerging data showed that measuring cf-DNA extracted from whole blood (nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid, cf-nDNA) could yield different results from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or buffy coat (cf-mtDNA), because of the presence of mitochondrial DNA in platelets.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113Z6gTm]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, being retrospective, it shares the limitations of this study design. Primarily, we cannot prove a pathophysiological link between the urine leukocyte count and the likelihood of invasive bacterial infections. It is also not possible to determine, retrospectively, whether antibiotics were administered prior to urine collection in some infants. Fortunately, at our site, antibiotic pretreatment in this age-group is highly unlikely and so would not alter our conclusions. The enhanced urinalysis technique (compared to standard urinalysis), because of better test performance characteristics, may support more accurate diagnosis but was not evaluated by us because it is not utilized at our institution. Irrespective of the specific technique utilized, however, it is reasonable to expect an even lower urine leukocyte count to translate to still lower odds of concomitant bacteriuric sepsis in infants with initially missed urinary tract infections. With respect to standard urinalysis, some clinicians may find it useful to lower the threshold for urine leukocytes to 5 cells/hpf – as proposed in a recent study – to further reduce the risk of bacteriuric sepsis associated with expectant management. As mentioned earlier, test selection bias was unlikely to affect our results appreciably during the years of study, an interval during which compliance with full sepsis protocols was likely to be highest.

Finally, although not specifically evaluated in this study, we expect the short delay reported in a recent study from the first visit to a report of positive urine culture – about 16 hours – to further lower the risk of invasive sepsis and to permit the safe application of expectant strategies in febrile young infants. Rapid turn-around of the urine culture report should shorten the exposure of infants to unduly long periods of unrecognized urinary tract infection, concomitant sepsis, or needless antibiotic treatment. In cases among whom fever is merely the first sign of an incipient but easily recognized viral infection, expectant management may also permit a firmer diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria to be made. Prospective studies are needed to formally investigate these possibilities and to solidify our results. We do not address the related issue of the impact of urinary leukocytes on the risk of renal scarring among young infants with positive urine culture. Other investigators address this outcome more fully, reporting a low risk in infants and young children with low leukocytes in urine.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^111w9NYz]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In combination with clinical information, the accuracy of urine RBC counting could be improved, and the integrity of hematuria diagnosis could also be promoted simultaneously to achieve or approach the non-invasive diagnosis of CKD. This small sample size study might provide crucial support for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who are contraindicated for renal biopsy and likely guide and support clinical activities for primary health care institutes that do not qualify to perform renal biopsy.

### Validation of the Spanish acute cystitis symptoms score (ACSS) in native Spanish-speaking women of Europe and Latin America [^116Sp5Ub]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Clinical and microbiological considerations

Following the EAU guidelines on urological infections, the diagnosis of AC was made by the treating physician based on the clinical history and the typical clinical symptoms of patients referred to the clinic. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AC underwent urinalysis and urine culture, obtaining a urine sample collected in the middle of urination. UTI–AC is defined microbiologically, according to the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America, by the presence of ≥ 10⁵ CFU (colony‐forming units)/ml of a bacterial species isolated in a urine culture. In patients with the typical symptoms of UTI, a cut‐off point of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml was also accepted. Women clinically diagnosed with AC based on symptoms and with a positive urine leukocyte esterase test but without significant bacteriuria of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml in urine culture were not excluded from the study, as there is evidence that AC can occur with a low bacterial count. The results of urine analysis were usually evaluated in the midstream as the number of cells in a chamber's cell (high power field [HPF]). Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false‐positive and false‐negative results can occur. According to publications, the normal reference value for women is 0–5 white blood cells/HPF. However, it can vary depending on regulatory issues, equipment, local guidelines, clinical protocols.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114yLxJ6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^112h6cmC]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Analysis

For our primary analysis, we determined the relative risk (with 95% confidence limits) of concomitant sepsis between bacteriuric infants with low as opposed to high concentrations of leukocytes in urine. Specifically, we compared the frequency of urinary tract infections associated with concomitant bacteremia or bacterial meningitis between infants that had 0–9 leukocytes/hpf versus > 9 leukocytes/hpf on confirmatory urine microscopy. For suitable parts of our analysis, we also combined infants with 0–9 leukocytes in urine with those that had negative dipstick results. We hypothesized that the risk in febrile young infants of urinary tract infections complicated by invasive sepsis would differ significantly depending on whether leukocytes in urine were few or many.

The accuracy of urine leukocytes for predicting concomitant bacteremia and bacterial meningitis was determined by estimating the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) for this test. The AUC is a summative index of true to false positives for a given outcome at ordered values of a diagnostic test. An AUC value of 0.5 indicates no value of a test for diagnosis. A value of 1.0, on the other hand, shows the test is able to identify the target outcome perfectly. We adopted an AUC cut-point of 0.7 as the minimum threshold for designating a test to be useful for diagnosis.

In a secondary analysis, we determined the diagnostic accuracy of other variables that have the potential to be predictors of invasive sepsis, concentrating on those that are measured easily. Specifically, we estimated AUC values for body temperature and age (both recorded routinely at triage), as well as for peripheral blood leukocytes (easily obtained from blood specimens collected by finger stick). Based on previous studies, we estimated the AUC value for non-linear (J-shaped) diagnosis models of peripheral blood leukocytes.

Finally, among infants with positive urine culture, we gauged whether groups stratified by the leukocyte count in urine differed sufficiently in respect to other markers of infection to permit assignment to separate clinical or prognostic groups. Specifically, we compared the concentration of bacteria in urine culture, the frequency of hematuria (> 5 red blood cells/hpf) and the fraction with positive nitrites in urine at the initial visit among infants with leukocytes in urine greater versus fewer than 10 cells/hpf.

Data were analyzed with the Stata statistical package (version 8.0, Stata Corp. TX). The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare count data. Medians of data that were not normally distributed were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^114UFNqx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), cognitive impairment, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) complicate the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in older women. The presence of pyuria remains the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. However, > 90% of ASB patients have pyuria, prompting unnecessary treatment. We quantified pyuria by automated microscopy and flowcytometry to determine the diagnostic accuracy for UTI and to derive pyuria thresholds for UTI in older women.

Methods

Women ≥ 65 years with ≥ 2 new-onset LUTS and 1 uropathogen ≥ 10⁴ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were included in the UTI group. Controls were asymptomatic and classified as ASB (1 uropathogen ≥ 105 CFU/mL), negative culture, or mixed flora. Patients with an indwelling catheter or antimicrobial pretreatment were excluded. Leukocyte medians were compared and sensitivity-specificity pairs were derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

We included 164 participants. UTI patients had higher median urinary leukocytes compared with control patients (microscopy: 900 vs 26 leukocytes/µL; flowcytometry: 1575 vs 23 leukocytes/µL; P < .001). Area under the curve was 0.93 for both methods. At a cutoff of 264 leukocytes/µL, sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 88% (positive and negative likelihood ratio: 7.2 and 0.1, respectively). The commonly used cutoff of 10 leukocytes/µL had a poor specificity (36%) and a sensitivity of 100%.

Conclusions

The degree of pyuria can help to distinguish UTI in older women from ASB and asymptomatic controls with pyuria. Current pyuria cutoffs are too low and promote inappropriate UTI diagnosis in older women. Clinical Trials Registration. International Clinical Trials Registry Platform: NL9477 (https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID = NL9477).

### Sterile pyuria in patients admitted to the hospital with infections outside of the urinary tract [^112JGPME]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, associations, evaluation, and management of pyuria in patients admitted to the hospital with nonurinary infections.

Methods

This study abstracted inpatient records of consecutive patients hospitalized for pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, female genital tract infections (GYN infections), bacterial septicemia, and enteritis in the pediatric and adult medical and surgical units at an academic medical center.

Results

The study population included 210 patients (66 children; 144 adults). Nearly one-third had ≥ 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (pyuria). Pyuria was more common in women (P < .001) and in patients with GYN infections (P = 0.001) and less common in patients with pneumonia (P < .001). Cultures were performed on 18 of 19 children (94.7%) and 26 of 43 adults (60.5%) with pyuria. Of those, 11.1% of children and 42.1% of adults had a positive culture, and all but one of those met criteria for a urinary tract infection. Excluding patients with GYN infections, only 18.8% of patients with pyuria had a positive culture. Of the 44 patients with pyuria who were cultured, a positive culture was associated with having a GYN infection (P = 0.01), moderate or large amounts of bacteria in the urine (P = 0.005), and a positive urine nitrite (P = 0.004). The absolute number of WBCs or red blood cells in the urine and the presence of casts, proteinuria, and leukocyte esterase were not associated with positive culture or urinary tract infection. Neither pyuria nor a positive culture was related to temperature, systemic WBC count, or serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine.

Conclusions

Sterile pyuria of uncertain cause is common in patients admitted to the hospital with acute nonurinary infections.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^115fzLcz]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility. 6, 9–11 Cloudy urine suggests an infection but can indicate alkaline urine with precipitated phosphate crystals. 6, 12 Gross hematuria is concerning for malignancy. Visible feces in the urine can suggest an enterovesical fistula, whereas nonfeculent brown urine may indicate ingestion of fava beans. LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE AND NITRITES Leukocyte esterase and nitrites found on dipstick testing suggest a UTI. Leukocyte esterase is produced by neutrophils and may be present with inflammatory processes and infections. 6, 13 In one study of 705 children with culture-confirmed UTI, 71% of patients were positive for leukocyte esterase; however, this percentage decreased to 44% in patients with Enterococcus or Klebsiella infection.
19. BLOOD Dipstick testing for blood detects peroxidase activity of red blood cells in the urine.

These tests have a greater than 90% sensitivity for hematuria, but free hemoglobin and myoglobin can lead to false-positive results. 6, 22 Microscopic analysis is the best way to confirm dipstick testing positive for blood. 5 Hematuria can be due to glomerular or nonglomerular causes 6, 23, 24. 6, 13, 24, 25 RED BLOOD CELLS Microhematuria in adults is defined as three or more RBCs per high-power field on spun urine. In children, microhematuria is diagnosed with more than five RBCs per high-power field. WHITE BLOOD CELLS Neutrophils are the most common WBCs found in urine. On microscopy, neutrophils are larger than RBCs and contain nuclei. Neutrophils can be found in infectious and inflammatory processes, including UTIs, sexually transmitted infections, and urolithiasis. The presence of casts in urine suggests certain renal pathologies. Hyaline casts are made of protein and may be a normal finding or occur with renal disease.

RBC and WBC casts confirm glomerular disease. Granular casts consist of protein or degraded cellular casts and may indicate tubular injury, such as acute tubular necrosis. 6, 25.

Materials and methods

Urine collection and processing

One hundred thirty-nine samples (n = 139) were analysed in this study, including samples from patients diagnosed with PDAC (n = 51) and pNET (n = 28) and sex-matched controls (n = 60). Power analyses were conducted to determine the appropriate numbers of cancer patients and controls, based on comparing the medians and interquartile ranges of the urinary biomarker levels (measured via ELISA) between the study groups using the Mann–Whitney U -test. These indicated that to detect a 30% difference in the median levels (ng mL –1), a minimum sample size of 28 patients in each of the three study groups (Controls, pNET and PDAC) would provide 80% statistical power using a Bonferroni-adjusted P -value to reduce the false discovery rate and assuming that 75% of the controls would have a lower uMMP value than cancer patients. In our study, we had the benefit of having more PDAC samples (n = 51) than required based on the sample size requirements and decided to include 60 controls to provide greater assurance that elevated uMMP biomarkers in pNET or PDAC groups compared with the controls would reflect clinically important differences in the population. Urine was collected according to the institutional bioethical guidelines pertaining to discarded clinical material as previously described. Samples were collected in sterile containers and immediately frozen at –20 °C. Urine was tested for presence of blood and leukocytes using Multistix 9 Urinalysis Strips (Bayer, Elkhart, IN, USA) and samples containing blood or leukocytes were excluded from analysis.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes (protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones).

Objective —

To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells because of urine strip shortages.

Design —

During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed 2 labels so nursing staff would collect 2 specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

Results —

The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period we had only 1 complaint, by a physician wanting to have results of nitrates.

Conclusions —

During urine strip shortages, we successfully implemented a diversion algorithm that provided actionable urinalysis analytes in a timely manner with minimal provider complaints.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^1158WGdK]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing guidelines

SIGN guidelines for UTI in older adults advise against the use of the urine dipstick as a diagnostic test due to lack of high quality evidence. This advice is echoed by Public Health England guidance, because positive urine dipsticks are often be caused by asymptomatic bacteriuria. The results of our review contradict these recommendations, and suggest that a positive urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocytes is helpful in diagnosing UTI in symptomatic older adults. Further studies in this area are required to corroborate or refute these findings.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^114Mzq4v]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we show that urine leukocytes reflect well the risk of concomitant sepsis in febrile young (0–89 day old) infants with bacteriuria. Reassuringly, we find low odds of invasive sepsis by uropathogens even when urinary tract infections – the most common serious bacterial infections at this age – are missed at the initial visit on account of few leukocytes in urine. The low risk of invasive sepsis in bacteriuric infants with 'normal' screening urinalysis mitigates a major limitation of this test – a modest tendency to miss urinary tract infections – and indicates that fever management strategies reported in the literature that rely on urinalysis for screening are likely to be safe in selected febrile well-appearing young infants managed on an outpatient basis and assured of close follow-up.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^114gCAcS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Febrile infants and young children in emergency departments — dipstick and urinalysis accuracy are reported from multiple Class III studies. In a retrospective review of 375 pediatric ED patients aged 0 to 10 years, urinary tract infection prevalence was 10.7%, urine dipstick sensitivity 92.5% (95% CI 84.3% to 100%) and specificity 39.4% (95% CI 34.2% to 44.6%). In the 0- to 2-year group (160 patients), prevalence was 15%, sensitivity 87.5% (95% CI 74.3% to 100%), and specificity 39.7% (95% CI 31.5% to 47.9%); in the 2- to 10-year group, prevalence was 7.0%, sensitivity 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), and specificity 39.2% (95% CI 32.4% to 46%). In another study of febrile patients younger than 2 years (mean age 9.3 months) at a United Kingdom pediatric ED, a test positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood was 97.12% specific (95% CI 94.17% to 98.96%) with a positive LR of 15.13 (95% CI 6.99 to 32.76), and a test negative for nitrite, leukocyte esterase, blood, and protein had a sensitivity of 97.44% (95% CI 91.12% to 99.29%) with a negative LR of 0.10 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). A multicenter febrile infant study from Spain (N = 649; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL sterile collection; < 90 days; ≥ 38°C) reported leukocyte esterase mean sensitivity 82.1%, mean specificity 92.4%, mean negative predictive value 97.8% for female patients (N = 176) and 94.1% for male patients (N = 473), and mean positive predictive value 58% for female patients and 79.4% for male patients. Another pediatric ED Class III study of febrile patients younger than 5 years (half the patients were ≤ 12 months) with a urinary tract infection prevalence of 17.6% found, for all patients, sensitivities and negative predictive values respectively: nitrite 20% and 85%, hemoglobin 44% and 88%, leukocyte esterase 48% and 90%, 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 48% and 90%, centrifuge Gram's stain 60% and 92%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%; for infants aged 12 months or younger versus older than 12 months, respective sensitivities were nitrite 7% and 23%, hemoglobin 33% and 53%, leukocyte esterase 42% and 53%; 2 to 5 or more WBCs/hpf in sediment 42% and 53%, centrifuge Gram's stain 42% and 76%, and unspun WBC count greater than 10/μL 67% and 96%.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^1145uCfe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

In asymptomatic controls, median urine leukocyte values were higher than the most commonly used cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/µL. Therefore, applying the current pyuria threshold to older women leads to misclassification of many of these women, both with and without ASB. This has several consequences. First, the true cause of the symptoms (eg, vaginal atrophy, Candida vulvovaginitis, and overactive bladder) remains unidentified and thus untreated if symptoms are wrongfully attributed to UTI. Second, it leads to overprescription of antimicrobials, contributing to gut dysbiosis, side effects, and selection of resistant pathogens. Gupta et al show that 25% of asymptomatic patients with pyuria on routine preoperative urinalysis (without urine cultures) were treated with antimicrobials, and that the degree of pyuria predicted prescribing of antimicrobials. These findings, combined with our own data, imply that separate, higher reference values are needed for older women with regard to pyuria. For instance, a threshold of 300 leukocytes/µL would be a considerable improvement, increasing specificity to avoid overtreatment while still maintaining a fair sensitivity. As in any diagnostic test, pyuria levels should be interpreted within the clinical context of individual patients and should not be the only deciding factor when diagnosing UTI. Since both older women with UTI and asymptomatic older women have a high pre-test probability of pyuria, and leukocyte esterase activity is a very rough estimate of the absolute number of leukocytes in the urine, the role of urine dipsticks in older patients should, at best, be limited to ruling out UTI. In addition to clinical implications, there are also implications for research, as misclassification influences the validity of UTI studies.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include the use of a stringent UTI definition instead of urine culture as a reference standard, the consistency of results across 2 quantification methods (identical AUCs), inclusion of participants from multiple settings, and the rapid analysis of urine samples, increasing the reliability of results. Our study also has several limitations. Results may not be generalizable to institutionalized older people with high frailty and/or advanced dementia. However, our population was chosen to prove a concept for which a clear definition and reliable assessment of UTI and ASB were deemed necessary. Moreover, our control group contained a higher proportion of LTCF residents than our UTI group. Nonetheless, ADL dependency scores were similar between the UTI and control groups, and median leukocyte values within the LTCF subgroup were comparable to the values of the overall group.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^111cNbN7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and is classically described as urinary symptoms associated with a positive urine culture. Symptoms of UTI can vary widely but often include dysuria, increased frequency, urgency of urination, and lower abdominal pain. However the diagnosis of UTI in older adults is challenging due to atypical or subtle symptoms and frequent cognitive impairment. In addition, urine cultures are often positive due to the high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, further complicating the diagnosis. Urine dipsticks, commonly used as a preliminary diagnostic tool, provide a rapid and non-invasive method of testing for UTIs by detecting the presence of leukocytes and nitrites in the urine. While urine dipsticks give good results in young patients, they may not be able to accurately identify UTIs in older patients. This inadequacy is probably due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria combined with the fact that the leukocyturia thresholds used to guide the diagnosis of UTIs are based on younger populations and may not be appropriate for older people. Automated urine flow cytometers provide rapid and accurate counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, bacteria and epithelial cells in urine samples. As urine culture is time-consuming and does not aid the diagnosis of UTI in the emergency setting, several studies have established specific thresholds or scoring systems using these automated results to detect UTI or positive urine cultures. However, these studies have primarily focused on younger adults, limiting their relevance to older patients.

Given these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop diagnostic criteria applicable to the older adults. This study proposes to investigate older patients admitted to the hospital with a urine culture obtained in the emergency department. The primary objective was to evaluate the flow cytometry parameters for the diagnosis of UTI in older patients and compare them with the performance of the urine dipstick. We also aimed to evaluate the association of biological parameters and clinical symptoms to exclude or diagnose UTI before urine culture results.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^111iUVwE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has been variably defined over the years. In addition, the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, whether the patient is a man or a woman influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Thus, data support changing current hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

Diagnostic of UTI

The diagnosis of UTI in the older patients is complicated by the frequent absence of specific clinical signs in these patients. There is currently no gold standard for diagnosis in this age group. We based the diagnosis of UTI on the clinician's assessment during the patient's admission, coupled with strict criteria. Patients were considered eligible for the UTI group if they were treated for UTI during their hospital stay based on their initial urine culture results. To confirm the diagnosis of UTI, patients had to have: a positive urine culture (as defined above) associated with a bloodstream infection with the same bacteria, or at least one major symptom of UTI (dysuria, pollakiuria), or imaging compatible with UTI, or at least two minor symptoms among: fever or chills, hypotension, confusion, urological obstruction, or flank pain without another diagnosis to explain these symptoms. Additionally, we collected other symptoms, such as onset of incontinence, acute urinary retention, or acute renal insufficiency. However, these symptoms were not included in our criteria, as they are not usually considered in the diagnosis of UTI. U-WBC, as a diagnostic criterion, was excluded to avoid biasing the leukocyte threshold selection. For patients with discordant classification between the patient's hospital admission report and our definition, patient's charts were reviewed by a geriatrician and an infectious disease physician independently (M.G. and K.B.). In the case of a discordant classification between the two investigators or a lack of data to exclude or confirm urinary tract infection, the patient was excluded.

### Immunomonitoring in bladder cancer: a short report on stability of leukocytes and proteins in refrigerated urine samples [^114QiVeo]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine biomarkers are crucial for monitoring patient responses in treating urological pathologies, including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Yet, analysing urine biomarkers poses several challenges, including ensuring specimen stability during transportation and analytical processing. This prospective feasibility study aimed to investigate how urinary leukocytes and proteins are impacted by storing and refrigerating urine.

Methods

Stability of leukocytes from four healthy donors (HD) spiked into urine supernatants was analyzed for up to 72 h at 4°C. Urine samples from five NMIBC patients undergoing BCG treatment were divided into two portions, followed by either immediate processing or overnight refrigeration. Urinary cell content and soluble factors were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry and Luminex®, respectively.

Results

We confirmed the stability of healthy donor peripheral blood leukocytes spiked into cell-free urine supernatants from healthy donors or untreated bladder cancer patients for up to 72 h under refrigeration at+5℃. Additionally, we conducted immune cell and proteomic analysis from urine samples obtained from five NMIBC patients receiving Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy either processed immediately or after overnight refrigeration. We successfully demonstrated that leukocyte and protein composition remain stable in refrigerated urine from BCG-treated NMIBC for 24 h. This included granulocytes, monocytes, and T cells, as well as total protein, creatinine and 46 additional individual immune-related mediators.

Conclusions

This work demonstrates the compatibility of refrigerated urine shipment from the collection sites to analytical laboratories with both immunophenotyping and proteomic analysis and establishes clear logistical benefits for numerous clinical settings focused on monitoring patient immune responses in the urine matrix.

### Neutrophil extracellular traps protect the kidney from ascending infection and are required for a positive leukocyte dipstick test [^112Gz3G2]. Science Translational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is common but only rarely complicated by pyelonephritis. However, the mechanisms preventing extension to the kidney are unclear. Here, we identified neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in healthy human urine that provide an antibacterial defense strategy within the urinary tract. In both in vivo murine models of UTI where uropathogenic E. coli are inoculated into the bladder and ex vivo human urine models, NETs interacted with uromodulin to form large webs that entrapped the bacteria. Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) inhibition in mice blocked NETosis and resulted in progression of cystitis into pyelonephritis, suggesting that NETosis of urinary neutrophils acts to prevent bacterial ascent into the kidney. Analysis of UK Biobank data revealed that genetic variants in PADI4 that associated with increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis in multiple genome-wide association studies were consistently associated with reduced susceptibility to UTI. Last, we showed that urine dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase was negative in the presence of intact blood neutrophils but became positive when neutrophils were stimulated to NET, and this could be prevented by selective PADI4 inhibition, demonstrating that this test does not detect absolute neutrophil count, as has long been assumed, but specifically detects neutrophils that have undergone NETosis. These findings highlight the role of NETosis in preventing ascending infections in the urinary tract and improve our understanding of one of the most common clinical tests in medicine.

### Effecting the culture: impact of changing urinalysis with reflex to culture criteria on culture rates and outcomes [^115Dno19]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of changes to urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) reflex criteria on culture performance and clinical decision outcomes.

Design

Retrospective study utilizing interrupted time series analysis from December 2018 to November 2020. Primary outcomes were measures of culture performance. Secondary outcomes were rates of antimicrobial prescription for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). We also assessed harmful events related to antimicrobial prescription for all causes and UTI, UTI symptoms, and sepsis.

Setting

A 415-bed, academic, tertiary-care, medical center.

Patients

Hospitalized adult patients with urine testing performed.

Intervention

UARC reflex criteria were changed on October 22, 2019, from ≥ 5×10⁹/L white blood cells (WBCs) or trace leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite units on urinalysis to only ≥ 15×10⁹/L WBCs.

Results

The study included 11,322 unique UARC tests. We detected a significant decrease in the rate of urine cultures performed from UARC after the intervention (32.5–8.7 cultures per 1,000 patient days; P < .001), with improved diagnostic efficacy (ie, culture positivity increased from 34.8% to 62.1%). CAUTI rates did not change. We detected a significant decrease in antimicrobial prescription rates (P = 0.05), this was primarily driven by preintervention changes. One case of sepsis occurred secondary to a missed UTI, and UTIs were rarely missed after the intervention.

Conclusions

Implementation of a stricter UARC reflex criterion was associated with a decrease in culture rates with improved diagnostic efficacy without significant adverse events. Continued education is needed to change antimicrobial prescribing practices.

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^111KXDxU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) incidence increases with age and is higher in women than in men. In older women, diagnosing UTI is complicated for several reasons. First, symptom communication may be affected by cognitive impairment. Second, pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as urinary incontinence and urgency, are common and distinguishing acute from chronic LUTS can be challenging. Finally, 20% of community-dwelling and 50% of institutionalized older women have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), defined as the presence of 1 or more uropathogens with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or higher in the absence of signs or symptoms attributable to UTI. As a result, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment is common, leading to unnecessary side effects, drug interactions, Clostridioides difficile infection, and the selection of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Distinguishing ASB from UTI is further complicated by the fact that over 90% of older women with ASB have concomitant pyuria. Consequently, the positive-predictive value of the presence of pyuria for UTI is low in older women. However, it is unclear whether the degree of pyuria differs between older women with UTI and ASB, partly because urine dipstick is the most ordered screening test, providing only semiquantitative results of leukocyte esterase activity. Pyuria can be quantified in different ways. Initially, Mabeck found that a leukocyte excretion rate of 400 000 per hour could distinguish UTI from asymptomatic women. This rate corresponds to a cutoff value of 10 leukocytes/mm³ in non-centrifuged urine. In clinical practice and research, pyuria is most often quantified by direct or automated microscopy of (non)centrifuged urine, usually after initial dipstick screening. Automated microscopy reduces variability in centrifugation and resuspension of urine and is more efficient than direct microscopy. In recent years, an increasing number of laboratories are adopting urine flowcytometry for quantification of pyuria. Although cutoff values for "significant" pyuria vary in the literature and depend on quantification methods, commonly accepted cutoffs include 10 leukocytes/µL and 5–10 leukocytes per high-power field (hpf). These cutoff values are largely derived from studies involving nonpregnant premenopausal women, in whom ASB is uncommon. The objective of this study was to determine sensitivity and specificity of automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry for diagnosing UTI in older women, with the ultimate goal to derive optimal cutoff values for pyuria for UTI in this population, taking ASB into account.

Urinary tract infection diagnostic testing recommendations alignment — The level B recommendation about the use of diagnostic tests (eg, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, Gram's stain) for a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection and the level C recommendation that a urine culture should be obtained when urinary tract infection is suspected even with a negative urinalysis result are consistent with the AAP guideline, and the AAP guideline further recommends that the specimen be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspirate.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113vvdoH]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Screening urinalysis is only moderately sensitive and has been reported to miss approximately 20% of urinary tract infections in febrile young infants. The worry, when this occurs, is that infants with missed urinary tract infections on account of normal screening urinalysis results will progress to septicemia or bacterial meningitis from concomitant bacteremia unrecognized at the initial visit. We show in this study that this concern is unwarranted for the most part because urine leukocytes are an adequate screen for bacteriuric sepsis. Specifically, we find that few leukocytes in urine and a negative urine dipstick result at the initial visit reflect a low risk of concomitant sepsis in young infants when a urinary pathogen is unexpectedly isolated from culture.

Other plausible markers of bona fide urinary tract infections such as the concentration of bacteria in urine also differ significantly between bacteriuric infants with low and high leukocytes in urine, supporting categorization to separate clinical groups. Based on these differences and the relatively low risk of concomitant sepsis observed in the present study, it appears safe to manage, on an outpatient basis, febrile young infants who are well-appearing and have few leukocytes in urine, as recommended in clinical practice guidelines for fever. The risk of adverse outcome when depending on this strategy is likely to be low provided infants are carefully selected for outpatient management, the interval to urine culture result is short, follow-up is assured, and other tests, when deemed necessary, are available for the complementary but separate task of identifying infants with serious bacterial infections not associated with bacteriuria.

### Predicting urinary tract infections with interval likelihood ratios [^113eQdWf]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protocols for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI) often use arbitrary cutoff values of urinalysis components to guide management. Interval likelihood ratios (ILRs) of urinalysis results may improve the test's precision in predicting UTIs. We calculated the ILR of urinalysis components to estimate the posttest probabilities of UTIs in young children.

Methods

Review of 2144 visits to the pediatric emergency department of an urban academic hospital from December 2011 to December 2019. Inclusion criteria were age < 2 years and having a urinalysis and urine culture sent. ILR boundaries for hemoglobin, protein, and leukocyte esterase were "negative", "trace", "1+", "2+" and "3+". Nitrite was positive or negative. Red blood cells and white blood cells (WBCs) were 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 50, 50 to 100, and 100 to 250. Bacteria counts ranged from negative to "loaded". ILRs for each component were calculated and posttest probabilities for UTI were estimated.

Results

The UTI prevalence was 9.2%, with the most common pathogen being Escherichia coli (75.2%). The ILR for leukocyte esterase ranged from 0.20 (negative) to 37.68 (3+) and WBCs ranged from 0.24 (0–5 WBCs) to 47.50 (100–250 WBCs). The ILRs for nitrites were 0.76 (negative) and 25.35 (positive). The ILR for negative bacteria on urinalysis was 0.26 and 14.04 for many bacteria.

Conclusions

The probability of UTI in young children significantly increases with 3+ leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite results, 20 to 50 or higher WBCs, and/or many or greater bacteria on urinalysis. The probability of UTI only marginally increases with trace or 1+ leukocyte esterase or 5 to 20 WBCs. Our findings can be used to more accurately predict the probability of true UTI in children.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^114T7zrd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in pediatric patients — bag versus catheter urine and white blood cell thresholds are reported as follows: Leukocyte esterase had higher sensitivity (84% leukocyte esterase versus 39% nitrites), and leukocyte esterase specificity was lower in bag urine (84%) than catheterization urine (94%). Urine white blood cells per high-power field (WBC/hpf) showed graded likelihood ratios (LRs): LR = 19 for WBC count greater than 20/hpf, LR = 18.2 for 11 to 20 WBCs/hpf, LR = 2.8 for 6 to 10 WBCs/hpf, LR = 1 for 3 to 5 WBCs/hpf, and LR = 0.3 for 0 to 2 WBCs/hpf. Relative risk of an ambiguous culture was higher for bag specimens at 2.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5), with absolute risks 7.4% in bag urine versus 2.7% with catheterization; 21 cultures (95% CI 13 to 53) by catheterization would be required to avoid 1 ambiguous bag culture. With a 5% prevalence and bagged urine specificity of 70%, the positive predictive value of a bag culture is 15% and 85% of positives would be false; a positive bagged urinalysis result should prompt a urine culture obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112yE1He]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### The importance of pyuria in identifying a UTI needs more "Concentration" If you want to use this sign as a diagnostic tool… [^112jvRQH]. publications.aap.org (2016). Low credibility.

When we find white blood cells being reported in a urinalysis, we tend to look at the number of white cells among other clinical indicators to point us in the direction of diagnosing a urinary tract infection. Yet with newer automated urinalysis systems that do not centrifuge urines, it is possible that urine concentration may need to be taken into account in terms of how many white cells per high powered field are suggestive of that UTI. In other words, do you need to see more WBC if the sample is obtained from concentrated urine and less WBCs in less concentrated urine. To answer this question Chaudari et al. in a study being released this month in our journal, performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 2700 infants less than 3 months of age being evaluated for a possible UTI. WBC and leukocyte esterase levels were looked at in terms of specific gravities of urines ≥ 1.015 and less than 1.015.

Optimal WBC cut points were obtained depending on whether the urine was dilute or more concentrated whereas concentration did not influence leukocyte esterase positivity at all. Do you take into account the urine concentration when you send a urine to your lab to be analyzed. Is this a useful clinical finding to apply. To help you make that decision, we have asked the chair of the AAP's UTI policy committee, Dr. Ken Roberts to share his thoughts on this study with an accompanying commentary that is a must-read as well. Take a pee-k at both the study and commentary and let us know your thoughts by responding to this blog, sending us a comment to be posted with this article or post your thoughts on our Facebook or Twitter sites.

### Treatment for positive urine cultures in hospitalized adults: a survey of prevalence and risk factors in 3 medical centers [^114ak9qa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is prevalent but often contrary to published guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate risk factors for treatment of ASB.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

A tertiary academic hospital, county hospital, and community hospital.

Patients

Hospitalized adults with bacteriuria.

Methods

Patients without documented symptoms of urinary tract infection per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria were classified as ASB. We examined ASB treatment risk factors as well as broad-spectrum antibiotic usage and quantified diagnostic concordance between IDSA and National Healthcare Safety Network criteria.

Results

Among 300 patients with bacteriuria, ASB was present in 71% by IDSA criteria. By National Healthcare Safety Network criteria, 71% of patients had ASB; within-patient diagnostic concordance with IDSA was moderate (kappa, 0.52). After excluding those given antibiotics for nonurinary indications, antibiotics were given to 38% (62/164) with ASB. Factors significantly associated with ASB treatment were elevated urine white cell count (65 vs 24 white blood cells per high-powered field, P < .01), hospital identity (hospital C vs A, odds ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14–0.80], P = 0.01), presence of leukocyte esterase (5.48 [2.35–12.79], P < .01), presence of nitrites (2.45 [1.11–5.41], P = 0.03), and Escherichia coli on culture (2.4 [1.2–4.7], P = 0.01). Of patients treated for ASB, broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in 84%.

Conclusions

ASB treatment was prevalent across settings and contributed to broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Associating abnormal urinalysis results with the need for antibiotic treatment regardless of symptoms may drive unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Immunomonitoring in bladder cancer: a short report on stability of leukocytes and proteins in refrigerated urine samples [^114UUMy6]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Urine contains multiple components that can be used as effective biomarkers and can potentially reflect dynamic changes in the urological tumour microenvironment, including immune cells and proteins. Voided urine sampling is thus a simple, non-invasive procedure that may generate a highly informative source of biomarkers allowing for regular monitoring of treatment and disease, especially bladder cancer, and can potentially increase patient enrolment and retention in clinical trials. However, the limited knowledge about the stability of urine samples during storage and transit poses a challenge for their use in clinical trials, where samples must be analysed by a central laboratory.

Tumour tissue and peripheral blood are traditionally considered key samples for tracking biomarkers in oncology patients. Yet urine samples represent a non-invasive and readily available patient output that can provide similarly valuable clinical insights, especially in the urology setting. Extensive research has investigated stability and storage considerations for assays involving tumour tissue and peripheral blood, while established standards for voided urine samples remain limited. Existing studies mainly focus on urinary metabolites/electrolytes, with limited analysis of cytokines and no exploration of the urinary cell compartment.

We examined the stability of leukocytes from healthy donors spiked into either healthy donor or NMBIC patient urine supernatants, as well as the stability of immune cell and protein content in prospectively collected urine samples from NMIBC patients undergoing BCG treatment. We successfully show for the first time that storing urine at + 2 to + 8°C, without preservatives, for up to at least 24 h does not substantially affect the viability or recovery of total urine immune cells, and we were able to extend this stability window up to 72 h based on the result of spiking urine with whole blood leukocytes. Moreover, frequencies of monocytes, granulocytes and T cells remain unaffected in refrigerated urine. This discovery presents promising new logistical avenues for clinical trials or ongoing treatments involving the immunophenotyping of urinary leukocytes for biomarker research.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^115QNZYr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use, but risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

Exposures

One or more antibiotic dose for treatment of ASB.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

Results

Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%); median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.15–2.13), acutely altered mental status (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.23–3.04), urinary incontinence (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.36–2.41), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10 000/μL) (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00), positive urinalysis (presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrite, or > 5 white blood cells per high-power field) (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.05–3.93), and urine culture with a bacterial colony count greater than 100 000 colony-forming units per high-power field (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.83–2.91). Treatment of ASB was associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing (4 vs 3 days; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.28–1.47). No other differences in secondary outcomes were identified after propensity weighting.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hospitalized patients with ASB commonly receive inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic treatment did not appear to be associated with improved outcomes; rather, treatment may be associated with longer duration of hospitalization after urine testing. To possibly reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, stewardship efforts should focus on improving urine testing practices and management strategies for elderly patients with altered mental status.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^114dPTh3]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Screening dipstick was performed using Multistix (Bayer Corporation, Elkhard, IN). Per protocol at the institution, the laboratory performed microscopic analysis of urine (formal urinalysis) only if the dipstick examination was positive for nitrite, blood, leukocyte esterase, or protein. All urine samples, however, were sent for bacterial culture irrespective of urine dipstick findings. The leukocyte count reported on microscopic analysis was measured as the number of cells per high power field (hpf, 40× magnification) in urine centrifuged at 2000 revolutions per minute for 5 minutes. Results were reported on an extended ordinal scale that we abbreviated to three categories: 0–9, 10–50 and greater than 50 leukocytes per hpf in urine. Microscopy by standard urinalysis technique was applied equally to all urine specimens sent for formal urinalysis during the period of study.

Results of urine bacterial culture were recorded for each febrile young infant seen at this site. We defined positive urine culture based on published thresholds (colony forming units per mL [cfu/ml]) for each urine collection technique. Urine obtained by bladder catheterization was considered positive if a known pathogen was isolated at concentrations greater than or equal to 10,000 cfu/ml. Specimens obtained by supra-pubic aspiration were considered positive if a known pathogen was isolated at concentrations greater than or equal to 1000 cfu/ml. Specimens collected by clean void or by unknown technique were considered positive only if the concentration of bacteria in urine was greater than or equal to 100,000 cfu/ml. Urine that isolated a known contaminant was considered not to be infected but was retained in the dataset.

For young infants growing a pathogen from urine, culture results of blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained concurrently during the initial encounter were examined for evidence of concomitant infection by the same pathogen. Concomitant (also designated invasive or bacteriuria-associated) bacteremia and bacterial meningitis were diagnosed if standard culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid grew the same pathogen found in urine. Cases in which bacteremia or bacterial meningitis were diagnosed in infants with no evidence of urinary tract infection were designated non-bacteriuric sepsis.

### Urine specific gravity and the accuracy of urinalysis [^116hGe7J]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent study in young infants found that different cutoffs maximized the accuracy of the urine white blood cell count in dilute versus concentrated urine samples. We aimed to confirm this finding and to determine its impact on clinical care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of data gathered on consecutive children < 24 months of age with visits to the emergency department during a 5-year period. We evaluated the accuracy of screening tests for urinary tract infection (UTI) in dilute and concentrated urine samples. We also calculated the number of children who would have been treated differently in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 children presenting with fever had urine specific gravity (SG) been taken into consideration.

Results

We included 10078 children. The ability to rule in UTI (as measured by the positive likelihood ratio [LR]) was similar in dilute and concentrated urine for the leukocyte esterase test (11.76 vs 10.71, respectively). The positive LR for urine white blood cell count per high-powered field was higher in dilute urine (9.83 vs 6.12). In contrast, the positive LR for the nitrite test was lower in dilute urine (20.54 vs 47.44). Despite these differences, we found little change in the number of children treated with antibiotics in predictive models that took urine SG into consideration.

Conclusions

Although we found that urine SG influences the accuracy of some components of the urinalysis, its inclusion in the decision-making process had negligible effect on the clinical care of children with UTI.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a promising non-invasive biomarker for symptom assessment and diagnosis of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^114iBhrx]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

A particular antiproliferative factor (AFP) has been identified in the urine of IC/BPS patients. AFP is the most extensively investigated biomarker and exhibits remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Nevertheless, there is currently no evidence supporting the utilization of AFP for early detection of IC/BPS.

Neutrophils play a pivotal role in the innate immune response, carrying out essential functions like phagocytosis and releasing a multitude of cytokines and molecular mediators. The presence of lymphocytopenia is a hallmark of stress, while inflammation stems from processes like demargination, redistribution, and accelerated apoptosis. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a valuable metric that reflects the equilibrium between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Consequently, NLR emerges as an exceptional indicator of both inflammation and stress, effectively capturing the intricate interplay between the two. The underlying mechanism driving neutrophilia involves the activation of stem cell growth factor, which exerts its influence on neutrophil production. In the early phases of an inflammatory response, the tumor necrosis factor family triggers apoptosis in lymphocytes, thus establishing lymphocytopenia as a diagnostic marker of infection. Neutrophils possess the ability to release reactive oxygen species and an array of peptides, including antimicrobial peptides. These components contribute to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which, unfortunately, exert adverse effects on the bladder. In a comprehensive epidemiological study conducted by Lee et al. in 2018, a robust cohort comprising 12,160 healthy Korean citizens (6,268 men with a median age of 47 years and 5,892 women with a median age of 46 years) was meticulously examined. The researchers analyzed 12,160 blood samples that had undergone routine complete blood count assessments. The mean NLR value was (1.65 ± 0.79). Zahorec proposed NLR categorizations as follows: Latent, subclinical, or mild inflammatory/stress conditions: NLR range 2.3–3.0; Mild to moderate inflammation: NLR range 3–7; Moderate to severe inflammation, systemic infection, sepsis, and SIRS: NLR range 7–11; Severe inflammation, infection, severe sepsis and SIRS, and bacteremia: NLR range 11–17. In simpler terms, elevated NLR values are directly associated with conditions characterized by severe inflammation, stress, injury, trauma, major surgery, or cancer. These elevated NLR values indicate a worsening prognosis, signifying a higher likelihood of unfavorable outcomes in terms of illness or death.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112KNEot]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^113vD2ya]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading reason why patients seek treatment in primary care. One in three women will be treated with antibiotics for UTI by the age of 24 and 40% to 50% of women will experience one or more UTIs in their lifetime, with 10–15% experiencing recurrent infections. A UTI is commonly identified among young adolescents attending sexual health centres and accounts for 17% of treatment cases. In the adult population of 65 years and older, a UTI is the second most common cause of infectious disease related to hospitalisations in the USA. A UTI is a debilitating condition causing the onset of painful urination (dysuria), increased urinary frequency, the inability to start urinating (hesitancy) and the sensation of a sudden need to urinate (urgency), all of which are classified as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Many clinical guidelines advocate urinary dipstick testing for leucocyte esterase and nitrite as a means of detecting UTI, but evidence suggests that their utility might be limited. Dipstick analyses are surrogate tests, referenced not to microscopic pyuria but to a gold standard urine culture threshold for UTI, which guidelines accept as being between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of the pure growth of a single urinary pathogen. This test has attracted criticism too. Furthermore, the literature shows that the methods of sample collection for urine culture have never been validated in appropriate clinical trials. Justification for the use of such methods is based on plausible assumptions without supporting evidence. It is now recognised that routine urinalyses, including dipstick and culture, are insensitive, thus missing genuine infection in many symptomatic patients.

### Point-of-care diagnostic tests for childhood urinary-tract infection: phase-contrast microscopy for bacteria, stick testing, and counting white blood cells [^117EuBi7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate point-of-care testing for childhood urinary-tract infections (UTI).

Method

Point-of-care testing of prospectively collected sequential paired urines was compared with quantitative culture after serial dilution in 203 children, of whom 36 had UTIs. Proportionate reduction in uncertainty (PRU) plots were used to compare between methods and with published values.

Results

Phase-contrast microscopy for bacteria, as with culturing a single urine and using a threshold of 10⁵ bacteria/ml, was 100% sensitive, making it powerful to rule UTIs out. The specificity was slightly lower than urine culture (0.860 vs 0.925) except in girls > 9 years where vaginal Lactobacillus contamination reduced it to 0.61, but this increased to 0.81 when 'urethral stream' urines were collected. Nitrite positivity is highly specific at 0.985, making it powerful at ruling UTIs in, but its low sensitivity (0.61) makes it unsafe to rule UTIs out. A PRU plot of 16 previous studies confirmed this. Though the presence of urinary white blood cells (WBC) correlates with UTI, whether tested by point-of-care of laboratory microscopy or by stick testing, the coefficient of determination is too low to make them clinically useful, alone or combined with nitrite analysis. Seventeen other studies confirmed this.

Conclusion

Phase-contrast microscopy can rule out UTIs as reliably as urine culture but is immediate, which may be clinically important. To interpret positive results reliably, girls > 9 years must collect a 'urethral stream' urine. While nitrite positivity is useful to rule UTIs in, negative results are unreliable. Urinary WBC testing has little value.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^111SLBpi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The growing incidence of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, driven heavily by inappropriate antibiotic use. Diagnostic stewardship, including tools like reflex urine culture, can help reduce unnecessary testing and subsequent unwarranted antibiotic treatments, though optimal thresholds are not well-defined. In our analysis of urinary parameters, urine microscopy WBC count demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the presence of uropathogens.

Our study findings show that no single urinalysis parameter achieves both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting uropathogens from urine culture. However, WBC count on the microscopic portion of the urinalysis showed the best test performance with an AUC of 0.72, indicating acceptable or fair discriminative power.

Our results align with an analysis of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center healthcare system data, which assessed urinalysis parameters for diagnostic accuracy of "significant bacteriuria", a proxy definition for UTI. They found that WBC had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.78) and bacteria (AUC = 0.77). Interestingly, our AUC values were lower. Differences may stem from test ordering practice variation, with some systems performing urinalysis with urine cultures more or less discriminately, including ordering tests for patients without UTI symptoms. The bias introduced by selecting patients based on clinician-initiated urinalysis ordering, rather than on symptoms, has been shown to underestimate diagnostic accuracy and may have contributed to inter-study variability in AUC results. Another key difference is our mean population age was lower (48 versus 57 years), attributed to our inclusion of children, whereas the other study included only adults. Increased age is associated with a higher prevalence of pyuria and colonization in women, – which might contribute to test performance differences. Finally, uropathogen definition differences may explain discrepant AUC values. The previous study's outcome was > 10,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, whereas our definition was organisms likely to prompt clinical action.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Reflex testing of male urine specimens misses few positive cultures may reduce unnecessary testing of normal specimens [^115Cswtp]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the predictive values of leukocyte count for the presence of a positive urine culture in ambulatory male urology patients. Many institutions have adopted a practice of "reflex testing" urine samples, in which urine culture is only performed if a threshold number of leukocytes (WBCs [white blood cells]) is present.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all male patients who presented to our tertiary-care urology clinic in 2006. Only those with both a urinalysis and urine culture performed were included in this study. A urine culture was considered positive if at least 10,000 colonies of a uropathogen were present. Data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS V15.0 software.

Results

Of 874 patients, 176 (20%) urine cultures were positive. WBCs were present at a concentration of at least 5/hpf (high power field) in 367 (42%) of all specimens and in 163 of 176 (93%) positive specimens, but were present at lower concentrations in 13 specimens with positive cultures. The presence of > 5 WBC/hpf had a positive predictive value of 47%, and a negative predictive value of 97% for positive culture.

Conclusions

Reflex urine testing, in which cultures are done on urine specimens with > 5 WBC/hpf, would have missed 7% of positive urine cultures, while avoiding 69% of all cultures. Reflex testing may be appropriate in most ambulatory urology patients.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^116fQ3mA]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Well-appearing 8- to 21-day-old febrile infants — urinalysis and culture (KAS 1): For febrile (temperature ≥ 38.0°C), well-appearing, term infants 8 to 21 days of age, clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or SPA of the bladder for urinalysis and, if urinalysis result is positive, for culture (Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation). A positive urinalysis result is defined as the presence of any leukocyte esterase (LE) on dipstick, > 5 WBCs per high-powered field (hpf) in centrifuged urine, or > 10 WBCs/mm³ in uncentrifuged urine on microscopic urinalysis using a hemocytometer. Of the estimated 10% of febrile infants with UTIs, 94% have urinalysis positive for leukocyte esterase (LE) (95% CI, 91%–97%).

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^116hszcZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

Methods:

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21–1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Results:

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient). The urinalysis parameter combination with the highest AUC, WBC plus bacteria, performed worse than WBCs alone (AUC = 0.711 vs. AUC = 0.722, p = 0.001).

Conclusion:

WBC on microscopic urinalysis demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens in urine cultures. Stewardship programs should consider prioritizing urinalysis WBC count as the screening tool to optimize urine culture utilization.

### Influencing factors on the NMP-22 urine assay: an experimental model [^1177W5xA]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using a novel experimental model, we evaluated a number of factors that may influence the NMP-22 urine tests. Although the model does not mimic the actual physiological situation exactly, the aim was to test whether the NMP-22 analyte could originate from blood (serum or whole blood) or benign cells of urothelial origin. Previous studies have investigated the influence of blood in the NMP-22 assay. Atsu et al. reported that when whole blood was added to a urine sample, positive NMP-22 results increased in parallel with the increase in the amount of red blood cells in the sediment. In addition, the leukocyte count in the urine sediment also had a significant impact, and the investigators concluded that pyuria and hematuria significantly affected urinary NMP-22. In our study, the influence of blood was confirmed, but we also showed that spiking with intact, benign or cancerous cells caused a positive NMP-22. As expected, cellular lysate from those cells had a greater effect.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Which Investigations Are Needed at Diagnosis and During Complicated UTI?

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D).
Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration and urine analysis, culture and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C).
Additional blood investigations for cUTI may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine and electrolytes (GRADE C).
An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).
All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D).
Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uUTI or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis – (Table 2). Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

TABLE 2.
Summary of Diagnostic and Other Initial Investigations in Children With cUTI

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag with a positive culture will be false positives, so they should only be used in nonurgent situations as an initial screening measure; a negative result confirms the absence of a UTI.

Urine Dipstick Analysis

If leukocyte esterase is greater than trace, pyuria is present. Dipsticks may be false negatives in children with < 3 months with high voiding frequency or with Enterococcus spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens have a reduced ability to convert nitrate to nitrite, and Enterococcus spp. may not induce a strong inflammatory response to increase leukocyte esterase.– Dipsticks may be false positives due to contamination, fever of a different cause, localized or systemic inflammatory processes, for example, Kawasaki disease.

Urine Microscopy

Pyuria is present with ≥ 5 WBC/high-powered field with standardized or automated microscopy or ≥ 10 WBC/mm³ on a hemocytometer. Because of low sensitivity, negative urine microscopy does not exclude UTI.

These models represent the natural log odds of invasive sepsis in febrile young infants as a function of the leukocyte count in peripheral blood. To calculate the natural log odds of this outcome in a particular patient, insert the specific peripheral blood leukocyte count into the equation. Conversion to odds is then obtained by calculating the exponent of the numerical value obtained for the equation of the natural log odds of invasive sepsis.

### Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality [^11168YvC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening asymptomatic people, and for case-finding among inpatients or outpatients who do not have genitourinary symptoms. Abnormalities identified on screening sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious disease, such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urinary dipstick screening could improve prognoses due to earlier detection, but could also lead to unnecessary and potentially invasive follow-up testing and unnecessary treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks in general populations and patients in hospitals.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 8 September 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and other study types that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening were eligible for inclusion. We searched for studies that investigated the use of urinary dipsticks for detecting haemoglobin, protein, albumin, albumin-creatinine ratio, leukocytes, nitrite, or glucose, alone or in any combination, and in any setting. We planned to exclude studies conducted in patients with urinary disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. However, no studies met our inclusion criteria.

Main Results

Literature searches to 8 September 2014 yielded 4298 records, of which 4249 were excluded following title and abstract assessment. There were 49 records (44 studies) eligible for full text assessment; of these 18 studies were not RCTs and 26 studies compared interventions or controls that were not relevant to this review. Thus, no studies were eligible for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks, which remain unknown.

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^113VR3kr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113mStWN]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Results

For the period of study, urine samples were obtained from 3765 febrile infants aged 0–89 days presenting to Children's Hospital Boston and sent for screening urine dipstick and bacterial culture. Of these, positive urine culture was reported in 307 (8.2%). Urine was sent for formal microscopy after dipstick analysis in 1516 (40%) of 3756 infants. Of these, 258 (17%) met study criteria for positive culture.

Seventy-nine of 258 pathogens (75 by bladder catheterization, 1 by clean void, and 3 by unknown technique) were isolated from urine specimens with 0–9 leukocytes/hpf at the initial visit. These included: E. coli (61), Enterococcus spp (7), Enterobacter spp (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4) and Citrobacter spp (2).

Organisms isolated from 179 cases with greater than or equal to 10 leukocytes/hpf in urine included E. coli (169), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Enterococcus spp (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Citrobacter spp (1), and Enterobacter spp (1). One hundred seventy of these pathogens were cultured from urine obtained by bladder catheterization, 4 by clean void, and 5 by unknown technique.

Urine leukocytes as predictors of urinary tract infections

The rate of positive urine culture increased with rising concentrations of urinary leukocytes in these infants: 6.2% (79/1279) for infants with 0–9 leukocytes/hpf, 68% (88/130) for infants with 10–50 leukocytes/hpf, and 85% (91/107) for those with more than 50 leukocytes/hpf. Twelve pathogens isolated from urine were also cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. These included 10 cases of E. coli bacteremia, 1 case of S. aureus bacteremia, and 1 case of meningitis caused by E. coli.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarise the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

Methods

Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and by reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

Results

70 publications were included. Accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly and in family medicine. Accuracy of leukocyte-esterase was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests in all patient groups and settings, except for in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed an important increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies in urology patients (DOR = 52), in children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine (90%). Predictive values of combinations of positive test results were low in all other situations.

Conclusions

Overall, this review demonstrates that the urine dipstick test alone seems to be useful in all populations to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte-esterase are negative. Sensitivities of the combination of both tests vary between 68 and 88% in different patient groups, but positive test results have to be confirmed. Although the combination of positive test results is very sensitive in family practice, the usefulness of the dipstick test alone to rule in infection remains doubtful, even with high pre-test probabilities.

Microhematuria diagnosis and definition — clinicians should define microhematuria as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic evaluation of a single, properly collected urine specimen, and clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone; a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^112humPF]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of urine dipstick

We collected the results of a total of 417 urine dipsticks (91.4%) performed in the emergency department, including 66 for the UTI group (95.6%) and 351 for the control group (90.7%). Urine dipsticks were considered negative if leukocyte esterase and nitrite were negative (AUC = 0.7405 [0.706–0.775]) and positive otherwise (Table S5). Sensitivity of urine dipstick for UTI (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) was lower than the sensitivity of UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (98.48% [91.90–99.79]) (p < 0.01) but similar to the sensitivity of the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (95.45% [87.47–98.44]) (p < 0.99). However, specificity was higher for both the UBC threshold of 150 bacteria/µL (67.81% [62.75–72.48]) and the U-WBC threshold of 50 leukocytes (70.66% [65.69–75.17]) compared to the specificity of the urine dipstick (57.83% [52.61–62.89]) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). The LR- was < 0.1 for all test methods. Urine dipstick in patients with at least one major symptom had a sensitivity of 91.43% [77.62–97.04], a specificity of 73.08% [53.92–86.30], a LR- of 0.117 [0.059–0.234] and a LR + of 3.396 [2.55–4.42].

### Nomogram for customized recurrence prediction in primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer based on routine blood and urine parameters [^1175TEZN]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the routine blood and urine parameters in predicating the recurrence of primary NMIBC. Specifically, higher age, blood platelet count, urinary leucocyte counts and lower urinary mucus filament showed significant associations with rapid NMIBC recurrence. Furthermore, we established a nomogram model, which comprised the parameters above and performed well in the customized prediction of NMIBC recurrence at 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month, hypothesized that its predictive value would assist doctors in identifying high-risk NMIBC patients and providing suitable follow-up alternatives.

The current gold standards for BC follow-up are urine cytology and cystoscopy with biopsy. However, cystoscopy is intrusive, expensive, has an accuracy rate of 85–90%, and has a risk of urinary tract infection, hematuria, and inadequate adherence to care guidelines. Additionally, it can be challenging to schedule repeated postoperative cystoscopic follow-ups for patients with NMIBC.

An extensive effort has been made in recent years to find biomarkers in blood and urine that can be used to diagnose BC and predict how well patients will respond to treatment. Lower urine pH and greater levels of urine protein, urine glucose, and pee occult blood have been linked to an increased risk of BC, according to research by Zeng et al. When compared to healthy controls, patients with bladder cancer have greater levels of urine- and plasma-soluble proteins such as VEGF, endostatin, stress proteins, and cytokines, which aid in the detection and staging of the disease. After BCG injection, leukocyte cell presence in urine appears to be a replacement urine biomarker of immune system activity. Additionally, a worse response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated to an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in MIBC patients' blood. However, few studies have looked into the use of non-invasive markers in blood or urine to predict the prognosis of NMIBC patients. Elsawy et al. reported that urinary IL-10 and serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can significantly predict the initial complete response after BCG treatment in high-risk NMIBC. Li et al. observed that the presence of ferrous protoporphyrin(+)/reactive oxygen species(+) in urine is associated with an increased risk of recurrence in newly diagnosed NMIBC patients.

### Measurement of lysosomal enzyme activities: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112iY3d7]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ACMG technical standard on measurement of lysosomal enzyme activities — assays that measure lysosomal enzyme activity are important tools for the screening and diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and are often ordered in combination with urine oligosaccharide and glycosaminoglycan analysis, additional biomarker assays, and/or DNA sequencing when an LSD is suspected. Enzyme testing in whole blood/leukocytes, serum/plasma, cultured fibroblasts, or dried blood spots demonstrating deficient enzyme activity remains a key component of LSD diagnosis and is often prompted by characteristic clinical findings, abnormal newborn screening, abnormal biochemical findings (eg, elevated glycosaminoglycans), or molecular results indicating pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance in a gene associated with an LSD. This document focuses on clinical enzyme testing for LSDs and provides a resource for laboratories to develop and implement clinical testing, to describe variables that can influence test performance and interpretation of results, and to delineate situations for which follow-up molecular testing is warranted.

### History and physical examination plus laboratory testing for the diagnosis of adult female urinary tract infection [^1173wmU7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians often encounter females presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for female UTIs in emergency departments (EDs) have not been quantitatively described.

Objectives

This was a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P) and urinalysis in diagnosing uncomplicated female UTI in the ED.

Methods

The medical literature was searched from January 1965 through October 2012 in PUBMED and EMBASE using the following criteria: Patients were females greater than 18 years of age in the ED suspected of having UTIs. Interventions were H&P and urinalysis used to diagnose a UTI. The comparator was UTI confirmed by a positive urine culture. The outcome was operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing a UTI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc.

Results

Four studies (pooled n = 948) were included with UTI prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. H&P variables all had positive LRs (+LR, range = 0.8 to 2.2) and negative LRs (-LR, range = 0.7 to 1.0) that are insufficient to significantly alter pretest probability of UTI. Only a positive nitrite reaction (+LR = 7.5 to 24.5) was useful to rule in a UTI. To rule out UTI, only a negative leukocyte esterase (LE; -LR = 0.2) or blood reaction on urine dipstick (-LR = 0.2) were significantly accurate. Increasing pyuria directly correlated with +LR, and moderate pyuria (urine white blood cells [uWBC] > 50 colony-forming units [CFUs]/ml) and moderate bacteruria were good predictors of UTI (+LR = 6.4 and 15.0, respectively).

Conclusions

No single H&P finding can accurately rule in or rule out UTI in symptomatic women. Urinalysis with a positive nitrite or moderate pyuria and/or bacteruria are accurate predictors of a UTI. If the pretest probability of UTI is sufficiently low, a negative urinalysis can accurately rule out the diagnosis.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113gnUQe]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

When urine infections are missed in febrile young infants with normal urinalysis, clinicians may worry about the risk – hitherto unverified – of concomitant invasion of blood and cerebrospinal fluid by uropathogens. In this study, we determine the extent of this risk.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study of febrile 0–89 day old infants evaluated for sepsis in an urban academic pediatric emergency department (1993–1999), we estimated rates of bacteriuric sepsis (urinary tract infections complicated by sepsis) after stratifying infants by urine leukocyte counts higher, or lower than 10 cells/hpf. We compared the global accuracy of leukocytes in urine, leukocytes in peripheral blood, body temperature, and age for predicting bacteruric sepsis. The global accuracy of each test was estimated by calculating the area under its receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests compared count data. Medians for data not normally distributed were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

Two thousand two hundred forty-nine young infants had a normal screening dipstick. None of these developed bacteremia or meningitis despite positive urine culture in 41 (1.8%). Of 1516 additional urine specimens sent for formal urinalysis, 1279 had 0–9 leukocytes/hpf. Urine pathogens were isolated less commonly (6% vs. 76%) and at lower concentrations in infants with few, compared to many urine leukocytes. Urine leukocytes (AUC: 0.94) were the most accurate predictors of bacteruric sepsis. Infants with urinary leukocytes < 10 cells/hpf were significantly less likely (0%; CI:0–0.3%) than those with higher leukocyte counts (5%; CI:2.6–8.7%) to have urinary tract infections complicated by bacteremia (N = 11) or bacterial meningitis (N = 1) – relative risk, 0 (CI:0–0.06) [RR, 0 (CI: 0–0.02), when including infants with negative dipstick]. Bands in peripheral blood had modest value for detecting bacteriuric sepsis (AUC: 0.78). Cases of sepsis without concomitant bacteriuria were comparatively rare (0.8%) and equally common in febrile young infants with low and high concentrations of urine leukocytes.

Conclusion

In young infants evaluated for fever, leukocytes in urine reflect the likelihood of bacteriuric sepsis. Infants with urinary tract infections missed because of few leukocytes in urine are at relatively low risk of invasive bacterial sepsis by pathogens isolated from urine.

Microhematuria (MH) — urine dipstick and repeat urinalysis: The Panel recognizes that although a positive dipstick does not warrant MH evaluation, data exist correlating the extent of dipstick positivity with the likelihood of identifying a greater number of RBC/HPF on urinalysis (UA), and therefore in patients with a greater degree of blood on urine dipstick but a negative UA, clinicians may consider follow-up with repeat UA, including patient risk and preference in the decision process.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis. The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies, showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Abnormal urinalysis results are common, regardless of specimen collection technique, in women without urinary tract infections [^114mXspZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Voided urinalysis to test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is prone to false-positive results for a number of reasons. Specimens are often collected at triage from women with any abdominal complaint, creating a low UTI prevalence population. Improper collection technique by the patient may affect the result. At least four indices, if positive, can indicate UTI.

Objective

We examine the impact of voided specimen collection technique on urinalysis indicators of UTI and on urine culture contamination in disease-free women.

Methods

In this crossover design, 40 menstrual-age female emergency department staff without UTI symptoms collected urine two ways: directly in a cup ("non-clean") and midstream clean catch ("ideal"). Samples underwent standard automated urinalysis and culture. Urinalysis indices and culture contamination were compared.

Results

The proportion of abnormal results from samples collected by "non-clean" vs. "ideal" technique, respectively, were: leukocyte esterase (> trace) 50%, 35% (95% confidence interval for difference -6% to 36%); nitrites (any) 2.5%, 2.5% (difference -2.5 to 2.5%); white blood cells (> 5/high-powered field [HPF]) 50%, 27.5% (difference 4 to 41%); bacteria (any/HPF) 77.5%, 62.5%, (difference -7 to 37%); epithelial cells (> few) 65%, 30% (difference 13 to 56%); culture contamination (> 1000 colony-forming units of commensal or > 2 species) 77%, 63% (difference -5 to 35%). No urinalysis index was positively correlated with culture contamination.

Conclusion

Contemporary automated urinalysis indices were often abnormal in a disease-free population of women, even using ideal collection technique. In clinical practice, such false-positive results could lead to false-positive UTI diagnosis. Only urine nitrite showed a high specificity. Culture contamination was common regardless of collection technique and was not predicted by urinalysis results.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — repeat testing for suspected contamination (Clinical Principle) advises that clinicians should obtain repeat urine studies when an initial specimen is suspect for contamination, with consideration for obtaining a catheterized specimen. Establishing infection requires linking acute-onset symptoms to laboratory evidence including pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis and uropathogenic bacteria, and contamination with skin and vaginal bacteria can occur, supporting repeat or catheterized specimens when contamination is suspected.

Urinalysis parameter combinations

When WBCs, which had the highest AUC (0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725]) among urinalysis parameters, were combined with bacterial counts of "few" or more, the AUC was slightly lower (0.711[95% CI 0.706–0.714)). Combinations of WBCs with other microscopic parameters resulted in even lower AUCs (Table 3). Among the macroscopic parameter combinations, leukocyte esterase combined with nitrite (whether positive or negative) had an AUC of 0.695, which was identical to that of leukocyte esterase alone (AUC = 0.700 [95% CI 0.690–0.701], p = 0.08) but higher than nitrites alone (AUC = 0.627 [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), p = 0.001) (Table 3).

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^113qC96H]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm³ on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^113hnp1a]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Our findings corroborate those by other investigators who have also reported differences in clinical outcomes between infants and children with urinary tract infections after stratification by the leukocyte count in urine. Of particular interest, are studies that report lower levels of acute phase reactants in blood, fewer structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and a lower incidence of renal scarring, suggesting milder disease in children less than 24 months of age with few leukocytes in urine. The specific reasons are unclear for the outcomes noted in these studies and ours between young infants with low and high urine leukocyte counts. It is conceivable, however, that few urine leukocytes in infants diagnosed with urinary tract infections reflect low virulence of pathogens, indicate mere colonization or contamination of urine, suggest infection confined to the lower urinary tract, or point to urine infections of insufficient duration or severity to induce an inflammatory response. The lower concentration, observed in our study, of bacteria isolated from urine of infants with normal urinalysis supports a number of these hypotheses. Unfortunately, there is currently no timely way to differentiate between these possibilities in a way that is accurate enough to have clinical utility at the initial visit.

To inform initial management decisions, therefore, it seems to us more pragmatic to identify in operational terms, as done in this study, febrile well-appearing infants at risk of bacteriuric sepsis. Risk-stratification for sepsis that is based on the urine leukocyte count undergirds expectant fever management strategies and is supported by studies that indicate not only a low risk to withholding empiric antibiotic treatment, but also the non-trivial prospect of developing acute pyelonephritis within months of antibiotic treatment in young children with few leukocytes in urine ultimately diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria. The low odds, observed in this study, of invasive sepsis complicating unrecognized bacteriuria in febrile infants with few leukocytes in urine, complements in the acute setting observations previously noted at longer time intervals. Together, these data reinforce fever management strategies that rely on screening tests like urinalysis for decision-making vis-à-vis supporting more judicious antibiotic treatment in febrile well-appearing young infants (specifically, those beyond the neonatal period) who satisfy low-risk criteria for sepsis.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^117GgmrA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this post-hoc analysis of a subcohort of a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of cardiac surgery patients without creatinine-based acute kidney injury, we did not find evidence of association between either pre- or postoperative biomarker levels and age or sex. However, there were significant differences in biomarker levels associated with urine dipstick findings, including proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyte esterase and nitrites.

All biomarkers were mildly correlated with hematuria, indicating that blood might interfere with biomarker levels or their measurement even in the absence of overt kidney injury evidenced by creatinine rise. Preexisting substances in the urine interfering with assays for novel analytes has been previously described.

We found evidence that proteinuria is associated with all four biomarkers both pre- and post-operatively. Dipstick proteinuria is a marker of preexisting kidney damage and is associated with both the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury. In addition, there is evidence that proteinuria may represent subclinical or early acute tubular necrosis, which has not yet manifested as a rise in creatinine. Thus, the part of the correlation we observed between proteinuria and biomarker levels may be the association between proteinuria and subclinical kidney injury. When we adjusted for measures of discrimination of AKI for urine protein, all of the pre-op AUCs diminished and 2 of the 4 post-operative AUCs diminished. Since dipstick proteinuria is a readily available and inexpensive test, future studies should assess the impact of accounting for dipstick proteinuria in evaluating the predictive and diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers.

We also found evidence of an association between NGAL levels and leukocyte esterase/nitrites. Urinary NGAL has been previously shown to be elevated in patients with septic shock. This is especially important, since critically ill patients, in whom novel biomarkers could potentially be deployed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, have high rates of urinary tract infections or may have leukocyturia/urine nitrites secondary to urinary catheters. This may lead to false positive AKI diagnosis in patients with no kidney injury but leukocyturia/urinary nitrites. Although, currently the mainstay of AKI management is supportive, if future therapies for AKI develop, misdiagnosis may expose patients with no kidney injury to unnecessary risk of a novel therapy.

Our study has several limitations. Since our study population was predominantly white, we could not assess racial differences in biomarker levels. In addition, we did not have urine sediment or histology to discern acute tubular necrosis in absence of serum creatinine rise and for correlation with biomarker levels. Thus, there may have been underlying subclinical injury that resulted in the correlations between the dipstick findings and the biomarkers levels.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^115v29Lu]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) definitions and related terms describe rUTI as Two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a six-month period within the preceding year. Systemic urinary tract infection is defined as An infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is Presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms, and pyuria is Presence of increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (WBC) in the urine as evidence of an inflammatory response in the urinary tract. Complicating factors that increase risk include Anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (e.g., stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), Immunocompromised host, and Indwelling urinary tract foreign body (e.g., indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: a retrospective cohort study [^111bdqxQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Other potential predictors of bacteriuric sepsis

For identifying young infants at risk of concomitant bacteriuric sepsis at the initial encounter, the leukocyte count in urine when compared to other potential predictors was more accurate than age, temperature, peripheral bands and leukocytes in blood (specifications of the non-linear model for leukocytes in peripheral blood are provided in the appendix). Specifically, the AUC value for urine leukocytes, at 0.94, was higher than that estimated for temperature (0.52), age (0.62), leukocytes in blood (0.64), and peripheral bands (0.78).

Other differences noted between bacteriuric infants with low versus high leukocyte counts in urine

Finally, among infants subsequently reported to have a positive urine culture, there were additional differences observed – besides the risk of invasive sepsis – between those with low and high urine leukocytes, supporting categorization to separate groups, Table 1. Specifically, among 245 (95%) febrile infants with specific notation in the medical chart of urine collected by bladder catheterization or supra-pubic tap, concentrations of bacteria in urine, as well as rates of hematuria, and proportions with positive urine nitrites differed significantly between the 2 groups. Concentrations of bacteria in urine differed significantly, both when compared directly (non-parametrically) and after collapsing the data from a semi-quantitative scale to a binary scale (being, the number of specimens with bacteria > 100,000 cfu/ml, Table 1).
