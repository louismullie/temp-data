## Question

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is also known as which of the following?

Answer Choices:
A. Bardo Thodol
B. Bardo Ngawang
C. Bardo Gyaltsen
D. Bardo Chogye

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which alternative name corresponds to The Tibetan Book of the Dead among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the canonical title of the text is in Tibetan and how it is commonly transliterated. Then, I should verify which of the answer choices matches that canonical name. Next, I will consider whether any of the other options are plausible alternatives or simply distractors. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly explain why the others do not fit.

> Let me first confirm the canonical name. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is traditionally known in Tibetan as the Bardo Thodol, which translates roughly to "Liberation Through Hearing in the Intermediate State", and this is the standard name used in scholarly and popular sources alike [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the options against that canonical name. Option A, Bardo Thodol, matches the canonical Tibetan title exactly, which strongly suggests it is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D introduce different second elements — Ngawang, Gyaltsen, and Chogye — that do not correspond to the traditional title of the text, making them unlikely alternatives for The Tibetan Book of the Dead [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any of the other names could be variant spellings or regional names. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking a less common but legitimate alternative. After reconsidering, none of the other options align with recognized variants of the title, whereas Bardo Thodol remains the consistently cited name across sources, reinforcing that A is the correct choice [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. Bardo Thodol.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is also known as the **Bardo Thodol** [^notfound], which translates to "Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State". This text is a foundational Tibetan Buddhist guide for navigating the **intermediate state (bardo)** between death and rebirth, and is traditionally read aloud to the deceased to support their journey. The other options listed (Bardo Ngawang, Bardo Gyaltsen, Bardo Chogye) are not recognized alternative names for this text.

---

## Alternative names and translations

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is primarily known by its Tibetan title, **Bardo Thodol** (བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ), which translates to "Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State" [^notfound]. This title reflects the text's central theme: providing guidance for the soul's journey through the intermediate state (bardo) between death and rebirth. The text is also sometimes referred to as the "Great Liberation Through Hearing" or simply the "Bardo Thodol".

---

## Historical and cultural context

The Bardo Thodol is part of a larger collection of Tibetan Buddhist texts known as the **Karma Lingpa cycle**, discovered in the 14th century by the treasure revealer Karma Lingpa. It is traditionally believed to have been authored by Padmasambhava, an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master who played a crucial role in establishing Buddhism in Tibet. The text is intended to be read aloud to the deceased during the 49-day period following death, a time considered critical for the soul's transition to the next life.

---

## Content and structure

The Bardo Thodol is divided into several sections, each addressing different stages of the **death and rebirth process**:

- **Chikhai Bardo**: The moment of death, characterized by the dissolution of consciousness and the appearance of the "clear light".
- **Chönyid Bardo**: The intermediate state, where the deceased experiences various visions and encounters with deities, both peaceful and wrathful.
- **Sidpa Bardo**: The state of rebirth, where the soul is drawn toward a new life based on its karma.

The text provides detailed instructions on how to navigate these stages, including meditation practices, visualizations, and mantras. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the true nature of reality and achieving liberation from the cycle of rebirth (**samsara**).

---

## Influence and significance

The Bardo Thodol has had a profound influence on Tibetan Buddhism and has also gained recognition in the Western world, particularly after its translation into English by **Walter Evans-Wentz** in the early 20th century. It has inspired numerous scholarly works, artistic creations, and spiritual practices, and continues to be studied and revered by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.

---

## Misconceptions and clarifications

There are several misconceptions regarding the **Bardo Thodol**. Some mistakenly believe it to be a single, unified text, whereas it is actually part of a larger collection of teachings. Others confuse it with different Tibetan texts or misinterpret its philosophical teachings. It is essential to approach the text with a clear understanding of its cultural and religious context to fully appreciate its significance.

---

## Conclusion

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is also known as the **Bardo Thodol**, a text that provides profound guidance for navigating the intermediate state between death and rebirth. Its teachings continue to inspire and enlighten practitioners worldwide, offering a unique perspective on life, death, and the nature of consciousness.

### Palliative procedures for congenital heart disease: imaging findings and complications [^fd191cb2]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Palliative procedures are performed for congenital heart diseases that are not amenable for definitive surgical procedures or as a component of hybrid procedures along with transcatheter interventions. Multimodality imaging plays an important role in the follow-up of these palliative procedures, mainly for the timely detection of complications and for planning any subsequent palliative or definitive procedure. Echocardiography is the first-line imaging modality, with CT and MRI used as complementary techniques in indeterminate cases. MRI provides anatomic, functional, flow, and tissue characterization information. CT is performed for the evaluation of vascular anatomy and when MRI cannot be performed due to contraindications, challenges, or artifacts. The modified Blalock-Taussig shunt procedure is the most common systemic-pulmonary artery (PA) shunt procedure, with thrombus being the most serious complication. Other complications of systemic-PA shunts include shunt stenosis, infection, pulmonary overcirculation, and cardiac failure. The Glenn shunt procedure is the second stage of palliation in single ventricle physiology, with thrombus, stenosis, superior vena cava syndrome, and infection being the common complications. The Fontan shunt procedure is the third stage of palliation in single ventricle physiology. Complications can be cardiovascular (heart failure, valve regurgitation, thromboembolism, shunt stenosis, arteriovenous malformation), venolymphatic (collaterals, protein-losing enteropathy, plastic bronchitis), or hepatic (congestion, cirrhosis, portal hypertension). PA banding is used to decrease pulmonary flow or to train the systemic ventricle. Complications include stenosis, thrombus, erosion, pseudoaneurysm, and subaortic obstruction. Atrial septostomy and atrial switch procedures are performed for increasing intracardiac mixing. Complications of atrial septostomy can be mechanical, traumatic, embolic, or electrical. Complications of the atrial switch procedure include baffle stenosis, baffle leak, and systemic ventricle failure. The authors review the role of multimodality imaging in the evaluation of these palliative procedures. © RSNA, 2023 See the invited commentary by Bardo and Popescu in this issue.

### Hemispheric asymmetries in resting-state EEG and fMRI are related to approach and avoidance behaviour, but not to eating behaviour or BMI [^df456704]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Since obesity is related to altered approach/avoidance behaviours, it might also be related to hemispheric asymmetries. This hypothesis is grounded in the right‐brain theory of obesity, which posits that hypoactivation of the right prefrontal cortex is an underlying factor of obesity (Alonso‐Alonso & Pascual‐Leone, 2007). It is based on findings of increased eating behaviour after damages to right‐hemispheric anterior brain areas (Regard & Landis, 1997; Short, Broderick, Patton, Arvanitakis, & Graff‐Radford, 2005). It is also supported by EEG experiments showing a higher right‐hemispheric bias for restrained eaters, a predominantly inhibitory feature (Silva, Pizzagalli, Larson, Jackson, & Davidson, 2002) and a positive relationship of left‐hemispheric bias with disinhibition and hunger (Ochner, Green, van Steenburgh, Kounios, & Lowe, 2009) as measured with the three‐factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard & Messick, 1985). The above‐mentioned studies, however, did not investigate a direct link between obesity measures, such as BMI and hemispheric asymmetries. Furthermore, due to the method of choice (EEG), those studies could focus mainly on cortical brain structures. Since obesity is often related to functional alterations in dopaminergic subcortical structures (Cone, Chartoff, Potter, Ebner, & Roitman, 2013; Friend et al. 2016; Geiger et al. 2009; Horstmann, Fenske, & Hankir, 2015; Narayanaswami, Thompson, Cassis, Bardo, & Dwoskin, 2013; Stice, Yokum, Burger, Epstein, & Small, 2011; Volkow, Wang, Fowler, & Telang, 2008; Vucetic, Carlin, Totoki, & Reyes, 2012), focusing on subcortical asymmetries using suitable neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, might further our knowledge regarding the neural correlates of obesity.

### Altered single-subject gray matter structural networks in drug-naïve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder children [^dadbdaaf]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

This study also demonstrated that different ADHD subtypes exhibited some differences in nodal properties. Specifically, we found that nodal attributes (degree, efficiency, and betweenness) of amygdala were different between the two subtypes. Amygdala is considered to play a crucial role in the control of emotion and impulsive behavior (Vazquez‐Sanroman, Arlington Wilson, & Bardo; Venniro et al.). Previous studies of ADHD have demonstrated that significantly altered volumes of amygdala, implicating anatomic disruption of amygdala in the pathogenesis of this disorder (Van Dessel et al; Van Dessel et al.). The present findings add to this model by demonstrating increased connections between the amygdala and other brain regions which were associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity.

The present study has some limitations. First, the brain atlas and processing pipeline we selected for constructing brain networks may affect the network analysis results. Second, while the construction of individual structural networks was based on the similarity of GM, the physiological correlates of these anatomic network alterations are still unclear and need to be investigated in the future. Third, this study excluded ADHD subjects with comorbidities, which generalize the findings to ADHD patients with more diverse and complicated.

In conclusion, the current study revealed excessive brain connectivity in individual similarity‐based GM networks in drug‐naïve ADHD children and adolescents, especially in the frontal striatal loop and amygdala. These alterations were related to cognitive dysfunction and impulsive behavior in ADHD, pointing to a potential network‐based neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of ADHD.

### Assessing perceived empathy based on genetic counselor gender using a randomized, hypothetical prenatal genetic counseling scenario design [^32883513]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Study limitations and future research

One limitation of this study was that all demographic information was self‐reported by the participants and could not be verified by our study approach. It is possible that keywords such as "genetic counselor" or "healthcare" led to a sampling bias from the MTurk site, and thus, the unexpectedly high proportion of participants with reported genetic counseling experience in our sample. Participants should not have mistaken the question to be an exclusionary screening question since it was explicitly stated prior to the item that "no previous experience with a genetic counselor is required". In future studies, researchers may choose to recruit a sample of participants with a known history of genetic counseling experience to more comprehensively explore the potential association between GC empathy rating and previous exposure to genetic counseling. Additionally, we did not assess interaction effects between demographic items, which future studies may aim to explore.

It should also be noted that we modified the language of the items on the empathy measure to read from a third‐person perspective rather than a second‐person perspective (example: "… making the couple feel at ease" vs. "… making you feel at ease"). Hence, a direct comparison of our findings to other studies using the CARE measure may have limited generalizability.

We were also unable to explore the impact of racial/ethnic identity on how participants perceived empathy. Over 90% of participants in our study identified as White, which is an overrepresentation from the MTurk community (Bardos et al; Buhrmester et al.). As such, we did not include analysis of racial/ethnic identity in our regression analysis, though an association between race/ethnicity and empathy may be plausible. For example, self‐reported ratings of empathy have been found to be associated with race/ethnicity in medical students (Berg et al.) and the general adult population (Sommerlad et al.), and that racial discordance between patients and providers can affect empathy ratings (Lorié et al.). In future studies, a larger, more diverse pool of participants can be sought to determine whether any such association exists.

### Tahyna virus and human infection, China [^66a00fd1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

RNA was extracted from an XJ0625 RNA lysate and subjected to reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) amplification by using genus primer sets designed for the detection of flavivirus, alphavirus, and bunyavirus RNA. The sequence amplified by the bunyavirus genus primer had a high homology with TAHV. Subsequently, microplate plaque-reduction neutralization tests were performed with BHK-21 cells and immune ascites fluid with immunity to prototype TAHV (Bardos 92; provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Fort Collins, CO, USA) to validate the molecular identification. XJ0625-associated cytopathic effects were completely inhibited at ascites fluid dilutions up to 1:3,200.

The nucleotide sequence of the small (S) (EU622820) and medium (M) (EU622819) segments of XJ0625 were sequenced by using the primers SF (5′-AGTAGTGTACCCCACTTGAAT AC-3′), SR (5′-CAAATGGATTTGATCCTGATGC-3′), M1F (5′-CACAAGTTCCAAGA TGATGTT-3′), M 1R (5′-CTGTGCCTTCTGCTTGGACTA-3′), M2F (5′-GTCCAAGC AGAAGGCACAGAT-3′), M2R (5′-GTGGTCACTGTACATTCTCCTGAA-3′), M3F (5′-CACACTTCTGTTTAGCAGATACC-3′), M 3R (5′-CTCTAGTCTATAGCTTGCTG GTGTT-3′), M4F (5′-GCACCAATCTGAACGCAATAACAC-3′), and M4R (5′-AGTAG TGTGCTACCAAGTATA-3′). By using Clustal X version 1.8, sequences were aligned with those of viruses belonging to the California virus group. The phylogenic status of XJ0625 isolate was assessed by using MEGA version 3.1 software, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining algorithm with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

### Oil palm expansion and deforestation in southwest Cameroon associated with proliferation of informal Mills [^c1bbdf5c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Both the oil palm expansion and deforestation non-spatial binomial logit models (Supplementary Table 4) yielded error terms with high spatial autocorrelation. Moran's I was estimated at 0.439, relative to an expected value of −0.001 (σ² < 0.0001, two-tailed, Student's t test, p < 0.0001) for the non-spatial oil palm expansion model, and 0.102, relative to an expected value of −0.003 (σ² < 0.0001, two-tailed, Student's t test, p < 0.0001) for the non-spatial deforestation model. To address the issue of spatial autocorrelation, autocovariate regressions were fit by including a spatial autocovariate term in each model. Dormannand Dormann et al. put forth the claim that autocovariate models can underestimate the effects of important parameters and generate bias in the estimates. Bardos and coauthors demonstrate, however, that this is not the case when a valid neighborhood weighting scheme is employed. We used the spdep and lattice packages in R to calculate neighborhood weights using the method described in Bardos et al. Parameter estimates from the spatial autocovariate regression were comparable to the non-spatial models (Supplementary Table 4).

Model parameters and accuracy were estimated using 10-fold cross validation for the non-spatial and spatial autocovariate model. Robust (White–Huber) standard errors were calculated using White's estimator via the foreign and sandwich packages in R. Results are reported from the spatial autocovariate oil palm expansion (n = 1,929,816) and deforestation (n = 12,266) models. To evaluate performance of the overall model, prediction error was calculated as the average area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) across all cross validation test sets using the ROCR package in R (Supplementary Fig. 4). Because the purpose of this analysis was inference, as opposed to prediction, the AUC values reported in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 demonstrate sufficiently reasonable performance of both models. We focus on inference related to the significance of specific milling variables of interest in the model, and their relationships with oil palm expansion and deforestation.

### Web-based surveillance and global Salmonella distribution, 2000–2002 [^7da6e016]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

In North America in 2002, S. Typhimurium was more common than S. Enteritidis among human isolates. S. Newport and S. Heidelberg also accounted for a sizeable proportion of the isolates. Among nonhuman isolates, a corresponding pattern emerges; S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg, and S. Newport were most common. S. Enteritidis was not reported among the 10 most common nonhuman serotypes. The relative ranking of serotypes did not change in the 3-year period; S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype in humans and nonhuman isolates from 2000 to 2002. In Oceania in 2000, the only year in which > 1 country reported data, S. Typhimurium accounted for 62% of human Salmonella isolates, followed by S. Virchow and S. Enteritidis.

Some serotypes were reported among the 15 most common serotypes in only 1 region during the 3-year period and therefore were classified as region-specific serotypes. Africa was the only region to report S. Brancaster among nonhuman isolates. Asia was the only region to report S. Rissen (human), S. Panama and S. Stanley (nonhuman), and S. Weltevreden (human and nonhuman). Europe was the only region to report S. Blockley, S. Kisangani, S. Kottbus, S. Ohio, and S. Stanleyville from human isolates and S. Indiana and S. Isangi from nonhuman isolates. Latin America and the Caribbean was the only region to report S. Bardo, S. Muenster, and S. Rubislaw among human isolates. North America was the only region to report S. Javiana (human) and S. Muenster (nonhuman).

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Acute human inkoo and chatanga virus infections, Finland [^49edcaba]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Serologic Testing

Serum samples were screened with an indirect INKV-IgM immunofluorescence (IFA) test described previously. In brief, IFA slides contained Vero E6 cells (green monkey kidney cells, American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1586, Manassas, VA, USA); 30% of the cells were infected with INKV. Samples (serum diluted at 1:20 ratio; CSF undiluted) were incubated on slides overnight and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline; anti–human IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was then added, and samples were incubated for 1 hour. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were dried and examined with a fluorescence microscope. IgM-positive samples were retested with IgM IFA after removal of IgG by using Gullsorb treatment (Meridian Bioscience, Inc. Cincinnati, OH, USA) for the serum samples. To ensure that diagnostic criteria of acute infection were met, as previously described, IgM-positive samples were confirmed with IgG IFA testing and studied with INKV prototype strain KN3641, CHATV Möhkö strain M07–1, and TAHV prototype strain Bardos 92 plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). PRNT was performed because of the occurrence of cross-reactions.

Reverse Transcription PCR

When possible (i.e. when sufficient sample remained after serologic testing), IgM-positive samples were tested with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to study the presence and kinetics of viremia and to obtain information on the viral sequences. RNA extraction was performed by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with ERT-Ro Roche Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). PCR methods, as described previously, were modified to work with the Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA). The mixture included 1.25 µL of each primer (10 µmol/L), 12.5 µL of the Phusion Flash 2X buffer, and 8 µL of sterile distilled deionized water, producing a total volume of 25 µL, which included 2 µL of cDNA.

### Is framing of treatment options misleading? Maybe, but not because of a lower-bound reading [^b170f143]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a recent paper, Yeo argues that the framing of treatment options by physicians in the contexts of patient's decision-making conflicts with a physician's duty of disclosure. I argue that this conclusion is drawn too quickly, as it is questionable whether the empirical research on which Yeo relies is applicable to the framing of treatment options. This means that Yeo's main assumption is undermined, and we should hold off on concluding that the framing of treatment options is misleading.

### Dementia in ancient Greece and Rome [^5024c065]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

We respond to the commentary by Ballenger et al. While appreciating "our provocative article", they called for "a more rigorous historical approach… " In fact, we documented from known texts how ancient physicians recognized memory loss in the elderly, Solon to Galen, who gave stereotypical descriptions of the negative aspects of old age in historical sequence. Texts from the Roman era with references to elderly memory loss did not have any earlier Greek counterpart, suggesting historically novel environmental and lifestyle factors in dementia that are associated with the modern dementia epidemic. Our initial inquiry, while historically rigorous, warrants further discussion.

### The four horsemen of the apocalypse: tropical medicine in the fight against plague, death, famine, and war [^21fe7efb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Most of the diseases on this list, with the exception of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, are also known as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The conceptualization of these conditions as NTDs was put into the peer-reviewed biomedical literature in 2005 and 2006,–and refers to them as a group of chronic parasitic and related tropical infections that are highly disabling, disfiguring, and stigmatizing. Many of the NTDs are non-emerging infections and have afflicted humankind for centuries, and their descriptions are found in ancient texts. In the 15th century, Dürer might have recognized several NTDs such as ascariasis and leprosy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently created a list of 17 common NTDs, and the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases recognizes an expanded list of almost 40 NTDs. A common element of the NTDs, and one that we will return to later, is their ability to actually cause poverty because of their profound effects on child growth and cognitive and intellectual development, pregnancy outcome, and agricultural worker productivity. The NTDs are also the most common infections of girls and women living in poverty. Together, the NTDs represent the most prevalent adverse health conditions among the world's poor living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). I often tell my lay colleagues, the NTDs are the "most important diseases you never heard of".

Death.

The tropical diseases are also important global causes of death. A new list of the world's tropical infections ranked according to the number of persons they kill annually is shown in (Table 2). To no one's surprise, malaria heads the list with more than 600,000 people dying annually, mostly children from P. falciparum infection, followed by more than 100,000 deaths annually from schistosomiasis, typhoid fever, and cholera, and tens of thousands of deaths from kinetoplastid infections (leishmaniasis and Chagas disease), amebiasis, dengue, and soil-transmitted helminthiases. In all, an estimated 1.5 million persons die each year from tropical infections. To put this number in perspective, together the tropical infections kill more persons than the number of children who die annually from lower respiratory tract infections, and together the tropical infections cause almost as many deaths as the 1.8 million people who died from HIV/AIDS in 2010.

### Cancer and fertility preservation: international recommendations from an expert meeting [^a9ecc29d]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Over the last several years, thanks to improvements in the prognoses of cancer patients, increasing attention has been given to survivors' fertility issues. International guidelines on this topic have been recently updated and published. However, since then, new data have become available, and several issues in this field remain controversial. On the basis of the discussion during the meeting, the expert panel has drafted a total of 10 recommendations (Table 5).

Table 5
The 10 recommendations drafted by the expert panel

Although there is a great interest in this field, due to the lack of large prospective cohort studies and randomized studies on these topics, the level of evidence is not higher than 3 for most of the recommendations highlighting the need of further research efforts. Several registries and prospective studies are ongoing to evaluate feasibility, safety and efficacy of fertility preserving strategies in cancer patients and encouraging patient participation in these studies is crucial to acquire more robust conclusions.

### ア ン グ ル ： ダ ラ イ ・ ラ マ が 89 歳 に 、 チ ベ ッ ト に 迫 る 後 継 者 問 題… [^c50ebb42]. jp.reuters.com (2024). Medium credibility.

In an Indian monastery surrounded by snow-capped mountains, a prominent monk overseeing the protection and prophecies for the followers of the 14th Dalai Lama, the supreme leader of Tibetan Buddhism, has been growing increasingly concerned. As the Dalai Lama approaches his 89th birthday on the 13th, discussions swirl around what the future holds, with China asserting its right to choose a successor while a high-ranking oracle, known as the Nechung, ponders the next steps. Unlike in many countries where a change in leadership marks the end of an era, in Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that leaders like the Dalai Lama reincarnate into newborns after passing away. Currently undergoing medical treatment in the United States, the Dalai Lama plans to reveal details about his successor around his 90th birthday, including whether he will reincarnate and where, following a process of receiving prophecies and certifying the "rebirth".

The Dalai Lama, a charismatic figure who has promoted Buddhism globally and fought for the Tibetan cause while in exile, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his efforts. Despite being labeled a "dangerous separatist" by the Chinese government, he advocates for a "middle way" seeking autonomy and religious freedom within China. The issue of succession raises concerns as whoever succeeds him may lack international experience and recognition, potentially impacting the Tibetan freedom movement. As the successor dilemma unfolds, scholars point out that Tibet was under the rule of the Mongol Empire during the 13th-14th centuries under the Yuan Dynasty, overlapping with much of present-day China. While China claims sovereignty over Tibet from that period, experts argue that the relationship between the two has evolved over centuries, with Tibet maintaining autonomy for most of that time.

Following a failed uprising in Tibet against China in 1959, the Dalai Lama went into exile in India, where China, taking an atheistic stance, recognized two youths as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking figure in Tibetan Buddhism, in 1995. Many Buddhists view China's selection as illegitimate, raising concerns that a similar parallel certification process may occur for the Dalai Lama's successor. Amid the succession uncertainties, there is a growing anticipation of what lies ahead after the Dalai Lama, a revered figure among Tibetan exiles, passes away. The Tibetan Youth Congress, while respecting the "middle way, " expresses desires for complete independence, reflecting the varied aspirations within the Tibetan community.

### Consensus on prostate cancer treatment of localized disease with very low, low, and intermediate risk: a report from the first prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries (PCCCDC) [^6a5a40cb]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although PSA values provide limited information regarding the extent and location of the cancer, and in some groups of patients may have harms and benefits, it is a required test when managing patients with intermediate-risk PCa after treatment. The panel recommends PSA measurement every 3–6 months for 5 years and then every year for follow-up of patients with PCa, including in areas of limited resources where the issue may not be the availability of the test itself but the accessibility to a stable healthcare provider, a complete medical record, or the patient's adherence to the appointments.

The recommendations from this panel in treating patients with very low-, low-, and intermediate-risk PCa in areas of limited resources are the same as or very similar to those made in developing countries for patients with a life expectancy of > 5–10 years. Differences in treatment recommendations are more apparent for patients with a life expectancy of < 5–10 years.

### Amphetamine (dyanavel XR) [^4d150a5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

DYANAVEL XR contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DYANAVEL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. DYANAVEL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including DYANAVEL XR, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

DYANAVEL XR may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including DYANAVEL XR include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

DYANAVEL XR may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

Evidence quality was categorized according to the GRADE framework, with judgments about the quality of the included studies and/or synthesized evidence incorporating risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and any other considerations (eg, publication bias) that may influence evidence quality. These judgments considered study number and design, statistical data and importance of outcomes (Table 2). The quality of evidence reflects the confidence that the estimate of the effect is adequate to support each recommendation, largely determined by the expert evidence synthesis team. GRADE acknowledges that evidence quality is a continuum; any discrete categorization involves some arbitrary decisions; nevertheless, the advantages of simplicity, transparency, and clarity outweigh these limitations.

When AS is selected for the treatment of very low- and low-risk PCa, the panel was split in recommending the timing for which at least one confirmatory biopsy must be performed for a patient to be considered for AS protocol, with almost half recommending between 6 and 12 months (48.84%) and some (38.37%) recommending 12–24 months. In the same case, in an area with limited resources, the panel reversed its recommendation with 49.41% selecting 12–24 months and 35.29% indicating 6–12 months. For follow-up tests, half of the panel (50%) recommended annual MRI and digital rectal exam (DRE) and PSA measurement every 6 months and biopsy in the case of signs of progression, and some (40.48%) made the same recommendation with difference of the biopsy every 1–1.5 years. When considering an area with limited resources and no MRI available, for follow-up tests, most of the panel (55.29%) recommended DRE and PSA measurement every 6 months and biopsy every 1–1.5 and one fifth (21.18%) selected DRE and PSA measurement every 12 months and biopsy every 1–1.5 years.

### Fenofibrate (Antara) [^bdf65b4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Prior to Initiation of Antara

Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high triglyceride levels and manage as appropriate.
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Antara and should continue this diet during treatment with Antara.
In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting Antara.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 43 mg or 130 mg orally once daily. ○ Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.
- **Primary hyperlipidemia**: ○ The recommended dosage of Antara is 130 mg orally once daily.
- Administer Antara as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food.
- Advise patients to swallow Antara capsules whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules.
- Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Antara. Discontinue Antara in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment.
- If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.
- Advise patients to take Antara at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Antara and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dosage of 43 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dose.
Antara is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Rheum officinale (a traditional Chinese medicine) for chronic kidney disease [^93e31724]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue worldwide. Standard therapies to delay CKD progression include dietary protein restriction and administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) to help control blood pressure and confer additional renoprotective effects. Despite such interventions, CKD incidence and mortality rates continue to increase. Rheum officinale (Da Huang) a medicinal herb used widely in China to treat CKD has been reported to offer a range of pharmacological properties that may delay disease progression.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of Rheum officinale for preventing the progression of CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register and CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2011), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database), and Wanfang Data. We also handsearched reference lists of articles. We applied no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the benefits and harms of Rheum officinale for preventing the progression of CKD regardless of dosage, type, maturity, mode of administration, duration of treatment, or storage time before use.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, assessed study quality, and extracted data. We expressed results for dichotomous outcomes (need for renal replacement therapy, all-cause mortality, quality of life) as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes (glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), blood urea nitrogen (BUN)) were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

We identified nine studies that enrolled 682 participants. None of the studies reported blinding or group allocation methods. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of incomplete outcome reporting; three studies were judged to be a low risk of selective reporting (protocols were available and/or all outcomes relevant to the this review were reported); and two studies were judged free of other potential biases. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale with no treatment and two made comparisons with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Compared with no treatment, Rheum officinale had a positive effect on SCr (MD -87.49 µmol/L, 95% CI -139.25 to -35.72) and BUN (MD -10.61 mmol/L, 95% CI -19.45 to -2.21). Compared with captopril, a statistically significant difference was not demonstrated in relation to Rheum officinale for any outcome (BUN, CrCl, or patients' capacity to undertake work). No data were available on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment. Only minor adverse events were reported in association with Rheum officinale.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available evidence concerning the efficacy of Rheum officinale to improve SCr and BUN levels in patients with CKD is both scant and low quality. Although Rheum officinale does not appear to be associated with serious adverse events among patients with CKD, there is no current evidence to support any recommendation for its use.

### Comment on' the latency period of mesothelioma among a cohort of British asbestos workers (1978–2005)': methodological problems with case-only survival analysis [^124b7823]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The mistake of restricting the analysis on cases without considering the population from which cases originated was recognised almost 50 years ago by. Despite that paper and the fact that scientific papers, statistical and epidemiological books explicitly discourage the analysis of survival times among cases only, this problem occasionally re-appears in the literature. Notably, this problem affected also studies based on case series from mesothelioma registries.

In summary, the results reported in the paper byare not interpretable because they were on the basis of analyses among mesothelioma deaths only, which are known to be incorrect. The only meaningful way to address the issue of mesothelioma latency using survival techniques is to include all subjects, and to treat those who do not die from mesothelioma during the follow-up period as 'censored'. This approach implies the use of information from all the 94 960 workers in the GB cohort.

After all, occupational epidemiologists do not restrict analyses to dead workers while studying carcinogens and oncologists do not restrict analyses to dead patients while analysing cancer survival.

### Professional recommendations: disclosing facts and values [^b676eafb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

It is not unusual for patients and their families, when confronted with difficult medical choices, to ask their physicians for advice. This paper outlines the shades of meaning of two questions frequently put to physicians: "What should I do?" and "What would you do?" It is argued that these are not questions about objective matters of fact. Hence, any response to such questions requires an understanding, appreciation, and disclosure of the personal context and values that inform the recommendation. A framework for considering and articulating a response to these questions is suggested, using as a heuristic the phrasing "If I were you… /If it were me… "

### Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) for heart failure [^9653a266]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Shengmai, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has long been used as a complementary treatment for heart failure in China. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2012.

Objectives

To determine the effect (both benefits and harms) of Shengmai in treatment of people with heart failure.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (Issue 5 of 12, April 2013); DARE on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 of 4, April 2013); MEDLINE (1948 to June Week 1 2013); EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 23); AMED (1985 to August 2008); BIOSIS (1969 to 7 June 2013); CBM (1978 to June 2013); VIP (1989 to June 2013); and CNKI (1979 to June 2013). We also handsearched Chinese journals and did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Shengmai plus usual treatment for heart failure versus usual treatment alone, or Shengmai versus placebo, irrespective of blinding status. In this update we only included studies with a clear description of randomisation methods and classified as true RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We calculated dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes without heterogeneity; and a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes with heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included a total of 14 RCTs (858 patients) in this review update, four of which were new trials. Of these 14 RCTs, 11 trials compared Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone, and three trials compared Shengmai with placebo. Improvement of NYHA functional classification was more common in patients taking Shengmai plus usual treatment than in those receiving usual treatment alone (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51; 10 trials, 672 participants; low quality evidence). Beneficial effects of Shengmai in treating heart failure were also observed in other outcomes, including exercise test, ejection fraction and cardiac output. The three RCTs (106 patients) comparing Shengmai with placebo reported improvement in NYHA functional classification and in stroke volume. Three of the 14 RCTs reported a total of six patients with mild adverse effects and two were withdrawn due to the adverse effects. The adverse events rate was 1.21%.

Authors' Conclusions

Shengmai may exert a positive effect on heart failure, especially for improving NYHA functional classification when Shengmai plus usual treatment is used. The review results should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias of the included studies (particularly regarding allocation concealment and blinding), the small sample size of these studies, and the significant heterogeneity in outcomes such as ejection function, cardiac output and stroke volume. There was no evidence available concerning the effect of Shengmai on mortality, and more high quality studies with long-term follow-up are warranted.

Viral hemorrhagic fevers in travelers — Many viruses that are naturally present in rodents, bats, or non-human primates have the potential to spill over into human populations, with Ebola and Marburg viruses as examples; such viruses might cause serious, hemorrhagic, or otherwise deadly diseases, and if the virus is easily transmitted from person to person, then clusters, outbreaks, or even an epidemic might ensue. Healthcare professionals concerned that a returned traveler may have a possible viral hemorrhagic fever should notify public health authorities and initiate precautions to protect the patient and others, and features of a viral hemorrhagic fever include morbilliform eruptions, bleeding in the skin such as petechiae (pinpoint bleeding) and ecchymoses (bruises), gingival bleeding, epistaxis, and other features such as jaundice.

### Making healthcare decisions in a person's best interests when they lack capacity: clinical guidance based on a review of evidence [^e262f6ce]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Undertaking the best interests process

This second half of the article considers how significant healthcare decisions can be made using the best interests process that has been discussed above. This section covers the range of possible decisions, including those relating to life-sustaining treatments, but it is applicable to all other significant decisions. The supplementary data gives aide memoires to support anyone running or participating in a meeting, covering preparation and the meeting.

Although this section focuses on a best interests meeting, making decisions in someone's best interests really requires a process that encompasses both preparatory work (e.g. collecting and collating information) and actions after the meeting, often including further reviews or meetings.

Initiating the process – recognizing need

The starting point must be to recognize when someone lacks the capacity to make complex healthcare decisions. This is covered in the companion article. If someone lacks capacity, it is usually possible to triage a person into one of four groups:

Definitely lack capacity, are unlikely to recover it soon, and need or will need significant decisions made (including people who never developed capacity);
Are lacking capacity, but: no significant (irreversible and/or risky) immediate decisions are needed, and capacity is likely to be regained before any significant decisions are needed;
Definitely have sufficient capacity to make all necessary decisions some patients will need extra time and help;
Very uncertain whether they have capacity and needs a significant decision to be made. This will include people who have fluctuating capacity

Patients in Group C simply need to be given more time by and support from the clinical team to make an informed decision. Support is not always given, but it is a legal requirement. Patients in Group D will need further assessment, usually by all those involved, and will usually need a meeting both to decide about capacity and to plan further management; if there is an attorney or deputy, they should be involved, as should family and friends.

For patients in Groups A and B, if there is a valid and applicable Advance Decision or an appointed attorney or deputy with the relevant powers in place, then the healthcare team needs to adhere to the Advance Decision or to ask the deputy or attorney to act as decision-maker; if the deputy or attorney does not wish to act as decision-maker, decision-making will revert to the doctor with overall responsibility for the patient's care.

### Biliary tract cancers: understudied and poorly understood [^1d08128e]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Biliary tract cancers are a heterogeneous group of cancers that arise in either the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts or the gallbladder. Local therapy with surgical resection and perhaps radiation therapy is used for localized disease. There is no known effective adjuvant therapy, although various combinations have been used clinically without definitive data showing a benefit. The most standard chemotherapy for metastatic disease is gemcitabine plus cisplatin based on a single positive randomized trial. Genetic mutations that may lead to better, targeted therapy choices are being identified, albeit with variable frequency. Early studies of targeted agents have been negative, but these were in unselected patients where it was unknown whether the target was activated in any individual patient. Careful selection of patients enrolling onto trials of targeted agents will make the subsets of biliary tract cancers even smaller but is likely necessary to improve outcomes from these deadly diseases.

### Avicenna's treatise on otology in medieval persia [^f1325191]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Avicenna (AD 980–1037) was one of the best-known physicians of his time. Born in Persia, he gained notoriety both in the local and international scenes. Avicenna's best-known book, Canon of Medicine, was the standard textbook of medicine for more than five centuries in Europe and the Persian Empire. Because no English translation of the entire Canon of Medicine exists, the authors have recently translated the treatise on otologic diseases from Persian into English. Correlation was made with the Arabic text as well to ensure accuracy. This study provides a review of Avicenna's significant contributions to the concepts in anatomy and the pathophysiology of ear diseases. Herbal and nonherbal medications used in the treatment of otologic disorders are also discussed.

### Patients' preferred place of death: patients are willing to consider their preferences, but someone has to ask them [^ea77b716]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Patients are often unaware of their preferred place of death until someone introduces this topic for consideration.
Due to unawareness, some patients die before they consider their end-of-life preferences.
Alone living patients, patients with more chronic diseases and patients who were not admitted to hospital are more often unaware.

It has been two decades since advance directives have become an integral part of health care. Impediments to their optimal usage are common and multifactorial. Decisions commonly have to be made when patients are unable to do so or choose not to participate in decision making, often at the end of life. The use of two questions, 1) "If you cannot, or choose not to participate in health care decisions, with whom should we speak?" and 2) "If you cannot, or choose not to participate in decision making, what should we consider when making decisions about your care?", may accomplish the major goals of an advance directive.

### 2025 Brazilian evidence-based guideline on the management of obesity and prevention of cardiovascular disease and obesity-associated complications: a position statement by five medical societies [^d9183de9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of various treatment options, including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, the management of obesity remains challenging. Achieving and maintaining weight loss can be challenging, and the long-term outcomes of obesity treatment are frequently modest. Moreover, the increasing complexity of anti-obesity treatments, some with proven benefits in cardiorenal-metabolic syndrome outcomes, underscores the urgent need for new stratification tools to guide treatment selection in specific clinical situations.

Accordingly, this guideline aims to structure obesity treatment within the context of CVD prevention, considering both CV risk and obesity stage. It provides evidence-based recommendations to support healthcare professionals in personalizing optimal therapeutic strategies for individuals living with obesity.

### Diagnosing dying: an integrative literature review [^9bceb0bd]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2014). Medium credibility.

The importance of exposing uncertainty in diagnosing dying cannot be overly emphasised. It is an important consideration for the individual clinician and the healthcare team, but equally for patients and carer(s). Allowing the possibility of death to be acknowledged and any plan of treatment to be discussed realistically gives precious time for the patient and family to express their preferences. This facilitates an individualised plan of care, particularly where no restorative treatment is possible or further decline would herald the end of life. Paradoxically, being open about uncertainty may support planning and build trust with the patient and their carer(s), removing the need to rely on a 'tick box' approach to diagnosing dying.

Thus, strategies used to reduce uncertainty should reflect that decision making is influenced by clinical skills, professional judgement and clinical wisdom. In this context, clinical wisdom describes a depth of intuitive expertise, reflective of a strong skill base, which frames the decision-making process. Clinical wisdom is evident when symptoms are potentially reversible or when the reality of dying is in evidence and a decision on the right course of action is needed. Clinical wisdom assists in determining appropriate goals of care and interventions to ensure that the patient's wishes are met and a dignified death is achieved.
