## Question

Define sepsis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the definition of sepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source and the exact wording of the current definition. Then, I should verify the three core conceptual components embedded in that definition. Next, I will review the operational clinical criteria, especially SOFA and qSOFA, and confirm their evidentiary basis. After that, I need to check how this differs from older SIRS-based definitions and why the change was made. Finally, I should consider special populations, controversies, and practical bedside application, making sure I reconcile any apparent inconsistencies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative definition. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3), published in JAMA in 2016, defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and this formulation is echoed in contemporary reviews and guidelines, so I should anchor to that wording to avoid drift [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the three conceptual pillars embedded in that sentence. First, there must be infection, which can be suspected or confirmed and spans bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic etiologies. Second, the host response must be dysregulated, meaning it is maladaptive and injurious beyond local infection control. Third, there must be life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is the clinical manifestation that distinguishes sepsis from uncomplicated infection, and this triad is consistently emphasized in Sepsis-3 and subsequent summaries [^112XneM3] [^111fhrDL].

> Next, I should review the operational clinical criteria. For adults with suspected infection, organ dysfunction is operationalized as an acute increase in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more from baseline, which correlates with in-hospital mortality greater than 10 percent; wait, let me verify the mortality association and the baseline-change approach, yes, that threshold and the relative increase rationale are explicitly stated in Sepsis-3 and supported by validation work [^115tUKZq] [^112DCACY].

> I will now examine the bedside screening tool. For rapid identification outside the ICU, the quick SOFA (qSOFA) uses three variables — respiratory rate 22/min or higher, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg or less — and a score of 2 or more identifies patients at higher risk of poor outcomes; I should double-check that qSOFA is a screening prompt rather than a diagnostic definition, and indeed Sepsis-3 and subsequent commentaries emphasize its prognostic, not definitional, role [^115tUKZq] [^116rLepk].

> Let me consider septic shock next. Septic shock is defined within Sepsis-3 as a subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, identified clinically by vasopressor requirement to maintain mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg or higher and serum lactate greater than 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation, which is associated with mortality greater than 40 percent; I should confirm that both vasopressor need and hyperlactatemia are required, and yes, that is the Sepsis-3 criterion [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf].

> Now, I need to contrast this with prior definitions. Historically, sepsis was defined using the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) plus infection, with severe sepsis denoting sepsis with organ dysfunction; Sepsis-3 removed SIRS from the definition and retired the term severe sepsis as redundant because organ dysfunction is now integral to sepsis itself, which is a pivotal shift I should explicitly acknowledge [^115tUKZq] [^112XneM3].

> But wait, what if SIRS was actually useful for early detection; I should review the rationale for removal. The Sepsis-3 task force found SIRS overly sensitive and nonspecific, capturing many patients with uncomplicated infection and missing others with organ dysfunction, and large datasets showed no mortality inflection at the two-SIRS threshold; moreover, patients with infection and organ dysfunction but fewer than two SIRS criteria still had substantial mortality, undermining SIRS as a gatekeeper for severity [^11183mWR] [^115tUKZq].

> Next, I should review the evidentiary basis for SOFA and qSOFA to ensure I am not overstating their performance. In a large derivation and validation cohort, SOFA outperformed SIRS and performed similarly to LODS for predicting in-hospital mortality in ICU patients with suspected infection, while qSOFA showed superior prognostic discrimination to SOFA and SIRS in non-ICU settings; I should confirm those AUROC comparisons and the non-ICU advantage of qSOFA, which are reported in the Sepsis-3 validation study [^112DCACY].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world applicability and controversies. Some hospitals report difficulty implementing SOFA documentation, and critics argue that requiring organ dysfunction may delay recognition of evolving sepsis; additionally, qSOFA has lower sensitivity than SIRS for early risk, so a negative qSOFA does not exclude sepsis, reinforcing the need for clinical judgment and serial reassessment rather than reliance on any single score [^113DeioC] [^116P7RyS] [^115rUxsU].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. Pediatric sepsis still largely uses modified SIRS-based criteria from 2005, and ongoing work seeks pediatric-specific organ-dysfunction frameworks; neonatal sepsis lacks a unified definition and often relies on culture-based criteria rather than organ dysfunction; maternal sepsis has WHO-endorsed criteria emphasizing clinically detectable organ dysfunction during pregnancy and the peripartum period, reflecting population-specific physiology and risk [^111HXsYV] [^113Nqtgd] [^114HdcVN].

> Let me reconsider practical bedside application to avoid misinterpretation. Sepsis remains a clinical diagnosis grounded in suspected or confirmed infection plus new or worsening organ dysfunction; clinicians should integrate history, exam, and labs, calculate SOFA when feasible, use qSOFA as a risk prompt, and escalate care promptly when organ dysfunction is present, recognizing that no single biomarker or score replaces clinical synthesis and that early recognition and timely antibiotics and organ support are central to improving outcomes [^1115wEis] [^114nkjGV].

> In summary, I should confirm the final synthesis. Modern sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized in adults as an increase in SOFA score of 2 points or more from baseline in the setting of suspected infection, with qSOFA serving as a rapid prognostic screen outside the ICU and septic shock defined by vasopressor requirement with hyperlactatemia; this Sepsis-3 framework supersedes the older SIRS-based definitions and aims to align diagnosis with severity and risk while acknowledging implementation challenges and the need for clinical judgment [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf].

---

Sepsis is **life-threatening organ dysfunction** [^115tUKZq] from a dysregulated host response to infection, identified by a **SOFA rise ≥ 2 points** [^112DCACY] or a **qSOFA ≥ 2** in suspected infection [^114iHXrQ]. Septic shock is a subset with vasopressors needed to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and lactate > 2 mmol/L despite fluids, reflecting profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities [^115A1XRf]. Early recognition and prompt antibiotics and hemodynamic support are critical to reduce mortality [^1155TWWm] [^114nkjGV].

## Historical evolution of sepsis definitions

The definition of sepsis has evolved through **three consensus conferences** — Sepsis-1 (1991), Sepsis-2 (2001), and Sepsis-3 (2016) — reflecting advances in pathophysiology and clinical practice [^113faCoX].

- **Sepsis-1 (1991)**: Defined sepsis as SIRS due to infection, with severe sepsis as sepsis with organ dysfunction or hypotension, and septic shock as persistent hypotension despite fluids [^113faCoX].

- **Sepsis-2 (2001)**: Expanded SIRS criteria and introduced the PIRO model (Predisposition, Infection, Response, Organ dysfunction) [^116Zuz9Y].

- **Sepsis-3 (2016)**: Redefined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection, removing SIRS and introducing SOFA/qSOFA for risk stratification [^115tUKZq].

---

## Current sepsis definition (Sepsis-3)

The Sepsis-3 definition emphasizes **organ dysfunction** as the core feature, operationalized by the SOFA score [^115tUKZq].

- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized by an increase in SOFA score of ≥ 2 points [^115tUKZq].

- **Septic shock**: A subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, identified by vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^115tUKZq].

---

## Clinical criteria and tools for sepsis identification

The Sepsis-3 task force introduced **SOFA and qSOFA** for early identification and risk stratification.

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Components** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SOFA | ICU patients with suspected infection | - Respiratory <br/> - Coagulation <br/> - Liver <br/> - Cardiovascular <br/> - Central nervous system <br/> - Renal systems | Predicts mortality and identifies organ dysfunction [^112DCACY] |
| qSOFA | Non-ICU patients with suspected infection | - Respiratory rate ≥ 22 <br/> - Altered mentation <br/> - Systolic BP ≤ 100 mmHg | Rapid bedside screening for sepsis risk [^115tUKZq] |

## Pathophysiology of sepsis

Sepsis arises from a **complex interplay** between the pathogen and the host immune response, leading to widespread inflammation, immune dysregulation, and organ dysfunction [^111p1kWS]. Key mechanisms include **hyperinflammation**, characterized by an excessive cytokine release causing tissue damage and organ failure, and **immunosuppression**, with impaired immune function increasing susceptibility to secondary infections. Endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy contribute to microvascular thrombosis, hypoperfusion, and organ dysfunction.

---

## Clinical manifestations and organ dysfunction

Sepsis presents with varied signs and symptoms, often reflecting **underlying organ dysfunction** [^113p97aa]:

- **Respiratory**: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemia.

- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, shock, arrhythmias.

- **Renal**: Acute kidney injury, oliguria.

- **Hepatic**: Hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy.

- **Neurologic**: Altered mental status, delirium.

- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

---

## Epidemiology and mortality

Sepsis is a **global health burden** with substantial mortality and morbidity [^112o3sXj]. Global incidence is estimated at 50 million cases annually, with mortality around 20% in adults. Mortality increases with severity: sepsis ~10–20%, severe sepsis ~20–50%, and septic shock ~40–80% [^115A1XRf].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The Sepsis-3 definition underscores the importance of **early recognition** and intervention. Key management principles include **early identification** with prompt recognition using clinical assessment, SOFA/qSOFA, and biomarkers (e.g. lactate, procalcitonin) [^114nkjGV] [^111bw38N]. Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control are critical [^1155TWWm]. Hemodynamic support with fluids and vasopressors maintains perfusion and organ function [^114nkjGV]. Ongoing monitoring of organ function and timely supportive care reduce complications [^notfound].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Despite widespread adoption, Sepsis-3 has sparked debate: SIRS removal may delay recognition of early infection; **qSOFA has limited sensitivity** and may miss at-risk patients [^116P7RyS]; and data used to derive Sepsis-3 were largely from high-income countries, raising concerns about applicability in low-resource settings [^114ntXVb].

---

## Future directions

Future efforts focus on **precision medicine** to stratify patients and tailor therapies, on developing rapid diagnostics to detect infection and organ dysfunction early, and on global standardization to harmonize definitions and criteria across diverse healthcare systems [^111j6k7T].

---

Sepsis is **life-threatening organ dysfunction** from a dysregulated host response to infection; **early recognition and intervention** are essential to reduce mortality and morbidity [^115tUKZq].

### A framework for the development and interpretation of different sepsis definitions and clinical criteria [^115JiwrE]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although sepsis was described more than 2,000 years ago, and clinicians still struggle to define it, there is no "gold standard", and multiple competing approaches and terms exist. Challenges include the ever-changing knowledge base that informs our understanding of sepsis, competing views on which aspects of any potential definition are most important, and the tendency of most potential criteria to be distributed in at-risk populations in such a way as to hinder separation into discrete sets of patients. We propose that the development and evaluation of any definition or diagnostic criteria should follow four steps: 1) define the epistemologic underpinning, 2) agree on all relevant terms used to frame the exercise, 3) state the intended purpose for any proposed set of criteria, and 4) adopt a scientific approach to inform on their usefulness with regard to the intended purpose. Usefulness can be measured across six domains: 1) reliability (stability of criteria during retesting, between raters, over time, and across settings), 2) content validity (similar to face validity), 3) construct validity (whether criteria measure what they purport to measure), 4) criterion validity (how new criteria fare compared to standards), 5) measurement burden (cost, safety, and complexity), and 6) timeliness (whether criteria are available concurrent with care decisions). The relative importance of these domains of usefulness depends on the intended purpose, of which there are four broad categories: 1) clinical care, 2) research, 3) surveillance, and 4) quality improvement and audit. This proposed methodologic framework is intended to aid understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, provide a mechanism for explaining differences in epidemiologic estimates generated by different approaches, and guide the development of future definitions and diagnostic criteria.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1155TWWm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the United States each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Current sepsis criteria identify heterogenous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold. Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not. We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^1148pq6L]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The pathogenesis of sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune system and the infecting microorganisms. Sepsis describes a broad-based syndrome covering many infectious agents, affecting various sites in patients of differing age, gender, and comorbidity. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and death. Despite remarkable advances in the management of patients with sepsis, its recognition and timely, appropriate treatment remain of utmost importance.

The Sepsis-3 definitions underline the concept of a dysregulated immune response resulting in potentially modifiable life-threatening organ dysfunction. However, they may fail in identifying patients with serious infections before organ dysfunction ensues.

Downplaying infections that do not meet the current Sepsis-3 criteria may hinder their identification, resulting in an unnecessary increase in both morbidity and mortality due to their inexorable progression in the following hours.

Clear definitions for sepsis and septic shock should guide clinicians both to support early recognition of at-risk patients and to facilitate an understanding of the global epidemiology of sepsis.

Sepsis is a burden for global health. Its global nature calls for a global response, both in the geographic sense and across the whole range of sectors involved.

In this paper, we have raised our concerns regarding the Sepsis-3 definitions. We believe that in order for sepsis definitions to be universally accepted, they should facilitate clinical care on a global scale.

On Friday, May 26th, 2017, the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization made sepsis a global health priority, by adopting a resolution to improve, prevent, diagnose, and manage sepsis.

The Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery suggests that future revisions have a more global perspective and include a wider range of representatives and expertise. We also hope our comments can serve as a basis for future discussions on how to further improve the definitions of the sepsis continuum.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1143BM5N]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The exact number of patients suffering from sepsis is difficult to capture, but it is estimated to affect at least 1–1.5 million persons each year in the United States.and 19 million patients worldwide. Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 USA deaths per yearand an in-hospital mortality upward of 30% despite advances in critical care. During the last several decades, the mortality rates have decreased, but the incidence is rising. The condition affects all ages, however, among those with sepsis, 49% are between the ages of 65–84 years old. It also commonly affects those with compromised immune systems, chronic disease, infants and those suffering traumatic injury. The direct healthcare costs in the United States exceed $24 billion dollars per yearand rises on average more than 11% per year in cost. Sepsis remains in the top 10 leading causes of death despite plentiful investigative attention toward new therapies and adjuncts to mitigate poor outcome.

The newest developments in our understanding of sepsis reflect revisions to the definitions of the terms sepsis, septic shock and severe sepsis. Since 1991 there have been three consensus conferences convened (in 1991, 2001 and 2014) to adjudicate the definition of sepsis. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force published the 'The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)". This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. These new definitions were followed shortly by the 'Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)'. The aim of this publication was to evaluate and recommend clinical criteria that could help identify patients at risk of developing sepsis.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1138QvVG]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Sepsis: key insights, future directions, and immediate goals. A review and expert opinion [^117D2nTa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review explores the current landscape and evolving understanding of sepsis, highlighting both challenges and future directions. Sepsis remains a major global health burden, with diverse clinical presentations complicating timely diagnosis and management. Existing definitions, including the Sepsis-3 criteria, emphasize the importance of organ dysfunction, yet early sepsis detection remains limited by available tools. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, though widely used, may not fully capture early stages of infection or account for complex presentations like noncatecholamine-resistant shock. Additionally, the review underscores the pressing need for standardized terminology across sepsis and shock characterization to ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment strategies. Accessible, resource-adapted solutions are particularly crucial in low- and middle-income countries where sepsis-related mortality rates are higher due to limited resources. Future research should focus on developing and validating integrated, multi-parameter tools that combine clinical, biochemical, and microbiological data to improve sepsis outcomes globally. Advancing sepsis care will require both technological innovation and collaborative, globally consistent guidelines to bridge disparities in healthcare delivery.

### Sepsis in the 21st century: recent definitions and therapeutic advances [^115QLdp9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis as a disease has received renewed interests since recent publications of a revised clinical definition and crucial clinical trials showing the benefits of early goal-directed resuscitation, recombinant human activated protein C, and low-dose corticosteroids. The epidemiology of sepsis has also been further examined. Management guidelines and international quality improvement efforts have been developed targeting increased disease identification, clinician education, and optimal patient care with the result of decreasing patient mortality. The evidence suggests that early recognition and early intervention are most important in affecting outcome. This article will summarize these developments in the diagnosis and management of sepsis at the turn of this century.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113p97aa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Raising concerns about the Sepsis-3 definitions

Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors. If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impairment of one or more vital organs or systems. There are many well-known risk factors for the infections that most commonly precipitate organ dysfunction, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many cancers, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and advanced age. Although big steps forward have been made, the pathophysiological mechanisms for organ dysfunction are not entirely known, but it has become apparent that infection triggers a much more complex, variable, and prolonged host response, involving early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Sepsis has variable clinical presentations depending on the initial site of infection, the causative organism, the pattern of acute organ dysfunction, and the underlying health status of the patient.

There is general consensus that early recognition and timely treatment largely determine outcome of sepsis.

Since the first classification in 1991, the definition of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, though imprecise, have provided the clinicians a useful framework for clinical management, stressing the need for early recognition, and when these criteria are followed by the application of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, they have an impressive history of success in reducing the mortality of sepsis in several areas of the world.

Several studies demonstrated that sepsis-related mortality reduced steadily over the years. A meta-analysis reported a reduction of sepsis 28-day mortality rates from 46.9% during the period 1991–1995 to 29% during 2006–2009. In the United States, mortality due to severe sepsis decreased by 51% from 1988 to 2012. In Australia and New Zealand, an overall decrease of 16.7% in hospital sepsis mortality was reported between 2000 and 2012 (from 35 to 18.4%). However, high mortality rates are still reported in low- and middle-income countries.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^114iswjs]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions. It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous, and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics which support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses, and solutions for locally relevant outcome measures. For this purpose, global collaborative databases need to be established, using minimum variable datasets from routinely collected data. In summary, a "Think globally, act locally" approach is required.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^114vHH6V]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this Special Article from the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, we present a conceptual framework and a rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the operationalization of sepsis definitions in children around the world (Fig. 1). These include biological factors, epidemiology, differences in the pathways to care, pretest probabilities of sepsis at different levels of care, and the resources that are available to provide care.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^116Dj6P3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery appreciates the great effort of the task force who derived and validated the Sepsis-3 definitions and considers the new definitions an important step forward in the evolution of our understanding of sepsis. Nevertheless, more than a year after their publication, we have a few concerns regarding the use of the Sepsis-3 definitions.

### Sepsis: older and newer concepts [^114vkeXW]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common complication in patients in intensive care units and a frequent reason for intensive care unit admission. Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and, without specific antisepsis therapies, management relies on infection control and organ support. For these interventions to be most effective, they must be started early, which highlights the need for all health-care workers to be aware of sepsis so that diagnosis can be made as early as possible. In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of the earlier terms used to characterise and define sepsis, and point out some of their limitations. We then introduce some aspects of new consensus definitions, proposed by an expert panel, which highlight in particular the importance of organ dysfunction. These definitions should help provide a more standardised approach to the identification of patients with suspected sepsis in both clinical practice and clinical research.

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^115tUKZq]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.

Objective

To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.

Process

A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).

Key Findings From Evidence Synthesis

Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.

Recommendations

Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.

### SIRS in the time of sepsis-3 [^115r5tcx]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis is a common, deadly, and diagnostically vexing condition. Recent recommendations for diagnosing sepsis, referred to as consensus guidelines, provide a definition of sepsis and remove the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a component of the diagnostic process. A concise definition of sepsis is welcomed. However, the approach to developing these guidelines, although thorough, had weaknesses. Emphasis is placed on mortality prediction rather than on early diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria are recommended to replace current criteria without evidence of any effect that their use would have on mortality. SIRS is a prevalent feature of patients with sepsis, should remain an important component of the diagnostic process, and remains a valuable term for discussing patients with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection.

### Defining and diagnosing sepsis [^1139SkNw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that encompasses infections of many different types and severity. Not surprisingly, it has confounded most attempts to apply a single definition, which has also limited the ability to develop a set of reliable diagnostic criteria. It is perhaps best defined as the different clinical syndromes produced by an immune response to infection that causes harm to the body beyond that of the local effects of the infection.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^111T4vxG]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^112XneM3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

New definitions from sSepsis-3

Sepsis, severe sepsis and the SOFA score

The 2012 sepsis guidelines defined sepsis as 'the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection'. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as 'a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection'. This new definition highlights the three critical components of sepsis, namely the presence of infection, the abnormal regulation of the host response to infection and the resulting organ system dysfunction as a result of the host response.

One of the most significant changes in the new definitions was the elimination of a defined condition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The SIRS criteria have included temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate more than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute and white blood cell count > 12 000/µL or < 4000/µL or > 10% immature (band) forms. Traditionally, more than two SIRS criteria were felt to represent patients at risk of or suffering from sepsis. The taskforce determined that the inclusion of two SIRS criteria did not provide appropriate discrimination between those suffering sepsis and an appropriate physiological response to insult (infection or otherwise). Likewise, many patients with two or more SIRS criteria never go on to develop an infection or sepsis. Thus, the presence of SIRS criteria has been removed from the definition of sepsis. In addition, the term 'severe sepsis' (previously defined as sepsis accompanied by sepsis-induced organ dysfunction) was removed from the guidelines, as this term is redundant to the 2016 definition of sepsis. This change highlights the taskforce's focus on organ dysfunction as a critical component in the diagnosis of sepsis. The taskforce identified 'life-threatening organ dysfunction' by 'an increase [from baseline] in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more'.

### International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics [^111HXsYV]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Although general definitions of the sepsis continuum have been published for adults, no such work has been done for the pediatric population. Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children.

Design

Consensus conference.

Methods

This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting.

Results

Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations.

Conclusion

We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population. Our goal is for these first-generation pediatric definitions and criteria to facilitate the performance of successful clinical studies in children with sepsis.

### New sepsis and septic shock definitions: clinical implications and controversies [^115mPnnT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

New sepsis definitions shift emphasis from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to organ dysfunction, quantified using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The new definitions also propose Quick SOFA criteria to rapidly identify potentially infected patients at risk for poor outcomes. The diagnosis of septic shock requires vasopressor dependence and increased lactate levels. Strengths of these definitions include their simplicity and clear association with adverse outcomes. However, their utility in identifying patients with serious infections before frank sepsis ensues remains to be seen. This article reviews challenges in defining sepsis, strengths and weaknesses of the new definitions, and unresolved issues.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management [^114nkjGV]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

### Pediatric sepsis definitions: past, present, and future [^114VfDWN]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the past, present, and future definitions of sepsis and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in children.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Results

The history and development of the adult-derived sepsis syndrome and its application to pediatric-specific sepsis definitions is provided. Initially, only adult definitions were applied to pediatric studies. Recently, pediatric-specific definitions have been published. The pediatric consensus conference-derived definitions for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock are summarized, and their limitations are discussed.

Conclusions

The potential value and inconsistencies of the current pediatric-specific sepsis definitions are discussed. Future direction of the definitions and their applications are presented.

### The international sepsis forum consensus conference on definitions of infection in the intensive care unit [^114vmAgG]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop definitions of infection that can be used in clinical trials in patients with sepsis.

Context

Infection is a key component of the definition of sepsis, yet there is currently no agreement on the definitions that should be used to identify specific infections in patients with sepsis. Agreeing on a set of valid definitions that can be easily implemented as part of a clinical trial protocol would facilitate patient selection, help classify patients into prospectively defined infection categories, and therefore greatly reduce variability between treatment groups.

Design and Methods

Experts in infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, and critical care medicine were recruited and allocated specific infection sites. They carried out a systematic literature review and used this, and their own experience, to prepare a draft definition. At a subsequent consensus conference, rapporteurs presented the draft definitions, and these were then refined and improved during discussion. Modifications were circulated electronically and subsequently agreed upon as part of an iterative process until consensus was reached.

Result

Consensus definitions of infection were developed for the six most frequent causes of infections in septic patients: pneumonia, bloodstream infections (including infective endocarditis), intravascular catheter-related sepsis, intra-abdominal infections, urosepsis, and surgical wound infections.

Conclusions

We have described standardized definitions of the common sites of infection associated with sepsis in critically ill patients. Use of these definitions in clinical trials should help improve the quality of clinical research in this field.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113faCoX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The definition of sepsis has shifted over time.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were initially defined in 1991 by a consensus panel convened by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). The conference defined sepsis as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection. "Severe" sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension, and "septic shock" was defined as sepsis with arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation (Appendix 1).

The definitions were revisited in 2001 during the International Sepsis Definitions Conference, which included members from the ACCP, the SCCM, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS). The consensus retained the definitions of sepsis as SIRS due to infection (presumed or confirmed) and severe sepsis as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction. However, the new criteria defining SIRS were greatly expanded from the 1991 original, and organ dysfunction variables indicative of severe sepsis were also defined. This new set of sepsis criteria also changed the diagnostic requirement from "more than 1" of the original 4 to "some" of the expanded list (Appendix 2).

In February 2016, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a proposal for new definitions and criteria for sepsis, called Sepsis-3, updating previous sepsis definitions. The new definitions were prepared by a task force appointed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) (Appendix 3). They were aimed at providing a standardized classification to facilitate clinical care, future research, and reporting.

In 2017, the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery instituted an interdisciplinary task force of 76 experts from 50 different countries with different backgrounds to assess the clinical value of the Sepsis-3 definitions.

The Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery appreciates the great effort of the task force who derived and validated the Sepsis-3 definitions and considers the new definitions an important step forward in the evolution of our understanding of sepsis particularly in regard to what distinguishes sepsis from uncomplicated infection. Nevertheless, more than a year after their publication, we have a few concerns regarding the use of the Sepsis-3 definitions. We hope our comments can encourage further discussion and debate on how to further optimize the definitions of the sepsis continuum.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^111RsxNd]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Subsequent to the wide uptake of adult data-driven Sepsis-3 criteria, it is important to address the practical challenges in developing pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illness in a range of settings and with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. The criteria will need to be unambiguous yet flexible, capable of adapting to the widely different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. These criteria should facilitate early recognition of patients at risk, improved diagnosis, and risk stratification to enable timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression. At the same time, we must endeavor to avoid the problems associated with overdiagnosis and treatment.

In summary, there are challenges and opportunities in operationalizing sepsis in the global and diverse settings in which children present, but we present potential actionable solutions that can be applied locally to identify, manage and study children with sepsis.

### Sepsis subclasses: a framework for development and interpretation [^1121f4tW]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials tested therapies for sepsis over the past 2 decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biologic features. Combinations of these features, however, may identify previously unrecognized groups, or "subclasses" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment. As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise. These include: 1) the semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses, 2) the conceptual goal of subclasses, 3) considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods, 4) the role of emerging data types, and 5) how to determine whether subclasses represent "truth". We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodologic approaches, and guide clinicians in how to consider subclasses in bedside care.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^111fhrDL]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis varies in its clinical manifestations over time, which necessitates different requirements for identification of sepsis across the various stages of its progression. In the early phases, clinicians may have limited information available, but require criteria to make a presumptive diagnosis that is sufficient to implement effective therapeutic approaches. At later stages, clinicians usually have access to substantive information, including results of diagnostic testing, clinical progression, and response to therapy, to allow a definitive diagnosis. This concept enables clinicians to consider parameters for early initiation of antibiotic therapy, while allowing early termination of antibiotic therapy, once additional information allows for reevaluation of the diagnosis and risk. To ensure widespread adoption and patient benefit, criteria for sepsis should correlate with clinically relevant intervention points (e.g. invasive bacterial infection = antibiotic therapy, organ dysfunction = organ support therapy), as well as the risk of mortality in each situation.

Sepsis represents a broad umbrella term covering a condition that may be caused by a wide range of pathogens (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic). There are no simple and unambiguous clinical, biological, imaging, or laboratory features that uniquely identify a patient with sepsis. The lack of rapid and reliable sepsis tests hampers the ability to make a definitive diagnosis of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, at the time of presentation.

Dysregulation of host response includes imbalances in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory states driven by the innate and adaptive immune systems and contributing to new or worsening organ injury and death. The adult Sepsis-3 criteria emphasize the importance of identification of organ dysfunction in patients with infection and have led to research that improves our mechanistic understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis, including infection-specific biology and responses to specific interventions. In this context, phenotyping using biological and clinical characteristics, and specific pathophysiology, has great potential to be employed as an enrichment strategy in the evaluation of treatment responses.

### A retrospective review of the sepsis definition after publication of sepsis-3 [^113DeioC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Two and a half years after the introduction of Sepsis-3, clinicians continue not to document Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. There continue to be variations in what standard is accepted by both commercial payers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) in diagnosing sepsis. The purpose of this review is to determine if the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) were being utilized in defining sepsis in the clinical setting.

Methods

One hundred patients between February 2016 and March 2018 who were diagnosed with sepsis were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of criteria for the diagnosis of sepsis. Data points for SOFA criteria were analyzed.

Results

None of the septic patients were diagnosed utilizing SOFA scores. Many of the data points were found to not have been collected or measured to complete a SOFA score.

Conclusions

Due to Sepsis-3 criteria not being accepted by CMS or the Infectious Disease Society of America, along with it not being able to be operationalized for use in the clinical setting, it is recommended to continue utilizing systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria plus infection while Sepsis-3 continues to be evaluated. It will also allow for some time to study any effect it may have on patient outcomes. There is also a need for a uniform definition of sepsis.

### The immunology of sepsis [^111p1kWS]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. This recently implemented definition does not capture the heterogeneity or the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome, which is characterized by concurrent unbalanced hyperinflammation and immune suppression. Here, we review current knowledge of aberrant immune responses during sepsis and recent initiatives to stratify patients with sepsis into subgroups that are more alike from a clinical and/or pathobiological perspective, which could be key for identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific immune interventions.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^115VVQVc]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Considerations

Although concepts such as sepsis and pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome have enabled the development of management strategies, standardized research cohorts, and research protocols, our understanding of sepsis is evolving thanks to more detailed phenotyping, providing opportunities for the enrichment of cohorts toward precision medicine. As we focus on criteria for sepsis across the world, we need to develop global databases which are granular enough in content to examine the details of specific communities, and broad enough to contain information on multiple additional factors. Databases ideally will capture the full "narrative" of illness (not just presentation), and incorporate concepts of probability rather than definitive "certainty of diagnosis". Although the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce has included primary care and emergency practitioners in the "definition" process, during the implementation of new criteria it will be necessary to reach out to other practitioners such as those who provide long-term care, laboratory teams, and those with expertise in implementation science. Social determinants of health (SDOH) in pediatric sepsis studies are not commonly reported, with marked variability in categorizations and definitions of SDOH variables. Standardized reporting of SDOH in pediatric sepsis studies is needed to understand the role these factors play in the development, progression, and recovery of sepsis, to implement policies aimed at addressing socioeconomic conditions related to sepsis.

Actionable solutions to the considerations above are described in Table 1 and include individualized approaches dependent on setting, affordable diagnostics for accurate risk stratification, optimization of data capture from routinely collected datasets to support collaborative registries, and development of locally relevant outcome measures.

### Diagnosing sepsis: does the microbiology matter? [^111KChaK]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Sepsis is caused by infection, and knowing what type of organism is causing the infection certainly matters in terms of both epidemiology and selecting antibiotic therapy. Although there is considerable laboratory evidence that micro-organisms initiate sepsis in different ways, the clinical consequences are usually indistinguishable. New drugs that target specific points in the activation pathway are starting to emerge, and these will require us to be much more accurate in how we diagnose sepsis.

### An international sepsis survey: a study of doctors' knowledge and perception about sepsis [^116GxAE8]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Background

To be able to diagnose and treat sepsis better it is important not only to improve the knowledge about definitions and pathophysiology, but also to gain more insight into specialists' perception of, and attitude towards, the current diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

Methods

The study was conducted as a prospective, international survey by structured telephone interview. The subjects were intensive care physicians and other specialist physicians caring for intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Results

The 1058 physicians who were interviewed (including 529 intensivists) agreed that sepsis is a leading cause of death on the ICU and that the incidence of sepsis is increasing, but that the symptoms of sepsis can easily be misattributed to other conditions. Physicians were concerned that this could lead to under-reporting of sepsis. Two-thirds (67%) were concerned that a common definition is lacking and 83% said it is likely that sepsis is frequently missed. Not more than 17% agreed on any one definition.

Conclusion

There is a general awareness about the inadequacy of the current definitions of sepsis. Physicians caring for patients with sepsis recognise the difficulty of defining and diagnosing sepsis and are aware that they miss the diagnosis frequently.

### Challenges in developing a consensus definition of neonatal sepsis [^113Nqtgd]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal population, and at present, there is no unified definition of neonatal sepsis. Existing consensus sepsis definitions within paediatrics are not suited for use in the NICU and do not address sepsis in the premature population. Many neonatal research and surveillance networks have criteria for the definition of sepsis within their publications though these vary greatly and there is typically a heavy emphasis on microbiological culture. The concept of organ dysfunction as a diagnostic criterion for sepsis is rarely considered in neonatal literature, and it remains unclear how to most accurately screen neonates for organ dysfunction. Accurately defining and screening for sepsis is important for clinical management, health service design and future research. The progress made by the Sepsis-3 group provides a roadmap of how definitions and screening criteria may be developed. Similar initiatives in neonatology are likely to be more challenging and would need to account for the unique presentation of sepsis in term and premature neonates. The outputs of similar consensus work within neonatology should be twofold: a validated definition of neonatal sepsis and screening criteria to identify at-risk patients earlier in their clinical course. IMPACT: There is currently no consensus definition of neonatal sepsis and the definitions that are currently in use are varied. A consensus definition of neonatal sepsis would benefit clinicians, patients and researchers. Recent progress in adults with publication of Sepsis-3 provides guidance on how a consensus definition and screening criteria for sepsis could be produced in neonatology. We discuss common themes and potential shortcomings in sepsis definitions within neonatology. We highlight the need for a consensus definition of neonatal sepsis and the challenges that this task poses.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### QSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis [^113T1bfj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The recently published consensus definitions for sepsis have raised a lot of discussion and controversy. We had the privilege of being part of this consensus group and fully support the final definitions. We are pleased that a definition has been developed that closely reflects everyday clinical language, recognizing that sepsis is most simply described as a "bad infection" associated with some degree of organ dysfunction, as proposed earlier. The article conveying the consensus definition also emphasizes that sepsis is more often recognized from the associated organ dysfunction than from the more difficult to identify infection, so that sepsis can be defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection".

The proposition of the 1992 North American consensus document that sepsis be defined by a combination of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and the presence of an infection raised confusion, because the SIRS criteria (especially fever, tachycardia, and altered white blood cell count) are themselves typical features of infection. As the majority of infected patients will therefore meet the SIRS criteria, they would also be considered to have sepsis by this 1992 definition. This approach to defining sepsis has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of patients diagnosed with sepsis over the years; however, these patients may have less severe disease so that reported parallel reductions in mortality rates may be deceptive. The recent "new" definitions are not so novel, more a return to the traditional use of the term to indicate patients with a substantial and deleterious response to an infection. We doubt that this will change further over time, exactly as the meaning of other words like pneumonia, peritonitis, or meningitis has not changed.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^116P7RyS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sepsis was previously defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in a patient with an infection but now reflects a significantly greater degree of illness, characterized by organ dysfunction, de-emphasizing intervention at earlier stages when it is most treatable.

Definition of organ failure based on SOFA ≥ 2 may be accurate and safe in the ICU, although reliance on the SOFA score can make it more challenging to diagnose a patient with sepsis outside the ICU environment.

The SOFA score is not globally accessible and not well known by emergency or ward healthcare professionals, and its applicability is complex outside the ICU, as it might demand the calculation of SOFA for subsequent days to verify if the patients fulfill the strict criteria and require laboratory tests.

The qSOFA is a tool for risk stratification, and it seems necessary to look for options to improve its low sensitivity. Until then, SIRS will still be helpful as a screening tool in ED to identify patients with infections that will most likely benefit from earlier and more aggressive interventions.

Clinicians should keep in mind the difference between a screening tool and a risk-stratification tool. A screening tool aims to identify patients with a particular disease from a larger pool of patients. Once these patients are identified, a risk-stratification tool can be applied to determine their likelihood of meeting a particular outcome.

We probably still need a good screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing organ dysfunction. However, this is not addressed in Sepsis-3.

The Sepsis-3 authors concluded that "These updated definitions and clinical criteria should clarify long-used descriptors and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing it". However, it seems to us that Sepsis3 definitions have the opposite outcome.

Sepsis 3 definitions exclude from the concept of sepsis those patients who are in transition from infection to sepsis and who have a SOFA score of 2 or more points.

Quantifying the global burden of sepsis

Challenges in definitions

Early, accurate identification of patients with sepsis is critical to improving outcomes through better targeted medical management, yet remains challenging. There is no single "gold standard" diagnostic test for sepsis, and case definitions vary widely. Use of nonspecific terminology such as "septicemia" remains pervasive. A consensus definition of adult sepsis, originally proposed in 1991, was most recently revised in 2016 (Sepsis-3). Sepsis-3 defined sepsis as a syndrome of "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection", and the authors proposed that organ dysfunction be identified by a change in organ failure score relative to baseline. The analyses underpinning these clinical criteria were based on data exclusively drawn from the United States and Germany. The validity of one Sepsis-3 clinical prompt, the Quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, has now been retrospectively evaluated in multiple datasets from LMICs. However, neither the qSOFA score nor other Sepsis-3 criteria have been tested prospectively in low-resource settings. Until these clinical criteria are more fully validated in more diverse populations, their utility elsewhere in the world remains uncertain. Additionally, the Sepsis-3 Task Force explicitly did not examine definitions of infection and did not specify which infections, when leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction, should be considered as causes of sepsis. There is some disagreement within sepsis and infectious disease communities regarding this issue; for example, some authors consider malaria to be a potential cause of sepsis, whereas others do not. This disagreement has important implications for comparability of patient populations in research studies and for the clinical application of sepsis treatment guidelines.

The definition of pediatric sepsis is also challenging. Last revised in 2005 and based heavily on the 1991 adult sepsis consensus definition, the pediatric definition offers age-appropriate values for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Combined with suspected infection, the presence of these modified SIRS criteria is used to identify pediatric patients with sepsis. This definition has not been revisited in over a decade and has posed problems in implementation, especially in low-resource settings, due to its low specificity and requirement for a leukocyte count.

### The current and future state of pediatric sepsis definitions: an international survey [^115iQZub]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Definitions for pediatric sepsis were established in 2005 without data-driven criteria. It is unknown whether the more recent adult Sepsis-3 definitions meet the needs of providers caring for children. We aimed to explore the use and applicability of criteria to diagnose sepsis and septic shock in children across the world.

Methods

This is an international electronic survey of clinicians distributed across international and national societies representing pediatric intensive care, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and pediatric infectious diseases. Respondents stated their preferences on a 5-point Likert scale.

Results

There were 2835 survey responses analyzed, of which 48% originated from upper-middle income countries, followed by high income countries (38%) and low or lower-middle income countries (14%). Abnormal vital signs, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and microbiologic diagnoses were the criteria most used for the diagnosis of "sepsis". The 2005 consensus definitions were perceived to be the most useful for sepsis recognition, while Sepsis-3 definitions were stated as more useful for benchmarking, disease classification, enrollment into trials, and prognostication. The World Health Organization definitions were perceived as least useful across all domains. Seventy one percent of respondents agreed that the term sepsis should be restricted to children with infection-associated organ dysfunction.

Conclusions

Clinicians around the world apply a myriad of signs, symptoms, laboratory studies, and treatment factors when diagnosing sepsis. The concept of sepsis as infection with associated organ dysfunction is broadly supported. Currently available sepsis definitions fall short of the perceived needs. Future diagnostic algorithms should be pragmatic and sensitive to the clinical settings.

### Potential impact of the 2016 consensus definitions of sepsis and septic shock on future sepsis research [^113aSRoR]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The influence of the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) on the conduct of future sepsis research is unknown. We seek to examine the potential effect of the new definitions on the identification and outcomes of patients enrolled in a sepsis trial.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) trial of early goal-directed therapy that recruited 1,591 adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with early septic shock diagnosed by greater than or equal to 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and either refractory hypotension or hyperlactatemia. The proportion of participants who would have met the Sepsis-3 criteria for quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, sepsis (an increased Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 2 because of infection) and septic shock before randomization, their baseline characteristics, interventions delivered, and mortality were determined.

Results

There were 1,139 participants who had a qSOFA score of greater than or equal to 2 at baseline (71.6% [95% confidence interval {CI} 69.4% to 73.8%]). In contrast, 1,347 participants (84.7% [95% CI 82.9% to 86.4%]) met the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis. Only 1,010 participants were both qSOFA positive and met the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis (63.5% [95% CI 61.1% to 65.8%]). The Sepsis-3 definition for septic shock was met at baseline by 203 participants (12.8% [95% CI 11.2% to 14.5%]), of whom 175 (86.2% [95% CI 81.5% to 91.0%]) were also qSOFA positive. Ninety-day mortality for participants fulfilling the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis and septic shock was 20.4% (95% CI 18.2% to 22.5%) (274/1,344) and 29.6% (95% CI 23.3% to 35.8% [60/203]) versus 9.4% (95% CI 5.8% to 13.1%) (23/244) and 17.1% (95% CI 15.1% to 19.1% [237/1,388]), respectively, for participants not meeting the criteria (risk differences 11.0% [95% CI 6.2% to 14.8%] and 12.5% [95% CI 6.3% to 19.4%], respectively).

Conclusion

Most ARISE participants did not meet the Sepsis-3 definition for septic shock at baseline. However, the majority fulfilled the new sepsis definition and mortality was higher than for participants not fulfilling the criteria. A quarter of participants meeting the new sepsis definition did not fulfill the qSOFA screening criteria, potentially limiting its utility as a screening tool for sepsis trials with patients with suspected infection in the ED. The implications of the new definitions for patients not eligible for recruitment into the ARISE trial are unknown.

### Criteria for pediatric sepsis – A systematic review and meta-analysis by the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^115Ez5Vy]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This systematic review rigorously assessed the association of individual variables with development of sepsis in children with infections and the odds of mortality in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. The included studies were from economically diverse regions of the world, populations with diverse underlying conditions, and varying definitions of sepsis. Despite the clinical heterogeneity and limited number of studies for some variables, strong associations with the outcomes of interest were seen for many of the variables assessed, predominantly reflecting measures of organ dysfunction and supporting the inclusion of these variables in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113CF9XL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis-3 definitions

The process for revising the Sepsis-3 definitions of sepsis and septic shock was a 2-year-long process that involved several components. Critical efforts in this process included a discussion of the concept of sepsis, identification of criteria alerting clinicians for the patient's risk to develop sepsis, and the development of the criteria to identify septic shock.

The clinical criteria for sepsis were formulated by using a data-driven approach. Electronic health record data of 1.3 million encounters at 12 community and academic hospitals within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health system in southwestern Pennsylvania were studied, and among them, there were 148,907 patients with suspected infection. The power of the Sequential [sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) was equivalent to Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) and higher than SIRS in predicting hospital mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). The choice of the SOFA to measure organ dysfunction was due to its greater simplicity. The task force introduced the rapid bedside quick SOFA (qSOFA) tool for determined patients outside the ICU who likely develop sepsis from the retrospectively derived databases. Confirmatory analyses were performed by using data sets from the United States and Germany.

The clinical criteria for septic shock were formulated by using multiple methods: (a) a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the criteria used in observational studies reporting sepsis epidemiology, (b) a Delphi process among the 19 members of the task force to achieve consensus on the new definitions, and (c) cohort studies to test variables identified by the Delphi process using the Surviving Sepsis Campaign registry, along with two other data sets from the United States.

Yet when they were published, these definitions, however, had not been prospectively validated in a generalizable population. Moreover, the patient data were all almost exclusively from adults in high-income countries and primarily contained information from patients in the United States and Germany, so the utility of these definitions in other geographic regions and particularly in settings with less resources is unknown.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^115oRW6L]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Defining sepsis

Defining the syndrome of sepsis has proven challenging since the initial consensus definitions were developed in the early 1990s. The definitions of sepsis and septic shock were based on expert consensus. In 2016, a novel approach saw a data-driven redefinition as:

'Life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection'.

The team demonstrated that SOFA score was a better discriminant than the traditional SIRS and similarly effective to the more complex Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS). Organ dysfunction was therefore characterised by a change in SOFA score of two or more points as a consequence of infection, which conferred an associated mortality of approximately 10%. By using a change in SOFA score, the authors recognised that whilst SOFA score can often be considered zero in previously healthy patients, the presence of chronic organ dysfunction precludes the use of an absolute value to define the presence of infection. This transition from observing to defining a syndrome has significant relevance for clinicians and researchers in critical care.

Mortality rates for sepsis and septic shock have not improved in the past decade. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines released in 2012 emphasize early recognition and treatment of sepsis, in an effort to reduce the burden of sepsis worldwide. This series of review articles will discuss the pathophysiology of sepsis; comorbidities, such as multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and endocrine issues; and finally, management of sepsis and septic shock.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^114uVDEn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis definitions and septic shock criteria — evolution across consensus statements are outlined with specific thresholds. The first and second consensus definitions describe sepsis as suspected or confirmed infection with ≥ 2 SIRS criteria, including temperature of > 38 °C or < 36 °C, heart rate > 90 beats/min, respiratory rate ≥ 20 breaths/min or PaO2 < 32 mm Hg, and white blood cell count > 12,000 or < 4,000 cells/mm3 or > 10% band neutrophils. The second consensus definitions list organ dysfunction findings for severe sepsis such as lactate 2 mmol/L or greater, international normalized ratio > 1.5, creatinine ≥ 2.1 mg/dL or urine output < 0.5 mL/kg per hour, and oxygen saturation < 90%. The third consensus definitions define sepsis as organ dysfunction with an increase in SOFA score of ≥ 2 and note that severe sepsis was eliminated as redundant with sepsis. The 2016 definitions state septic shock is sepsis with vasopressors required to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg and lactate ≥ 2 mmol/L after fluid resuscitation.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^115A1XRf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sepsis and septic shock:

- **Definition**: According to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction (defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline in the SOFA score) caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is no longer included in the definition of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common infectious pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis are S. aureus (20.5%), Pseudomonas species (19.9%), fungi (19%), E. coli (16.0%), Klebsiella species (12.7%), and Acinetobacter (9%).
- **Epidemiology**: In hospitalized adult patients, the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 6.0%.
- **Disease course**: In patients with sepsis, continued activation of immune cells in response to an infection result in a dysregulated inflammatory response. The coagulation system is closely tied to the inflammatory response, with cross talk between the two systems. These pathophysiological changes cause the clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction, which may progress to multiple organ failure, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock is 10–20%, 20–50%, and 40–80%, respectively.

### Neonatal sepsis definitions from randomised clinical trials [^112MW3jB]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide with non-specific and varied presentation. We aimed to catalogue the current definitions of neonatal sepsis in published randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Method

A systematic search of the Embase and Cochrane databases was performed for RCTs which explicitly stated a definition for neonatal sepsis. Definitions were sub-divided into five primary criteria for infection (culture, laboratory findings, clinical signs, radiological evidence and risk factors) and stratified by qualifiers (early/late-onset and likelihood of sepsis).

Results

Of 668 papers screened, 80 RCTs were included and 128 individual definitions identified. The single most common definition was neonatal sepsis defined by blood culture alone (n = 35), followed by culture and clinical signs (n = 29), and then laboratory tests/clinical signs (n = 25). Blood culture featured in 83 definitions, laboratory testing featured in 48 definitions while clinical signs and radiology featured in 80 and 8 definitions, respectively.

Discussion

A diverse range of definitions of neonatal sepsis are used and based on microbiological culture, laboratory tests and clinical signs in contrast to adult and paediatric sepsis which use organ dysfunction. An international consensus-based definition of neonatal sepsis could allow meta-analysis and translate results to improve outcomes.

### Sepsis prediction model for determining sepsis vs SIRS, qSOFA, and SOFA [^115rUxsU]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The Third International Task Force on Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) established a consensus definition of sepsis as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection". Although updated definitions have advanced the conceptual framework of sepsis, significant heterogeneity among patients with sepsis continues to limit the application of practical and efficient clinical tools to improve treatment delivery. This heterogeneity arises from the grouping of different infectious organisms, sites of infection, and organ dysfunctions into a single clinical condition rather than as unique disease states. At the point of care, no single marker or physiologic parameter consistently predicts the imminent development of sepsis. Additional challenges for sepsis recognition and intervention programs include prevention of harm through overtreatment with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Consequently, early sepsis identification remains a major challenge with both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis contributing to negative outcomes. Accurate, early recognition of sepsis linked to specific, early interventions is an important but elusive goal for developers of electronic decision support systems.,

Sepsis identification systems based on bedside findings are widely disseminated to promote early recognition and prompt intervention. Current recommendations emphasize that sepsis be considered a medical emergency and stress the importance of timely treatment. These goals of early recognition and intervention are impeded by suboptimal performance of simplified disease scales. For example, 2 common sepsis detection models are the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which has a pooled sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 26%, and quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), which has a pooled sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 72% for sepsis as defined by Sepsis-3 criteria. Newer, complex, and often proprietary models based on electronic health record (EHR) data including identification of organ dysfunction have been developed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of sepsis prediction.

### Judging quality of current septic shock definitions and criteria [^1133jWHE]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Septic shock definitions are being revisited. We assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity characteristics of the current definitions and criteria of septic shock. Septic shock is conceptualised as cardiovascular dysfunction, tissue perfusion and cellular abnormalities caused by infection. Currently, for feasibility, septic shock is identified at the bedside by using either hypotension or a proxy for tissue perfusion/cellular abnormalities (e.g., hyperlactatemia). We propose that concurrent presence of cardiovascular dysfunction and perfusion/cellular abnormalities could improve validity of septic shock diagnosis, as we are more likely to identify a patient population with all elements of the illness concept. This epidemiological refinement should not affect clinical care and may aid study design to identify illness-specific biomarkers and interventions.

### Concept of PIRO as a new conceptual framework to understand sepsis [^116Zuz9Y]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To define and introduce the PIRO model for categorizing sepsis in infants and children.

Design

A summary of the literature published during the 5 yrs since this concept has been formulated, along with a consensus opinion of experts in the field of sepsis and septic shock.

Results

The imprecision and intrinsic heterogeneity of the patient population defined as septic has prompted the introduction of a new sepsis classification system known as PIRO. PIRO stands for predisposition, infection, response, and organ dysfunction. It is hoped that by defining the septic process through a detailed analysis of each of its component parts, the development of sepsis will be better understood. This may contribute to improved therapeutic interventions for sepsis in the future.

Conclusions

The PIRO model is a conceptual framework for understanding sepsis that has many favorable attributes. The PIRO model should be directly tested in both the research laboratory and in clinical trial designs to determine the practical value and clinical relevance of this new classification scheme for sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Time for a neonatal-specific consensus definition for sepsis [^111wLbFa]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the accuracy of the pediatric consensus definition of sepsis in term neonates and to determine the definition of neonatal sepsis used.

Study Selection

The review focused primarily on pediatric literature relevant to the topic of interest.

Conclusions

Neonatal sepsis is variably defined based on a number of clinical and laboratory criteria that make the study of this common and devastating condition very difficult. Diagnostic challenges and uncertain disease epidemiology necessarily result from a variable definition of disease. In 2005, intensivists caring for children recognized that as new drugs became available, children would be increasingly studied and thus, pediatric-specific consensus definitions were needed. Pediatric sepsis criteria are not accurate for term neonates and have not been examined in preterm neonates for whom the developmental stage influences aberrations associated with host immune response. Thus, specific consensus definitions for both term and preterm neonates are needed. Such definitions are critical for the interpretation of observational studies, future training of scientists and practitioners, and implementation of clinical trials in neonates.

### Developing a shared sepsis data infrastructure: a systematic review and concept map to FHIR [^116vAQ1W]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Systematic review

We sought to identify relevant studies that (1) describe consensus sepsis definitions, (2) provide criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock or a sepsis subgroup, or (3) detail sepsis subtyping. Search methods were designed following guidance published by the Cochrane collaboration. This systematic review conforms all these criteria.

To develop the list of search terms, we collated applicable MeSH terms provided for each major Sepsis consensus definition (i.e. Sepsis-1, Sepsis-2, and Sepsis-3). These included "sepsis", "septic shock", "severe sepsis". Natural language search terms included "definition", "decision rule", "diagnosis", "characteristics", "variables", "criteria", and "epidemiology". Boolean operators OR and AND for combining search term(s) were used to streamline the procedure. Next, we employed the PICOS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, and study design) search strategy, a widely cited tool for synthesizing scientific research. By using the PICOS structure, we sought to identify studies reporting on sepsis patient Populations to elucidate sepsis cohort definitions used.

We sought original research published in peer-reviewed journals reporting on adult patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and/or septic shock. Selected study designs included consensus statements, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, case-control studies, and cohort studies. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, reporting pediatric populations or animals, or "gray" literature were prospectively excluded.

We searched English language studies published from January 1, 1970 through January 31, 2020. We systematically searched three databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. Search strategies were developed for each database, starting with PubMed then adapted for each subsequent search (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). We screened all titles and abstracts returned from searches against inclusion criteria and removed duplicate studies. Reference lists from selected manuscripts were scrutinized by two authors (E.B. and J.K.) to identify additional studies meeting selection criteria. Manuscripts were reviewed and ranked by two independent reviewers (E.B. and J.K). Full-text versions were then obtained and independently reviewed by co-authors. Discrepancies throughout the review process were resolved through discussion with study senior authors (C.S. and V.L.) Initial searches were conducted June 2019 with a second search completed at the end of January 2020.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of Sepsis mimics [^113MHGoW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common clinical condition, and mortality and morbidity may be severe. The current definition of sepsis involves systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which is met by many conditions.

Objective

This review evaluates the SIRS continuum, signs and symptoms of sepsis, mimics of sepsis, and an approach to management for sepsis mimics.

Discussion

The current emergency medicine definition of sepsis includes SIRS, a definition that may be met by many conditions. Because of common pathophysiologic responses, these diseases present in a similar manner. These conditions include anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal emergency, pulmonary disease, metabolic abnormality, toxin ingestion/withdrawal, vasculitis, and spinal injury. Many of these conditions can be deadly if they are not diagnosed and managed. However, differentiating between sepsis and mimics can be difficult in the emergency setting. Laboratory abnormalities in isolation do not provide a definitive diagnosis. However, a combination of history, physical examination, and adjunctive studies may assist providers. For the patient in extremis, resuscitation must take precedence while attempts to differentiate sepsis from mimics are underway.

Conclusions

SIRS and sepsis exist along a continuum, with many other conditions overlapping because of a common physiologic response. A combination of factors will assist providers in differentiating sepsis from mimics rather than using diagnostic studies in isolation. Resuscitation should be initiated while attempting to differentiate sepsis from its mimics.

### Application of the third international consensus definitions for sepsis (sepsis-3) classification: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^114iHXrQ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) present clinical criteria for the classification of patients with sepsis. We investigated incidence and long-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with these classifications, which are currently unknown.

Methods

We did a retrospective analysis using data from 30239 participants from the United States who were aged at least 45 years and enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Patients were enrolled between Jan 25, 2003, and Oct 30, 2007, and we identified hospital admissions from Feb 5, 2003, to Dec 31, 2012, and applied three classifications: infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, elevated sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score from Sepsis-3, and elevated quick SOFA (qSOFA) score from Sepsis-3. We estimated incidence during the study period, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality.

Findings

Of 2593 first infection events, 1526 met SIRS criteria, 1080 met SOFA criteria, and 378 met qSOFA criteria. Incidence was 8·2 events (95% CI 7·8–8·7) per 1000 person-years for SIRS, 5·8 events (5·4–6·1) per 1000 person-years for SOFA, and 2·0 events (1·8–2·2) per 1000 person-years for qSOFA. In-hospital mortality was higher for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (67 [23%] of 295 patients died) than for those with an elevated SOFA score (125 [13%] of 960 patients died) or who met SIRS criteria (128 [9%] of 1392 patients died). Mortality at 1 year after discharge was also highest for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (29·4 deaths [95% CI 22·3–38·7] per 100 person-years) compared with those with an elevated SOFA score (22·6 deaths [19·2–26·6] per 100 person-years) or those who met SIRS criteria (14·7 deaths [12·5–17·2] per 100 person-years).

Interpretation

SIRS, SOFA, and qSOFA classifications identified different incidences and mortality. Our findings support the use of the SOFA and qSOFA classifications to identify patients with infection who are at elevated risk of poor outcomes. These classifications could be used in future epidemiological assessments and studies of patients with infection.

### Estimates of sepsis prevalence and outcomes in adult patients in the ICU in India: a cross-sectional study [^112yMiD6]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a global health problem. Limited data exist on the prevalence of sepsis using current definitions in ICUs in India.

Research Question

In adult patients admitted to ICUs in India, what is the prevalence of sepsis using the previous (Second International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock [Sepsis-2]) and current (Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock [Sepsis-3]) definitions?

Study Design and Methods

Prospective, observational, multicentre, 1-day, cross-sectional study. The primary outcome was the sepsis prevalence using both the Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 definitions and their concordance (using Cohen's κ coefficient). Additional outcomes included reporting on current microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial use, multidrug-resistant infections, and 30-day discharge and mortality status in patients with sepsis.

Results

A total of 35 ICUs (85.7% private, 14.3% public) participated, enrolling 680 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 24 years]; 62.1% men). The most common primary diagnosis was renal disease, and common comorbidities were diabetes (44.0%) and chronic renal failure (11.6%). The sepsis prevalence on the study day was 382 of 677 patients (56.4%). Prevalence by Sepsis-3 and Sepsis-2 definitions was 33.2% and 46.2%, respectively, with minimal concordance (κ = 0.32). In patients with sepsis, the most common microorganisms were bacterial (77.9%) followed by fungal (14.1%) infections. Approximately 45% of infections were caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Mortality at 30 days after the study day (27.6% vs 5.3%; P < .01) and rates of discharge against medical advice (12.8% vs 4.9%; P < .01) were significantly higher in the sepsis cohort compared with the cohort without sepsis, respectively.

Interpretation

This multicenter point prevalence study in Indian ICUs showed a high burden of sepsis using both Sepsis-2 and Sepsis-3 criteria, with associated high rates of antimicrobial resistance and mortality. These findings have implications for public health and future research.

### Reducing post-cesarean sepsis: current best practice in prevention and treatment [^114HdcVN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.2 Defining sepsis

The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock Task Force in 2016 emphasized signs of organ dysfunction rather than signs of infection in defining sepsis and septic shock. The Task Force defined sepsis as a life‐threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated response to an infection. An increase of 2 or more points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is considered organ dysfunction. There is increasing consensus that the definition of organ dysfunction should be based on specific criteria for the obstetric population over those used for SOFA and clinical markers preferred over laboratory investigations. Maternal sepsis has been comprehensively defined by WHO as "a life‐threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during pregnancy, childbirth, post‐abortion, or postpartum period", a definition that has been endorsed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and FIGO. The Global Maternal and Neonatal Sepsis Initiative was launched by WHO to "focus additional efforts, energize stakeholders and accelerate progress in the area of maternal and neonatal infection".

Delay in recognition of sepsis, antibiotic administration, and appropriate intensive monitoring and care can worsen the outcome and increase the risk of maternal death. Maternal sepsis needs to be recognized as an obstetric emergency. Recognizing risk factors and setting up of a care bundle to prevent sepsis and applying the principles of golden hour to maternal sepsis can contribute to reducing the incidence of this major complication.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) POSITION STATEMENT: why IDSA did not endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [^116FQvVP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

IDSA did not endorse the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines despite being represented in the working group that drafted the guidelines document. Leadership from the IDSA, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine had numerous amicable discussions primarily regarding the bolded, rated guidelines recommendations. Our societies had different perspectives, however, regarding the interpretation of the major studies that informed the guidelines' recommendations, thus leading us to different conclusions and different perspectives on the recommendations. IDSA consequently elected not to endorse the guidelines. IDSA nonetheless hopes to be able to continue collaborating with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to resolve our differences and to develop further strategies together to prevent sepsis and septic shock as well as reduce death and disability from these conditions both nationally and globally.

### Judging quality of current septic shock definitions and criteria [^116Bgxpb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Septic shock conceptually comprises an illness with new onset or worsening cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired tissue perfusion and cellular abnormalities caused by infection. Individually, none of these abnormalities truly reflects the complex illness concept but they may do so in combination, potentially improving the validity and reliability of a diagnosis of septic shock. As there are no specific treatments for this condition, this epidemiological refinement will not affect clinical care and may aid the design of studies that can identify illness-specific biomarkers and interventions.

### The impact of the sepsis-3 septic shock definition on previously defined septic shock patients [^114cg6uL]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force (Sepsis-3) recently recommended changes to the definitions of sepsis. The impact of these changes remains unclear. Our objective was to determine the outcomes of patients meeting Sepsis-3 septic shock criteria versus patients meeting the "old" (1991) criteria of septic shock only.

Design

Secondary analysis of two clinical trials of early septic shock resuscitation.

Setting

Large academic emergency departments in the United States.

Patients

Patients with suspected infection, more than or equal to two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and systolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg after fluid resuscitation.

Interventions

Patients were further categorized as Sepsis-3 septic shock if they demonstrated hypotension, received vasopressors, and exhibited a lactate greater than 2 mmol/L. We compared in-hospital mortality in patients who met the old definition only with those who met the Sepsis-3 criteria.

Measurements and Main Results

Four hundred seventy patients were included in the present analysis. Two hundred (42.5%) met Sepsis-3 criteria, whereas 270 (57.4%) met only the old definition. Patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria demonstrated higher severity of illness by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (9 vs 5; p < 0.001) and mortality (29% vs 14%; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of 127 patients meeting only the old definition demonstrated significant mortality benefit following implementation of a quantitative resuscitation protocol (35% vs 10%; p = 0.006).

Conclusion

In this analysis, 57% of patients meeting old definition for septic shock did not meet Sepsis-3 criteria. Although Sepsis-3 criteria identified a group of patients with increased organ failure and higher mortality, those patients who met the old criteria and not Sepsis-3 criteria still demonstrated significant organ failure and 14% mortality rate.

### Biomarkers of sepsis [^112AG7JL]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A complex network of biological mediators underlies the clinical syndrome of sepsis. The nonspecific physiologic criteria of sepsis syndrome or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome do not adequately identify patients who might benefit from either conventional anti-infective therapies or from novel therapies that target specific mediators of sepsis. Validated biomarkers of sepsis may improve diagnosis and therapeutic decision making for these high-risk patients.

Objectives

To develop a methodologic framework for the identification and validation of biomarkers of sepsis.

Methods

A small group meeting of experts in clinical epidemiology, biomarker development, and sepsis clinical trials; selective narrative review of the biomarker literature.

Results

The utility of a biomarker is a function of the degree to which it adds value to the available clinical information in the domains of screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of the response to therapy. We identified needs for greater standardization of biomarker methodologies, greater methodologic rigor in biomarker studies, wider integration of biomarkers into clinical studies (in particular, early phase studies), and increased collaboration among investigators, pharmaceutical industry, biomarker industry, and regulatory agencies.

Conclusions

Biomarkers promise to transform sepsis from a physiologic syndrome to a group of distinct biochemical disorders. This transformation could aid therapeutic decision making, and hence improve the prognosis for patients with sepsis, but will require an unprecedented degree of systematic investigation and collaboration.

### How to use biomarkers of infection or sepsis at the bedside: guide to clinicians [^111bw38N]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In this context, biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. More than 250 biomarkers have been identified and evaluated over the last few decades, but no biomarker accurately differentiates between sepsis and sepsis-like syndrome. Published data support the use of biomarkers for pathogen identification, clinical diagnosis, and optimization of antibiotic treatment. In this narrative review, we highlight how clinicians could improve the use of pathogen-specific and of the most used host-response biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, to improve the clinical care of patients with sepsis. Biomarker kinetics are more useful than single values in predicting sepsis, when making the diagnosis and assessing the response to antibiotic therapy. Finally, integrated biomarker-guided algorithms may hold promise to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Herein, we provide current data on the clinical utility of pathogen-specific and host-response biomarkers, offer guidance on how to optimize their use, and propose the needs for future research.

### Plasma interleukin-6 concentration for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults [^111bmeN5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The definition of sepsis has evolved over time, along with the clinical and scientific knowledge behind it. For years, sepsis was defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the presence of a documented or suspected infection. At present, sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection. Even though sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality in critically ill patients, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes it as a healthcare priority, it still lacks an accurate diagnostic test. Determining the accuracy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in plasma, which is proposed as a new biomarker for the diagnosis of sepsis, might be helpful to provide adequate and timely management of critically ill patients, and thus reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration for the diagnosis of bacterial sepsis in critically ill adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Web of Science on 25 January 2019. We screened references in the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not apply any language restriction to the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies enrolling critically ill adults aged 18 years or older under suspicion of sepsis during their hospitalization, where IL-6 concentrations were evaluated by serological measurement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the references to identify relevant studies and extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We estimated a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve by fitting a hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) non-linear mixed model. We explored sources of heterogeneity using the HSROC model parameters. We conducted all analyses in the SAS statistical software package and R software.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (n = 4192) assessing the accuracy of IL-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults. Twenty studies that were available as conference proceedings only are awaiting classification. The included participants were heterogeneous in terms of their distribution of age, gender, main diagnosis, setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis criteria, year of publication, and origin of infection, among other factors. Prevalence of sepsis greatly varied across studies, ranging from 12% to 78%. We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias due to issues related to the index test domain in QUADAS-2. The SROC curve showed a great dispersion in individual studies accuracy estimates (21 studies, 3650 adult patients), therefore the considerable heterogeneity in the collected data prevented us from calculating formal accuracy estimates. Using a fixed prevalence of sepsis of 50% and a fixed specificity of 74%, we found a sensitivity of 66% (95% confidence interval 60 to 72). If we test a cohort 1000 adult patients under suspicion of sepsis with IL-6, we will find that 330 patients would receive appropriate and timely antibiotic therapy, while 130 patients would be wrongly considered to have sepsis. In addition, 370 out of 1000 patients would avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy, and 170 patients would have been undiagnosed of sepsis. This numerical approach should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations described above.

Authors' Conclusions

Our evidence assessment of plasma interleukin-6 concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adults reveals several limitations. High heterogeneity of collected evidence regarding the main diagnosis, setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis criteria, year of publication, and the origin of infection, among other factors, along with the potential number of misclassifications, remain significant constraints for its implementation. The 20 conference proceedings assessed as studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once they are fully published and evaluated. Further studies about the accuracy of interleukin-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in adults that apply rigorous methodology for conducting diagnostic test accuracy studies are needed. The conclusions of the review will likely change once the 20 studies pending publication are fully published and included.

### Assessment of clinical criteria for sepsis: for the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^112DCACY]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force defined sepsis as "life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection". The performance of clinical criteria for this sepsis definition is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the validity of clinical criteria to identify patients with suspected infection who are at risk of sepsis.

Design, Settings, and Population

Among 1.3 million electronic health record encounters from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, at 12 hospitals in southwestern Pennsylvania, we identified those with suspected infection in whom to compare criteria. Confirmatory analyses were performed in 4 data sets of 706,399 out-of-hospital and hospital encounters at 165 US and non-US hospitals ranging from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 2013.

Exposures

Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score, and a new model derived using multivariable logistic regression in a split sample, the quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (range, 0–3 points, with 1 point each for systolic hypotension [≤ 100 mm Hg], tachypnea [≥ 22/min], or altered mentation).

Main Outcomes and Measures

For construct validity, pairwise agreement was assessed. For predictive validity, the discrimination for outcomes (primary: in-hospital mortality; secondary: in-hospital mortality or intensive care unit [ICU] length of stay ≥ 3 days) more common in sepsis than uncomplicated infection was determined. Results were expressed as the fold change in outcome over deciles of baseline risk of death and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

Results

In the primary cohort, 148,907 encounters had suspected infection (n = 74,453 derivation; n = 74,454 validation), of whom 6347 (4%) died. Among ICU encounters in the validation cohort (n = 7932 with suspected infection, of whom 1289 [16%] died), the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality was lower for SIRS (AUROC = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62–0.66) and qSOFA (AUROC = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.64–0.68) vs SOFA (AUROC = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P < .001 for both) or LODS (AUROC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; P < .001 for both). Among non-ICU encounters in the validation cohort (n = 66 522 with suspected infection, of whom 1886 [3%] died), qSOFA had predictive validity (AUROC = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80–0.82) that was greater than SOFA (AUROC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.78–0.80; P < .001) and SIRS (AUROC = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75–0.77; P < .001). Relative to qSOFA scores lower than 2, encounters with qSOFA scores of 2 or higher had a 3- to 14-fold increase in hospital mortality across baseline risk deciles. Findings were similar in external data sets and for the secondary outcome.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ICU encounters with suspected infection, the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality of SOFA was not significantly different than the more complex LODS but was statistically greater than SIRS and qSOFA, supporting its use in clinical criteria for sepsis. Among encounters with suspected infection outside of the ICU, the predictive validity for in-hospital mortality of qSOFA was statistically greater than SOFA and SIRS, supporting its use as a prompt to consider possible sepsis.

### Systematic review and consensus definitions for the standardised endpoints in perioperative medicine (StEP) initiative: infection and sepsis [^112AUGMy]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative infection and sepsis are of fundamental concern to perioperative clinicians. However, standardised endpoints are either poorly defined or not routinely implemented. The Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine (StEP) initiative was established to derive a set of standardised endpoints for use in perioperative clinical trials.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review to identify measures of infection and sepsis used in the perioperative literature. A multi-round Delphi consensus process that included more than 60 clinician researchers was then used to refine a recommended list of outcome measures.

Results

A literature search yielded 1857 titles of which 255 met inclusion criteria for endpoint extraction. A long list of endpoints, with definitions and timescales, was generated and those potentially relevant to infection and sepsis circulated to the theme subgroup and then the wider StEP-COMPAC working group, undergoing a three-stage Delphi process. The response rates for Delphi rounds 1, 3, and 3 were 89% (n = 8), 67% (n = 62), and 80% (n = 8), respectively. A set of 13 endpoints including fever, surgical site, and organ-specific infections as defined by the US Centres for Disease Control and Sepsis-3 are proposed for future use.

Conclusions

We defined a consensus list of standardised endpoints related to infection and sepsis for perioperative trials using an established and rigorous approach. Each endpoint was evaluated with respect to validity, reliability, feasibility, and patient centredness. One or more of these should be considered for inclusion in future perioperative clinical trials assessing infection, sepsis, or both, thereby permitting synthesis and comparison of future results.

### The evolving value of older biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of pediatric sepsis [^1163TLpA]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. The evolving definition of pediatric sepsis is extrapolated from adult studies. Although lacking formal validation in the pediatric population, this working definition has historically proven its clinical utility. Prompt identification of pediatric sepsis is challenging as clinical picture is often variable. Timely intervention is crucial for optimal outcome, thus biomarkers are utilized to aid in immediate, yet judicious, diagnosis of sepsis. Over time, their use in sepsis has expanded with discovery of newer biomarkers that include genomic bio-signatures. Despite recent scientific advances, there is no biomarker that can accurately diagnose sepsis. Furthermore, older biomarkers are readily available in most institutions while newer biomarkers are not. Hence, the latter's clinical value in pediatric sepsis remains theoretical. Albeit promising, scarce data on newer biomarkers have been extracted from research settings making their clinical value unclear. As interest in newer biomarkers continue to proliferate despite their ambiguous clinical use, the literature on older biomarkers in clinical settings continue to diminish. Thus, revisiting the evolving value of these earliest biomarkers in optimizing pediatric sepsis diagnosis is warranted. This review focuses on the four most readily available biomarkers to bedside clinicians in diagnosing pediatric sepsis. IMPACT: The definition of pediatric sepsis remains an extrapolation from adult studies. Older biomarkers that include C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, and lactate are the most readily available biomarkers in most pediatric institutions to aid in the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis. Older biomarkers, although in varying levels of reliability, remain to be useful clinical adjuncts in the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis if used in the appropriate clinical context. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are more sensitive and specific among these older biomarkers in diagnosing pediatric sepsis although evidence varies in different age groups and clinical scenarios.

### The last 100 years of sepsis [^115apqan]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Over the last 100 years, huge advances have been made in the field of sepsis in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutics. Here, we offer our perspective of the key changes and current situation in each of these areas. Despite these changes, mortality rates remain unacceptably high and continued progress, particularly in early diagnosis and therapy, is urgently needed.

### American Burn Association consensus conference to define sepsis and infection in burns [^1174FXFb]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2007). Low credibility.

Because of their extensive wounds, burn patients are chronically exposed to inflammatory mediators. Thus, burn patients, by definition, already have "systemic inflammatory response syndrome". Current definitions for sepsis and infection have many criteria (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis) that are routinely found in patients with extensive burns, making these current definitions less applicable to the burn population. Experts in burn care and research, all members of the American Burn Association, were asked to review the literature and prepare a potential definition on one topic related to sepsis or infection in burn patients. On January 20, 2007, the participants met in Tucson, Arizona to develop consensus for these definitions. After review of the definitions, a summary of the proceedings was prepared. The goal of the consensus conference was to develop and publish standardized definitions for sepsis and infection-related diagnoses in the burn population. Standardized definitions will improve the capability of performing more meaningful multicenter trials among burn centers.

### Patient, public, and healthcare professionals' sepsis awareness, knowledge, and information seeking behaviors: a scoping review [^116m6MFR]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis Knowledge

Most studies evaluated sepsis knowledge (n = 51/80; 63.7%), including patient, public, or HCP knowledge of the definition of sepsis (n = 30/51; 58.8%), sepsis signs/symptoms (n = 34/51; 66.7%), mortality (n = 7/51; 13.7%), and risk factors (n = 8/51; 15.7%). The sepsis knowledge survey developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) was most frequently used to evaluate patient or public sepsis knowledge. The survey by Robson et al was most frequently used to evaluate HCP sepsis knowledge.

Definition of Sepsis

Thirty studies (n = 30/80; 37.5%) reported on patient (n = 3/30; 10%), public (7/30; 23.3%), or HCP (21/30; 70%) knowledge of the definition of sepsis. One study included patients and HCPs. The proportions of patients/public who "correctly" selected the study-identified definition of sepsis ranged from 4.2% (Singapore) to 92% (Sweden) (Fig. 2). In comparison, there was a higher proportion of HCPs who could correctly identify the definition of sepsis, which ranged from 17% (EMTs) to 91% (nurses). As demonstrated in Table 1, sepsis definitions in the included studies show important yet slight variation in interpretation and description. Although most of these definitions are different, some have overlapping elements. For example, the two definitions "sepsis is evidence of organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection" and "presence of life-threatening organic dysfunction secondary to the body's unregulated response to infection" have overlapping elements of organ dysfunction and infection. This emphasizes the importance of a global definition for sepsis.

### Validation of the new sepsis-3 definitions: proposal for improvement in early risk identification [^112K4J4E]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Sepsis-3 definitions generated controversies regarding their general applicability. The Sepsis-3 Task Force outlined the need for validation with emphasis on the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. This was done in a prospective cohort from a different healthcare setting.

Methods

Patients with infections and at least two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were analysed. Sepsis was defined as total SOFA ≥ 2 outside the intensive care unit (ICU) or as an increase of ICU admission SOFA ≥ 2. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity of qSOFA outside the ICU and sepsis definition both outside and within the ICU to predict mortality.

Results

In all, 3346 infections outside the ICU and 1058 infections in the ICU were analysed. Outside the ICU, respective mortality with ≥ 2 SIRS and qSOFA ≥ 2 was 25.3% and 41.2% (p < 0.0001); the sensitivities of qSOFA and of sepsis definition to predict death were 60.8% and 87.2%, respectively. This was 95.9% for sepsis definition in the ICU. The sensitivity of qSOFA and of ≥ 3 SIRS criteria for organ dysfunction outside the ICU was 48.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Misclassification outside the ICU with the 1991 and Sepsis-3 definitions into stages of lower severity was 21.4% and 3.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001) and 14.9% and 3.7%, respectively, in the ICU (p < 0.0001). Adding arterial pH ≤ 7.30 to qSOFA increased sensitivity for prediction of death to 67.5% (p 0.004).

Conclusions

Our analysis positively validated the use of SOFA score to predict unfavourable outcome and to limit misclassification into lower severity. However, qSOFA score had inadequate sensitivity for early risk assessment.

### Paediatric and neonatal sepsis and inflammation [^111YLRn5]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Definitions, diagnosis

The Sepsis-3 consensus defined adult sepsis as a "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection". The Paediatric sepsis definition is under development by the International Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce and has found strong associations of organ dysfunction markers linked with clinical outcomes suitable for inclusion in the validation phase of the definition. However neonatal sepsis definitions are not aligned with those in adults and children as many clinicians still rely on microbiological results rather than organ dysfunction. In addition to the lack of an internationally accepted consensus definition of neonatal sepsis, there are no long-term outcomes or core outcome datasets to standardise clinical trials of sepsis and allow comparison between trials.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines highlighted the need for research in clinical trials on paediatric sepsis recognition and QI screening tool algorithms to recognise clinical deterioration as essential. Rapid development in sepsis recognition tools have occurred in recent years and involve the electronic health record. Eisenberg et al. describe the different sepsis screening tools that have evolved and discuss the risk of alarm fatigue if too many false positives are detected.

Celik et al. discuss the issues related to the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis as culture methods alone are not adequate and traditional laboratory biomarkers such as CRP and PCT have limitations as serial measurements are required. Molecular diagnostic tools such as PCR and sequencing, and mass spectrometry offer promise for more rapid and sensitive detection of disease but are not yet in routine clinical practice. Machine learning, AI and multi-omics may allow future personalised care and rapid early accurate diagnosis of sepsis.

### Maternal sepsis is an evolving challenge [^114f4ak1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite major advances in the last century, particularly in high resource settings, maternal sepsis remains a common and potentially preventable cause of direct maternal death globally. A barrier to further progress has been the lack of consensus on the definition of maternal sepsis. Publications from two recent multidisciplinary consensus conferences, one on sepsis in the non-pregnant adult and the other on sepsis in the pregnant woman, concluded that the criteria for diagnosing sepsis should be clinically-based, applicable at the bedside, and should not be laboratory-based. Informed by reviews of the evidence, in 2017 WHO published a new definition of maternal sepsis based on the presence of suspected or confirmed infection. It also announced a Global Maternal and Neonatal Sepsis Initiative to identify the diagnostic criteria for the early identification, epidemiology, and disease classification of maternal sepsis. Standardizing the criteria for maternal sepsis optimizes clinical audit and research. It may facilitate the evaluation of the role of different clinical parameters and biomarkers in the diagnosis, earlier recognition and management of maternal infection and sepsis. Further work is required to develop an international consensus on the criteria for diagnosing maternal sepsis and any associated organ dysfunction.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria in defining severe sepsis [^11183mWR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The consensus definition of severe sepsis requires suspected or proven infection, organ failure, and signs that meet two or more criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We aimed to test the sensitivity, face validity, and construct validity of this approach.

Methods

We studied data from patients from 172 intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand from 2000 through 2013. We identified patients with infection and organ failure and categorized them according to whether they had signs meeting two or more SIRS criteria (SIRS-positive severe sepsis) or less than two SIRS criteria (SIRS-negative severe sepsis). We compared their characteristics and outcomes and assessed them for the presence of a step increase in the risk of death at a threshold of two SIRS criteria.

Results

Of 1,171,797 patients, a total of 109,663 had infection and organ failure. Among these, 96,385 patients (87.9%) had SIRS-positive severe sepsis and 13,278 (12.1%) had SIRS-negative severe sepsis. Over a period of 14 years, these groups had similar characteristics and changes in mortality (SIRS-positive group: from 36.1% [829 of 2296 patients] to 18.3% [2037 of 11,119], P < 0.001; SIRS-negative group: from 27.7% [100 of 361] to 9.3% [122 of 1315], P < 0.001). Moreover, this pattern remained similar after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio in the SIRS-positive group, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 0.97; odds ratio in the SIRS-negative group, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; P = 0.12 for between-group difference). In the adjusted analysis, mortality increased linearly with each additional SIRS criterion (odds ratio for each additional criterion, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.15; P < 0.001) without any transitional increase in risk at a threshold of two SIRS criteria.

Conclusions

The need for two or more SIRS criteria to define severe sepsis excluded one in eight otherwise similar patients with infection, organ failure, and substantial mortality and failed to define a transition point in the risk of death.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^115EQsJt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The Sepsis-3 definitions requiring the presence of organ dysfunction to define sepsis may hinder the awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment of infections before organ dysfunction appears, de-emphasizing intervention at earlier stages when it is most treatable.

Ideally, patients at risk for sepsis should be identified before organ dysfunction is established. Therefore, it may be questionable if it is helpful to have a definition that recognizes a patient once organ dysfunction has occurred and the patient already needs intensive care.

An observational study conducted at 132 medical institutions worldwide over a 4-month study period enrolled 4533 patients to validate a predictive score for patients with intra-abdominal infections. Data from the WSES cIAIs Score Study (WISS) showed that mortality was significantly affected by the previous sepsis definition. Mortality with no sepsis was 1.2%, with sepsis only 4.4%, with severe sepsis 27.8%, and with septic shock was 67.8%. Severity of illness and the inherent mortality risk escalated from no sepsis, through sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

The previous stratification of the severity and consequent mortality due to infection that progressed from no sepsis to sepsis (infection meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS), to severe sepsis (sepsis with organ failure, arterial hypertension, and/or hypoperfusion), to septic shock (arterial hypotension refractory to adequate volume resuscitation) is now reduced to simple infection, sepsis (infection and organ dysfunction), and septic shock (arterial hypotension defined as the use of vasopressors and hyperlactatemia). The previous concept of severe sepsis corresponds now to the definition of sepsis in the Sepsis-3 criteria, although this correlation is not absolute because sepsis, according to the new criteria, can include very different conditions, such as organ failure without hypotension nor hyperlactatemia.

The Sepsis-3 definitions exclude patients with isolated hypotension from the definition of sepsis because they would have a SOFA score of 1. Moreover, lactate is not part of the SOFA score, even though it is well documented to be a sensitive marker of severity of illness in patients with infection.

### Status of sepsis care in European hospitals: results from an international cross-sectional survey [^114urA9K]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Use of Sepsis Definitions

Most hospitals (45.4%; 95% CI, 42.3%–48.5%) reported using the Sepsis-3 definition (Table 1). The Sepsis-3 criteria were used more often in Northern Europe (48.0%; 95% CI, 37.9%–58.2%) and Southern Europe (53.5%, 95% CI, 46.0%–60.9%) than in Eastern Europe (39.5%; 95% CI, 33.0%–46.4%) and Western Europe (43.0%; 95% CI, 37.6%–48.5%). Sepsis-1 was used in 24.5% (95% CI, 21.9%–27.3%) of hospitals and more commonly in Eastern Europe (37.7%; 95% CI, 31.2%–44.5%). Sepsis-1 and Sepsis-3 criteria were used together in 23.2% (95% CI, 20.6%–25.9%) of hospitals. A smaller proportion of hospitals (6.9%; 95% CI, 5.5%–8.7%) used other criteria or had no definition for sepsis. Sepsis-3 was more frequently used in university hospitals (51.0%; 95% CI, 45.7%–56.2%) than in general hospitals (42.0%; 95% CI, 38.0%–46.2%) and more often in hospitals with more than 750 beds (Table 1).

### QSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis [^116rLepk]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

We would like to stress that, although SIRS was part of the definition of sepsis in 1992, the qSOFA is not part of the new sepsis definitions. This important difference is illustrated in Fig. 1, with panel A showing that infection and sepsis (by the 1992 definition) are virtually the same — infection without SIRS can be found, but it is relatively rare. By contrast, panel B shows that sepsis (by the new SEPSIS-3 definition) represents only a minority of cases of infection. Moreover, panel B illustrates important aspects of the sepsis definition vis-à-vis infection and qSOFA. For example, sepsis can be present without a qSOFA score ≥ 2 because different forms of organ dysfunction may be present than are assessed using the qSOFA, such as hypoxemia, renal failure, coagulopathy, or hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, a patient may have a qSOFA ≥ 2 without infection; for example, in other acute conditions, such as hypovolemia, severe heart failure, or large pulmonary embolism. Further work remains to be done to determine the predictive validity of qSOFA in such patients. Finally, infected patients may have a qSOFA ≥ 2 and not be septic because the degree of hypotension, tachycardia, and/or altered mentation needed to fulfill qSOFA criteria is not the same as that needed to meet the SOFA organ dysfunction criteria necessary for a diagnosis of sepsis; the qSOFA criteria are thus clinically valuable but imperfect markers of sepsis. Nevertheless, in an analysis of a database of more than 74,000 patients, Seymour et al. recently reported that 75% of patients with suspected infection who had two or more qSOFA points also had at least two SOFA points.

Fig. 1
Schematic representation illustrating a the almost complete overlap of sepsis and infection when the SIRS criteria of the 1992 criteria are used and b the differences between qSOFA and sepsis. qSOFA quick sequential organ failure assessment, SIRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome

We hope this editorial will clarify that the qSOFA is meant to be used to raise suspicion of sepsis and prompt further action — it is not a replacement for SIRS and is not part of the definition of sepsis.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The Campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, SSC created a research committee that was charged with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018. The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Year in review 2013: critical care – sepsis [^115b9Jrv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite intense experimental and clinical research activity over the past decades, sepsis still remains an elusive syndrome. Actual understanding has led to international recommendations on diagnosis and treatment, but management of severe sepsis and septic shock in the ICU still represents a major challenge for clinicians in 2014, with high mortality rates. The past year's contribution to the field of sepsis research was quite prolific, and the aim of this review is to summarise the relevant findings of research articles that were published in 2013 in Critical Care and other relevant journals. We focus on advances in the understanding of sepsis physiopathology, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, potential new therapies, and epidemiologic and outcome studies.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1115wEis]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^112o3sXj]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

For more than two decades, sepsis was defined as a microbial infection that produces fever (or hypothermia), tachycardia, tachypnoea and blood leukocyte changes. Sepsis is now increasingly being considered a dysregulated systemic inflammatory and immune response to microbial invasion that produces organ injury for which mortality rates are declining to 15–25%. Septic shock remains defined as sepsis with hyperlactataemia and concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, with in-hospital mortality rates approaching 30–50%. With earlier recognition and more compliance to best practices, sepsis has become less of an immediate life-threatening disorder and more of a long-term chronic critical illness, often associated with prolonged inflammation, immune suppression, organ injury and lean tissue wasting. Furthermore, patients who survive sepsis have continuing risk of mortality after discharge, as well as long-term cognitive and functional deficits. Earlier recognition and improved implementation of best practices have reduced in-hospital mortality, but results from the use of immunomodulatory agents to date have been disappointing. Similarly, no biomarker can definitely diagnose sepsis or predict its clinical outcome. Because of its complexity, improvements in sepsis outcomes are likely to continue to be slow and incremental.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^11173gbC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a goal of what?

The complexity of lactate as a molecule, substrate, biomarker, energy source, component of some intravenous fluids, and major modulator of cellular bioenergetics during physiological stress is formidable. Such complexity makes it impossible to define what goal it should be a marker or target of. Seeking to lower lactate levels (by whatever means given the multiple events that regulate its blood levels) has no credibility and no logic in terms of hemodynamics, bioenergetics, or tissue protection. In fact, it could make more biological sense to assist the natural process of lactate utilization and generation during sepsis or during other physiological stress situations by administering lactate. Until we are able to define the goals that we wish to achieve by manipulating lactate and have the means of measuring whether we have achieved such goals or not, the idea of seeking to lower lactate by increasing its "clearance" in sepsis is both an illusion and a folly.

### The need for change in generating evidence for the critically ill [^11469E94]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Critical illness often represents a turning point in patients' journeys. Sepsis, one of the main drivers of critical illness, is the leading cause of death worldwide. The last edition of the sepsis management international guidelines has 93 statements, most recommendations having low or very low quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for evidence generation, but the costs, time, and resources needed to test all the recommendations using traditional trials could take decades and cost billions of dollars.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113VuuTG]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — scope and populations define "children" as infants, school-aged children, and adolescents. All recommendations apply to children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated acute organ dysfunction. The guidelines are not intended to address the management of infection with or without SIRS when there is not associated acute organ dysfunction, and newborns less than 37 weeks gestation are excluded. The panel sought to include term neonates (0–28 d) born at greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation; however, because studies of neonates with perinatal infection or conditions associated with neonatal sepsis were not specifically addressed, these guidelines do not address all management considerations for neonatal sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^113YNoab]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Definitions of severe and critical COVID-19 — adult criteria: Severe disease involves clinical signs of pneumonia plus one of the following thresholds or conditions — respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation < 90% on room air. Critical disease is defined by the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure requiring ventilation, sepsis, or septic shock.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^114t8rLh]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The SOFA score has become integrated into a range of aspects of critical care since its development in the early 1990s, and it is now widely employed in the daily monitoring of acute morbidity in critical care units. The SOFA score was designed to provide population level insights into the acute morbidity of ICU patients; however, its application has broadened substantially in recent years. Following the development of new definitions, it is now used as a key criterion in the diagnosis of the sepsis syndrome on an individual patient level. It is also increasingly used to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in phase II trials, a development that follows acceptance by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and others of organ dysfunction scores as an endpoint in exploratory trials for sepsis.

This review describes the development of the score and the challenges associated with robust and reproducible calculation and proposes guidance for its assessment in clinical trials, where inconsistency in SOFA score measurement could introduce substantial variability in key outcomes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^112zUSXi]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Long-term outcomes and goals of care — discussion and timing: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families over no such discussion (Best practice statement). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest addressing goals of care early (within 72 hr) over late (72 hr or later) (Weak, low quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on any specific standardized criterion to trigger goals of care discussion.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^117Kenw6]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methodology — definitions applied for pediatric sepsis in these guidelines: For the purposes of these guidelines, we define septic shock in children as severe infection leading to cardiovascular dysfunction (including hypotension, need for treatment with a vasoactive medication, or impaired perfusion) and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children as severe infection leading to cardiovascular and/or noncardiovascular organ dysfunction. The majority of studies used to establish evidence referred to the 2005 nomenclature in which severe sepsis was defined as 1) greater than or equal to 2 age-based systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, 2) confirmed or suspected invasive infection, and 3) cardiovascular dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or greater than or equal to 2 noncardiovascular organ system dysfunctions, and septic shock was defined as the subset with cardiovascular dysfunction, which included hypotension, treatment with a vasoactive medication, or impaired perfusion. Because several methods to identify acute organ dysfunction in children are currently available, we chose not to require a specific definition or scheme for this purpose.
