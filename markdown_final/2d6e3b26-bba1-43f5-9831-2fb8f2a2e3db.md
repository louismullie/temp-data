## Question

Increase in Alkaline phosphatase

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the source of ALP using GGT and isoenzyme patterns. Next, I will branch the workup into hepatic versus non-hepatic etiologies, followed by targeted imaging and serologies. After that, I need to consider special populations and prognostic implications. Finally, I will outline monitoring, thresholds for biopsy, and a concise algorithm to tie this together, making sure I double-check each step against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pre-analytical or transient causes. I should repeat the liver panel and add a GGT to verify persistence and hepatic origin before committing to a full workup, and I need to check for hemolysis, recent meals, or assay interference that could artifactually elevate ALP, because guidelines emphasize confirming true abnormalities and using GGT to corroborate hepatic sourcing before proceeding [^1156xFwp] [^114k6r3r].

> Wait, let me verify the source next. If GGT is elevated, that supports a hepatobiliary origin, whereas a normal GGT pushes me to consider bone, intestinal, or placental sources, and if the pattern remains unclear, I should order ALP isoenzyme fractionation to distinguish liver, bone, and intestinal fractions, keeping in mind that GGT is not specific and can be elevated in alcohol use even without overt liver disease, so I should not overinterpret an isolated GGT rise without corroborating cholestatic chemistries [^115xNaAK] [^114k6r3r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also integrate the rest of the liver panel to classify the injury pattern, using the R ratio to separate hepatocellular from cholestatic or mixed patterns, because an ALP-predominant pattern guides me toward biliary disease, while a mixed pattern may reflect overlapping processes, and this classification will shape subsequent imaging and serologic testing choices [^116MrpTo] [^1155asMt].

> If hepatic origin is confirmed, I will now examine the biliary tree with a right upper quadrant ultrasound. If ducts are dilated, I should suspect extrahepatic obstruction and proceed to MRCP or ERCP as indicated, whereas non-dilated ducts suggest intrahepatic cholestasis and should prompt autoimmune serologies including AMA for primary biliary cholangitis and ANA/SMA for autoimmune hepatitis, with consideration of IgG4 in the right context, and I should remember that PSC can present with a cholestatic profile and may require MRCP even when ultrasound is unrevealing [^116VCtcF] [^114k6r3r] [^1165dMgH].

> I need to ensure I do not miss infiltrative or granulomatous disease. If ultrasound and serologies are unrevealing and ALP remains more than twice the upper limit of normal, I should consider liver biopsy to evaluate for small duct PSC, sarcoidosis, drug-induced injury, or other uncommon causes, and I should double-check medications and supplements meticulously because drug-induced liver injury is a common and often overlooked cause of cholestatic injury [^114k6r3r] [^113s1NHW].

> If non-hepatic origin is likely, I should review bone disease next. Paget's disease typically shows marked ALP elevations with characteristic skeletal findings and responds biochemically to bisphosphonates, so I should obtain plain radiographs of symptomatic bones and consider a bone scan to assess extent, then use total ALP to monitor treatment response, recognizing that bone-specific ALP or other turnover markers can be helpful when total ALP is normal but suspicion remains high [^116LPuzr] [^115S355f].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD? I should consider CKD-mineral and bone disorder, where high total ALP often reflects elevated bone turnover and correlates with PTH-driven disease, and I should monitor calcium, phosphorus, and PTH alongside ALP at guideline-recommended intervals, noting that bone-specific ALP can be a more stable marker than PTH in some settings, though availability varies and clinical context remains paramount [^111tFadN] [^114v4JkQ].

> Let me consider pregnancy. I should confirm gestational age because ALP rises in the second and third trimesters due to placental isoenzyme, so modest elevations are expected, but if ALP is extremely high or accompanied by concerning symptoms, I should evaluate for placental insufficiency or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and I should remember that isolated ALP elevation in pregnancy is often benign yet warrants correlation with clinical context [^1165GU7U] [^116t8JQh].

> I should double-check pediatrics. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common in healthy children, often following viral illness, with ALP levels sometimes five to ten times the upper limit of normal that normalize within weeks to a few months, so if the child is well and other liver and bone tests are normal, observation and repeat testing are appropriate to avoid unnecessary imaging or invasive workup [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications. In cholestatic liver diseases like PBC, lower ALP and bilirubin correlate with better transplant-free survival, and ALP normalization or sustained reduction is associated with improved outcomes, whereas in PSC, large spontaneous fluctuations in ALP limit its reliability as a progression biomarker, so I should interpret serial changes cautiously and integrate with other markers like ELF when available [^116bhGPj] [^111U7ekM] [^113zTGZL].

> I will now examine special contexts. In oncology, rising ALP can signal bone metastases or tumor-derived ALP activity, so I should correlate with symptoms and imaging, and in bone sarcomas, ALP and LDH have prognostic value at baseline, while in critical illness and sepsis-associated AKI, exogenous alkaline phosphatase has shown signals of renal benefit in small trials, though this remains investigational and not standard of care [^1166HcT4] [^111p1iTG] [^112jPSj6].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and thresholds. For confirmed hepatic ALP elevation, I should repeat labs every 3 to 6 months if stable and pursue escalation if there is a persistent rise beyond twice normal or new jaundice, and for bone disease, I should expect total ALP to decline within 2 to 3 months of effective antiresorptive therapy and consider additional turnover markers if the response is unclear or disease is limited but active [^114k6r3r] [^115xhVeX].

> Hold on, I should verify the biopsy threshold. Persistent ALP elevation beyond six months, especially if greater than twice the upper limit of normal with nondiagnostic imaging and serologies, justifies liver biopsy to clarify the diagnosis and stage disease, and I should ensure that reversible causes such as medications have been excluded before proceeding to invasive testing [^114k6r3r] [^1156xFwp].

> To synthesize, my algorithm is to confirm the abnormality and add GGT, classify the liver test pattern with the R ratio, obtain ultrasound if hepatic origin is suspected, branch to MRCP or ERCP for ductal dilatation versus autoimmune and infiltrative testing for non-dilated ducts, consider biopsy if unexplained and persistent, and if non-hepatic, pivot to bone imaging and markers or age-appropriate considerations like pregnancy or pediatric benign hyperphosphatasemia, documenting each step and revisiting assumptions if new data contradict the working diagnosis [^114k6r3r] [^116VCtcF] [^116MrpTo].

---

An increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reflects **increased bone turnover** [^111Y8Hb4], **cholestatic liver disease** [^111Zqb9T], or **placental/intestinal sources** [^1165GU7U] [^117XpUm1]. Evaluate with **GGT** [^111Zqb9T] to confirm hepatic origin, then use ultrasound [^116VCtcF] and cholestatic serologies (AMA, ANA, ASMA) [^114k6r3r] to distinguish intra- from extrahepatic causes. In children, transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2]; in adults, persistent elevations warrant imaging and targeted labs [^114k6r3r]. ALP is a marker of disease activity and prognosis in cholestatic and bone diseases, not a disease itself [^116bhGPj] [^1166HcT4].

---

## Physiological roles of alkaline phosphatase

ALP is a metalloenzyme that **catalyzes phosphate ester hydrolysis** at alkaline pH, supporting bone mineralization, intestinal lipid absorption, and bile canalicular function [^1126UAag] [^116z8vAc]. Isoforms include bone, liver, intestine, and placenta; **bone ALP rises with osteoblast activity**, while liver ALP rises with cholestasis [^116z8vAc] [^111Zqb9T].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated alkaline phosphatase

Elevated ALP is **not disease-specific** and reflects increased synthesis or release from bone, liver, intestine, or placenta [^111Zqb9T]. The clinical significance depends on the **underlying source and disease activity** [^114k6r3r].

---

## Common causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Hepatic | - Cholestasis (PBC, PSC, biliary obstruction) [^1155asMt] [^115xNaAK] <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Infiltrative liver disease [^notfound] |
| Bone | - Paget's disease [^113zBMQ2] <br/> - Osteomalacia/rickets [^112QxpcA] <br/> - Hyperparathyroidism [^112vJ7eE] <br/> - Bone metastases [^117RKeur] <br/> - Fracture healing [^notfound] |
| Placental | - Pregnancy (2nd–3rd trimesters) [^1165GU7U] |
| Intestinal | - Recent fatty meal [^notfound] <br/> - IBD [^notfound] |
| Pediatric | - Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia [^115XLydM] [^113kShy2] |
| Medications | - Anticonvulsants <br/> - Glucocorticoids <br/> - NSAIDs [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase

A **structured approach** is essential [^114k6r3r]:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat ALP and check GGT to confirm hepatic origin [^111Zqb9T].
- **Imaging**: Right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess bile ducts and liver parenchyma [^116VCtcF].
- **Serologies**: AMA for PBC; ANA, ASMA for autoimmune hepatitis; IgG4 for IgG4-related disease [^114k6r3r].
- **Bone evaluation**: Calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, bone scan if bone disease suspected [^notfound].
- **Isoenzymes**: Consider fractionation if the source remains unclear [^115xNaAK].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

- **Cholestatic liver disease**: ALP correlates with disease activity and prognosis; normalization predicts better outcomes [^116bhGPj] [^111U7ekM].
- **Bone disease**: ALP reflects turnover and is used to monitor therapy (e.g. bisphosphonates) [^115xhVeX].
- **Malignancy**: Elevated ALP in bone metastases or osteosarcoma indicates active disease and worse prognosis [^1166HcT4].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Hepatic**: Treat cholestasis (e.g. UDCA for PBC), relieve obstruction, stop hepatotoxic drugs [^114k6r3r] [^116bhGPj].
- **Bone**: Treat metabolic bone disease (e.g. bisphosphonates, vitamin D, calcium) [^115S355f].
- **Pediatric**: Reassure and monitor in benign hyperphosphatasemia [^113kShy2].
- **Medications**: Discontinue offending agents [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

During pregnancy, **second–third trimester ALP elevations are normal** [^1165GU7U]; in children, transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common [^115XLydM]; and in older adults, ALP may rise with age, especially in women over 50 [^113LJvTk].

---

An increase in alkaline phosphatase signals **increased activity from bone, liver, intestine, or placenta** [^115S355f] [^113LJvTk] [^117XpUm1] [^1165GU7U]. Confirm the source with GGT and isoenzymes, then tailor imaging and serologies to the likely etiology [^115xNaAK]. ALP is a marker of disease activity and prognosis, guiding therapy and follow-up [^116bhGPj] [^116LPuzr].

### Differences in serum alkaline phosphatase levels in infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation versus necrotizing enterocolitis with perforation [^114xMPS9]. Neonatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Data on laboratory markers of spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remain sparse.

Objective

To compare serum alkaline phosphatase levels in infants with bowel perforation secondary to SIP versus surgical NEC, and then investigate the possible role of serum alkaline phosphatase in differentiating infants with these conditions.

Methods

A retrospective case-control study of infants admitted with bowel perforation from 2005 to 2015. Demographic and prenatal data, postnatal exposures, and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings were extracted from inpatient medical records and analyzed using regression analysis.

Results

Of 114 outborn infants included, 48 infants had SIP (cases) and 66 had NEC (controls). Upon admission from the referring hospital, the serum alkaline phosphatase level was significantly higher in infants with SIP, i.e., a median value of 782 versus236 U/L in NEC patients (p < 0.0001), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 4.3 (p < 0.05) when the level was > 500 U/L in multivariate regression model. Infants with SIP had significantly younger gestational age, presented earlier in life, primarily with pneumoperitoneum, and had greater exposure to steroids and indomethacin compared to infants with NEC. Alkaline phosphatase levels decreased rapidly in infants with SIP following admission.

Conclusion

A transient increase in serum alkaline phosphatase level is independently associated with SIP when compared to NEC. Studies to confirm the role of alkaline phosphatase in the diagnosis of SIP are necessary and have potentially significant clinical and prognostic implications.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^117RKeur]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA renal mass follow-up — bone scan use directs that patients undergoing follow-up for treated malignant renal masses should only undergo bone scan if one or more of the following is present: clinical symptoms such as bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, or radiographic findings suggestive of a bony neoplasm (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The text also notes that the routine use of bone scan in the absence of bone pain or elevated ALP should not be pursued, although with the presence of symptoms and/or elevated marker, radionuclide bone scan can be a useful test.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^117XpUm1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Minoxidil [^111H1h8E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

4. Hematologic - Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (WBC < 3000/mm³) have rarely been reported.

5. Gastrointestinal - Nausea and/or vomiting has been reported. In clinical trials the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the underlying disease has shown a decrease from pretrial levels.

6. Miscellaneous - Breast tenderness - This developed in less than 1% of patients.

7. Altered Laboratory Findings - (a) ECG changes - Changes in direction and magnitude of the ECG T-waves occur in approximately 60% of patients treated with minoxidil. In rare instances a large negative amplitude of the T-wave may encroach upon the S-T segment, but the S-T segment is not independently altered. These changes usually disappear with continuance of treatment and revert to the pretreatment state if minoxidil is discontinued. No symptoms have been associated with these changes, nor have there been alterations in blood cell counts or in plasma enzyme concentrations that would suggest myocardial damage. Long-term treatment of patients manifesting such changes has provided no evidence of deteriorating cardiac function. At present the changes appear to be nonspecific and without identifiable clinical significance. (b) Effects of hemodilution-hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocyte count usually fall about 7% initially and then recover to pretreatment levels. (c) Other - Alkaline phosphatase increased varyingly without other evidence of liver or bone abnormality. Serum creatinine increased an average of 6% and BUN slightly more, but later declined to pretreatment levels.

### Elevated alkaline phosphatase in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease reflects bone rather than liver disease [^113wHjg3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD). The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of serum ALP in the diagnostic criteria for PNALD by measuring tissue-specific levels in infants with IF and PNALD.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient data for 15 infants diagnosed with PNALD between December 2012 and August 2013 was performed. PNALD was defined as the presence of 2 consecutive direct bilirubin (DB) levels > 2 mg/dL. Fractionated serum alkaline phosphatase was measured in each patient, while the DB was > 2 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were recorded where available.

Results

In 15 infants with PNALD, elevation in total ALP was due to marked elevations in bone-specific ALP. The median liver-specific ALP remained within the normal range. PTH, vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were within normal limits.

Conclusion

While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113zBMQ2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — presenting signs and skeletal features include that many patients are asymptomatic and the disease is discovered when a radiograph or bone scan is performed for another indication or when an elevated serum ALP level is found on a multiphasic screening chemistry panel; patients usually have a single bone or several bones affected, with the pelvis, vertebrae, skull, femur, and tibia most frequently involved; a hallmark is skeletal deformity with increased size and/or abnormal shape, increased warmth over an affected bone (usually the tibia) attributed to increased blood flow, and skeletal growth or expansion that becomes clinically obvious when the skull, jaw, clavicle, femur, or tibia are involved.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111CWfb9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical markers for monitoring (Appendix): Analytical and biological variation and the least significant change (LSC) guide interpretation of serial markers; automated platforms perform better than manual methods and serum markers show lower within-subject variability than urine. The best marker shows a substantial decrease with treatment when expressed as a ratio to the LSC, and BSAP, PINP, and NTx show the largest ratio of change/LSC ratio during antiresorptive treatment. Total ALP is a cost-effective test for routine monitoring, with any additional marker use depending on patient characteristics, local availability, and cost. During treatment of monostotic disease, sensitivity is best assessed by expressing the decrease in turnover as a ratio to the LSC; in this respect, BSAP shows a much better response than total ALP, P1NP may be useful for monitoring with a ratio of > 2, and current resorption markers are less useful, with only NTx having a ratio > 1 while hydroxyproline, serum CTx, and urinary CTx had ratios less than unity. Treatment-induced changes in biochemical measurements, often within the reference range, require understanding of measurement precision and reproducibility for proper evaluation.

### Pindolol [^1167z9qt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL LABORATORY

Minor persistent elevations in serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT) have been noted in 7% of patients during pindolol tablets administration, but progressive elevations were not observed. These elevations were not associated with any other abnormalities that would suggest hepatic impairment, such as decreased serum albumin and total proteins. During more than a decade of worldwide marketing, there have been no reports in the medical literature of overt hepatic injury. Alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and uric acid are also elevated on rare occasions. The significance of these findings is unknown.

### Transient benign hyperphophatasemia [^115XLydM]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Sometimes, a temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase level is found in healthy infants and toddlers without evidence of liver or bone disease. The condition is customarily termed transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood. Most textbooks do not refer to the condition. The aim of the study was to promote broader awareness of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia.

Methods

We completed a systematic review of the literature using the principles underlying the UK Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.

Results

The 142 reports retained for analysis included 813 cases (male:female ratio 1.1:1.0): 80 in subjects older than 18 years and 733 in subjects 18 years or younger. The alkaline phosphatase ratio, calculated by dividing the measured level by the upper limit of normal, was ≥ 5.0 in ≈70% and the duration of the elevation was ≤ 4 months in 80% of the cases. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia often followed a benign infection, but available data fail to demonstrate a causal link. The prevalence of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia ranged from 1.1% to 3.5% in infants 2 to 24 months of age.

Conclusions

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is likely the most common cause of hyperphosphatasemia among healthy infants and toddlers. Sometimes it also occurs in older children and adults, indicating that the traditional term transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood may not be correct. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase persists for > 4 months in ≈20% of the cases. Recognition of this benign condition is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations.

### Loss of intestinal alkaline phosphatase leads to distinct chronic changes in bone phenotype [^115uAaBo]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The gut is becoming increasingly recognized as the source of various systemic diseases, and recently, it has been linked to bone metabolism via the so-called gut-bone axis. The microbiome and gut-derived mediators are thought to impact upon bone metabolism, and administration of probiotics has been shown to have beneficial effects in bone. The gut brush border enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) plays an important role in controlling calcium absorption, inhibiting lipopolysaccharides, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for endotoxemia and appears to preserve the normal gut microbiota. Interestingly, IAP-deficient mice (AKP3 -/-) also display a significant decrease in fecal Lactobacillus, the genus shown to be beneficial to bone.

Materials and Methods

IAP mRNA levels in mouse bone were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Femurs of IAP-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were analyzed by microcomputed tomography and histopathology. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus were measured. Target cell response upon exposure to serum from IAP-KO and WT mice was quantified using primary bone marrow macrophages.

Results

IAP was not significantly expressed in bones of WT or KO animals. IAP (alkaline phosphatase 3) expression in bone was vanishingly low compared to the duodenum (bone versus duodenum, 56.9 ± 17.7 versus 25,430.3 ± 10,884.5 relative expression, P = 0.01). Bone histology of younger IAP-KO and WT animals was indistinguishable, whereas older IAP-deficient mice showed a distinctly altered phenotype on histology and computed tomography scan. Younger KO mice did not display any abnormal levels in blood chemistry. Older IAP-KO animals showed an isolated increase in serum alkaline phosphatase levels reflecting an environment of active bone formation (IAP-WT versus IAP-KO, 80 ± 27.4 U/I versus 453 ± 107.5 U/I, P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in serum calcium or phosphorus levels between KO and WT mice. Serum from IAP-KO mice induced a significantly higher inflammatory target cell response.

Conclusions

Through its multiple functions, IAP seems to play a crucial role in connecting the gut to the bone. IAP deficiency leads to chronic changes in bone formation, most likely through dysbiosis and systemic dissemination of proinflammatory mediators.

### Associations of serum skeletal alkaline phosphatase with elevated C-reactive protein and mortality [^113hk3hV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Higher serum total alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels are associated with increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and mortality in the general and CKD populations. It is unclear to what extent these associations are related to bone disease.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In a nationally representative sample of 10,707 adult participants from the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, serum nonskeletal AP levels were estimated from the measured serum skeletal and total AP levels. The associations of serum skeletal AP and nonskeletal AP levels with elevated serum CRP concentrations (> 3 mg/L) and mortality were examined in multivariable models.

Results

Skeletal AP was not associated with elevated CRP (for each doubling in non-CKD: odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.90–1.11; in CKD: OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.83–1.70) or mortality (for each doubling in non-CKD: hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.94–1.29; in CKD: HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.75–1.28). In contrast, nonskeletal AP was associated with elevated CRP (for each doubling in non-CKD: OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 3.80–5.35; in CKD: OR, 5.98; 95% CI, 3.40–10.51). Nonskeletal AP was associated with mortality in non-CKD (for each doubling: HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.37–2.80) but not in CKD (for each doubling: HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.51–1.67) (interaction P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Bone disease is unlikely to account for the known associations of serum total AP with increased inflammation and mortality.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1156xFwp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117Ffs7r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical targets and remission risk: The usual aim is to reduce turnover values into the lower half of the reference range, and after zoledronate achieving total ALP in the lower half of the normal range at 6 months was associated with a 6-year risk of losing therapeutic response of < 10%. Duration of biochemical remission correlates inversely with the minimum post-treatment value and also with the shortterm reduction in turnover.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1119XmYr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Monostotic Paget's disease — biochemical assessment: We suggest that PINP or BSAP and βCTX or NTX should be used for assessing the activity of untreated monostotic Paget's disease, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy. In limited disease, BSAP seems most sensitive and was increased in 60% of patients with limited disease activity/extent although total ALP was normal, and either βCTX or NTX with a bone formation marker should provide the best chance of providing biochemical evidence of responsiveness to treatment. If baseline biochemical tests are normal, a follow-up radionuclide scan may determine a significant response to treatment.

### Intestinal alkaline phosphatase prevents the systemic inflammatory response associated with necrotizing enterocolitis [^114FaNfT]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in neonates, with an incidence of 0.5–2.4 cases per 1000 live births and a mortality rate between 10% and 50%. Neonates affected by NEC develop a septic injury that is associated with increased risk of neurological impairment due to intraventricular bleeding and chronic lung disease. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) is an endogenous protein that has been shown to inactivate the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and has recently been used successfully as an adjunct to treat sepsis in adult patients. We tested the hypothesis that systemic, exogenous IAP will mitigate the inflammatory response as measured by serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines in a rat model of NEC.

Methods

Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups. Control pups were dam fed. NEC was induced by feeding formula containing LPS and exposure to intermittent hypoxia. NEC pups were given intraperitoneal injections of 4 or 40 glycine units (U) of IAP or placebo twice daily. Intestine and serum was collected for cytokine analysis as well as measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity.

Results

Systemic IAP administration significantly increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, and interleukin 1β were significantly increased in NEC rats versus controls on days 2 and 3. Importantly, treatment with 40 U systemic IAP decreased these proinflammatory cytokines back to near-control levels.

Conclusions

Systemic IAP administration appears effective in mitigating the systemic inflammatory response associated with NEC, and may prove to be a valuable adjunctive treatment for NEC.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^116htGEL]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric deficiency and insufficiency thresholds — For children, it has been recommended that a serum 25(OH)-D level of ≤ 37.5 nmol/L (15 ng/mL) be considered indicative of deficiency and > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), as indicative of vitamin D sufficiency; in adolescents, bone density at the forearm was low with 25(OH)-D < 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL), nutritional rickets occurs in black breastfed infants at 25(OH)-D 40 to 45 nmol/L (16–18 ng/mL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are noted to rise at < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL).

KDIGO CKD-MBD monitoring frequency by CKD stage: In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, it is reasonable to base the frequency of monitoring serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and rate of progression of CKD (not graded). Reasonable monitoring intervals would be: In CKD stage 3: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 6–12 months; and for PTH, based on baseline level and CKD progression; in CKD stage 4: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 3–6 months; and for PTH, every 6–12 months; in CKD stage 5, including 5D: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 1–3 months; and for PTH, every 3–6 months; and in CKD stages 4–5D: For alkaline phosphatase activity, every 12 months or more frequently in the presence of increased PTH levels. These recommendations are applicable to the United States.

### Transient rise in alkaline phosphatase activity in adults [^115LYxLm]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Benign transient hyperphosphatasia (BTH) is a condition that occurs mainly in infants and children and is characterised by a transient increase of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity up to several fold the adult upper reference limit (URL). The present report concerns BTH in 2 patients, aged 59 and 52 years old, who showed no evidence of bone or liver disease but had an increase in ALP activity up to 20-fold and 13-fold the adult URL, respectively. The diagnosis of BTH in the first case was made retrospectively, and after excluding liver and bone disease. However, in the second case the diagnosis was made early in the course of the disease, by performing an ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis test. Lengthy and extensive investigations were avoided in the second case. These cases highlight the occurrence of this condition in adulthood as well as in infancy and childhood.

### Intestinal alkaline phosphatase: a summary of its role in clinical disease [^117QGHpk]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, there is increasing evidence implicating a novel role for Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) in mitigating inflammatory mediated disorders. IAP is an endogenous protein expressed by the intestinal epithelium that is believed to play a vital role in maintaining gut homeostasis. Loss of IAP expression or function is associated with increased intestinal inflammation, dysbiosis, bacterial translocation and subsequently systemic inflammation. As these events are a cornerstone of the pathophysiology of many diseases relevant to surgeons, we sought to review recent research in both animal and humans on IAP's physiologic function, mechanisms of action and current research in specific surgical diseases.

### Alkaline phosphatase for treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^112jPSj6]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

To evaluate whether alkaline phosphatase (AP) treatment improves renal function in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with evidence of AKI was performed.

Methods

Thirty-six adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock according to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria and renal injury defined according to the AKI Network criteria were included. Dialysis intervention was standardized according to Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative consensus. Intravenous infusion of alkaline phosphatase (bolus injection of 67.5 U/kg body weight followed by continuous infusion of 132.5 U/kg/24 h for 48 hours, or placebo) starting within 48 hours of AKI onset and followed up to 28 days post-treatment. The primary outcome variable was progress in renal function variables (endogenous creatinine clearance, requirement and duration of renal replacement therapy, RRT) after 28 days. The secondary outcome variables included changes in circulating inflammatory mediators, urinary excretion of biomarkers of tubular injury, and safety.

Results

There was a significant (P = 0.02) difference in favor of AP treatment relative to controls for the primary outcome variable. Individual renal parameters showed that endogenous creatinine clearance (baseline to Day 28) was significantly higher in the treated group relative to placebo (from 50 ± 27 to 108 ± 73 mL/minute (mean ± SEM) for the AP group; and from 40 ± 37 to 65 ± 30 mL/minute for placebo; P = 0.01). Reductions in RRT requirement and duration did not reach significance. The results in renal parameters were supported by significantly more pronounced reductions in the systemic markers C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, LPS-binding protein and in the urinary excretion of Kidney Injury Molecule-1 and Interleukin-18 in AP-treated patients relative to placebo. The Drug Safety Monitoring Board did not raise any issues throughout the trial.

Conclusions

The improvements in renal function suggest alkaline phosphatase is a promising new treatment for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with AKI.

### Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are surrogate end points of outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: an international follow-up study [^116bhGPj]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Noninvasive surrogate end points of long-term outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are needed to monitor disease progression and evaluate potential treatments. We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies to evaluate whether patients' levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin correlate with their outcomes and can be used as surrogate end points.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of data from 4845 patients included in 15 North American and European long-term follow-up cohort studies. Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were analyzed in different settings and subpopulations at different time points relative to the clinical end point (liver transplantation or death).

Results

Of the 4845 patients, 1118 reached a clinical end point. The median follow-up period was 7.3 years; 77% survived for 10 years after study enrollment. Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin measured at study enrollment (baseline) and each year for 5 years were strongly associated with clinical outcomes (lower levels were associated with longer transplant-free survival). At 1 year after study enrollment, levels of alkaline phosphatase that were 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) best predicted patient outcome (C statistic, 0.71) but not significantly better than other thresholds. Of patients with alkaline phosphatase levels ≤ 2.0 times the ULN, 84% survived for 10 years compared with 62% of those with levels > 2.0 times the ULN (P < .0001). Absolute levels of alkaline phosphatase 1 year after study enrollment predicted patient outcomes better than percentage change in level. One year after study enrollment, a bilirubin level 1.0 times the ULN best predicted patient transplant-free survival (C statistic, 0.79). Of patients with bilirubin levels ≤ 1.0 times the ULN, 86% survived for 10 years after study enrollment compared with 41% of those with levels > 1.0 times the ULN (P < .0001). Combining levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin increased the ability to predict patient survival times. We confirmed the predictive value of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels in multiple subgroups, such as patients who had not received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, and at different time points after study enrollment.

Conclusions

Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin can predict outcomes (liver transplantation or death) of patients with PBC and might be used as surrogate end points in therapy trials.

### Association of serum alkaline phosphatase with coronary artery calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients [^115385Jp]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Recent in vitro studies have shown a link between alkaline phosphatase and vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with increased death risk in epidemiologic studies of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. We hypothesized that coronary artery calcification is independently associated with increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels in MHD patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We examined the association of coronary artery calcification score (CACS) and alkaline phosphatase in 137 randomly selected MHD patients for whom markers of malnutrition, inflammation, and bone and mineral disorders were also measured.

Results

Serum alkaline phosphatase was the only measure with significant and robust association with CACS (P < 0.003), whereas either other biochemical markers had no association with CACS or their association was eliminated after controlling for case-mix variables. Serum alkaline phosphatase > 120 IU/L was a robust predictor of higher CACS and was particularly associated with the likelihood of CACS > 400 (multivariate odds ratio 5.0 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 16.3; P = 0.007). Serum alkaline phosphatase of approximately 85 IU/L seemed to be associated with the lowest likelihood of severe coronary artery calcification, but in the lowest tertile of alkaline phosphatase, the CACS predictability was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

An association between serum alkaline phosphatase level and CACS exists in MHD patients. Given the high burden of vascular calcification in patients with CKD, examining potential therapeutic interventions to modulate the alkaline phosphatase pathway may be warranted.

### Alkaline phosphatase activity after cardiothoracic surgery in infants and correlation with post-operative support and inflammation: a prospective cohort study [^112F3TcM]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Limited evidence suggests that serum alkaline phosphatase activity may decrease after cardiac surgery in adults and children. The importance of this finding is not known. Recent studies, however, have identified a potential role for alkaline phosphatase as modulator of inflammation in multiple settings, including during adult cardiopulmonary bypass. We sought to describe the change in alkaline phosphatase activity after cardiothoracic surgery in infants and to assess for a correlation with intensity and duration of post-operative support, markers of inflammation, and short-term clinical outcomes.

Methods

Sub-analysis of a prospective observational study on the kinetics of procalcitonin in 70 infants (≤ 90 days old) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. Subjects were grouped based on the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and delayed sternal closure. Alkaline phosphatase, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were obtained pre-operation and on post-operative day 1. Mean change in alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in each surgical group. Generalized linear modeling and logistic regression were employed to assess for associations between post-operative alkaline phosphatase activity and post-operative support, inflammation, and short term outcomes. Primary endpoints were vasoactive-inotropic score at 24 hours and length of intubation. Secondary endpoints included procalcitonin/CRP levels on post-operative day 1, length of hospital stay, and cardiac arrest or death.

Results

Mean decrease in alkaline phosphatase was 30 U/L (p = 0.01) in the non-bypass group, 114 U/L (p < 0.0001) in the bypass group, and 94 U/L (p < 0.0001) in the delayed sternal closure group. On multivariate analysis, each 10 U/L decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity on post-operative day 1 was independently associated with an increase in vasoactive-inotropic score by 0.7 (p < 0.0001), intubation time by 6% (p < 0.05), hospital stay by 5% (p < 0.05), and procalcitonin by 14% (P < 0.01), with a trend towards increased odds of cardiac arrest or death (OR 1.3; p = 0.06). Post-operative alkaline phosphatase activity was not associated with CRP (p = 0.7).

Conclusions

Alkaline phosphatase activity decreases after cardiothoracic surgery in infants. Low post-operative alkaline phosphatase activity is independently associated with increased procalcitonin, increased vasoactive/inotropic support, prolonged intubation time, and prolonged hospital stay. Alkaline phosphatase may serve as a biomarker and potential modulator of post-operative support and inflammation following cardiothoracic surgery in infants.

### Ursodiol [^117LP9SV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Abnormal Liver Function Tests: Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin level should be monitored. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels. Caution should be exercised to maintain patients' bile flow. (5.1)
Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis: Monitor for obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms; if symptoms occur, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted. (5.2)

5.1 Abnormal Liver Function Tests

Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin levels should be monitored every month for three months after start of therapy, and every six months thereafter. This monitoring will allow the early detection of a possible deterioration of the hepatic function. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if the above parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels.

Caution has to be exercised to maintain the bile flow of the patients taking ursodiol.

5.2 Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis

There have been rare postmarketing reports of ursodiol-treated patients who developed enteroliths (bezoars) resulting in obstructive symptoms that required surgical intervention. These patients had medical conditions that predisposed them to intestinal stenosis or stasis (e.g., surgical enteroanastomoses, Crohn's disease). If a patient presents with obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted.

### Efavirenz is associated with severe vitamin D deficiency and increased alkaline phosphatase [^115BnnuP]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective(S)

To identify factors (including exposure to specific antiretroviral drugs) associated with severe vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in HIV-infected individuals and to explore the effects of severe VDD and antiretroviral drug exposure on serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as surrogate marker of bone turnover.

Design

Cross-sectional survey of vitamin D status among HIV-infected patients attending for routine clinical care at a large London HIV clinic.

Methods

Severe VDD was defined as 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 microg/l (< 25 nmol/l). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with severe VDD and upper quartile ALP levels.

Results

Vitamin D levels were measured in 1077 patients and found to be suboptimal in 91%. One-third of patients had severe VDD. Black ethnicity, sampling in winter, nadir CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/microl, and exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy were associated with severe VDD. In analyses restricted to patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, current efavirenz use was significantly associated with severe VDD [adjusted odds ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.5–2.7)]. Current tenofovir [adjusted odds ratio 3.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3–5.2)] and efavirenz use [adjusted odds ratio 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.02–2.4)], but not severe VDD [odds ratio 1.1 (0.8–1.5)], were associated with increased bone turnover (upper quartile ALP).

Conclusion

Efavirenz was associated with severe VDD, a condition associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, and efavirenz and tenofovir with increased ALP. The clinical significance of these findings requires further investigation, given the widespread use of efavirenz and tenofovir in first-line combination antiretroviral therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Elevated liver enzymes and cardiovascular mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of more than one million participants [^113YrATK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are commonly used liver function markers. We performed a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the association between liver enzymes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in prospective cohort studies. We conducted a systematic search up to April 2018 in Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model as described by DerSimonian and Laird. Dose-response analysis was also carried out. Twenty-three studies with 1067922 participants reported association between GGT and CVD mortality and were included in our analysis. Pooled results showed a significant association between GGT and risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.47–1.78, P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.001) and it was HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.73–1.07; P = 0.221, P-heterogeneity = 0.028, for ALT. There was a direct association between baseline levels of ALP and AST/ALT ratio with CVD mortality (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.11–1.89; P = 0.005, P-heterogeneity = 0.026, and HR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.60–3.04; P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.540, respectively). Pooled results did not show any significant association between AST and the risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.83–1.73; P = 0.313, P-heterogeneity = 0.024). Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear association between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality (P = 0.008 and 0.016, respectively). Our dose-response meta-analysis revealed a direct relationship between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality. High levels of GGT, ALP and AST/ALT were associated with an increased CVD mortality rate.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^112QxpcA]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — monitoring therapy includes scheduled labs and imaging. It is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 1 month after initiating therapy, and with stoss therapy a biochemical response occurs in 1 or 2 weeks with an early increase in phosphate; ALP may actually increase in the short term, there is usually an initial increase in 1,25(OH)₂-D, then ALP and 1,25(OH)₂-D decrease to normal while 25(OH)-D increases to within the reference range. Complete radiologic healing may take months, but changes are evident in 1 week. In 3 months, it is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)-D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one may consider obtaining a urine sample to determine the calcium/creatinine ratio. A radiograph should be repeated at 3 months, and subsequently 25(OH)-D levels should be monitored yearly.

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^116jVVbP]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115xhVeX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — bone turnover markers for assessing treatment response: If there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short- term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely. (2|⊕⊕◯◯) Resorption markers such as βCTX fall rapidly with potent bisphosphonates, reaching a nadir value at 10 days, whereas formation markers such as total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are slower, reaching a nadir at about 2 to 3 months, and the short-term (10-d) reduction in markers such as urinary NTX correlates with the final post-treatment ALP. For most patients, measurement of total ALP or other baseline disease activity markers at 6 to12 weeks is an acceptable and cost-effective option, and maximal suppression of high bone turnover may require measurement at 6 months.

### How to use… alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^116BVg9u]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — efficacy and dosing: UDCA is the most studied drug in PSC and is a hydrophilic 3,7-dihydroxy bile acid; evidence for efficacy is inconsistent, with low-dose UDCA (13–15 mg/kg/day) showing improvement in ALP by 12 months, intermediate-dose UDCA (17–23 mg/kg/day) being inconclusive, and in the largest study UDCA 17–23 mg/kg not achieving statistical significance for reducing need for LT, CCA, or mortality, with only 63% of predicted patients enrolled; a multicenter trial of 150 patients with high-dose UDCA (28–30 mg/kg/day) was terminated early due to futility and was associated post hoc with increased serious adverse events and, in PSC with ulcerative colitis, increased colorectal neoplasia; therefore, high-dose UDCA is not recommended and should not be prescribed; prior 2010 AASLD guidelines recommended against UDCA as medical therapy, but recent adult data link better outcomes to ALP reduction thresholds (< 1.5 × ULN, 40% reduction or normalization, or normalization), while in children a 75% reduction in GGT or a GGT < 50 IU was associated with the best outcomes; UDCA withdrawal has been associated with increases in fatigue, pruritus, liver biochemistries, and Mayo PSC Risk Score.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^112vJ7eE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — calcium measurement approach and alkaline phosphatase use: The work group did not recommend that corrected calcium measurement be abandoned at present, although recent data did not show superiority over total calcium alone, and it considered measurement of ionized calcium to be more specific, but presently not practical or cost-effective. The KDOQI Work Group recommends using total alkaline phosphatase activity as an adjunct test, which may provide supplemental information in the assessment of bone turnover, particularly in the setting of increased PTH levels and in the assessment of response to therapy for increased PTH levels if liver disease is not likely to be the cause of increased total alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase derives more specifically from bone and can be used when the clinical situation is more ambiguous; however, the test is not readily available. High total alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality, but it is not known whether therapies aimed at decreasing these levels improve patient outcomes. The KDOQI bone guideline also discussed that concomitant consideration of alkaline phosphatase levels can increase the predictive power of PTH levels; data were insufficient to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase levels for renal osteodystrophy alone or together with PTH levels, and the value of alkaline phosphatase for clinical decision making remains to be proved.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase levels associate with elevated serum C-reactive protein in chronic kidney disease [^116APoDE]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

High serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are associated with elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the general population. To examine whether this association is independent of serum vitamin D levels or modified in chronic kidney disease (CKD), we determined if such associations exist using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III of 14,420 adult participants in which 5.7% had CKD (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²). For each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase, the odds of elevated serum CRP (over 3 mg/l) were increased 2.73-fold in the non-chronic and 2.50-fold in the CKD sub-populations, respectively. Regression coefficients of each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase with elevated CRP were not significantly different in between the sub-populations. Additional adjustment for the serum 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D level did not substantively change the results. Thus, associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with elevated CRP are independent of serum 25-OH vitamin D in the chronic and non-CKD populations. Hence, serum alkaline phosphatase might be a marker of the inflammatory milieu.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^111g4yEa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### Can the laboratory affect the investigation and diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis? [^116AoFSG]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterised by the presence of various laboratory abnormalities but the precise role of laboratory staff in initiating clinical referral and subsequent biopsy is not clear.

Objective

To examine the impact of laboratory abnormalities in the investigation of PBC.

Methods

In a retrospective study of laboratory results over nine years from 1996, computer records were reviewed to identify how many referrals for biopsy were initiated and subsequent diagnoses made as a result of clinical signs, raised serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), raised IgM concentration, or positive mitochondrial antibodies accompanied by a clinical comment from the laboratory suggesting further action.

Results

22 diagnoses of PBC were confirmed by histopathology. Eleven had high ALP activity which had follow up tests initiated by the laboratory (mitochondrial antibodies or IgM or both) and a comment added suggesting further investigation into the possibility of PBC. Seven had abnormal liver antibodies and one had a high polyclonal IgM concentration which prompted the relevant follow on testing and comments. One had an earlier diagnosis made on serological/clinical grounds and the biopsy was a confirmatory measure. One had no liver related antibodies. One had a request by laboratory staff for follow on tests but these were not asked for in subsequent samples by the requesting clinician.

Conclusions

There is a positive role for laboratory staff in the diagnosis of PBC. Unexplained rises in ALP activity, positive mitochondrial antibodies, or raised IgM concentrations should be investigated more fully by laboratory staff and advice given to prompt a clinical referral for review and biopsy.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^111p1iTG]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests that bone-related parameters are the main prognostic factors for overall survival in advanced prostate cancer (PCa), with elevated circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) thought to reflect the dysregulated bone formation accompanying distant metastases. We have identified that PCa cells express ALPL, the gene that encodes for tissue nonspecific ALP, and hypothesised that tumour-derived ALPL may contribute to disease progression.

Methods

Functional effects of ALPL inhibition were investigated in metastatic PCa cell lines. ALPL gene expression was analysed from published PCa data sets, and correlated with disease-free survival and metastasis.

Results

ALPL expression was increased in PCa cells from metastatic sites. A reduction in tumour-derived ALPL expression or ALP activity increased cell death, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and reduced migration. Alkaline phosphatase activity was decreased by the EMT repressor Snail. In men with PCa, tumour-derived ALPL correlated with EMT markers, and high ALPL expression was associated with a significant reduction in disease-free survival.

Conclusions

Our studies reveal the function of tumour-derived ALPL in regulating cell death and epithelial plasticity, and demonstrate a strong association between ALPL expression in PCa cells and metastasis or disease-free survival, thus identifying tumour-derived ALPL as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of PCa progression.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for palliative nuclear medicine therapies of bone metastases [^112Bm4jK]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). High credibility.

Radionuclide therapy for bone metastases — biomarker and imaging follow-up notes that monitoring of common biomarkers (e.g., prostate-specific antigen [PSA], lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase) after several cycles (e.g., before the fourth therapy cycle) is preferable; however, fluctuations of biomarkers are not uncommon during therapy and increasing biomarkers do not necessarily represent a lack of therapy response. There is growing evidence that alkaline phosphatase can better predict response compared with PSA, and a comparison with findings from imaging is advisable in order to objectify increasing biomarkers. Continued monitoring of common biomarkers after therapy should depend on the duration of the disease, tumor biology, and previous course, with common intervals 3 to 6 months at the beginning and yearly thereafter. Timing of follow-up imaging should depend on symptoms, duration of illness, and tumor biology; imaging should be performed 3–6 months after the last treatment, or earlier as symptoms dictate, and patients should be advised that anatomic improvement on imaging takes time and that reactive osseous remodeling may lead to new sclerosis on CT.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Alkaline phosphatase normalization is associated with better prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111U7ekM]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis results in elevated but fluctuating serum alkaline phosphatase levels that occasionally return to normal.

Aims

To investigate the frequency of normalization of alkaline phosphatase in newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and the subsequent clinical outcomes.

Methods

Records of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were examined retrospectively for laboratory values and clinical end points (cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation and death) within 10 years of diagnosis. Data from a recent prospective ursodeoxycholic acid treatment trial were also studied.

Results

Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Normalization of alkaline phosphatase was seen in 35 (40%) patients. Five (14%) patients with normalization reached an end point whereas 17 (33%) of the patients with persistent elevation reached an end point (P = 0.02). Ursodeoxycholic acid was used similarly by both groups. When the investigative criteria were applied to a prospective trial, there was again a significant relationship between normalization of alkaline phosphatase and survival in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.01) and the placebo group (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Serum alkaline phosphatase was found to normalize in a high proportion of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. This was significantly associated with a better prognosis in a retrospective cohort and when data from a prospective treatment trial was evaluated.

### Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia in the pediatric population: a single center cohort study [^113kShy2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be increased in a benign condition known as benign-transient hyperphosphatasemia (BTH). We aimed to evaluate the demographic, and clinical characteristics of infants and children with BTH.

Methods

In our retrospective study, infants and children diagnosed with BTH between September 2019 and September 2023 were included.

Results

Of 249 children with elevated ALP levels, 95 (38.1%) had BTH. The mean age at diagnosis of children with BTH was 2.4 ± 1.3 years (min 0.6 - max 6.2 years). ALP mean value was 2,587 ± 1252 U/L (min 972 - max 5757 U/L). ALP value was an average 7.4 ± 3.6 times higher than the corresponding upper limit of normal. The second measurement was made after an average of 13.2 ± 6 days, and a statistically significant difference was detected compared to the first value, with a decrease of 61 ± 23% in the ALP value (p < 0.001). ALP value returned to normal in an average of 44 ± 29.2 days. Elevated ALP was detected during infection in 49 (51.6%) children. When the sample was divided into those under 2 years of age and aged 2 and over, no statistical difference was observed in ALP levels in the time it took for ALP levels to return to the normal range (p = 0.480).

Conclusions

BTH should be kept in mind if high serum ALP is detected in children without clinical or laboratory suspicion of bone or liver disease. In the follow up detecting a significant decrease trend compared to the first value may be guiding for BTH.

### Associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with metabolic syndrome and mortality [^115SYA5t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data suggest that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels are associated with increased mortality, but the mechanisms for this association are unknown. As metabolic syndrome is associated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels, we examined the joint association of mortality with metabolic syndrome and serum alkaline phosphatase levels in the US general population.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of 15,234 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to jointly relate mortality risk to serum alkaline phosphatase and indicators of metabolic syndrome.

Results

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 14% to 41% among patients in lowest and higher quartiles, respectively, for baseline serum alkaline phosphatase. The mortality hazard ratio for each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.72) adjusting only for demographic factors, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.21–1.56) adjusting for both demographic and metabolic syndrome factors in the full cohort, and was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36–2.46) adjusting for demographic factors in the subgroup without any of the component conditions of metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

In the US general population, higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is a predictor of mortality independent of the baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are warranted to unravel the mechanisms of this association.

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^1134VH4e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117L8mhk]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Putative predictors of treatment response in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) include that serum aminotransferase levels should improve within 2 weeks, elderly patients (≥ 60 years old) respond more quickly to treatment and are characterized by HLA DRB1✱04:01, and biochemical remission achieved within 6 months is associated with a significantly lower frequency of progression to cirrhosis or need for liver transplantation (LT). Laboratory cholestasis markers (increased serum alkaline phosphatase or GGT) have been associated with incomplete or delayed response and may indicate an alternative diagnosis, and in type 1 AIH persistent production of SMA or anactin during biochemical remission has been associated with histological features of active liver inflammation. Elevated ferritin levels (> 2.1-fold ULN) at diagnosis have been associated with subsequent biochemical remission, with predictive value increased when both elevated serum ferritin and low IgG levels (< 1.9-fold ULN) are present at baseline, while vitamin D deficiency at presentation has been associated with histological severity, poor treatment response, progression to cirrhosis, increased mortality or need for LT, and increased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels have correlated with fibrosis scores.

### Calcium and phosphate balance with quotidian hemodialysis [^114w7wn7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional hemodialysis (HD) is associated with profound disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism and abnormal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Effects of more frequent HD on calcium and phosphate balance have not been fully elucidated.

Methods

The London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study examined effects of quotidian HD, either daily HD (n = 11) or nocturnal HD (n = 12), on calcium and phosphate metabolism, bone alkaline phosphatase levels, and intact PTH (iPTH) levels.

Results

Daily HD patients showed a slight decrease in predialysis serum phosphate levels, no changes in phosphate-binder requirements or serum calcium levels, and slight increases in serum bone alkaline phosphatase and iPTH levels. Nocturnal HD patients showed a trend for decreased predialysis phosphate levels, with significantly lower values than daily HD and matched control patients on conventional HD therapy at several times. Phosphate-binder use by nocturnal HD patients was significantly reduced. Both quotidian HD groups showed decreases in calcium x phosphate product, with significantly lower values for nocturnal HD patients (38.11 mg²/dL²) compared with daily HD and control patients (53.99 and 52.51 mg²/dL², respectively) at 18 months. Bone alkaline phosphatase levels increased slightly and attained statistical significance compared with baseline values for both quotidian HD groups. A trend for increases in serum iPTH levels, coupled with increasing levels of bone alkaline phosphatase in nocturnal HD patients, led to the decision to increase the dialysate calcium concentration from 5.0 to 7.0 mg/dL. This 1-time adjustment resulted in a reversal of the trend and a return to baseline values.

Conclusion

This study shows the superior control of serum phosphate levels in nocturnal HD patients compared with daily HD or conventional HD patients and the benefits of dialysate with a greater calcium concentration in slow nocturnal HD.

### Towards a standardized classification of the hepatobiliary manifestations in cystic fibrosis (CFHBI): a joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN position paper [^115PhMmP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in pwCF — associations with disease and predictive performance: In children diagnosed via newborn screening, a persistent elevation of AST or GGT > 1.5 x ULN before the age of 5 was linked to a 6-fold increase in risk of clinically significant liver disease, defined as cirrhosis, portal hypertension (PHT), or stage F3/4 fibrosis. In 244 children with CF, higher mean ALT/AST levels were reported in those with liver ultrasound abnormalities, although levels were mostly within the normal range with significant overlap. Elevated ALT, GGT, or ALP on 2 or more occasions before age 6.5 was linked to higher risk of PHT; elevated ALT had a hazard ratio of 2.7 but only a sensitivity of ~20% and PPV of ~20%. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that changes in ALT and/or AST levels over time can reliably predict development of structural hepatic abnormalities in pwCF.

### Alkaline phosphatase and mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis [^116MroZQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality in the general population, CKD patients, and hemodialysis patients. However, in peritoneal dialysis patients, this association has received little attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between alkaline phosphatase and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In this single center retrospective cohort study, 1021 incident peritoneal dialysis patients from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2010 with baseline serum alkaline phosphatase values were enrolled. Collected baseline data included demographic characteristics and clinical and laboratory measurements. All patients were followed until December 31, 2012. The associations of total serum alkaline phosphatase levels with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed using multivariable-adjusted Cox models.

Results

Of 1021 patients, mean age was 47.5 (± 15.5) years, 59.1% of patients were men, and 22.8% of patients were diabetic. The median serum alkaline phosphatase level was 64 U/L (interquartile range = 52–82 U/L). During a median 31-month (interquartile range = 19–45 months) follow-up period, 203 patients died, of which 109 deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease. After adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, liver function, and bone metabolism parameters, the highest alkaline phosphatase quartile was significantly associated with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.74, P = 0.03) and a hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality of 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.72, P = 0.04). Each 10 U/L higher baseline alkaline phosphatase level was associated with 4% (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.08, P = 0.04) and 7% (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.11, P = 0.003) higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.

Conclusion

Higher total serum alkaline phosphatase levels at the commencement of peritoneal dialysis were independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.

### High alkaline phosphatase levels in hemodialysis patients are associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death [^113rr9sD]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated risks associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase in hemodialysis patients using longitudinal data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries. Alkaline phosphatase levels were normalized by the upper limit of the laboratory-reported reference range. Cause-specific hospitalization and mortality risks were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by region and adjusted for phosphorus, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, case mix, and numerous comorbidities. The odds of high normalized alkaline phosphatase were increased twofold in the United States in comparison to Japan. Elevations of normalized alkaline phosphatase were significantly associated with several comorbid conditions, increased fractures, parathyroidectomy, risk of hospitalization due to major adverse cardiac events, higher all-cause cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality risk. Our results also show that elevated serum normalized alkaline phosphatase was associated with higher risks of hospitalization and death in hemodialysis patients, independent of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in African Americans with chronic kidney disease [^115j26ZJ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Serum alkaline phosphatase has been associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients but its associations with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages III and IV are unknown. Design, settings, participants & measurements: In 1094 participants in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) database, the associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with mortality and cardiovascular events were examined in Cox models.

Results

The mean (± SD) age was 54 ± 11 yr, and 61% were men. The median alkaline phosphatase was 80 IU/L, and interquartile range was 66 to 97 IU/L. The mean follow-up was 4.6 yr. There were 105 (9.6%) all-cause deaths and 149 (13.6%) cardiovascular events. Each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly associated with increased hazard [hazard ratio (HR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–2.36] of all-cause mortality adjusted for demographics, drug and blood pressure groups, and comorbidity. With further adjustment for liver function tests as well as serum calcium and phosphorus, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase remained significantly associated with increased mortality (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.33). Serum alkaline phosphatase was not significantly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Independent of liver function tests and serum calcium and phosphorus, higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase are associated with increased mortality in the CKD population. Further studies are warranted to identify the potential mechanisms for this association.

CKD-MBD bone assessment and imaging in CKD stages 3–5D: KDIGO 2009 suggests that in patients with CKD stages 3–5D, measurements of serum PTH or bone-specific ALP can be used to evaluate bone disease because markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover, and states it is reasonable to perform bone biopsy in various settings and before therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with CKD-MBD. KDOQI 2003 noted bone-specific ALP not specifically recommended and that unexplained increases in bone ALP activity together with increases in PTH is indication for considering bone biopsy in CKD stage 5D; it also stated that bone biopsy should be considered in CKD stage 5D in various settings. For densitometry, KDIGO 2009 states that in CKD stages 3–5D with biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, suggest that BMD testing not be routinely performed, whereas KDOQI 2003 stated DXA should be used in patients with fractures and those with known risks for osteoporosis. KDIGO also made no recommendation given for routine screening for vascular calcification.

Paget's disease of bone — diagnostic imaging and biochemical monitoring recommendations state that We recommend that plain radiographs be obtained of the pertinent regions of the skeleton in patients with suspected Paget's disease. If the diagnosis is confirmed, we suggest that a radionuclide bone scan be done to determine the extent of the disease. After diagnosis, we recommend measurement of serum total alkaline phosphatase or, when warranted, a more specific marker of bone formation or bone resorption to assess response or disease evolution; in monostotic disease with a normal serum total alkaline phosphatase, we suggest that a specific marker of bone formation and bone resorption be measured, and serial radionuclide bone scans may determine the response to treatment if the markers are normal.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### Upregulation of alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphate hydrolysis: potential mechanism for uremic vascular calcification [^1166W2AP]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Pyrophosphate is a potent inhibitor of medial vascular calcification where its level is controlled by hydrolysis via a tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). We sought to determine if increased TNAP activity could explain the pyrophosphate deficiency and vascular calcification seen in renal failure. TNAP activity increased twofold in intact aortas and in aortic homogenates from rats made uremic by feeding adenine or by 5/6 nephrectomy. Immunoblotting showed an increase in protein abundance but there was no increase in TNAP mRNA assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by rat aortic rings was inhibited about half by the nonspecific alkaline phosphatase inhibitor levamisole and was reduced about half in aortas from mice lacking TNAP. Hydrolysis was increased in aortic rings from uremic rats and all of this increase was inhibited by levamisole. An increase in TNAP activity and pyrophosphate hydrolysis also occurred when aortic rings from normal rats were incubated with uremic rat plasma. These results suggest that a circulating factor causes pyrophosphate deficiency by regulating TNAP activity and that vascular calcification in renal failure may result from the action of this factor. If proven by future studies, this mechanism will identify alkaline phosphatase as a potential therapeutic target.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^1126UAag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

We report a potential association between an abnormally raised pregnancy level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There are few reports of women with abnormally high ALP during pregnancy. However, there is work to suggest an association with placental insufficiency, low birth weight and preterm delivery. In conjunction with a rising ALP, fetal IUGR and intermittent absence of umbilical artery end diastolic flow had evolved. A greatly elevated ALP may be a marker for placental insufficiency and IUGR.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Abnorma l Liver F unction T ests: Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin level should be monitored. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels. Caution should be exercised to maintain patients' bile flow. (5.1)
Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis:

Monitor for obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms; if symptoms occur, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted. (5.2)

5.1 Abnormal Liver Function Tests

Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin levels should be monitored every month for three months after start of therapy, and every six months thereafter. This monitoring will allow the early detection of a possible deterioration of the hepatic function. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if the above parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels.

Caution has to be exercised to maintain the bile flow of the patients taking ursodiol.

5.2 Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis

There have been rare postmarketing reports of URSO-treated patients who developed enteroliths (bezoars) resulting in obstructive symptoms that required surgical intervention. These patients had medical conditions that predisposed them to intestinal stenosis or stasis (e.g., surgical enteroanastomoses, Crohn's disease). If a patient presents with obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms, hold URSO until a clinical evaluation has been conducted.

### Increased serum alkaline phosphatase as a predictor of long-term mortality after stroke [^114DrTu6]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although the critical role of alkaline phosphatase in bone mineralization is clearly understood, the potentially adverse effect of high alkaline phosphatase levels on the cardiovascular system was only recently suggested. In this study, we hypothesized that increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase may be associated with poor outcome after stroke in terms of mortality.

Methods

We prospectively included patients with acute stroke admitted consecutively to our hospital, from October 2002 to September 2008. A total of 2,029 patients were selected for the analyses. In the analyses of mortality, the patients were divided by baseline measurements into quintiles of alkaline phosphatase levels (< 57, 57–69, 70–81, 82–97, > 97 IU/L).

Results

In the Cox proportional hazard models, compared with the first alkaline phosphatase quintile, adjusted hazard ratios of the third, fourth, and fifth quintiles for all-cause death were 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.12–2.49), 1.79 (1.20–2.67), and 2.83 (1.95–4.10). When we divided the patients into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, the association was also significant for both subtypes of stroke. In terms of vascular death, compared to the first alkaline phosphatase quintile, the adjusted hazard ratios of the fourth and fifth quintiles of alkaline phosphatase were 1.81 (95% confidence interval 1.14–2.86) and 2.78 (1.87–4.15).

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are an independent predictor of all-cause and vascular death after either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

NCCN Invasive Breast Cancer — findings concerning for progression of metastatic disease — findings concerning for progression of disease include worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea, evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination, declining performance status, unexplained weight loss, increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin, hypercalcemia, new radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality, new areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT), and increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15–3, CA 27.29). Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15–3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease, and an isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease; changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional radiology or on bone scan, and for these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.

### Screening for hypophosphatasia: does biochemistry lead the way? [^1151RjiR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with childhood hypophosphatasia (HPP) often have unspecific symptoms. It was our aim to identify patients with mild forms of HPP by laboratory data screening for decreased alkaline phosphatase (AP) within a pediatric population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective hospital-based data screening for AP activity below the following limits: Girls: ≤ 12 years: < 125 U/L; > 12 years: < 50 U/L Boys: ≤ 14 years: < 125 U/L; > 14 years: < 70 U/L. Screening positive patients with otherwise unexplained hypophosphatasemia were invited for further diagnostics: Re-test of AP activity, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in hemolyzed whole blood, phosphoethanolamine (PEA) in serum and urine, and inorganic pyrophosphate in urine. Sequencing of the ALPL gene was performed in patients with clinical and/or laboratory abnormalities suspicious for HPP.

Results

We assessed a total of 14,913 samples of 6,731 patients and identified 393 screening-positive patients. The majority of patients were excluded due to known underlying diseases causing AP depression. Of the 30 patients who participated in the study, three had a decrease in AP activity in combination with an increase in PLP and PEA. A heterozygous ALPL mutation was detected in each of them: One patient with a short stature was diagnosed with childhood-HPP and started with enzyme replacement therapy. The remaining two are considered as mutation carriers without osseous manifestation of the disease.

Conclusions

A diagnostic algorithm based on decreased AP is able to identify patients with ALPL mutation after exclusion of the differential diagnoses of hypophosphatasemia and with additional evidence of increased AP substrates.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Liver alkaline phosphatase: a missing link between choleresis and biliary inflammation [^116z8vAc]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence show that serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) is not only a signpost of cholestasis but also a surrogate marker of the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the present opinion article, we review and discuss the putative role of liver AP in health and in cholestatic diseases. In inflammatory cholestatic conditions, loss of activity of liver AP (resulting from its relocation from canaliculi and the acidic milieu) might promote hyper-adenosine triphosphate-bilia, lipopolysaccharide overload, and subsequent exacerbation and perpetuation of inflammation. Drugs that can restore the polarity of hepatocytes and canalicular export of bile acids or act as bile alkalinity modifiers are predicted to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to benefit both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Oral administration of intestinal AP could be a valid therapeutic intervention that deserves further study under experimental conditions as well as in human diseases. Overall, the key role of the liver microenvironment that might shape the different facets of the inflammatory processes in fibrosing cholangiopathies is highlighted.

Variability appears similar for bone resorption markers for men and women, and in women with osteopenia the least significant change is between 14% (for b-ALP) and 37% (for urinary NTX) in the short term. In all of the studies above, in more than half of men receiving standard treatments for 1–2 yr, BTM changes would appear to exceed the least significant change, with responses identifiable as early as within 3 months of starting treatment.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Inter-and intra-individual variation, and limited prognostic utility, of serum alkaline phosphatase in a trial of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113zTGZL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score are used as endpoints in trials of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We aimed to quantify inter- and intra-individual variation in levels of ALP and the ELF score over time, and evaluated their association with fibrosis progression.

Methods

We analyzed data from 234 patients with large-duct PSC enrolled in a 2-year, phase 2b placebo-controlled trial of simtuzumab. Participants were assessed by laboratory tests every 4 weeks, and liver biopsies collected at time of screening, week 48, and week 96.

Results

Serum levels of ALP and ELF scores did not differ significantly between simtuzumab and placebo groups, so the data were pooled. Median per-patient variations in ALP between clinic visits were approximately 12% over 12 weeks, 20% over 48 weeks, and 20% over 96 weeks. Reductions, unrelated to study intervention, of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 10.9% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 12.5% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN at 1 year. At 2 years, reductions of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 15.8% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the ULN and 17.9% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN. Among the 209 patients with Ishak fibrosis stage 0–4 at baseline, serum ALP activity did not associate with development of cirrhosis or with a 2-point increase in fibrosis stage at 2 years. In contrast, the median per-patient variation in ELF scores between clinic visits was approximately 3% over 12 weeks, 4% over 48 weeks, and 4% over 96 weeks. Elevated ELF scores at baseline and at weeks 12, 24 and 48, each associated with development of cirrhosis at 2 years (odds ratio > 2.75; P < .01 for all timepoints). ELF scores at baseline and weeks 12, 24 and 48, also associated with a 2-point increase in fibrosis stage at 2 years (odds ratios all greater than 2; P < .01 for all timepoints).

Conclusions

In an analysis of data from patients with large-duct PSC enrolled in a prospective trial, we found large interindividual and intraindividual variations in serum ALP activity. Serum ALP activity did not associate with disease progression over a 2-year period. Variations in ELF score were smaller, and scores determined at multiple timepoints associated with fibrosis progression and development of cirrhosis.

### Bone alkaline phosphatase in CKD-mineral bone disorder [^116eQ54t]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is greatly increased, without obvious current effective treatments. Mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a common manifestation of CKD and contributes to the high risk of fracture and cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Traditionally, clinical management of CKD-MBD focused on attenuation of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to impaired renal activation of vitamin D and phosphate retention, although recently, adynamic forms of renal bone disease have become more prevalent. Definitive diagnosis was based on histologic (histomorphometric) analysis of bone biopsy material supported by radiologic changes and changes in levels of surrogate laboratory markers. Of these various markers, parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been considered to be the most sensitive and currently is the most frequently used; however, the many pitfalls of measuring PTH in patients with CKD increasingly are appreciated. We propose an alternative or complementary approach using bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is directly related to bone turnover, reflects bone histomorphometry, and predicts outcomes in hemodialysis patients. Here, we consider the overall merits of bone ALP as a marker of bone turnover in adults with CKD-MBD, examine published bone histomorphometric data comparing bone ALP to PTH, and discuss possible pathogenic mechanisms by which bone ALP may be linked to outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase negatively affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in naïve hypertensive patients [^113y3nUT]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, promoting arterial calcification in experimental models, is a powerful predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality in general population and in patients with renal or cardiovascular diseases. For this study, to evaluate a possible correlation between serum alkaline phosphatase levels and endothelial function, assessed by strain gauge plethysmography, we enrolled 500 naïve hypertensives divided into increasing tertiles of alkaline phosphatase. The maximal response to acetylcholine was inversely related to alkaline phosphatase (r = −0.55; P < 0.001), and this association was independent (r = −0.61; P < 0.001) of demographic and classical risk factors, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum phosphorus and calcium, C-reactive protein, and albuminuria. At multiple logistic regression analysis, the risk of endothelial dysfunction was ≈3-fold higher in patients in the third tertile than that of patients in the first tertile. We also tested the combined role of alkaline phosphatase and serum phosphorus on endothelial function. The steepness of the alkaline phosphatase/vasodilating response to acetylcholine relationship was substantially attenuated (P < 0.001) in patients with serum phosphorus above the median value when compared with patients with serum phosphorus below the median (−5.0% versus −10.2% per alkaline phosphatase unit, respectively), and this interaction remained highly significant (P < 0.001) after adjustment of all the previously mentioned risk factors. Our data support a strong and significant inverse relationship between alkaline phosphatase and endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which was attenuated by relatively higher serum phosphorus levels.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115S355f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease — biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget's disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

### Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations are less variable than those of parathyroid hormone in stable hemodialysis patients [^114v4JkQ]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of bone mineral metabolism and vascular calcification are prevalent in patients with kidney failure. Clinical management is based on biochemical targets, in particular parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, but this has many limitations including high biological variation. A possible alternative is bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP); therefore, we evaluated the biological variation of this marker in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Bone ALP was measured in non-fasting serum samples taken twice a week over a 6-week period in 22 stable hemodialysis patients and 12 healthy volunteers. The within-individual coefficients of variance were calculated and used to derive the critical difference required to be certain that an observed change was significant. The coefficient of variance for bone ALP was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients compared to healthy individuals. Seven samples were required to estimate the homeostatic set point of bone ALP, within 10%, in a hemodialysis patient. The concentration of serial bone ALP measurements would need to change by 36% between any two measurements before it can be considered a significant change. Since the biological variation of bone ALP is less than half that reported for PTH, our study provides further support for the use of bone ALP as an alternative marker of bone mineral metabolism in the setting of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### Alkaline phosphatase treatment of acute kidney injury-an update [^1124qUbM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Through improved insights into the increasing incidence and detrimental effects of acute kidney injury (AKI), its clinical relevance has become more and more apparent. Although treatment strategies for AKI have also somewhat improved, an adequate remedy still does not exist. Finding one is complicated by a multifactorial pathophysiology and by heterogeneity in the patient population. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been suggested as a therapy for sepsis-associated AKI because of its protective effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and kidney injury in animals. However, its effectiveness as an AKI treatment has not been demonstrated definitively. Because the anti-inflammatory properties of ALP are likely not reliant on a direct effect on LPS itself, we postulate that other pathways are much more important in explaining the renoprotective properties ascribed to ALP. The re-evaluation of which properties of the ALP enzyme are responsible for the benefit seen in the lab is an important step in determining where the true potential of ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI in the clinic lies. In this review we will discuss how ALP can prevent activation of harmful pro-inflammatory receptors, redirect cell-cell signalling and protect barrier tissues, which together form the basis for current knowledge of the role of ALP in the kidney. With this knowledge in mind and by analysing currently available clinical evidence, we propose directions for new research that can determine whether ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI has a future in the clinical field.

### The preterm prediction study: the value of serum alkaline phosphatase, α-fetoprotein, plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone, and other serum markers for the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth [^111umgCu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

High levels of a number of analytes are found in maternal blood; alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and corticotropin-releasing hormone have been associated with spontaneous preterm birth. We investigated the relationship between 8 potential blood markers and subsequent spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic pregnant women.

Study Design

We performed a nested case control study that involved 127 women who were enrolled in the preterm prediction study and who had a singleton spontaneous preterm birth at < 35 weeks and 127 women who had a term birth and served as matched (age, parity, center) controls. Serum that was collected at 24 and 28 weeks was analyzed for alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and 5 other analytes.

Results

Alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and corticotropin-releasing hormone, but not other analytes, were significantly elevated in pregnancies that ended in spontaneous preterm birth. For alkaline phosphatase at 24 weeks, the odds ratio for spontaneous preterm birth at < 32 weeks was 6.8 (range, 1.4–32.8) and for spontaneous preterm birth at < 35 weeks 5.1 (range, 1.7–15.6). Similar results were found at 28 weeks. For alpha-fetoprotein at 24 weeks, the odds ratio for spontaneous preterm birth at < 32 weeks was 8.3 (range,2.2–30.9) and for spontaneous preterm birth at < 35 weeks was 3.5 (range, 1.8–6.7). The levels at 28 weeks were still predictive but less so than at 24 weeks. Corticotropin-releasing hormone, at 28 weeks but not at 24 weeks, was predictive for spontaneous preterm birth at < 35 weeks, with an odds ratio 3.4 (range, 1.0–10.9).

Conclusion

Elevated alkaline phosphatase and alpha-fetoprotein are associated with subsequent spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic pregnant women at 24 and 28 weeks. Elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone levels at 28 weeks are associated with spontaneous preterm birth at < 35 weeks.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115fZ5hX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".
