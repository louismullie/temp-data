## Question

Is MS associated with an increased risk for infertility?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with an increased risk of infertility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how infertility is defined and measured in the general population. Then, I should verify what high-quality contemporary data say about infertility rates in women with MS compared with controls. Next, I will examine whether any observed differences reflect disease biology versus behavioral or treatment-related factors. After that, I should review male fertility data in MS. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical counseling points, including when to refer for fertility evaluation and how disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) fit into this picture.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: infertility is typically defined as failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse for women under 35 years, and after 6 months for women 35 years or older. Fecundity refers to the ability to conceive and the time to pregnancy, which I should keep in mind as I interpret studies that report time-to-pregnancy rather than a binary infertility outcome [^113Gfrmg].

> Now, I should review the most direct comparative evidence. A recent high-credibility analysis summarized that in a large administrative database, women with MS had a slightly higher prevalence of infertility than women without MS (8.5% vs 8.1%, P = 0.0006), a difference of about 0.4 percentage points, which is statistically significant but clinically small. Importantly, the authors note that MS itself is not thought to meaningfully impair fertility, suggesting this small excess may reflect non-biological drivers such as delayed childbearing or treatment-related timing constraints [^113Gfrmg].

> Wait, let me verify whether this aligns with other contemporary cohorts. A Danish nationwide cohort of women with relapsing-remitting MS undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) found no increase in relapse activity at 3 or 9 months after ART initiation compared with the 12 months before ART, which indirectly supports that ART itself is not triggering excess disease activity and that the cohort's baseline fertility issues are not driven by MS biology per se. Similarly, multiple modern multicenter studies show no increase in annualized relapse rate after diverse fertility treatments, reinforcing that ART is generally safe from an MS activity standpoint when managed appropriately [^116ToHZW] [^11376yhW] [^112JaXfC] [^116HYEB9].

> Hold on, let's not conflate ART safety with baseline fertility. I should double-check whether women with MS actually have higher infertility rates independent of ART. A recent Israeli study cited in a peer-reviewed summary found similar infertility prevalence in MS compared with the general population, which argues against a large biologic effect of MS on fertility; moreover, a French observational study of 115 women with MS reported mean time-to-pregnancy of about 7.5 months after MS onset, which is within normal fecundity expectations, although the mean number of children was lower than the general population, likely reflecting behavioral choices and timing rather than inherent infertility [^113Gfrmg] [^111mzb5G].

> I need to check mechanistic hypotheses that could link MS to reduced fertility. Emerging data raise the possibility of lower ovarian reserve or greater immune-mediated thyroid disease in some women with MS, but these signals are not definitive and require prospective validation. Importantly, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, a marker of ovarian reserve, appear similar between women with and without MS in several cohorts, which tempers concern for a systemic ovarian failure phenotype in MS [^113Gfrmg] [^1142j65a].

> Next, I should review male fertility. Scandinavian registry-based studies suggest men with MS may have fewer offspring, but this association could reflect altered sexual behavior or disability-related factors rather than a direct testicular or spermatogenic defect. Indeed, a pooled Danish registry analysis linked male infertility with presence of MS but not with subsequent MS incidence, hinting at reverse causation or shared behavioral pathways, and a small prospective study found no deterioration in hormonal or semen parameters over 12 months in men on natalizumab or ocrelizumab, although data remain limited and heterogeneous [^111u671n] [^116vRgwF].

> But wait, what if medications are the real driver of infertility risk rather than MS itself? I should confirm which therapies carry reproductive toxicity. Mitoxantrone is clearly associated with ovarian failure in women and can cause male infertility, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with alkylating conditioning causes infertility in the vast majority of recipients; fingolimod is teratogenic and requires strict contraception and washout, and teriflunomide has teratogenic potential via paternal exposure necessitating accelerated elimination if a pregnancy is planned; by contrast, interferon beta and glatiramer acetate have reassuring pregnancy safety profiles and are often continued until conception in selected cases, which helps mitigate relapse risk without clear fertility harm [^116TLMo7] [^111rL8Tz] [^1155iMWL] [^1175ymx9] [^111g54KC] [^116pmoW8].

> I should also consider behavioral and timing effects that could masquerade as infertility. Women with MS frequently delay pregnancy due to disease concerns and DMT management, which increases age-related subfertility. Therapeutic inertia and early DMT discontinuation around pregnancy planning may worsen disease control and complicate timing, and guideline-concordant counseling now emphasizes establishing disease control before conception while using contraception, then individualizing DMT continuation or bridging strategies to balance maternal and fetal risks [^113XCE5j] [^1175wmXr] [^117DvHwo].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Overall, contemporary evidence does not support a large biologically mediated increase in infertility due to MS itself. Any excess infertility risk appears small (on the order of fractions of a percent in large databases) and is more plausibly explained by delayed childbearing, treatment timing constraints, and possibly small increases in autoimmune thyroid disease or subtle ovarian reserve differences that are not yet firmly established. For men, reduced offspring counts likely reflect sexual dysfunction and behavioral factors rather than primary testicular failure, though data remain sparse [^113Gfrmg] [^111u671n] [^116vRgwF].

> Clinically, I should confirm practical guidance. For women with MS who fail to conceive after 6 months of trying (if age 35 or older) or after 12 months (if younger than 35), early referral to fertility evaluation is reasonable given age-related fecundity decline and the potential need to coordinate DMT timing; during fertility treatments, maintaining an appropriate DMT where feasible reduces relapse risk without increasing ART-related disease activity in modern cohorts; and for men, routine fertility screening is not indicated solely on the basis of MS, but sexual dysfunction should be screened and treated because it can impair conception attempts [^113Gfrmg] [^11376yhW] [^112JaXfC] [^116vRgwF].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the weight of evidence: MS is not associated with a clinically meaningful increase in infertility risk. Observed small differences likely reflect behavioral and treatment-timing factors rather than a direct disease effect on reproductive physiology, and with proactive family planning, optimized DMT strategies, and timely fertility evaluation when indicated, most people with MS can achieve their reproductive goals without undue delay or harm [^113Gfrmg] [^113XCE5j] [^114L6QyH].

Multiple sclerosis (MS) does not directly cause infertility, but **fertility can be indirectly affected** by MS symptoms, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and delayed childbearing [^113XCE5j]. Women with MS have **similar fertility rates** to the general population, though some studies suggest a slightly higher prevalence of infertility, likely due to secondary factors such as sexual dysfunction, fatigue, and medication effects [^113Gfrmg] [^114L6QyH]. Male fertility may be impacted by sexual dysfunction and certain DMTs (e.g. mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide) [^116TLMo7] [^111rL8Tz]. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are generally safe for women with MS, and **recent data do not show a significant increase in relapse risk** after IVF when DMTs are managed appropriately [^112JaXfC] [^116HYEB9]. Overall, MS itself is not a direct cause of infertility, but **careful management of symptoms and medications** is essential for optimizing fertility outcomes [^113XCE5j].

## Female fertility and multiple sclerosis

### Direct impact of MS on fertility

There is **no clear evidence** that MS directly impairs ovarian function or causes infertility; most women with MS have fertility rates similar to the general population [^111mzb5G] [^113Gfrmg]. Some studies suggest a slightly higher prevalence of infertility among women with MS, but this may reflect secondary factors such as sexual dysfunction, fatigue, and medication effects rather than a direct disease mechanism [^1142j65a].

---

### Indirect impact of MS on fertility

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Fatigue, spasticity, and bladder dysfunction can reduce sexual activity and desire, indirectly affecting fertility [^1119gAa4].

- **Delayed childbearing**: Many women with MS delay pregnancy due to disease activity or medication concerns, which can reduce fertility with advancing age [^113Gfrmg].

- **Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)**: Some DMTs (e.g. mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide) can cause ovarian suppression or premature ovarian insufficiency, affecting fertility [^116TLMo7] [^117785ci].

---

### Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and MS

Historically, ART — particularly IVF — was thought to increase relapse risk due to hormonal stimulation; however, **recent studies show no significant increase in relapse risk** after IVF when DMTs are appropriately managed [^112JaXfC] [^116HYEB9]. Maintaining DMTs during ART may reduce relapse risk, and ART is generally considered safe for women with MS [^112JaXfC] [^11376yhW].

---

## Male fertility and multiple sclerosis

### Direct impact of MS on male fertility

There is **no clear evidence** that MS directly impairs spermatogenesis or causes male infertility; however, sexual dysfunction is common and can indirectly affect fertility [^114omFH2].

---

### Indirect impact of MS on male fertility

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and decreased libido are common in men with MS, indirectly affecting fertility [^115s1n73] [^1119gAa4].

- **Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)**: Some DMTs (e.g. mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide) can cause testicular suppression or azoospermia, affecting male fertility [^116TLMo7] [^111rL8Tz].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Preconception counseling**: Patients with MS should receive comprehensive counseling on fertility, pregnancy, and medication management to optimize outcomes [^116op8ex].

- **Medication management**: DMTs should be carefully managed before, during, and after pregnancy to balance disease control and fertility goals [^117DvHwo].

- **Assisted reproductive technologies**: ART is generally safe for patients with MS, and maintaining DMTs during ART may reduce relapse risk [^112JaXfC] [^116HYEB9].

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Female fertility** | **Male fertility** |
|-|-|-|
| Direct impact of MS | No clear evidence of direct impairment | No clear evidence of direct impairment |
| Indirect impact of MS | - Sexual dysfunction <br/> - Delayed childbearing <br/> - DMTs | - Sexual dysfunction <br/> - DMTs |
| ART and MS | Generally safe; no significant increase in relapse risk | Limited data; generally considered safe |
| DMTs and fertility | Some DMTs can impair fertility | Some DMTs can impair fertility |

---

MS does not directly cause infertility, but **fertility can be indirectly affected** by MS symptoms, DMTs, and delayed childbearing. With appropriate management and counseling, most patients with MS can achieve successful pregnancies and healthy outcomes [^113XCE5j].

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^116M63kg]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to evaluating the risk of relapse after COS-ET, we extend prior studies by evaluating inflammatory activity after other FTs that collectively encompass the full spectrum of modern fertility care. Increasingly, patients undergoing COS and egg retrieval may delay ET, to pursue a frozen ET at a later date, or oocyte or embryo cryopreservation for medical or social fertility preservation. Furthermore, ET from previously cryopreserved autologous eggs/embryos or embryos derived from donor eggs is increasingly common. And while one of the oldest FTs OI with clomiphene citrate or letrozole with or without IUI remains one of the most commonly used FTs nationwide. Each type of FT expands childbearing options. While the treatments involve varying degrees of hormonal preparation, a total of 6 relapses were observed within 3 months after 124 cycles.

While overall risk remains low for patients with MS undergoing FT, certain factors may be protective. Older age, which is known to be associated with declining risk of relapses in MS, is also associated with decreased success of FTs. Patients older than 37 years and with disease course longer than 2 years had a significantly lower relapse rate. Pregnancy remains a protective factor and may be one of the reasons why the COS-ET had a lower ARR post-FT because they were the most likely to achieve pregnancy. Remaining on DMT significantly lowered relapse risk for women undergoing COS. Finally, there were no relapses in the group of patients undergoing ET only, regardless of DMT status, which may be due to the lower exogenous hormonal exposure in this group.

### Cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies with natalizumab for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis [^117FFooR]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by demyelination affecting the central nervous system. The age at MS onset is variable, with peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 40. There is a significant gender disparity, with MS being up to three times more common in females. The majority of people with the disease are initially diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), with episodes of relapse, followed by periods of stability. These relapses can cause irreversible damage resulting in long-term disability. Although incurable, several disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are available for the treatment of MS. DMTs aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow down disability progression, and improve overall quality of life. The selection and initiation of DMTs for individual patients depend on multiple factors such as disease activity, individual patient characteristics, and potential side-effects.

Women with MS may face difficult decisions regarding balancing DMT use and family planning. Approximately, one in three women with MS becomes pregnant after diagnosis. Pregnancy affects the course of MS in women, with significant changes in relapse rates during the pregnancy and post-partum periods, with DMT strategy additionally impacting on pre-conception relapse risk. The historical studies have shown that annualised relapse rates (ARR) decrease after the first trimester compared to pre-conception levels, with a significant increase in the 3 months after delivery (post-partum rebound) and return to pre-pregnancy rates within 4–6 months postpartum. More recent work has shown that the post-partum rebound appears to be less marked, possibly reflecting either improved DMT algorithms around pregnancy, or extension of diagnostic criteria resulting in milder disease at pregnancy. In the post-partum period, breastfeeding is safe and recommended for women with MS. The risk of post-partum relapses appears to reduce significantly with breastfeeding, which is associated with 37% lower risk of postpartum relapse on average compared to not breastfeeding, although selection bias and reverse causation may impact on these observational study findings.

### UK consensus on pregnancy in multiple sclerosis:' Association of British Neurologists' guidelines [^117DvHwo]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in women than men and is most commonly diagnosed in early adulthood; thus, many patients will not have completed their families at the time of diagnosis. There is increasing awareness of the importance of early treatment in preventing long-term disability in MS. Delaying treatment until women with MS have completed their families can lead to the development of irreversible disability in at least some cases. It is therefore important to discuss family planning and pregnancy proactively. However, to date there is limited evidence to inform such discussions. We set out to develop consensus guidelines for the treatment of MS in pregnancy to encourage and facilitate discussions in this important area. The guidelines draw on available evidence from drug-specific pregnancy registers and published literature and have been scored by a panel of experts from a variety of disciplines using modified Delphi criteria. They cover prepregnancy counselling, management during pregnancy, delivery and anaesthetic options, postpartum advice and specific advice regarding currently licensed disease-modifying drugs. As the complexity and range of available disease-modifying drugs increase, further data gathering via a UK-wide MS pregnancy register is recommended.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^117BEJ9e]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding the impact of fertility treatments (FTs) on multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity represents a treatment goal because impaired fecundity affects approximately 11% of the female reproductive age population in the United States. While women with MS are more likely to receive an infertility diagnosis, they are less likely to receive FT. Historically, 5 small studies (N = 4–32) reported an elevated relapse risk in women with MS after assisted reproductive technologies. Specific contributing factors seemed to include the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and failure to conceive. These findings were supported by a meta-analysis and pooled analysis of the individual studies. However, more recent and larger cohort studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of relapse. Possible explanations for these conflicting results include changes in stimulation protocols over time, including a shift from GnRH agonist to GnRH antagonist–based protocols and an increased use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) throughout FT. These trends warrant further evaluation among patients with MS pursuing FTs.

In addition, there is a need for a broader analysis that encompasses the full spectrum of currently available FTs. Most cohort studies to date have focused on the risks associated with conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF), consisting of controlled ovarian stimulation followed by oocyte retrieval and IVF with fresh embryo transfer (COS-ET). However, patients may pursue other assisted reproductive treatments, including COS and oocyte retrieval without subsequent embryo transfer (ET) for the purposes of oocyte or embryo cryopreservation or ET without COS when using cryopreserved autologous oocytes or embryos or embryos derived from donor oocytes. Patients may also pursue ovulation induction (OI) with oral agents such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

To capture the full scope of fertility care, the current analyses evaluated the effect of various FTs on MS course in a contemporary cohort, leveraging data from 4 individual MS centers in the United States. Our primary aim was to evaluate the hypothesis that there was no increase in annualized relapse rate (ARR) after vs before FT. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the role of patient, MS, DMT, and FT-related factors on relapse risk.

Statistical Analyses

We performed descriptive analyses using means ± SD for quantitative variables and proportions for qualitative variables. We calculated the ARR by dividing the total number of relapses during the observed period by the sum of the follow-up time. We compared ARRs between groups using a zero-inflated Poisson regression because of the low occurrence of relapses observed in the descriptive analysis. We added an offset on the follow-up time to obtain the ARR. IVF was the statistical unit of analysis. As a woman could have undergone several IVF procedures (repeated measures), we included a random effect on the woman. We calculated the relapse incidence rates, incidence rate ratios, and the corresponding CIs and summarized them in a forest plot.

We used a zero-inflated Poisson regression to compare the ARR after IVF in the IVF group and control group (intergroup comparisons), and to compare the 3-month periods before and after IVF (intragroup comparison) and the control 3-month period 1 year before IVF.

We used the McNemar test to compare the percentage of IVF procedures where a woman had at least 1 relapse in the 2 periods of interest (before/after), followed by a multivariate logistic regression model.

Finally, we investigated potential prognostic factors of relapse occurrence in the 3 months after IVF using a logistic regression model.

We adjusted all models for age at IVF and the presence/absence of DMT at IVF, as well as their level of efficacy, categorized as medium or high. We performed subgroup analyses based on the stimulation protocol (GnRH agonists vs antagonists), IVF outcome (success vs failure), and treatment status at the time of IVF (treated vs untreated). We replicated all analyses for both subperiods.

We considered results significant when p < 0.05 and performed all analyses with R (v.4.2.2).

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

Ethical and data access approvals for the study were obtained according to the current French legislation.

Patients gave their informed consent to store their data in the OFSEP database and to use them for research in France and abroad. The OFSEP-SNDS linkage was approved by the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés CNIL; approval DR-2021–034 obtained on February 4, 2021) and was performed using medical records of patients who consented. Data were stored on a secure server at Eskemm Numérique (Rennes, France) that guarantees all the security requirements.

### Term pregnancies and the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis: a population based study [^113Hda69]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Pregnancy has a well documented effect on relapse risk in multiple sclerosis (MS). Prospective studies have reported a significant decline by two-thirds in the rate of relapses during the third trimester of pregnancy and a significant increase by two-thirds during the first 3 months postpartum. However, it is unclear as to whether there are any long term effects on disability.

Methods

Data were collated from clinical records and family histories systematically collected from the University of British Columbia MS Clinic.

Results

Clinical and term pregnancy data were available from 2105 female MS patients. MS patients having children after MS onset took the longest time to reach an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6 (mean 22.9 years) and patients having children before MS onset were the quickest (mean 13.2 years). However, these effects were not related to term pregnancy and were fully accounted for by age of MS onset.

Conclusions

Pregnancy had no effect on the time to reach an EDSS score 6. As MS predominantly affects women of childbearing age, women with MS can be reassured that term pregnancies do not appear to have any long term effects on disability.

### Disease activity in pregnant and postpartum women with multiple sclerosis receiving ocrelizumab or other disease-modifying therapies [^111nUkWk]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS and a common cause of neurologic disability in young adults, particularly prevalent in women, with onset typically occurring during childbearing years. Historical studies of peripregnancy relapse in women with MS on either no or low-efficacy disease-modifying therapy (DMT) showed reductions during pregnancy, followed by a spike in the early postpartum period. Recent studies that have included women treated with higher efficacy DMTs such as natalizumab (NAT) and fingolimod have revealed increased probabilities of relapse during pregnancy and postpartum periods, particularly after preconception DMT cessation and before reinitiation of therapy after delivery. In addition, women who have more active disease with higher relapse rates and disability before conception are also at elevated risk of postpartum disease reactivation.

Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 cell surface antigen and modulates the immunopathogenesis of MS by depleting B cells. Pivotal clinical trials showed that administration of OCR at a 24-weekly dosing interval leads to significant reductions in disease activity and slowing of disease progression compared with interferon-beta in patients with relapsing MS and placebo in patients with primary progressive MS. OCR efficacy was sustained in the open-label extension phases of the pivotal trials with safety profile consistent with clinical trial findings and no new safety signal identified with prolonged treatment.

While available data on pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to OCR are reassuring to date, data on postpartum disease activity control have only recently emerged. Several studies have described OCR and rituximab (RTX), another anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is used off-label in the treatment of MS, use before conception as associated with low rates of disease activity throughout pregnancy and during the postpartum period. The effect of OCR on disease reactivation during the pregnancy and postpartum periods relative to other DMTs remains unclear.

In the setting of multiple DMTs available at present, data to inform counseling and management of optimal maternal and infant outcomes in the context of family planning are important. Pivotal trials typically exclude pregnant women, and therefore, insights from observational studies are required. In this study, we sought to investigate disease activity during pregnancy and postpartum, in women who used OCR or other DMTs with accepted strategies for their use before conception and in the context of family planning.

### Oral contraceptives and the risk of multiple sclerosis: a review of the epidemiologic evidence [^11343TUo]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more frequent in women than in men, suggesting that sex hormones could play a role in the development of MS. For this reason, several studies have assessed whether use of oral contraceptives modifies the risk of MS. In this article, we review the methodology and results of published epidemiologic studies addressing this issue. On the whole, the existing epidemiologic evidence does not support an important effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of MS, though it does suggest that oral contraceptives might delay the onset of the disease.

### Assessing the risk of relapse requiring corticosteroids after in vitro fertilization in women with multiple sclerosis [^112JaXfC]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Several studies have shown an increased risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization (IVF) in women with multiple sclerosis (MS), especially when a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist stimulation protocol was used. Our objective was to investigate the risk of relapse after IVF in women with MS, overall and according to stimulation protocol (GnRH agonists vs antagonists), using data from the French national health insurance database.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included all women with MS who have benefited from IVF between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, in France. Three-month exposed periods after IVF were compared with unexposed periods before IVF, each woman being her own control. Four outcomes were considered: annualized relapse rate (ARR), proportion of IVF with relapse, difference in the number of relapses "after-before", and the delay from IVF to the first relapse. Relapses were identified by an algorithm based on MS-related hospital admissions and the use of corticosteroid therapy. Stimulation protocols and disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) were identified using drug claims. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models adjusted for age at IVF and the presence of DMT were used. A random effect on women was included because women may undergo multiple IVF procedures. Subgroup analyses by stimulation protocol and IVF outcome (pregnancy or failure) were conducted.

Results

A total of 225 women accounting for 338 IVF procedures were included (the mean age at the first IVF 34.6 ± 4.5 years; 36% of women underwent at least 2 IVF procedures during the period). No increase in the risk of relapse after IVF was found overall (before vs after IVF: 0.20 vs 0.18 relapse per patient-year; 7.7% vs 7.1% of IVF with women having at least one relapse) and in subgroups. A lower ARR before and after IVF was observed among women who remained treated until IVF.

Discussion

The maintenance of DMT until IVF seemed to be a determining factor in reducing the risk of relapse. Women with MS should be reassured because we did not show an increased risk of relapse requiring the use of corticosteroid therapy after IVF neither with GnRH agonists nor with GnRH antagonists.

### Rituximab, MS, and pregnancy [^113r79Ms]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the safety and efficacy of rituximab (RTX) in MS and pregnancy, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 74 pregnancies among 55 women treated with RTX for MS and their offspring.

Methods

We used prospectively collected information from the electronic health record at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2012 and 2019 of mother and baby to identify treatment history, pregnancy outcomes, and relapses.

Results

Last RTX exposure before conception occurred between 1.8 and 5.2 months in 32 (49%) of 65 pregnancies and accidentally during the first trimester in 9 (12%). Among 38 live births, adverse pregnancy outcomes were as follows: 3 preterm deliveries (including 1 set of twins), 1 neonatal death (preterm twin), and 1 perinatal stroke (full-term). No stillbirths, chorioamnionitis, or major malformations were found. Fifteen (27%) women had at least one first-trimester miscarriage, of whom 8 (53%) had a history of infertility. Cumulative dose or timing of last RTX infusion was not associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. Only 2 (5.4%) women experienced relapses, one during pregnancy and the other postpartum.

Conclusion

We observed no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with expected national incidence rates and remarkably little disease activity in RTX-treated women with MS, particularly when compared with periconceptional natalizumab-treated cohorts. However, larger studies are needed to fully assess the safety of RTX use before pregnancy, especially risks associated with prolonged B-cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia. Until these data are available, we recommend restricting RTX use before pregnancy to women who require highly effective MS treatments.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that for pregnant women with MS, RTX controls disease activity and does not increase adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Glatiramer acetate exposure in pregnancy: preliminary safety and birth outcomes [^115GfJV9]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

With the increasing incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in women and the earlier use of disease modifying therapy (DMT), issues surrounding DMT and pregnancy are a regular subject of discussion with regards to optimal management. Current recommendations are to withdraw DMT prior to conception, leaving patients exposed to an uncertain period of untreated disease. The objective of this study is to report preliminary experience on glatiramer acetate (GA) exposure through conception, pregnancy and the post-partum period in a series of 13 patients with previously highly active relapsing-remitting MS. This is a prospective observational case series. Fourteen pregnancies of 13 women resulted in 13 live births (one twin pregnancy), nine exposed to GA throughout pregnancy. There were no birth defects and treatment was well tolerated. No relapses occurred during pregnancy in those continuing on treatment. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that when considering the risks and benefits of treatment withdrawal prior to pregnancy, it may be reasonable to continue GA in those patients with previously highly active disease. Consideration should also be given to the initiation of a birth register, similar to such initiatives in epilepsy, to generate more robust safety data in this controversial area.

### Sex hormone-related factors and the risk of PIRA in women with multiple sclerosis [^114Pe4by]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sex-related differences affect multiple sclerosis (MS), but the impact of sex hormones on disease progression remains unclear. We investigated whether sex hormone-related factors influence progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in women with MS over a long-term follow-up.

Methods

The study analysed 1210 female MS patients from the San Raffaele MS Center using data from an environmental survey (2019–2023). PIRA was defined as 12-week confirmed disability progression independent of recent relapses (< 30days). Cox proportional-hazard models (adjusted for confounding factors) were used to assess the effect of hormone-related factors on PIRA risk.

Results

Patients who used oral contraceptives before MS diagnosis had a 26% lower risk of PIRA and a delayed median time to the first PIRA event (9.94 vs 7.5 years; HR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.89; p = 0.0018). Conversely, menopause at diagnosis (HR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.67; p = 0.0022) and pregnancy before diagnosis (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.006 to 1.47; p = 0.043) were associated with a shorter time to PIRA. No significant differences were found with abortion, menstrual irregularity or fertility therapy.

Conclusions

This study suggests that early oral contraceptives may delay future disability progression, supporting the importance of sex hormones in MS and prompting further prospective investigations on oral contraceptives to slow disease progression.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^116jErVM]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a female predominant disease. The prototypic affected individual is a young woman of childbearing age. This article emphasizes the current thinking about this disease, using a sex-based approach. It begins with a review of male vs. female differences in the nervous system and immune system, as well as a general discussion of sex hormones. The demographic and clinical impact of sex on MS prognosis and symptoms is covered. Pregnancy, the best studied sex-based condition, is reviewed and includes updated counseling information on fertility and assisted reproductive technology. MS issues in less well studied areas involving puberty, the menstrual cycle and menopause are also presented. The impact of sex on the MS therapeutic response is considered. The final section covers MS considerations in males. This up to date review provides a comprehensive and succinct approach to sex considerations in MS.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^115s1n73]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease with highest incidence during the period of optimal reproductive health. This scoping review aimed to identify and summarize available data on sexual/reproductive health in males with MS (MwMS).

Methods

This review was based on PRISMA extension for Scoping Review. PubMed database was searched for keyword "multiple sclerosis" alongside keywords "sexual health", "reproductive health", "family planning", "male fertility", "male infertility", "sexual dysfunction", and "erectile dysfunction", iteratively using the "AND" logical operator. Descriptive analysis was performed on the included articles.

Results

Thirty-four studies were included, and four topics emerged: sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, fertility, and family planning. Sexual dysfunction is common in MwMS (35–72%), yet only a minority of MwMS discuss their sexual health with their treatment teams. Both MS disability and depression were associated with sexual dysfunction in MwMS, with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido as the most prevalent aspects of sexual dysfunction. Positively, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors appear effective for treating erectile dysfunction and improving sexual quality of life in MwMS. There may also be a relationship between MS and male infertility, though changes in sexual behavior may underlie this association. Finally, a prominent knowledge gap was observed for disease-modifying therapy use and family planning in MwMS.

Conclusion

Sexual dysfunction is common, impacted by MS severity, and associates with decreased quality of life in MwMS. Communication barriers regarding sexual and reproductive health appear to exist between MwMS and providers, as do literature gaps related to MS therapeutics and sexual/reproductive health.

Switching: Recommendation 10 — pregnancy and disease-modifying therapy (DMT) management states that relapse risk is reduced during pregnancy and increases in the postpartum period, and directs the following: "Clinicians should counsel women to stop their DMT before conception for planned pregnancies unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specific DMT during pregnancy (Level B)". "Clinicians should discontinue DMTs during pregnancy if accidental exposure occurs, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specific DMT during pregnancy (Level B)". "Clinicians should not initiate DMTs during pregnancy unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specific DMT during pregnancy (Level B)".

### Increased risk of multiple sclerosis relapse after in vitro fertilisation [^116aMkuo]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Exogenous sexual steroids together with pregnancy have been shown to influence the risk of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS). Treatments used during assisted reproductive techniques may consequently influence the short term evolution of MS by modifying the hormonal status of the patient. The objective of this study was to determine if there was an increased risk of developing exacerbations in women with MS after in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

Methods

MS and IVF data were either automatically extracted from 13 French university hospital databases or obtained from referring neurologists. After matching databases, patient clinical files were systematically reviewed to collect information about MS and the treatments used for IVF. The association between IVF and the occurrence of MS relapses was analysed in detail using univariate and multivariate statistical tests.

Findings

During the 11 year study period, 32 women with MS had undergone 70 IVF treatments, 48 using gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and 19 using GnRH antagonists. A significant increase in the annualised relapse rate (ARR) was observed during the 3 month period following IVF (mean ARR 1.60, median ARR 0) compared with the same period just before IVF (mean ARR 0.80, median ARR 0) and to a control period 1 year before IVF (mean ARR 0.68, median ARR 0). The significant increase in relapses was associated with the use of GnRH agonists (Wilcoxon paired test, p = 0.025) as well as IVF failure (Wilcoxon paired test, p = 0.019).

Interpretation

An increased relapse rate was observed in this study after IVF in patients with MS and may be partly related both to IVF failure and the use of GnRH agonists.

### Disease-modifying therapy during pregnancy and postpartum relapse activity in women with multiple sclerosis undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment: a nationwide cohort study [^114L6QyH]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, often affects women of childbearing age. The disease characteristics of MS may impact fertility such that women with MS may have decreased fertility rates and fewer children, although a recent study has shown similar rates of infertility among MS patients and the general population. In the past, women with MS had been discouraged from having children because of concerns associated with the impact of the disease (eg, fatigue and mobility) on their ability to care for their child and the child's well-being. Furthermore, concerns associated with receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the prevention of relapses, MRI lesions and disability development, and if/when to discontinue DMT treatment before pregnancy, may lead women with MS to delay their first childbirth compared with the general population.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment could give women with MS an increased chance of pregnancy, and the proportion of women with MS seeking such treatment is thought to be increasing.

The relapse activity during pregnancy is generally regarded as low; immune response changes during pregnancy are thought to lead to lower inflammation and thereby fewer relapses, particularly in the third trimester. Historically, evidence has been equivocal regarding the effect of exposure to DMT on relapses during and after pregnancy in women with MS. However, more recent evidence suggests that the use of DMTs before pregnancy reduces the risk of postpartum relapse in women with MS; however, data concerning DMT use during pregnancy on postpartum relapses in women with MS undergoing fertility treatment are scarce.

Therefore, this study investigated the annualised relapse rate (ARR) postpartum, overall and according to DMT exposure during pregnancy, in women with relapsing-remitting MS from the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry (DMSR) who gave birth after ART. We further identified the clinical and demographical factors associated with being relapse-free postpartum.

### Cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies with natalizumab for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis [^1175ymx9]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Women of childbearing age require consideration when selecting treatment regimes, as some DMTs may affect fertility (haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, HSCT), be associated with congenital malformations (fingolimod), or pose risks associated with withdrawal rebound, with potential long-term consequences. Consequently, women with MS naturally have concerns about family planning including hesitation regarding use of DMTs during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as well as about managing childcare while experiencing relapses. Historically, women have often faced a choice between treatment plans and family planning and some were advised to begin treatment after pregnancy.

Whilst evidence regarding the safety profiles of DMTs when used in and around pregnancy has increased substantially in the last decade, research regarding the impact of DMT withdrawal has lagged behind. Recent studies have used drug trials to compare the effectiveness and risks of various DMTs, but there is little evidence regarding the advantages and disadvantages of stopping versus continuing treatment. The relapses resulting from withdrawal of treatment can cause substantial long-term morbidity, yet the impact of this beyond individual level has not been assessed. For example, UK consensus on pregnancy in multiple sclerosis strongly suggests continuing treatment with natalizumab during pregnancy given the significant risk of disease reactivation and/or rebound on stopping treatment. The analysis described here takes the case of the use of natalizumab to investigate the cost-effectiveness of three treatment strategies for women during pregnancy from the perspective of the UK healthcare system. We analyse the potential risks and challenges associated with treatment discontinuation at, during and after pregnancy.

### The complex genetics of multiple sclerosis: pitfalls and prospects [^116XmyuW]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence for the influence of genetics

Most, if not all, common diseases are characterized by an increased frequency in the relatives of affected individuals, and multiple sclerosis is no exception. Amongst white individuals living in temperate regions, the prevalence of multiple sclerosis is typically 1/1000, yet 15–20% of patients report a family history of the disease, a rate which is significantly more than would be expected by chance (Compston and Coles). Several carefully conducted, population-based studies of familial recurrence risk have been performed which have confirmed and quantified the increased risk of the disease in the relatives of affected individuals (Sadovnick et al; Robertson et al; Carton et al.). This familial clustering can be usefully summarized in terms of λ s; the relative risk of the disease seen in the siblings of affected individuals as compared to that seen in the general population (Risch). In multiple sclerosis this risk ratio takes a value of ∼15 (Sawcer,), and of course reflects the combined effects of all shared aetiological influences, both genetic and environmental (Guo). Teasing apart the relative contribution of these alternate influences requires the analysis of informative groups and many such studies have been performed in multiple sclerosis. A significant excess of concordance in monozygotic (identical) as compared to dizygotic (non-identical) twins is a virtually universal finding (Mumford et al; Willer et al; Hansen et al; Ristori et al; Islam et al.), with the only exceptions being studies which lacked the power to show any difference as significant (French Research Group on Multiple Sclerosis). In a study of individuals with multiple sclerosis who had been adopted in early life, researchers found no excess risk of the disease in the adopting family but the expected excess risk within the natural (genetically related) family (Ebers et al.). Couples where both the husband and the wife are affected with the disease (so-called conjugal pairs) do not occur more frequently than would be expected by chance, although the risk of the disease in their offspring is greater than if just one parent is affected (Robertson et al; Ebers et al.). The risk of the disease in half-siblings is approximately half the risk seen in full siblings, regardless of whether they are raised together or apart (Ebers et al.), while there is no excess risk in stepsiblings (Dyment et al.), who are of course genetically unrelated. In summary, these data suggest that living with someone who has, or who will eventually develop, multiple sclerosis has little or no effect on your risk of developing the disease unless you are genetically related to them, in which case your risk increases with the degree of relatedness (Dyment et al.). This is not to imply that environmental factors have no role, only that they seem to exert their effects mainly at a population level with the micro-environmental differences between families within a given population seeming to be of relatively little importance (Dyment et al.). Although these data confirm that genetic factors are unequivocally relevant in multiple sclerosis, large extended families containing multiple affected individuals in multiple generations are extremely uncommon (Willer et al.). Most families contain no more than two or three affected individuals and no clear mode of inheritance can be inferred from segregation analysis (Compston et al.).

### Pregnancy-related disease outcomes in women with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis disability [^111Jv3VR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Understanding the association between pregnancy and clinical outcomes in women with moderate to severe multiple sclerosis (MS) disability is crucial for guiding family planning and management strategies.

Objective

To assess peripregnancy relapse activity and disability progression in women with a preconception Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3 or higher.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter retrospective cohort study used data from the MSBase Registry, with clinical observations spanning 1984 through 2024. Study cohorts included pregnant women with MS with a preconception EDSS score of 3 or higher (range: 3–10, with higher scores indicating more severe MS-related disability) and propensity score-matched nonpregnant women with MS (controls).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were peripregnancy annualized relapse rates (ARRs) and time to 6-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW).

Results

A total of 1631 women with MS were included, of whom 575 were in the pregnant cohort (median [IQR] age at pregnancy, 32.5 [29.1–36.1] years) and 1056 were in the nonpregnant cohort (median [IQR] age, 32.6 [27.5–37.2] years). The median (range) preconception EDSS score was 3.5 (3.0–7.5). Relapse activity decreased during pregnancy, with a 75% reduction in ARR during the first trimester (rate ratio [RR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.15–0.43), and increased to 36% above preconception levels in the first 3 months post partum (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06–1.75). Relapse during pregnancy was associated with a higher preconception ARR (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.10–2.20) and preconception use of natalizumab (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.24–23.57) or fingolimod (OR, 14.07; 95% CI, 2.81–91.30). Older age (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99) and continuation of disease-modifying therapy into pregnancy (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19–1.00) were associated with reduced risk. Disease-modifying therapy reinitiation within 1 month post partum was associated with lower odds of early postpartum relapse (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.86). There was no significant difference in time to CDW between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.96–1.38). However, ARR during pregnancy (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13–1.65) and postpartum EDSS score higher than 4 (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.80–4.03) were associated with shorter time to CDW.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, women with moderate to severe MS disability exhibited a pattern of peripregnancy relapse activity similar to that reported in women with less disability. Pregnancy was not associated with worse long-term disability outcomes, although optimizing disease control in the peripregnancy period remained critical.

### Pregnancy does not modify the risk of MS in genetically susceptible women [^115VB1RX]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies investigating the effect of pregnancy on MS risk have reported conflicting results. Five studies reported a protective association between parity and risk of MS; however, 2 of these studies attributed their protective associations to reverse causality from reduced fertility and increased likelihood of miscarriage among women with latent MS. Five additional studies reported no association between pregnancy and risk of MS. A recent study investigating breastfeeding, ovulatory years, and risk of MS found evidence that cumulative duration of breastfeeding is associated with a decreased risk of MS. The authors suggest that breastfeeding duration confounds the association between parity/pregnancy and risk of MS and may explain previously reported conflicting findings.

Genes within the HLA complex contribute substantially to MS, with the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele conferring the largest known genetic risk for disease. Interactions between this allele and established environmental exposures such as tobacco smoking, Epstein-Barr Virus infection, and adolescent obesity have previously demonstrated large effect sizes. A recent GWAS identified approximately 200 non-HLA genetic variants associated with MS risk.

Previous research reported that protective associations between pregnancy and MS onset were attributable to reverse causality and that pregnancy was more likely among women with less severe disease or without latent disease. However, a registry-based study in Norway found that pregnancies among women with MS before symptom onset have birthweights and outcomes similar to those in women without MS. Furthermore, changes in counseling and availability of safer disease-modifying therapies and new diagnostic criteria that allow for earlier MS diagnosis have likely contributed to a recent reported increase in the rate of pregnancy among women with MS. Results from our sensitivity analyses did not indicate evidence for bias from latent disease. Furthermore, restricting analyses to cases reporting their first pregnancy within 5 years before symptom onset did not change our findings. Including data on non–live births in the pregnancy exposure did appear to move point estimates further from the null; however, data on non–live births were only available for KPNC and MS Sunshine cases and the CIs still contained the null.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^114bh7dM]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent study evaluated peripartum mental illness. It looked at large numbers of women who had given birth: N ​ = ​1745 women with MS; N ​ = ​5954 women with epilepsy; N ​ = ​4924 women with inflammatory bowel disease; N ​ = ​13,002 women with diabetes; and N ​ = ​869,227 comparator women. After adjustments, MS mothers had increased incidence of mental illness during the prenatal and postpartum periods vs. comparator mothers. Depression and anxiety were the most common issues. Any prevalent mental illness affected 42 ​% of MS mothers prenatally, and 50.3 ​% in the first year postpartum. An accompanying editorial emphasized the importance of acknowledging this, screening for it, and including it in counseling.

Counseling pertinent to MS pregnancy itself conveys that it is typically not a high risk pregnancy. Pregnancy is not associated with worse outcomes for relapsing MS. The vast majority of pregnant MS subjects have relapsing disease and minimal disability, with no negative impact of pregnancy on this cohort. Pregnancy in progressive and disabled MS is unusual, and whether there is an impact or not is not clear. Further studies are needed. Why MS disease activity goes down during pregnancy, but particularly in the third trimester, is also not clear. It is attributed to immune and hormonal changes that steadily rise during the pregnancy. Pregnancy overall shows a shift from T helper 1 to T helper 2 emphasis, with enhanced immune tolerance. Disease activity risk then increases in the 3 months postpartum, before returning to pre-pregnancy levels. The third trimester is associated with the highest hormone levels, that then abruptly drop postpartum. This is also true for certain immune factors. MS individuals can be counseled there is no increased risk for congenital malformations with MS. There is no increased risk of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. There are no limitations on delivery type, or the choice of anesthesia.

### Disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis in pregnancy: a systematic review [^114qwdng]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding safety of disease-modifying drug (DMD) use during pregnancy on perinatal and developmental outcomes in offspring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

A PubMed and EMBASE search up to February 2012 was conducted with a manual search of references from relevant articles. Selected studies were evaluated using internationally accepted criteria.

Results

Fifteen studies identified 761 interferon β-, 97 glatiramer acetate-, and 35 natalizumab-exposed pregnancies. Study quality ranged from poor to good; no study was rated excellent. Small sample sizes limited most studies. Compared with data for unexposed pregnancies, fair- to good-quality prospective cohort studies reported that interferon β exposure was associated with lower mean birth weight, shorter mean birth length, and preterm birth (< 37 weeks), but not low birth weight (< 2,500 g), cesarean delivery, congenital anomaly (including malformation), or spontaneous abortion. Fewer studies of fair quality were available for glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. Glatiramer acetate exposure was not associated with lower mean birth weight, congenital anomaly, preterm birth, or spontaneous abortion. Natalizumab exposure did not appear to be associated with shorter mean birth length, lower mean birth weight, or lower mean gestational age. No studies examined mitoxantrone or fingolimod exposure. One study of paternal DMD use during conception found no effect on gestational age or birth weight. Few studies examined longer-term developmental outcomes.

Conclusion

Further studies are needed to determine the potential risks associated with preconceptional and in utero DMD exposure in patients with MS. Discontinuation of DMDs before conception is still recommended.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^1119gAa4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual and reproductive health is severely affected by MS. Causes of sexual dysfunction are multifactorial and may be a consequence of neurologic dysfunction, inflammation, hormonal imbalances, and/or due to cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders, which are prevalent in MS. Clinical approaches in MS define primary sexual dysfunction as related to reproductive system dysfunction, secondary as related to disability due to motor impairment, fatigue, or associated bladder and bowel dysfunction, and tertiary as related to psychological and social factors. Sexual dysfunction and impaired reproductive health lead to increased burden of disease, with direct impact on physical health, mental health, and quality of life in MS. Despite the recognized value of sexual and reproductive health in MS, data on these domains are sparse, mostly based on cross-sectional or retrospective studies, and from periods before the availability of newer high-efficacy DMTs. Newer DMTs such as B-cell-depleting drugs have different safety profiles than predecessors, and their teratogenic potential is mostly unknown or investigated with ongoing monitoring. In addition, the longitudinal effects of common MS comorbidities on sexual and reproductive health in MS populations remain severely understudied.

The incidence of MS is greatest between the ages of 20 and 40 years, which coincides with the age period of optimal fertility, and, thus, family planning should be a part of standard MS care. Studies suggest female infertility may be more common in MS, but causes are not well understood, and recent findings are conflicting. Robust data on infertility in males with MS (MwMS) are lacking, but fewer pregnancies in women with MwMS partners compared to the general population have been reported. Similar to females with MS (FwMS), sexual dysfunction is very common in MwMS, with 50% experiencing ejaculatory or orgasmic dysfunction and 40–75% experiencing erectile dysfunction. Timely use of effective DMTs is increasingly encouraged to maintain remission, despite known and unknown teratogenic potential. Most FwMS discontinue DMT as part of pregnancy planning, though trends over the last decade show an increase in continued use. There are knowledge gaps in MS care regarding the effects of DMT use on sexual and reproductive health in MwMS.

Clinical relevance and objectives

Following recent reviews focused on female reproductive and sexual health in MS, we conducted a scoping review to evaluate the available literature on male reproductive and sexual health in MS. Such a comprehensive summary will facilitate current knowledge synthesis and identify existing gaps in the literature, which will guide next steps in enhancing MS clinical care and research related to male sexual and reproductive health in MS.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^115UgpnU]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data Availability

Data not provided in the article because of space limitations may be shared (anonymized) at the request of a qualified investigator for purposes of replicating procedures and results. Data will be made available up to 3 years after publication of this article. The authors will share the data with investigators whose proposal of data use has been approved by an independent review committee and with whom a data sharing agreement has been signed.

Demographic and Clinical Data Collection

Coinvestigators at each site extracted demographic, MS clinical data, and fertility data from the EMR and research databases. In cases where date was unknown (i.e. MS diagnosis date), the month was approximated as July and/or date as the 15th.

Demographic data collected were as follows: date of birth, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI, kg/m²), gravidity, parity, and comorbidities during FT.

MS clinical history included date of MS onset, MS type at FT cycle (CIS, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, primary progressive multiple sclerosis, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)at FT cycle (either listed or extrapolated by MS physician (E.G. R.B. M.H. T.B.K. and D.J.), when able), number of relapses in the year before assisted reproductive technology, date of most recent relapse, DMT within the prior 12 months, DMT stop date, date of first relapse post-FT, number of relapses within 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-FT. When available, reports of MRI of the brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine obtained in the year pre-FT and post-FT were reviewed for evidence of new T2 lesions or gadolinium-enhancing lesions.

DMT Presumed Biologic Activity

DMTs were categorized based on presumed biological activity during FT. Patients were considered to be on therapeutic DMT if they had received rituximab or ocrelizumab in the prior 6 months; dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, glatiramer acetate, or interferon treatment through the cycle. Natalizumab and S1P modulators were considered therapeutic only if they were continued throughout the cycle due to the risk of rebound relapse.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^114omFH2]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Men with MS

This article has focused on women with MS, but there are important issues for men with MS. For unclear reasons, they have a worse prognosis. This has implications for therapy, where DMT efficacy becomes more important. Men are less likely to develop MS, but are more likely to have the progressive from onset form of the disease. They seem more vulnerable to neurodegenerative injury. Men show poorer recovery from MS relapses, higher rates of brain volume loss, more cognitive disability, greater overall disability, and higher rates of transitioning to secondary progress MS. A very large study from the global MSBase registry evaluated N ​ = ​15,826 MS individuals. N ​ = ​14,753 had relapsing disease. In this cohort males worsened annually on EDSS significantly more than females (0.133 vs. 0.112, P ​ < ​0.01). Women had a decreased risk of developing secondary progressive MS (P ​ = ​0.001). In contrast progressive from onset MS did not show these sex-based differences.

In a scoping review of MS male sexual and reproductive health issues, sexual dysfunction was found to be common in men (35 ​%–72 ​%). Despite this, only a minority discussed sex with their treatment healthcare personnel. That translates to less likely to be treated for this symptom. Greater MS disability, as well as depression, were associated with sexual dysfunction. So was decreased quality of life. Erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido, were the two most common male issues.

There were 5 studies that evaluated male MS fertility. Results hinted at a possible relationship to infertility, but were far from conclusive. Decreased pregnancies were reported for partners of MS males. There are multiple possible factors to explain this of course. In a recent study, which included only 16 males, no fertility impact was appreciated. It was noted that there was very little information on DMTs and family planning for men with MS.

### Rituximab, MS, and pregnancy [^111EKeks]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

RTX is our treatment of choice in women with active MS who are struggling with infertility because it is unclear if or when they will become pregnant. This is why the proportion of RTX-treated women with infertility in our study is relatively high. This is also the most likely explanation for why we observed a relatively high rate of miscarriages because infertility and miscarriages are comanifestations of subfertility. Thus, it is not surprising that we found that a history of infertility was more common in women with miscarriages than those without. We believe it is probably not related to RTX exposure because the characteristics of RTX use did not differ between pregnancies ending in miscarriages and those advancing to the third trimester and beyond. It is also reassuring that many women with miscarriages went on to have successful pregnancies despite continued RTX treatment. Nevertheless, given the possible role of regulatory B-cell subpopulations in implantation and maintenance of successful pregnancies, more studies are needed to accurately assess this potential risk.

### Assessing the risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization in women with multiple sclerosis [^1163jBjo]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison of Subperiods: 2009–2014 vs 2015–2019

In the IVF group (n = 115), 76 women (66.1%) underwent at least 1 IVF procedure between 2009 and 2014 and 56 (48.7%) between 2015 and 2019. We included in both groups the 17 women (14.8%) who had IVF procedures in both subperiods.

Age at IVF was not different in the 2 subperiods (34.2 ± 3.9 years between 2009 and 2014 vs 34.6 ± 4.5 years between 2015 and 2019). However, MS duration at IVF was shorter in the 2015–2019 group (7.7 ± 4.1 years vs 8.3 ± 5.3 years). Moreover, women in this group were more often treated or still under treatment at IVF time (39.1% vs 25.0%). We observed several differences concerning treatments in the 2 subperiods (Table 4). Women who performed IVF between 2015 and 2019 started treatment at a younger age than those who performed IVF between 2009 and 2014 (28.7 ± 6.4 years vs 32.5 ± 6.7 years). Similarly, they started treatment earlier in the disease course (2.6 ± 3.2 years vs 6.1 ± 6.2 years). Accordingly, the part of disease duration under treatment was higher in the 2015–2019 period than in the 2009–2014 period (38.9% vs 24.4%). GnRH antagonists were more often used than GnRH agonists in the 2015–2019 period (65.5% vs 32.2%) (eFigure 2).

Table 4
Characteristics of the IVF Procedures Performed in 2009–2014 and 2015–2019

The risk of relapse after IVF was similar in the 2 subperiods (Figure 2, eTable 2). When we further divided women in the 2 subperiods (2009–2014 vs 2015–2019) in 2 subgroups (with/without treatment at IVF time) (Figure 3), we observed a decline in the ARR in all subgroups during pregnancy, followed by a postpregnancy increase. This increase was less pronounced among women under treatment.

### Investigating the long-term effect of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosis using causal inference [^1146EV18]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The question of the long-term safety of pregnancy is a major concern in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but its study is biased by reverse causation (women with higher disability are less likely to experience pregnancy). Using a causal inference approach, we aimed to estimate the unbiased long-term effects of pregnancy on disability and relapse risk in patients with MS and secondarily the short-term effects (during the perpartum and postpartum years) and delayed effects (occurring beyond 1 year after delivery).

Methods

We conducted an observational cohort study with data from patients with MS followed in the Observatoire Français de la Sclérose en Plaques registry between 1990 and 2020. We included female patients with MS aged 18–45 years at MS onset, clinically followed up for more than 2 years, and with ≥ 3 Expanded Disease Status Scale (EDSS) measurements. Outcomes were the mean EDSS score at the end of follow-up and the annual probability of relapse during follow-up. Counterfactual outcomes were predicted using the longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimator in the entire study population. The patients exposed to at least 1 pregnancy during their follow-up were compared with the counterfactual situation in which, contrary to what was observed, they would not have been exposed to any pregnancy. Short-term and delayed effects were analyzed from the first pregnancy of early-exposed patients (who experienced it during their first 3 years of follow-up).

Results

We included 9,100 patients, with a median follow-up duration of 7.8 years, of whom 2,125 (23.4%) patients were exposed to at least 1 pregnancy. Pregnancy had no significant long-term causal effect on the mean EDSS score at 9 years (causal mean difference [95% CI] = 0.00 [-0.16 to 0.15]) or on the annual probability of relapse (causal risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.95 [0.93–1.38]). For the 1,253 early-exposed patients, pregnancy significantly decreased the probability of relapse during the perpartum year and significantly increased it during the postpartum year, but no significant delayed effect was found on the EDSS and relapse rate.

Discussion

Using a causal inference approach, we found no evidence of significantly deleterious or beneficial long-term effects of pregnancy on disability. The beneficial effects found in other studies were probably related to a reverse causation bias.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^115wit1v]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may seek fertility treatment (FT)-including in vitro fertilization (IVF). Variable relapse risk after IVF has been reported in small historical cohorts, with more recent studies suggesting no change in annualized relapse rate (ARR). The objective of this study was to evaluate ARR 12 months pre-FT and 3 months post-FT in a multicenter cohort and identify factors associated with an increased risk of relapse.

Methods

Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS aged 18–45 years with at least 1 FT from January 1, 2010, to October 14, 2021, were retrospectively identified at 4 large academic MS centers. The exposed period of 3 months after FT was compared with the unexposed period of 12 months before FT. FTs included controlled ovarian stimulation followed by fresh embryo transfer (COS-ET), COS alone, embryo transfer (ET) alone, and oral ovulation induction (OI). The Wilcoxon signed rank test and mixed Poisson regression models with random effects were used to compare ARR pre-FT vs post-FT, with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI reported.

Results

One hundred twenty-four FT cycles among 65 patients with MS (n = 56) or CIS (n = 9) were included: 61 COS-ET, 19 COS alone, 30 ET alone, and 14 OI. The mean age at FT was 36.5 ± 3.8 years, and the mean disease duration was 8.2 ± 5.0 years. Across 80 cycles with COS, only 5 relapses occurred among 4 unique patients within 3 months of treatment. The mean ARR after COS and before was not different (0.26 vs 0.25, p = 0.37), and the IRR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.52–1.76, p = 0.88). No cycles with therapeutic disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during COS had 3 months relapse (ARR 0 post-COS vs 0.18 pre-COS, p = 0.02, n = 34). Relapse rates did not vary by COS protocol. Among COS-ET cycles that achieved pregnancy (n = 43), ARR decreased from 0.26 to 0.09 (p = 0.04) within the first trimester of pregnancy. There were no relapses 3 months after ET alone and 1 relapse after OI.

Discussion

In this modern multicenter cohort of patients with MS undergoing diverse FTs, which included 43% on DMTs, we did not observe an elevated relapse risk after FT.

### Role of gender in multiple sclerosis: clinical effects and potential molecular mechanisms [^1163THCn]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is more prevalent in females than males, and this female predominance is increasing as time goes by. Additionally, gender appears to play critical roles in development, progression and treatment of MS, and is therefore an aspect that should always be considered in the design and interpretation of research and clinical trials for MS. In this review, factors that could potentially explain the gender-biased observations in MS are discussed. These include sex-specific differences between the male and female immune systems and nervous systems, genetic and epigenetic or environmental-related effects, the effects of gonadal hormones, and materno-fetal interactions.

### An overview of pregnancy-related issues in patients with multiple sclerosis [^117785ci]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) is not generally considered high risk, there are some associated therapeutic challenges. The pregnancy-associated reduction in the relapse rate, especially in the third trimester, is followed by a sharp increase in the first few months postpartum. Nevertheless, retrospective evidence for pregnant women with and without MS followed for up to 10 years indicates that pregnancy has no perceptible effect on long-term disease course or disability progression. Likewise, MS has no apparent effects on the pregnancy course or fetal outcomes. All disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have potential adverse effects on fertility and pregnancy outcomes, but the level of risk varies amongst agents. There is some support for continued use of interferon-β and glatiramer acetate throughout pregnancy to reduce the risk of relapse. Use of DMTs during breastfeeding is best avoided if possible. Close evaluation of drug safety information is imperative when managing women with MS who are pregnant or wish to become pregnant. Decision-making should be a shared experience between patient and physician, and the approach must be individualized for each patient.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^11376yhW]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may seek fertility treatment (FT) — including in vitro fertilization (IVF). Variable relapse risk after IVF has been reported in small historical cohorts, with more recent studies suggesting no change in annualized relapse rate (ARR). The objective of this study was to evaluate ARR 12 months pre-FT and 3 months post-FT in a multicenter cohort and identify factors associated with an increased risk of relapse.

There were no relapses 3 months after ET alone and 1 relapse after OI.

Discussion

In this modern multicenter cohort of patients with MS undergoing diverse FTs, which included 43% on DMTs, we did not observe an elevated relapse risk after FT.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^113Gfrmg]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fertility and assisted reproductive technology

During reproductive aging there is a progressive reduction in oocytes/follicles, particularly marked by age 37–38 years. Smoking, as well as oral contraceptives, can also negatively impact ovarian reserve markers (anti- Müllerian hormone, antral follicle count). The only independent prediction factor for fertility is age. In a recent Israeli study, prevalence of infertility and fertility treatment did not differ in MS vs. the general population. It is accepted that MS does not meaningfully affect fertility. However, there is a tendency to delay pregnancy for newly diagnosed women, who would initially be encouraged to start an MS therapy to control their newly diagnosed disease. In a recent large administrative database, a greater proportion of MS women report infertility vs. those without MS (8.5 ​% vs. 8.1 ​%, P ​ = ​0.0006). This was particularly in those aged 18–34 years, and above age 42 years. Emerging data has raised a concern about MS fertility, with decreased ovarian reserve and greater prevalence of immune-mediated thyroid disease. Classically a diagnosis of infertility requires conception failure over 12 months in women younger than age 35, and over 6 months in those older than 35 years. However MS individuals should probably be referred to a fertility expert after 6 months of failing to conceive. The fertility issue will need to be sorted out in future studies.

### Family planning considerations in people with multiple sclerosis [^113XCE5j]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is often diagnosed in patients who are planning on having children. Although multiple sclerosis does not negatively influence most pregnancy outcomes, less is known regarding the effects of fetal exposure to novel disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The withdrawal of some DMTs during pregnancy can modify the natural history of multiple sclerosis, resulting in a substantial risk of pregnancy-related relapse and disability. Drug labels are typically restrictive and favour fetal safety over maternal safety. Emerging data reporting outcomes in neonates exposed to DMTs in utero and through breastfeeding will allow for more careful and individualised treatment decisions. This emerging research is particularly important to guide decision making in women with high disease activity or who are treated with DMTs associated with risk of discontinuation rebound. As increasing data are generated in this field, periodic updates will be required to provide the most up to date guidance on how best to achieve multiple sclerosis stability during pregnancy and post partum, balanced with fetal and newborn safety.

### Sex-related factors in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression [^111cXiNu]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers. Clinical observations suggest that the study of sex differences might provide important insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and progression of the disease in patients. MS occurs more frequently in women than in men, indicating that sex-related factors have an effect on an individual's susceptibility to developing the condition. These factors include hormonal, genetic and environmental influences, as well as gene-environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms. Interestingly, women do not have a poorer prognosis than men with MS despite a higher incidence of the disease and more-robust immune responses, which suggests a mechanism of resilience. Furthermore, the state of pregnancy has a substantial effect on disease activity, characterized by a reduction in relapse rates during the third trimester but an increased relapse rate in the postpartum period. However, pregnancy has little effect on long-term disability in women with MS. The unravelling of the mechanisms underlying these clinical observations in the laboratory and application of the results to the clinical setting is a unique and potentially fruitful strategy to develop novel therapeutic approaches for MS.

### Do estroprogestinic hormones protect against chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea in multiple sclerosis? [^1174vBue]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

This commentary discusses a paper by Cocco et al. that addresses the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with the drug mitoxantrone in women of childbearing age. This is a very important issue, as mitoxantrone is thought to be associated with the development of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) in women with MS. CIA is a condition characterized by cessation of menstrual bleeding that can be associated with either temporary or permanent infertility. In the study, a clear cumulative dose effect of mitoxantrone on the development of CIA was demonstrated. The risk of CIA was also shown to increase with age. However, the incidence of CIA was lower in women who took estroprogestinic hormones concurrently with mitoxantrone. The authors concluded that mitoxantrone may markedly affect reproductive capacity in women with MS and that estroprogestinic drugs should be administered alongside mitoxantrone to guard against these possible effects. The potential for estroprogestinic drugs to guard against CIA is intriguing and warrants further investigation.

### Association of pregnancy with the onset of clinically isolated syndrome… [^113xVrR9]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A large burden of multiple sclerosis is found among women of childbearing age because MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and women are 3 times more likely than men to develop MS. 1 Since the pivotal Pregnancy in Multiple Sclerosis study in 1998, 2 it has been well documented that MS relapses are reduced during pregnancy, with a small proportion of women being at risk of rebound relapses in the postpartum period. 3–5 Consensus is lacking, however, on the implications of pregnancy before the onset of MS. Most past reports6, 7, 9–16, 19 used MS, rather than clinically isolated syndrome, as the end point. Using CIS as an end point is advantageous in decreasing the inherent problem of reverse causality when exploring this association. In addition, most of the previous research6, 8–10, 12–17 focused on whether pregnancy reduced the risk of MS, and only a few studies7, 18, 19 explored whether pregnancy delayed MS onset.

We also performed an exploratory analysis using time to MS onset as the end point. We found a trend for women with previous pregnancies and childbirths to have a later onset of MS compared with women who had never been pregnant and those who had never given birth, although this association was not as strong as the association for CIS. These findings highlight the importance of using CIS as the outcome. Although this area is understudied, recent data show, for example, that numerous DNA methylation changes occur by the 10th week of pregnancy. 40 Therefore, the duration of the pregnancy may be less important than the occurrence of the pregnancy. In addition, a recent study of patients with relapsing-remitting MS found that estrogens promote a more tolerogenic T-cell repertoire in pregnancy through epigenetic mechanisms. 41 Epigenetic changes that occur during pregnancy may persist beyond the pregnancy itself and for several years.

The delayed and reduced pregnancy rates reported are likely associated with the increasing burden of MS observed among women of childbearing age. This study has several limitations. First, we cannot completely eliminate the problem of reverse causality, given that evidence suggests that CIS and MS are associated with a prodrome or premorbid symptoms. 37 We have tried to minimize reverse causality by using CIS rather than MS as the end point, excluding treated patients with CIS, and using pregnancy as a time-dependent variable.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^113iZkZL]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy is the best studied sex-based state in MS. It has a major impact on MS, and requires updated and ongoing counseling. This involves family planning, contraception, and direct pregnancy risk and management issues.

Family planning

Family planning is a key component in managing MS, particularly for subjects of reproductive age. MS impacts family planning and decision-making. In one study people with MS were more likely to not have children; 56 ​% reported that their disease impacted their decision making. The 2018 AAN Practice Guidelines on use of MS disease modifying therapies (DMTs) state that clinicians need to monitor reproductive plans of women with MS, and counsel on reproductive risks. The AAN guidelines also indicate that pregnancy and DMT use should be discussed. Clinicians were asked to counsel women to stop their DMT before conception for planned pregnancies, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighed the DMT risk. This recommendation has gotten much more liberal. Several MS DMTs can be taken without a washout period, and maintained until pregnancy is achieved. This is discussed below. Typically a DMT is discontinued once an unplanned pregnancy is recognized (unless MS activity risk is unacceptable). Usually a DMT is not initiated during pregnancy, unless risk of disease activity outweighs the DMT risk.

### Fecundity in women with multiple sclerosis: an observational mono-centric study [^111mzb5G]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease mostly affecting women of childbearing age. When counseling MS patients, many questions arise on the reciprocal influence of MS and pregnancy. However, little is known on the impact of MS and its treatments on the time to pregnancy. The objective was to evaluate fecundity (pregnancy and time to pregnancy) in a French cohort of MS women. One hundred and fifteen women with MS were included consecutively in this observational retrospective study. Pregnancy and time to pregnancy were collected using self-questionnaires. Among the 115 patients, 216 pregnancies (from 84 women) were reported. Mean time to pregnancy, which was available for 124 of these pregnancies, was 8.57 months when pregnancy occurred before MS onset, and 7.53 months after MS onset. Among the 95 patients who had a parental project, 2.27 spontaneous pregnancies per woman were recorded. The mean number of children per woman with MS was 1.37. Spontaneous pregnancies per woman and time to pregnancy were not different from the general French population. However, despite a normal fecundity, the mean number of children per woman with MS (1.37) was lower than in the general French population (1.99).

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^115kQe8b]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate which demographic, clinical, and protocol-specific variables might be associated with elevated risk of relapses. For this analysis, our outcome was any relapse within 3 months and was limited to the first cycle. Logistic regression models assessed individual factors that were associated with increased odds of relapse within 3 months. Demographic variables were categorized dichotomously as follows: age (older than or younger than 37 years), race (White/Asian vs Black/Hispanic), BMI (greater than or less than 25 kg/m²), and parity. Covariates were chosen based on those identified as relevant in the literature on MS activity after pregnancy and FT. Age older than or younger than 37 years was based on the mean age of 36.5 years in the study group. The 6 Asian patients were grouped with the White patients because in our clinical experience, the disparities in MS outcomes noted for Black and Hispanic patients are not as marked in Asian American patients. MS disease-specific variables included disease type, new T2 lesions in prior year, and current DMT treatment (within past 12 months). Protocol-specific factors included FT protocol (COS-ET, COS only, ET only, and OI), COS protocol (GnRH agonist vs GnRH antagonist), estradiol level if known, number of stimulations within 3-month cycle, and FT outcome (pregnant, not pregnant, and no egg transfer/egg banking).

All statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical software (version 4.1.2). Statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^113UZQTm]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome was ARR in the 3 months post-FT compared with that in the 12 months before FT, with primary FT cycles of interest involving COS (COS-ET, COS only). The 3-month time frame after FT was selected because the 12-month timeframe could be confounded by other factors such as pregnancy occurrence, DMT resumption, or additional FT cycles. ARR is defined as the total number of relapses divided by the total person-time at risk of relapse. The Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples was used to compare median ARR 12 months before 3 months post–COS ± ET. This accounts for a paired sample within a cycle but does not account for clustering within patients across cycles.

To account for repeated measures of an individual over multiple cycles, generalized linear mixed effects models with Poisson distribution that included a fixed effect for time and random intercept for patients were used to assess the ARR 3 months after vs 12 months before FT. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for ARR 3 months post-FT compared with that 12 months pre-FT informs risk direction. If IRR is < 1, the rate of relapse was lower 3 months after FT. If IRR is > 1, the rate was higher 3 months after FT. If IRR is 1 or close to 1, there was no difference. Analyses were performed in the overall study population and stratified by demographic, clinical, and protocol-specific subgroups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess the impact of relapse after the first cycle on future FTs.

### Multiple sclerosis: clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^111JE825]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The disease affects more women than men and often is diagnosed during a woman's childbearing years. Typical clinical presentations of the disease are extensive and variable, with symptoms that include dysregulated mood, fatigue, vision problems, weakness, tremor, imbalance, abnormal sensations, bladder dysfunction, and heat sensitivity. If a woman aged 15–50 years experiences these neurologic symptoms in isolation or combination, and the symptoms are not explained by other underlying medical conditions, MS should be suspected. Multiple sclerosis can be divided into four clinical subtypes: 1) relapsing-remitting MS, 2) secondary progressive MS, 3) primary progressive MS, and 4) clinically isolated syndrome. Relapsing-remitting MS at the time of onset is the most common form and accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of MS. Relapsing-remitting MS does not affect life expectancy. However, because of the neurodegenerative and progressive course of the disease, patients accumulate physical and cognitive disabilities over time that result in impaired ability to work, increased financial burden, and slightly increased mortality. A variety of possible risk and prognostic indicators have been identified that may predict the course of disease, particularly the extent of relapses and disability. Multiple sclerosis currently is incurable, but many disease-modifying therapies are available that can reduce the frequency of clinically evident exacerbations and accumulation of disease burden as defined by the number of lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging. The choice of disease-modifying therapies, contraception use, and treatment of symptoms should be individualized based on age at onset and disease activity and, during pregnancy, the gestational age. Proactive management of MS across the woman's life cycle reduces morbidity, improves maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and increases quality-of life-measures for patients and their families.

### Chronic diseases in male veterans with multiple sclerosis… [^1174gvpY]. CDC (2012). Low credibility.

Widowed male veterans with MS were more than 2. 5 times as likely to have hypertension as male veterans with MS who were currently married. The odds of having hypertension among male veterans with MS were higher with comorbid diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, prior stroke, and CHD, as well as for chronic drinkers. Male veterans with MS who were non-Hispanic black or African American, lived in the Midwest, or had a prior stroke had lower odds for hypercholesterolemia. The odds for hypercholesterolemia among male veterans with MS were higher with comorbid diabetes, hypertension, and CHD. Among male veterans with MS, the odds for having a stroke were lower with comorbid hypercholesterolemia but higher with concurrent asthma, CHD, diabetes, and hypertension. Older age at MS diagnosis was marginally associated with a higher risk of stroke.

Hypertension Male veterans with MS who were chronic drinkers had increased odds of having hypertension, a relationship that has been well documented in the general population. Consistent with general medical literature, odds for hypertension in this study were higher with comorbid diabetes, CHD, hyperlipidemia, and stroke. We found that widowed male veterans with MS were 2. 5 times as likely to have hypertension as their counterparts who were married. Becoming widowed may alter peoples' patterns of interaction in the health care system and informal care practices; the associated negative health risks are elevated and long-term for widowed men. Not being married has been associated with poor adherence to taking hypertension medication.

Furthermore, hypertension may be independently associated with an increased risk of ambulatory disability in people with MS, making it imperative to address to preserve function in this group. Stroke People with MS may have a higher risk of stroke than people who do not have MS. Although the absolute value for stroke prevalence in our study was not alarming, disparities were evident across age groups in male veterans with MS compared with both non-MS groups. Comparable to general medical literature, odds of stroke were higher for people with diabetes, CHD, and hypertension.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^114eQGnY]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

FT Data Collection

Data included FT type (vide infra), date of gonadotropin start (if COS) and/or date of ET, outcome of cycle (not pregnant, biochemical, ectopic, pregnant, no ET performed), outcome of pregnancy (spontaneous abortion, therapeutic abortion, live birth), date of pregnancy end, gestational age, and when available, baseline anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and peak estradiol during stimulation.

FT Types

To evaluate the impact on MS relapse rate, FTs were divided as follows based on presumed impact on hormonal levels (Figure 1):
COS-ET: COS with egg retrieval followed by fresh ET, commonly referred to as IVF. During COS, the ovaries are stimulated with exogenous gonadotropins to produce multiple follicles, frequently resulting in estradiol levels greater than 10 times those of a typical menstrual cycle.
COS: COS without fresh ET. This may occur when there are no embryos suitable for transfer or when the intent is to cryopreserve eggs or embryos for future use. As with COS-ET, estradiol levels are typically markedly elevated.
ET: ET without COS, as when using embryos derived from donor oocytes or cryopreserved autologous oocytes or embryos. Standard ET protocols either use the patient's natural menstrual cycle or hormonal preparations that closely approximate the patient's natural menstrual cycle, so estradiol levels are typically not markedly elevated. Rarely, GnRH agonists may be used with ET.
OI: Oral OI (letrozole/clomiphene) with or without IUI. Letrozole and clomiphene exert antiestrogenic effects, leading to increased follicle-stimulating hormone release and ovarian stimulation. Estradiol levels may be elevated but are typically lower than those among gonadotropin COS cycles.

MS = multiple sclerosis.

COS Subtypes

COS protocols were categorized according to their likely hormonal impact. The patient's endogenous ovulatory surge is prevented during the cycle using a GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist. For patients with limited response to typical regimens, other protocols may be used, including administration of small doses of GnRH agonist throughout the stimulation ("flare" or "microdose flare" protocols), estrogen patch plus GnRH antagonist ("estrogen-priming" protocol), or small doses of gonadotropins ("mini stim").

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^111u671n]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fertility

Four cohort studies (3 retrospective and 1 prospective) and a case–control study were focused on fertility as the main topic (Table 3). The prospective cohort study was the smallest (32 participants), but included longitudinal serum sex hormone profiles and sperm analysis. It demonstrated no changes in measured hormonal or sperm parameters over a 12-month follow-up period in those treated with natalizumab or ocrelizumab. The larger retrospective study, based on the pooled data from Danish national registries for infertility and multiple sclerosis (24,011 with male-factor infertility, 49 MwMS), showed that male infertility was associated with a presence of diagnosis of MS (odds ratio 1.6), but not with subsequent new diagnosis of MS. In a similar manner, a Swedish case–control study (497 MwMS and 1081 controls) showed there was an association between MS diagnosis in men and being childless for the 5 years preceding index MS clinical symptom with an odds ratio 0.6 for a diagnosis of MS for those with children when compared to being childless. A prior Danish national retrospective cohort based on a sample of 2,240,000 men (3426 MwMS) showed a reduced risk of MS diagnosis in men who had a child, with more children further decreasing the risk of MS diagnosis. However, these case–control studies might reflect changes in sexual behaviors that might lead to conception in the prodromal period for MS. Finally, in a cohort treated with mitoxantrone (238 participants, 80 MwMS), there were no differences in number of pregnancies or rates of abortion or miscarriages between FwMS and partners of MwMS.

### Use of disease-modifying drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding [^11472Thf]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The fact that multiple sclerosis (MS) predominantly affects women has been recognized for many years. As the age at diagnosis is decreasing, and treatment options are becoming more complex, increasing numbers of women are facing decisions about the use of disease modifying therapy (DMT) in and around pregnancy.

Recent Findings

New data are rapidly becoming available, particularly regarding the safety of therapies in both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Effective treatment and suppression of relapses is key to ensuring good outcomes in the longer term for the woman, however this must be balanced against individual risk of relapse and risks to the fetus. Women should be advised that it is possible to breastfeed while taking selected DMT.

Summary

In this review, we discuss evidence surrounding the safety of DMTs in both pregnancy and breastfeeding, and use this knowledge to suggest approaches to pregnancy and family planning in women with MS.

Overall, 115 women and 175/199 IVFs (88.0%) could be matched. The remaining 24 IVFs were not matched because the selected control no longer met the criteria for subsequent IVFs. As expected, the matching variables were similar in the control group (n = 115) and IVF group (Table 2). However, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score at the index date was higher in the control group than the IVF group (2.1 ± 2.1 vs 1.3 ± 1.5) and the relapse rate in the previous year was also higher (8.0% vs 5.1%).

Table 2
Characteristics of the Study Population and Control Group

Intergroup Analysis

The ARR in the 3 months following index date was similar in the IVF group and the control group (0.06 vs 0.06) (Figure 1), whatever the stimulation protocol. The relapse rate after the index date was similar when comparing treated women in the IVF group (0.04) with those in the control group (0.04). Among untreated women, the relapse rate was also comparable between the IVF group (0.07) and the control group (0.08). Given the higher pregnancy rate in the IVF group, due to IVF and ovarian stimulation, we conducted a subanalysis on nonpregnant women only, confirming similar results with a nonsignificant p value of 0.857 and an ARR of 0.07 in the IVF group vs 0.08 in the control group.

Figure 1
Relapse Incidence Rates and Incidence Rate Ratios

In the 3 months following index date, 12 women in the IVF group (6.9%) and 10 women (5.7%) in the control group experienced at least 1 relapse (p = 0.8). The multivariate logistic regression analysis also did not find any significant difference (p = 0.6) in the percentages of women experiencing a relapse between groups, in agreement with the ARR data.

### Pregnancy does not modify the risk of MS in genetically susceptible women [^1133qsUC]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

MS is a demyelinating autoimmune disease of the CNS with both environmental and genetic risk factors. This progressive disease results in significant disability and decreased quality of life.MS is more prevalent among females than males, and symptoms typically emerge during child-bearing ages, often soon after pregnancy. This has led many to hypothesize that female-specific exposures, such as those related to reproduction, pregnancy, and lactation, have a role in MS. Pregnancy appears to have short-term beneficial effects on existing MS symptoms, but there is no agreement in the scientific literature about the effect of pregnancy on MS risk in general or among women with genetic susceptibility to MS.

Gene-environment (G × E) interactions, for which the effect of an environmental exposure is modified by specific genotype(s), are believed to contribute substantially to complex disease risk, and discovery of these interactions can identify subgroups with higher risk of disease. Studies of pregnancy and MS risk have yielded conflicting results; however, no studies, to date, have investigated interaction between pregnancy and genetic susceptibility for risk of MS.

We used case-only G × E methods to evaluate interaction between pregnancy before symptom onset and known genetic risk factors for MS, including HLA-DRB1*15:01. Study participants included 2,497 White individuals from 4 established MS cohorts based in California, Sweden, and Norway. Analyses were conducted separately within each cohort and then combined with meta-analytic methods. A separate cohort of females without MS was used to test the case-only G × E independence assumption.

### Increase in multiple sclerosis activity after assisted reproduction technology [^113CSQ2w]. Annals of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate risk of exacerbations in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART) infertility treatment.

Methods

Sixteen patients with relapsing-remitting MS subjected to 26 ART treatment cycles receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone were studied prospectively. The baseline study period encompassed 12 months prior to the first cycle and 9 months after final ART cycle. Neurological examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and immunology testing were conducted every 3 months. Anti-myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody production, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-γ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β secretion by myelin basic protein- and MOG-peptide-specific T cells, as well as ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were studied using enzyme-linked immunospot. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by PBMCs was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

ART was associated with a 7-fold increase in risk of MS exacerbation, and a 9-fold increase in risk of enhanced disease activity on MRI. Worsening was associated with higher number of cells producing IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TGF-β, as well as increased VEGF production by CD4(+) T cells and CXCL-12 plasma levels, all GnRH-mediated effects. A rise in 17-β estradiol production associated with ART increased anti-MOG antibody titers, as well as B-cell survival factor BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 levels from purified CD19(+) B cells. Finally, ART facilitated PBMC transmigration across an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, an effect mediated by IL-8, VEGF, and CXCL-12.

Interpretation

Results indicate a significant increase in MS disease activity in patients receiving ART, a risk that neurologists should be aware of. Reproductive hormones appear to exert an important role in regulating immune responses during the course of autoimmune diseases.

### Conceiving complexity: biological mechanisms underpinning the lasting effect of pregnancy on multiple sclerosis outcomes [^115L8y23]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease with the highest incidence in women of childbearing age. The effect of pregnancy on disease activity and progression is a primary concern for women with MS and their clinical teams. It is well established that inflammatory disease activity is naturally suppressed during pregnancy, followed by an increase postpartum. However, the long-term effect of pregnancy on disease progression is less understood. Having had a pregnancy before MS onset has been associated with an older age at first demyelinating event, an average delay of 3.4 years. After MS onset, there is conflicting evidence about the impact of pregnancy on long-term outcomes. The study with the longest follow-up to date showed that pregnancy was associated with a 0.36-point lower disability score after 10-years of disease in 1830 women. Understanding the biological mechanism by which pregnancy induces long-term beneficial effects on MS outcomes could provide mechanistic insights into the elusive determinants of secondary progression. Here, we review potential biological processes underlying this effect, including evidence that acute sex hormone exposure induces lasting changes to neurobiological and DNA methylation patterns, and how sustained methylation changes in immune cells can alter immune composition and function long-term.

### Multiple sclerosis and pregnancy in the 'treatment era' [^111wavX3]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The influence of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been controversial; until the end of 1990s, women with MS were discouraged from having children owing to a biased belief that pregnancy would worsen the disease course. Since the first large prospective study in 1998, counselling of women with MS has changed radically, and many patients have attained their desire of motherhood. Although many disease-modifying drugs have come to market in the past two decades, when used during pregnancy and lactation, their beneficial effects on the course of MS have to be balanced with fears concerning potential risks to the fetus or child. The wealth of treatment options and the various associated risks have created a growing need for counselling on family planning for women with MS. Most importantly, such counselling should address the concerns that women with MS might have regarding pregnancy. Second, as soon as a woman starts considering pregnancy, a treatment plan should be established. This plan needs to weigh the risk posed to the fetus by potentially harmful drug exposure, and the risk to the mother from a reappearance of disease activity. Finally, breastfeeding and treatment options after delivery should be discussed to outline the options for prevention of postpartum relapses, and the possible resumption of disease-modifying drugs.

### Relapse activity after assisted reproductive technology treatments in women with multiple sclerosis: a nationwide cohort study in Denmark [^116ToHZW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence on relapse activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) after assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment differs. We investigated whether relapse activity increased after ART initiation.

Methods

Women with RRMS from the Danish MS Registry who underwent ART treatment from 1995 to 2018 were eligible. The annualised relapse rate (ARR) and corresponding 95%CI at 3 and 9months post-ART initiation versus 12 months pre-ART were investigated using a negative binomial regression model. Analyses were stratified for live births within 12 months post-ART and disease-modifying therapy (DMT) use pre-ART. Clinical and demographic factors associated with relapse risk were identified.

Results

At ART initiation, 162women, median age 33 years (IQR: 30–37), median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 1.5 (IQR: 1.0–2.5) were included; 55 (34.0%) were exposed to DMT. 27 relapses were recorded (ARR (95%CI) 0.17 (0.11 to 0.26)) at 12 months pre-ART; 7 relapses and 0.17 (0.08 to 0.36) at 3months post-ART initiation, and 16 relapses and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.23) at 9months post-ART initiation. When stratified by ART outcomes, relapse counts in subgroups became small. Women continuing DMT at ART initiation showed a statistically non-significant increase in ARR at 3months post-ART.

Conclusions

Women with RRMS in Denmark did not, on average, have increased relapse activity at 3 and 9months post-ART initiation compared with 12 months pre-ART. Women with disease activity pre-ART initiation may have a potentially elevated relapse risk post-ART.

### Pregnancy and multiple sclerosis: clinical effects across the lifespan [^1155wY7G]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly diagnosed in women of childbearing age. Having a greater understanding of the effects of pregnancy on the course of MS will lead to improved family-planning counselling for women. We found well-established evidence for a protective effect of pregnancy on relapse occurrence in historical cohorts. More recent studies suggest that the protective effect of pregnancy against relapse may be lost in those women with more active disease treated with high efficacy therapies. Furthermore, a strong body of evidence suggests that gravidity after diagnosis of MS does not lead to worse long-term outcomes. More contentious however, is whether pregnancy can delay a first episode of demyelination or a confirmed diagnosis of MS. This review provides a detailed analysis of the literature relating to the clinical effects of pregnancy on MS outcomes across a woman's reproductive lifespan.

### De-escalating and discontinuing disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^115sSu9X]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The development of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been highly successful in recent decades. It is now widely accepted that early initiation of DMTs after disease onset is associated with a better long-term prognosis. However, the question of when and how to de-escalate or discontinue DMTs remains open and critical.

This topic was discussed during an international focused workshop organized by the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in 2023. The aim was to review the current evidence on the rationale for, and the potential pitfalls of, treatment de-escalation in MS. Several clinical scenarios emerged, mainly driven by a change in the benefit-risk ratio of DMTs over the course of the disease and with ageing. The workshop also addressed the issue of de-escalation by the type of DMT used and in specific situations, including pregnancy and paediatric onset MS. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for selecting appropriate patients, defining de-escalation and monitoring modalities and outlining unmet needs in this field.

### Assessing the risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization in women with multiple sclerosis [^116HYEB9]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Older studies reported an increased risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization (IVF) in women with multiple sclerosis (MS), which has not been confirmed by more recent works. All these studies had several limitations, such as small sample sizes, absence of a control population, or lack of neurologic validation of the relapses. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of relapse after IVF in women with MS.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included all women with MS who underwent IVF between 2009 and 2019 and a control group of women with MS who did not undergo IVF matched on age, MS duration, number of relapses, and MS-specific treatments in the previous year. Data on MS (disease duration, treatments, and relapses) were from the French MS Registry (OFSEP), whereas data on IVF (number of procedures, stimulation protocol type, and outcomes) were from the French national health insurance database. For this, the 2 databases were linked by indirect matching.

Results

In total, 115 women with MS underwent 199 IVF procedures (mean age at first IVF: 33.9 ± 4.0 years; 45.2% had ≥ 2 IVF procedures), and 175 IVFs (88.0%) could be matched to specific patients. The risk of relapse in the 3 months after index date was the same in both IVF group and control group (0.06 relapse per patient-year), as confirmed also by the before-after analysis in the IVF group (0.06 vs 0.08).

Discussion

This study, using a 10-year clinical and administrative dataset, did not find any increased risk of relapse after IVF. The maintenance of disease-modifying therapies until IVF was a determining factor in reducing the risk of relapse.

### Fertility, pregnancy and childbirth in women with multiple sclerosis: a population-based study from 2018 to 2020 [^113nNvHB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to evaluate whether fertility, pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding have been actually improving in women with multiple sclerosis (MS), compared with general population, and in relation to treatment features.

Methods

We included 2018–2020 population-level healthcare data on women with MS living in the Campania region (Italy). Fertility, pregnancy and delivery outcomes were obtained from Certificate of Delivery Assistance; breastfeeding was collected up to 6 months after delivery by trained personnel.

Results

Out of 2748women with MS in childbearing age, 151women delivered 156 babies. Fertility rate was 0.58 live births per woman with MS, compared with 1.29 in Campania region and 1.25 in Italy. Disease-modifying treatment (DMT) continuation during pregnancy was associated with lower birth weight (coeff -107.09; 95% CI -207.91 to -6.26; p = 0.03). Exposure to DMTs with unknown/negative effects on pregnancy was associated with birth defects (OR 8.88; 95% CI 1.35 to 58.41; p = 0.02). Birth defects occurred in pregnancies exposed to dimethyl fumarate (2/21 exposed pregnancies), fingolimod (1/11 exposed pregnancies) and natalizumab (2/30 exposed pregnancies). After delivery, 18.8% ofwomen with MS were escalated of DMT efficacy, while 50.7% started on same/similar-efficacy DMTs, and 30.5% did not receive DMT. The probability of breastfeeding was higher in women who were treated with breastfeeding-safe DMTs (OR 5.57; 95% CI 1.09 to 28.55; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Fertility rate in women with MS remains below the general population. Family planning and subsequent DMT decisions should aim to achieve successful pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding outcomes, while controlling disease activity.

### Pregnancy rates and outcomes in women with and without MS in the United States [^113FZf9p]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Women with MS tended to be somewhat older than the general population at the time of pregnancy diagnosis. This is consistent with findings in other previously published data. The decision to start or enlarge a family can be complicated by chronic conditions such as MS. Concerns about the health of a child, societal attitudes, unpredictability of neurologic symptoms during or after pregnancy, and issues regarding the appropriate time to discontinue disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) in order to become pregnant can all delay pregnancy in women with MS. A conception delay could be related to the need to stabilize a newly diagnosed patient before conception attempts. In addition, there is some evidence of a possible decrease in fertility in women with MS, although no final conclusions can be made on this subject.

Both groups of patients had higher rates of labor and delivery complications than generally reported in the literature. Compared with women without MS and a live birth, women with MS and a live birth in the current study were significantly more likely to have claims for premature labor, infection during pregnancy, acquired damage to the fetus, and congenital hereditary fetal malformations. These data, which are derived from reimbursement information or the payment of bills for health care services and commodities, can improve our knowledge of the interactions that patients with pregnancy and MS have with the health care system, but they should be interpreted with caution. There may be biases in coding and billing associated with this specific analysis. For example, there may be increased health care resource utilization in women with MS because of increased vigilance of clinicians caring for these patients. The data do not include Expanded Disability Status Scale score, disease duration, or the numbers or outcomes of prior pregnancies. Other data sources or study designs could provide additional clinical details; however, the findings of the current study suggest important hypotheses for exploration.

### Therapeutic management during pregnancy and relapse risk in women with multiple sclerosis [^115YG71W]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

In women with multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-modifying therapy (DMT) management during pregnancy might impact relapse risk.

Objective

To estimate the effect of DMT management during pregnancy on MS relapse rate and compare different therapeutic strategies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study using data from January 1990 to December 2023. Data were extracted in December 2023 from the French MS registry. Among 52 955 women in the registry, we included pregnancies identified through childbirths in patients with relapsing-onset MS who were monitored for at least 18 months before delivery and 9 months after. Pregnancies occurring less than 18 months apart or with missing month of birth were excluded.

Exposures

Mediation analysis was used to estimate the total, direct, and indirect (mediated by DMT management) effects of pregnancy. Different therapeutic strategies were compared: DMT interruption, switching to or maintaining interferon β or glatiramer acetate, switching to or maintaining natalizumab until the third trimester, and switching to or maintaining intravenous anti-CD20 and interrupting it 3 months before conception.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the annualized relapse rate (ARR) during the preconception, gestation, and postpartum periods. Within a causal inference framework, counterfactual ARRs were estimated using longitudinal g-computation, combining a random forest algorithm for predicting DMTs, and a mixed-effects Poisson model for relapses.

Results

We included 6341 pregnancies occurring in 4998 women (mean [SD] age at conception, 31.5 [4.5] years). DMT management during pregnancy significantly increased ARR during gestation (causal rate ratio [cRR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06–1.22) and postpartum (cRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16) periods. This led to a deleterious total effect of pregnancy on ARR, particularly in women receiving natalizumab before pregnancy with prolonged interruption (ie, interruption before the second trimester or resumption more than 3 months after delivery; cRR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.76–2.69), and in women receiving fingolimod (cRR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.60–2.93). Compared to DMT interruption, anti-CD20 strategy was the most effective (cRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25–0.52), followed by the natalizumab strategy with short interruption (cRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.90), whereas interferon β (cRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–0.99) and glatiramer acetate strategies (cRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.99) were less effective.

Conclusion

In this study, DMT management during pregnancy significantly increased relapse risk, particularly in patients receiving natalizumab with prolonged interruption or fingolimod. The strategy based on the use of anti-CD20 before pregnancy was the most effective to mitigate this risk.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^113CpUUD]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) involves fertility treatments or procedures that involve handling of eggs or embryos. It includes in vitro fertilization (surgical removal of eggs, treatment with sperm in the laboratory, and implantation into the woman, or another gestational carrier). Gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer, are other rare techniques. It also includes egg and embryo cryopreservation. ART does not involve intrauterine insemination, or taking drugs to stimulate egg production. Initially 5 small studies from France, Germany and Argentina reported increased relapse risk after failed ART, particularly when GnRH agonists were used. This data was used to counsel MS subjects accordingly. In a meta-analysis of these studies, along with a new Boston cohort, the meta-analysis confirmed the increased ARR. But in the new Boston cohort analysis, ARR did not go up post ART. Subsequent large scale studies have not confirmed that IVF carries increased risk for disease activity if pregnancy does not occur. They also noted that maintaining a DMT into the IVF procedure reduced relapse risk. This was based on a French National Health Insurance database of 338 IVF and N ​ = ​225 MS women. In another study from 4 large academic MS centers, N ​ = ​65 MS or CIS subjects were identified who went through N ​ = ​124 fertility treatments. The exposed period of 3 months was compared to an unexposed 3 month period 1 year earlier. There was no elevated relapse risk with fertility treatment. Another very recent retrospective cohort study from France looked at N ​ = ​115 MS French MS women who underwent N ​ = ​199 IVF procedures from 2009 to 2019 vs. a control MS group who did not. ARR in the 3 months after IVF were the same. Maintaining DMT until IVF was considered important. These recent studies have changed counseling to MS subjects, endorsing there is no risk of IVF/ART initiating breakthrough disease activity, especially if their DMT is maintained.

### Contraception for women with multiple sclerosis: guidance… [^116vRJ9h]. stacks.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Contraception for women with multiple sclerosis: Guidance for healthcare providers Supporting Files 5 2017 By Houtchens, Maria K; Zapata, Lauren B; Curtis, Kathryn M;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: Mult Scler Personal Author: Description: Family planning is essential for any comprehensive treatment plan for women of reproductive age with multiple sclerosis, including counseling on using effective contraception to optimally time desired and prevent unintended pregnancies. This topical review summarizes the first evidence-based recommendations on contraception safety for women with MS. In 2016, evidence-based recommendations for contraceptive use by women with MS were included in US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use. They were developed after review of published scientific evidence on contraception safety and consultation with experts.

We summarize and expand on the main conclusions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Most contraceptive methods appear based on current evidence to be safe for women with MS. The only restriction is use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with MS with prolonged immobility because of concerns about possible venous thromboembolism. Disease-modifying therapies do not appear to decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraception although formal drug-drug interaction studies are limited. Neurologists can help women with MS make contraceptive choices that factor their level of disability, immobility, and medication use. For women with MS taking potentially teratogenic medications, highly effective methods that are long-acting might be the best option. Subjects: Keywords: Source: Mult Scler.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^1125yqof]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

MS and Demographic Factors

When evaluating ARR changes after COS in cycles among demographic or MS clinical subgroups, ARR in the 3 months after COS cycles was found to be significantly lower than before in several subgroups: age 37 years or older, MS disease duration at least 2 years, and those on therapeutic DMT (Table 3). Relapse risk did not seem to differ before and after COS according to other demographic or MS (race, BMI, and parity) characteristics.

COS Protocol Factors

When evaluating for FT protocol–related factors, there was a trend toward lower ARR post–COS-ET (0.23 vs 0.13, p = 0.07) and IRR 0.57 (95% CI: 0.24–1.36, p = 0.21). There was no significant difference in the ARR post–COS-only cycle relative to before (0.63 vs 0.37, p = 0.61). The IRR post–COS-only cycle was 1.71 (95% CI: 0.68–4.35, p = 0.26) (Table 3).

Use of GnRH agonist vs antagonist did not result in a difference in relapse rates: GnRH agonist IRR = 2 (95% CI: 0.37–10.9, p = 0.42) and GnRH antagonist IRR = 0.57 (95% CI: 0.24–1.36, p = 0.21) (Table 3). For cycles with 2 or more stimulations, ARR seemed numerically higher 3 months after COS compared with 12 months earlier (IRR 4.0; 95% CI: 0.85–18.8, p = 0.08, n = 18); 11 (58%) were on therapeutic DMT. There were very few relapses post-COS with those undergoing 1 stimulation cycle: ARR 0.31 pre-COS vs 0.19 post-COS (p = 0.12); IRR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.31–1.30, p = 0.21).

Referral Center

Most of the relapses (4) came from 1 referral center, which contributed the most patients, and which also had the lower proportion of patients on therapeutic DMT during FT (73%). Centers with > 60% of patients on treatment at FT did not have patients who relapsed. We were underpowered to evaluate effects by site.

### Pregnancy effect on disease activity in women with multiple sclerosis treated with cladribine [^114XNnZT]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a young age at onset and a female sex predominance. Hormonal and immune changes occurring during pregnancy may significantly impact MS activity. It is recognized that the risk of relapse declines during pregnancy and rebounds in the early postpartum period, eventually returning to a level comparable to the pre-pregnancy state within the 1st year postpartum. Consequently, patients in childbearing age are often counseled already at the time of MS diagnosis to plan future pregnancies. This planning often plays a pivotal role in guiding the selection of appropriate disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Indeed, few DMTs, such as injectables, can be continued until conception or even during pregnancy, while others might require a specific washout period before attempting conception due to their potential fetal toxicity.

Cladribine, administered as an oral pulsed therapy, involves a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years, with one annual course lasting up to 10 treatment days. Acting as a prodrug, cladribine enters cells and, once activated, disrupts DNA synthesis, leading to selective apoptosis of lymphocytes. MS activity control typically persists for approximately 4 years after cladribine initiation.

Reproductive toxicology studies on animals showed no adverse effects on female and male fertility or offspring development. However, intravenous cladribine wasshown was teratogenic in mice and rabbits. Given the potential teratogenicity at higher dose in animals, caution is required for conception during and after cladribine administration; indeed, to avoid the risk of exposure for the conceptus, a 6-month period of contraception is recommended after the intake of the last cladribine tablet. Observations from the Integrated Analysis of Safety during the Clinical Development Program of cladribine were generally consistent with epidemiological data on pregnancy outcomes for the general population or women with MS. Specifically, there were no differences in the rate of congenital malformations between those exposed to cladribine treatment or within 6 months after the last dose and those administered placebo. Anyway, there is currently a lack of information regarding the effect of pregnancy on disease activity in women with MS who conceived after the first or 2nd year of cladribine treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, AAN 2018 guidelines recommend to advise female patients to discontinue disease-modifying therapy before conception for planned pregnancies unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specific disease-modifying therapy during pregnancy.

Family planning

Two cross-sectional studies focused on family planning and both were based on original surveys. The first, based on 102 MwMS in Denmark, reported information about fetal risk with use of DMT was commonly obtained from MS treatment team (40% of respondents), but a majority of participants did not know if their current DMT had direct teratogenic effects (74%), or if DMT of male partners with MS may be associated with teratogenicity in case of conception with a female partner without MS. In the second study, in an international sample of 61 MwMS, 49% reported their MS diagnosis did not have an impact on their desire to have children, 8% decided not to have children due to their diagnosis, and 25% reported changing their plans significantly.

### Assessing the risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization in women with multiple sclerosis [^11372PKb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using clinical and administrative dataset (through a linkage procedure) and intergroup (matched women with MS who underwent or not IVF) and intragroup (women with MS before and after IVF) analyses, we did not find any increased risk of relapse after IVF in women with MS in France, between 2009 and 2019, overall and in function of the stimulation protocol and IVF outcome.

Previous small-size studiesand recent larger studiesinvestigated the risk of relapse after IVF in women with MS with conflicting results. The 3 most recent studiesfound no increased risk of relapse after IVF, as confirmed by this study. We think that the previously reported conflicting findings are due to differences in study populations and changes in MS management over time. Indeed, the earlier studiesincluded smaller samples (6–32 women who underwent between 10 and 78 IVF procedures). The women's mean age ranged from 29.8 to 32.0 years, and most of them received GnRH-agonist stimulation (60%,64.3%,42.3%,100%, and 68.6%). Women were not taking DMTs, or very few of them (6.4%and 5.7%). More recent studiesincluded larger samples (12–225 women and 22 to 338 IVF procedures) with older women (34.6–36.3 years) and less use of agonist stimulation protocols (31.8%,37.0%, and 10.5%). One studyincluded only untreated women at the time of IVF, and in the other 2, 24.3%and 42.7%of women were receiving DMTs at the time of IVF. We do not think that the changes in stimulation protocols over time explain the different results. Indeed, our subgroup analyses in function of the stimulation protocol did not highlight any difference. Regarding the use of DMTs, our analysis of the 2 subperiods (2009–2014 vs 2015–2019) did not find any significant difference. Nevertheless, we could hypothesize that better MS management in recent times, before the IVF procedure and from the disease onset, might contribute to the overall reduction of relapse occurrence.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^114MD2Pc]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature, with relapses clinically defined and MRI confirmation of new disease activity only available in a subset of cases. It is possible that not all relapses were collected in the EMR. The retrospective nature also limited the availability of specific details about the FTs. Certain cycles of FTs could be underascertained, especially OI, because these cycles do not involve as intensive hormonal changes, do not have specific diagnostic codes, and may not be as likely to be reported to the neurologist. There may be site-based limitations because differential MS care may influence DMT timing relative to FT and FT selection may vary across referral sites. The low proportion of Black, Hispanic, or Asian patients may reflect differences in the utilization of FTs, in the documentation of FTs in the medical record, or in the proportion of women seeking care for their MS at the centers during the study period. Further studies are necessary to evaluate MS outcomes after FT in more diverse women. Finally, the heterogeneity of fertility cycles, a feature of modern FTs personalized to optimize individual outcomes and the low numerical count of relapses, limited statistical power to identify specific risk factors for relapses. This study was not powered to detect specific differences between groups, and these estimates have wide CIs, but the overall low number of relapses described here is informative and reassuring.

Patients with CIS/MS, along with the general population, may use FT to optimize conception in several clinical and social scenarios, including fertility preservation, older age, single parenting, male factor infertility, and same-sex relationships. As the use of FTs has evolved, so have questions about the optimal management of MS during these periods. The low risk of relapses in this contemporary treated cohort, confirms more recent reports. Furthermore, our findings also provide reassurance to patients and fertility experts that the use of ET only and OI are not associated with elevated risk of relapses. In these settings aimed to promote conception, judicious use of DMTs will still be required to optimize MS disease stability and minimize fetal risk. Therapies with biological effects that persist beyond their elimination (e.g. induction therapies such as alemtuzumab, or B cell–depleting therapies) may achieve this therapeutic goal. Our findings highlight the importance of informed up-to-date management of patients with MS who seek fertility support. Of importance, continuing highly effective appropriately timed DMT during FTs may reduce the risk of relapse during this period of marked hormonal fluctuations and stressors.

### Alcohol misuse disorders and multiple sclerosis risk… [^113uskGX]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurologic disease caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors. To our knowledge, few studies have investigated the relationship between alcohol and MS risk, and these have been limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent results. 1–3 Hedström and colleagues4 reported that alcohol consumption exhibits a dose-dependent inverse association with MS risk. We aimed to determine whether individuals with alcohol misuse disorders, presumed to consume large quantities of alcohol, have a lower MS risk than the general population. A reference cohort was constructed by identifying people admitted for various other, mainly minor, medical and surgical conditions and injuries. None of the control conditions within the reference cohort, when studied separately, had unusually high or low rates of MS when compared with other conditions in the reference cohort.

There was a significantly increased risk for MS following alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, and alcohol use. We considered the possibility of reverse causality or that the increased risk for MS may be related to the alcohol-related care itself. Therefore, we analyzed the data for whether the occurrence of the first record of MS was within, or after, 1 year following the first admission for each alcohol misuse disorder. There was a significantly elevated risk for MS within 1 year of first admission for alcohol abuse only. For all alcohol misuse disorders, there was a significantly elevated risk for MS with an interval of more than 1 year from first admission with the alcohol misuse disorder. The association between alcohol misuse disorders and the risk for MS was more evident in men than women.

This study supports the presence of a significant positive association between alcohol misuse disorders and MS risk, particularly in men. The strengths of this study were the longitudinal design and the size of the Hospital Episode Statistics database. We consider it likely that most people with MS would be seen as a day case or admitted at least once. Whereas Hedström et al4 observed a negative association between alcohol consumption and MS risk, the likely much higher levels of toxicity and alcohol dependency in the patients in our study may be associated with MS or might be associated with risk factors or other comorbidities that may, in turn, be associated with MS.

### Assisted reproductive technology treatment and risk of multiple sclerosis-a Danish cohort study [^1128xDK5]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) among women who had undergone assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment with the women who had conceived a child without previous ART treatment.

Design

A register-based nationwide cohort study.

Patient(S)

Women with a first ovarian stimulation cycle before in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (i.e. ART treatment) recorded in the Danish IVF register between 1996 and 2018; and women recorded in the Danish Medical Birth Register with the birth of their first child where date of conception is between 1996 and 2018. The cohort was observed until March 10, 2021.

Intervention(S)

Mainly included IVF, ICSI, and fresh embryo transfer with hormone stimulation.

Main Outcome Measures

A diagnosis of MS recorded in the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

A total of 585,716 women were included in the cohort of which 63,791 (11%) were exposed to at least one initiated IVF or ICSI cycle during the study period. Cycles with oocyte donation were excluded. The median follow-up time for the entire cohort was 12.4 years (Q1-Q3 = 6.6–18.1). Compared with women conceiving without previous ART, ART treated women were older (31.8 years vs. 27.5 years), more often had a university degree (45% vs. 36%), and more often had received other fertility treatments than IVF or ICSI before cohort entry (26% vs. 3%). We found no association between incident MS and exposure to ART compared with non-ART pregnancy (aHR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.25). An analysis following intention-to-treat principle on a propensity score matched sub cohort confirmed our results. In subgroup analysis including all ART cycles among the ART treated women, we found no increased risk of MS within 2 years of ART cycle start for successful ART cycles (pregnancy) compared with failed ART cycles (no pregnancy) (aHR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.58–1.76). We found a non-significant trend toward increased risk of MS with increasing numbers of ART cycles although based on small numbers.

Conclusion(S)

Women treated with ART do not seem to be at increased risk of developing MS compared with the women not exposed to ART.

### Inflammatory activity after diverse fertility treatments: a multicenter analysis in the modern multiple sclerosis treatment era [^1142j65a]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This modern multicenter cohort identified no increase in relapse rate after FT in a group of women with recent or ongoing (43%) DMT use, regardless of FT type or hormonal protocol used. Over the past decade, there has been a trend for more active treatment for patients with MS of childbearing potential, rendering more important the question of active DMT use during COS and oocyte harvesting procedures. In historical cohorts, few patients seeking FT were on DMT. In a more recent French cohort where 24% of patients were treated with DMT during IVF, there was no difference in ARR 3 months before vs 3 months after IVF (0.20 vs 0.18). The percent of patients relapsing after IVF was lower in those on DMT (2% vs 9%).

Overall, women with MS are more likely to be diagnosed with infertility, but less likely to receive FTs. It is unclear whether the infertility diagnosis is related to biological causes because AMH levels seem to be similar between women with and without MS, as does the median age of natural menopause. However, MS-related changes in mood, activity, or libido could influence a patient's likelihood of conceiving.

The need for timely conception off DMT may lead some patients with MS to seek FT earlier than the general population. For instance, women on B cell–depleting drugs such as ocrelizumab or rituximab are advised to conceive 3–6 months after infusion. Therefore, the safety of FTs is a concern for many women with MS.

Small historical studiesand larger, more recent ones, primarily evaluated MS inflammatory activity after fresh IVF (COS-ET) cycles. In line with 2 more recent studies, the current analysis identified no elevation in relapse rate after COS-ET cycles. Current COS protocols are typically shorter and more frequently use GnRH antagonists, but we also detected no elevation in relapses even when GnRH agonists were used. Furthermore, almost half of all patients were considered therapeutic on DMT during FT, reflecting a shift in MS care toward more active management of patients during periods of high relapse risk.

Regarding specific circumstances for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating natalizumab, continued throughout pregnancy, after a full discussion of potential implications in patients deciding to become pregnant or having an unplanned pregnancy. Consider initiating alemtuzumab as an alternative therapeutic option for planned pregnancy in very active cases, provided that a 4-month interval is strictly observed from the latest infusion until conception.

### Does pregnancy affect women with multiple sclerosis? A prospective study in Western China [^1175nbEs]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pregnancy is considered to be protective for multiple sclerosis (MS) but little is known about Asian MS women. Our study aimed to investigate whether pregnancy affects the course of MS and whether MS affects pregnancy in a Chinese cohort.

Methods

We established a database (2009–2016) of 94 females with MS in the Department of Neurology at West China Hospital. From this database, we enrolled females who had been pregnant before or after the clinical onset of MS and consecutively followed up the patients and their offspring for at least one year after delivery. We registered their demographic, clinical and pregnancy-related information, as well as the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score.

Results

We enrolled 55 females with MS and 126 pregnancies. Among them, 14 females had 15 deliveries after MS onset. In these 15 full-term pregnancies after MS onset, the average ARR decreased from 0.46 ± 0.52 in the year before pregnancy to 0.07 ± 0.26 (P = 0.034) during pregnancy and no drug exposure were observed during pregnancy. The average EDSS score at one year after delivery (1.50 ± 1.72) was higher than that at conception (0.77 ± 1.35; p = 0.045).

Conclusions

The natural history of MS during pregnancy suggests that full-term pregnancy protects MS females from relapse. However, the disability of MS females may develop after delivery.

### Assessing the risk of relapse after in vitro fertilization in women with multiple sclerosis [^117FZyYm]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the CNS that primarily affects women and usually starts in young adulthood.MS-specific disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) play a crucial role in reducing the risk of relapse and slowing disability progression. Moreover, pregnancy decreases relapse occurrence, especially in the second and third trimesters.

Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), are medical procedures used primarily to address infertility. IVF procedures generally begin with ovarian stimulation, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs that may be agonists or antagonists. To increase the chances of success, several embryo transfers can be performed after the same IVF cycle (≥ 1 frozen embryos after the initial fresh transfer).

Few studies investigated the risk of MS relapse after IVF. The first ones(between 2006 and 2012) showed an increase in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) after IVF. In 2019, an American studyreported a nonsignificant difference in ARR after ART compared with control periods in 12 women with MS who underwent 22 ART cycles. All these studies had several limitations, especially small sample sizes (N = 6 to 32), risk of recruitment bias, and lack of control population. Recently, 2 studies, including one from our group, with larger sample sizes (N = 65 and 225 women with MS, respectively) did not find any increased risk of relapse after IVF. All these studiesused a before/after intragroup comparison.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the risk of relapse after IVF in women with MS, overall and according to the stimulation protocol (GnRH agonists and antagonists), using data from the French MS Registry (Observatoire Français de la Sclérose En Plaques; OFSEP) linked to the French national health insurance database (Système National des Données de Santé; SNDS). To strengthen the evidence robustness, we included also a matched control group of women with MS who never had IVF.

### Management of multiple sclerosis during pregnancy and the reproductive years: a systematic review [^117F2Hru]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence guiding management of multiple sclerosis (MS) in reproductive-aged women.

Data Sources

We conducted an electronic literature search using PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and other available resources. The following keywords were used: "multiple sclerosis" and "pregnancy". We manually searched the reference lists of identified studies.

Methods Of Study Selection

Two reviewers categorized all studies identified in the search by management topic, including effect of pregnancy on MS course, fetal risks associated with disease-modifying treatments during pregnancy, and management of patients off disease-modifying treatment. We categorized studies by strength of evidence and included prior meta-analyses and systematic studies. These studies were then summarized and discussed by an expert multidisciplinary team.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

The risk of MS relapses is decreased during pregnancy and increased postpartum. Data are lacking regarding the risks of disease-modifying treatments during pregnancy. There may be an increased risk of MS relapses after use of assisted reproductive techniques. There does not appear to be a major increase in adverse outcomes in newborns of mothers with MS.

Conclusion

Although there are many unmet research needs, the reviewed data support the conclusion that in the majority of cases, women with MS can safely choose to become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed children. Clinical management should be individualized to optimize both the mother's reproductive outcomes and MS course.

### Parenthood and immunomodulation in patients with multiple sclerosis [^115oxGxx]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the influence of immunomodulation on parenthood, in particular paternity in multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective was to determine whether there is an increased risk for pregnancies initiated by MS-parents under disease modifying therapies (DMT). We investigated the clinical outcome of pregnancies fathered by MS-patients under DMT by nationwide questionnaire and within our own outpatient clinic. Additionally, we compared the birth weight of children from MS-fathers exposed to DMT, MS-mothers without DMT, MS-mothers under interferon-beta (IFN beta) at the time of conception and healthy controls (HCs). DMT was reported for 32 paternities of 46 children; 30 under IFN beta, 12 under glatiramer acetate, 2 under natalizumab, 1 under methotrexate and 1 under combined azathioprine- and IFN beta-1b-treatment. Six (13%) pregnancies ended in early spontaneous abortions; of the 40 children of MS-fathers under DMT, 2 (5%) were preterm, 1 (2.5%) had a spinal lipoma and 3 (7.5%) had moderate hip dysplasia, of whom 2 were siblings whose mother had severe hip dysplasia. Mean birth weight of newborns from MS-fathers under DMT was not significantly reduced compared to HCs. Comparing birth weight of newborns of MS-mothers versus MS-fathers, we found a significant difference to the disadvantage of MS-mothers with or without IFN beta-treatment. No statistical difference in birth weight of IFN beta-exposed versus untreated MS-mothers was observed. Despite the small numbers, our available data suggest safe paternity by MS-patients. IFN beta-treatment of mothers does not seem to have an impact on birth weight, however, MS may contribute to a reduced birth weight.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^114tvfmL]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease that adversely affects physical and mental health and can lead to social dissatisfaction. There are 2.8 million people living with MS worldwide. Newer high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are shifting approaches in care, as risks for relapses substantially decrease with their use. Despite advances in managing disease activity, disease progression persists and many symptoms are difficult to control and worsen over time. In addition to motor impairment in MS, other frequent symptoms include cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, bladder dysfunction, and sleep disturbance, while depression, anxiety, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are common comorbidities. Comprehensive MS care entails management of active symptoms and comorbidities, but there are recognizable challenges due to knowledge gaps for understudied symptoms and lesser recognized comorbidities.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^116vRgwF]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis and male reproductive health

There is a major knowledge gap regarding DMT use in the context of reproductive health in MwMS population, which possibly has a direct impact for about a third of MwMS who change their plans regarding having children following an established diagnosis of MS. Sexual health is an integral part of reproductive health, but fertility and fecundity also depend on male factors such as sperm quality. Exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of male-factor infertility in MS remain to be determined, though up to 40% of causes of male-factor infertility are elusive even in general population-based studies. Scandinavian population-based studies showed an association between male diagnosis of MS and fewer offspring, and may be indicative of increased infertility but it may also reflect altered sexual behaviors. Most of the observational studies on these topics were retrospective (4/7) and based on specific European populations (4/7 Scandinavian countries, 2/7 Italy), which limits generalizability.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^111g54KC]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Natalizumab carries risk for rebound activity after it is stopped. That is why a new DMT is started, typically within a month after discontinuation. Natalizumab rebound has led to severe pregnancy relapses. In one study 10 ​% of women showed significant disability from a pregnancy relapse. This DMT is generally continued through the first 2 trimesters, on an extended dosing schedule (Q6 to 8 weeks, rather than Q4 weeks). In one clinical practice protocol, natalizumab was given Q6 weeks up to week 30, then withheld until a scheduled delivery at week 40, and then resumed postpartum. Natalizumab has also been maintained throughout pregnancy. Exposure during the third trimester requires checking the neonate for hematologic abnormalities, such as anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The B cell lytic agents (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies), according to their labels, require a six month washout. However, as a monoclonal antibody, fetal exposure is not a risk until the placenta develops, typically by weeks 17–22. A dose taken at the time of conception would be washed out by the time placental transfer was due to occur. Mean half-lives for the anti-CD20s range from 16 to 26 days. There is no convincing human or animal model concerns about teratogenicity for the routine anti-CD20s. The anti-CD20s have a long lasting effect on B cells. Expert consensus suggests they can be stopped once pregnancy is confirmed, without a washout. The single exception is the newest anti-CD20 (ublituximab). At high dose (30 ​mg/kg) it caused maternal fatality in a monkey model, leading to a caution about fetal risk in the label. Since pregnancy exposure data is so limited, this anti-CD20 should be used with a washout. Anti-CD20s have been used during pregnancy. If used in the latter stages, transient peripheral B cell depletion and lymphopenia should be assessed in the newborn infant.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a high efficacy therapy that is being evaluated for relapsing forms of MS. Late toxicity involves infertility in about 90 ​% of those who undergo this therapy, due to the conditioning regimen with alkylating agents. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation should be offered, and is reported to have a 30 ​% success rate for subsequent pregnancy.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^114SST4p]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations of this study are primarily related to the nature of the scoping review methodology and chosen strategy, i.e. we restricted our selection of eligible publications to PubMed database for initial article retrieval and defined a specific period. In case an additional source was sporadically identified in one of the read articles, it was considered for inclusion based on same eligibility criteria. Although this enabled an additional number of sources to be included, grey literature on potentially relevant topics and publications in language other than English were not reviewed. With the goal of summarizing the available literature in a broader, yet focused manner, only descriptive reporting or analysis was used. Evaluation of the quality of the included studies was not performed. Aside from research based on national registries, most studies were modestly sized (< 100 participants) and therefore potential subject to sampling variability and from which limited inference is possible.

### Sex-related gap in the use of disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^113f5nY5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In women with multiple sclerosis (MS), the therapeutic strategy may be influenced by the anticipation of future pregnancies, leading to underexposure to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and highly effective DMTs (HEDMTs) compared with men. We aimed to evaluate potential therapeutic inertia in women with MS and explore its causes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study based on data extracted on June 2023 from the Observatoire Français de la Sclérose en Plaques for all patients with a relapsing-remitting MS onset between 18 and 40 years. The primary outcome was the annual probability of receiving a DMT, accounting for sex, disease severity, and pregnancy/postpartum periods. Secondary outcomes were the annual probability of receiving a HEDMT, each DMT separately, and interaction of the effect of sex with calendar year, patient age, and disease duration. We used a longitudinal logistic model with generalized estimating equations and an inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting.

Results

We included 22,657 patients with MS; 16,857 (74.4%) were female, mean (SD) age at onset was 29.0 (6.0) years, and median (interquartile range) follow-up duration was 11.6 (6.6–17.3) years. Women were significantly less likely to receive a DMT (odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.87–0.97) or a HEDMT (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.86). This difference appeared 2 years after disease onset for DMTs and 1 year for HEDMTs, and did not differ significantly according to patient's age. Teriflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and anti-CD20s were significantly underused in women throughout their entire period of availability; interferons β (IFN-β) and natalizumab were initially less used and then equally after some time; glatiramer acetate and fumarates were first used equally, then more frequently in women. The proportion of treated women, analyzed from the first childbirth of 5,268 women, began to decline 18 months before childbirth, from 42.6% to 27.9% at the estimated time of conception.

Discussion

Women with MS were significantly less exposed to DMTs compared with men. Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor underlying this difference, but also sex-specific therapeutic inertia. Neurologists and patients should be educated on the most recent recommendations on the use of DMTs in the context of pregnancy to avoid deleterious therapeutic inertia.

### Multiple sclerosis and pregnancy: pathogenesis, influencing factors, and treatment options [^1152RBTD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-mediated degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by inflammatory demyelination. It is primarily found in women of childbearing age, making pregnancy a significant concern for both patients with MS and clinicians. To assist these patients in achieving their desire for pregnancy, reducing MS relapses during all stages of pregnancy, preventing the progression of MS, mitigating the impact of MS treatment on the course and outcome of pregnancy, and a thorough understanding of the relationship between pregnancy and MS, as well as specific management and the application of relevant medications for MS patients at each stage of pregnancy, are essential. This article provides an update on pregnancy-related issues in women with MS, including the general recommendations for management at each stage of pregnancy.

### Choosing initial MS therapy; personal, disease, and medication factors [^1175wmXr]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

An important consideration for women of childbearing age confronting a new diagnosis of MS, relates to plans for a future pregnancy, whether short term or at an undefined time in the future. Counseling regarding possibility of a future pregnancy should always be included in the context of choosing an initial therapy. The newly diagnosed woman with MS should be educated that the disease and its treatment are compatible with future pregnancy, that pregnancy does not adversely affect the course of MS, and that when pregnancies are planned, outcomes are similar to those of comparable women without MS. Women are generally advised to initiate DMT to establish disease control before pursuing pregnancy, and to use or continue effective contraception during that time period. Choices among initial disease modifying treatments will be influenced by their strategies for management, once pregnancy is to be pursued. Some agents will need to be discontinued prior to pursuit of pregnancy while others are safe to continue until pregnancy occurs. Some DMTs are compatible with post-partum nursing while others will need to be avoided during that period (reviewed in referenceand discussed below) Some highly effective therapies prior to pregnancy, and exclusive breast feeding, may influence post-partum relapse risk.

Finally, but importantly, it is an unfortunate reality that access to specific medications may vary based on an individual's health insurance coverage, or regulatory policies in some national health systems. In some health settings, out of pocket costs can be a significant concern for patients with newly diagnosed MS and influence their treatment decisions. Out of pocket medication cost may be defrayed by pharmaceutical support programs for some individuals, while others may be ineligible for support based on the source of their health care insurance. Formulary restrictions may limit access to preferred initial therapeutic choices For medications which are not self-administered, out of pocket cost for medication administration may be significant, even when the medication itself is provided without cost. Fortunately, a number of generic DMTs are now available at relatively low cost from large discount pharmacies and may offer treatment options to people otherwise unable to afford medication costs.

### Pregnancy: effect on multiple sclerosis, treatment considerations, and breastfeeding [^113wL17r]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly affects women in childbearing years making pregnancy issues important for patients with MS and their families. Pregnancy is a naturally occurring disease modifier of MS associated with a 70% reduction in relapse rates in the third trimester. This relapse rate reduction during the last trimester is roughly equal to the most effective disease-modifying treatments for MS. Given this efficacy, various pregnancy factors have been tested to determine which play a part in pregnancy's protection, and some have been translated to completed and ongoing phase II clinical trials. In contrast to protective effects during pregnancy, the postpartum period entails increased relapse risk, which may be due to either abrupt removal of protective pregnancy factors after delivery or to unique deleterious factors inherent to the postpartum period. The effect of breastfeeding on MS remains unclear. The best predictor for whether a patient will have a postpartum relapse is the incidence of her having active relapsing MS prior to pregnancy. The medical management of MS during pregnancy and the postpartum period is challenging given the risks of medication exposure to the fetus in utero and to the infant through breast milk. This review will focus on clinical aspects of pregnancy, including the effects of pregnancy on MS disease activity, as well as the medical management of MS during pregnancy and postpartum.

### Pregnancy and reproductive health in women with multiple sclerosis: an update [^111erJYc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory, neuro-degenerative disease of the central nervous system, prevalent in women of reproductive age. Today, many women want to start a family after MS diagnosis. There are over 20 treatments for MS, and safely navigating family planning is important. We review updated information on family planning, preconception, and peri-partum considerations, and reproductive concerns in special populations with MS.

Recent Findings

There are no MS-related restrictions on any available and appropriate contraceptive method in women with MS. The question of MS and pregnancy outcomes following assisted reproduction, remains somewhat unsettled. In many studies, no elevated relapse risk is confirmed regardless of the type of fertility treatment. MRI status may offer better assessment of postpartum disease stability than relapse rate alone. Ongoing effective MS treatments during fertility assistance and before pregnancy, can further reduce the relapse risk. B-cell depleting therapies are emerging as safe and effective treatments for peripartum MS patients.

Summary

Patients with MS should receive accurate support and counseling related to their reproductive options. The general outlook on pregnancy and MS remains positive. The ever-increasing therapeutic complexity of MS calls for ongoing education and updated guidance for neuroimmunology and obstetrics healthcare providers.

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^114gR48R]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our scoping review based on male sexual and reproductive health in MS included 34 original studies published over the last 2 decades (2002–2023). Most studies broadly focused on sexual dysfunction, followed by specific focus on erectile dysfunction, fertility, and family planning, respectively. Despite the growing availability of DMT options in recent years, including newer high-efficacy treatments, comorbidity management which includes sexual and reproductive health, remains one of the cornerstones to improve quality of life and minimize direct or indirect disability due to MS.

### Pregnancy and multiple sclerosis [^111TCMyo]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

At any one time, there are around 20 000 women of childbearing age with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the UK who may be considering having children. Neurologists can be asked for information from both patients and obstetric colleagues on a range of topics related to pregnancy and MS that extend beyond the well-known implications for relapse risk. This article aims to provide a brief overview for the general neurologist of the most commonly encountered issues and questions including those occasionally related to pregnancy management. The take-home message is that pregnancy does not hold adverse risks for the majority of patients with MS, or vice versa.
