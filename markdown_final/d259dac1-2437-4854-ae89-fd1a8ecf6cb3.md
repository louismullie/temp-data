## Question

What is the prognosis in ICU patients with acute tubular necrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in ICU patients, including short- and long-term outcomes, modifiers by etiology and severity, and practical prognostic tools and implications for care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how ATN is defined and distinguished from other causes of AKI in the ICU. Then, I should verify short-term mortality ranges and how they vary by severity and RRT requirement. Next, I will examine etiologic modifiers, especially ischemic versus nephrotoxic ATN and sepsis-associated AKI. After that, I should review long-term outcomes, including renal recovery and progression to CKD. Then, I will consider patient-level and process-of-care prognostic factors. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic prognostic framework and outline clinical implications for counseling and follow-up, making sure to double-check key claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. ATN in the ICU is typically a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, representing intrinsic tubular injury after ischemic or nephrotoxic insults; it is the most common cause of intrinsic AKI in critical illness, though septic AKI may not always show classic necrosis histologically, which complicates the ATN label in sepsis [^112tQNJx] [^116ud3yc] [^114wGoNf]. Hold on, I should verify that contemporary AKI frameworks (RIFLE/AKIN/KDIGO) capture severity but not etiology; indeed, they stage by creatinine/urine output and do not distinguish ischemic from nephrotoxic injury, so etiologic attribution in ICU cohorts often relies on clinical adjudication rather than biopsy [^113Ghui6] [^111JD9cT].

> Next, I should review short-term mortality. Historically, ICU-associated ATN carried very high mortality, often cited around 50–80%, reflecting the severity of underlying illness rather than kidney injury alone [^111egvkS]. Wait, let me verify more recent data; contemporary ICU cohorts show that severe AKI requiring RRT has mortality in the 40–60% range, with the landmark ATN trial showing no survival difference between intensive and less-intensive RRT strategies, underscoring that mortality is driven by the underlying critical illness rather than dialysis intensity per se [^117XeZS2]. I should also confirm that stage 3 AKI and RRT are associated with the highest risk; yes, RIFLE "failure" and AKI stage 3 consistently correlate with markedly higher mortality than milder AKI, and sepsis-associated AKI mortality can approach 50–70% in some series [^1123LdjS] [^114wGoNf] [^116Mvdoq].

> I will now examine etiologic modifiers. Let me think about ischemic versus nephrotoxic ATN; I initially thought mortality was uniformly high regardless of cause, but wait, I should double-check comparative data. A pivotal analysis of the anaritide trial placebo arm showed day-21 mortality of 10% with nephrotoxic ATN versus 30% with ischemic ATN, and dialysis-free survival was substantially lower with ischemic injury, indicating worse outcomes when ischemia predominates [^1135ceKY]. Hold on, I should verify consistency; ICU cohorts similarly report higher mortality with ischemic or mixed ATN compared with isolated nephrotoxic injury, reinforcing that hemodynamic collapse, shock, and sepsis portend worse prognosis than drug-induced tubular injury alone [^112ooLZ3].

> Let me consider sepsis-associated AKI specifically. Sepsis accounts for roughly half of ICU AKI and is linked to very high mortality, often exceeding 50% when RRT is required, and its pathophysiology may diverge from classic ischemic ATN with normal-to-increased renal blood flow and modest histologic necrosis, which may explain why global hemodynamic metrics alone fail to predict outcomes reliably in this phenotype [^114wGoNf] [^116ud3yc]. I should confirm that septic AKI mortality remains disproportionately high even after adjustment; yes, contemporary cohorts continue to show elevated short- and long-term mortality with sepsis-associated AKI, consistent with its unique inflammatory microvascular pathobiology [^113roTx3] [^116Mvdoq].

> Next, I should review long-term outcomes and renal recovery. Survivors of severe ATN requiring RRT have a reasonable chance of renal recovery; in a prospective cohort, about 57% normalized renal function at discharge, 33% had mild-to-moderate CKD, and only about 10% had severe impairment, with progression to ESRD uncommon at 1 year, especially if the patient survives the precipitating illness [^116qAAjA]. But wait, what if recovery is incomplete; I need to ensure I capture the MAKE risk. Nonresolving AKI within 72 hours is associated with a substantially higher risk of chronic kidney disease, dialysis, and death over the subsequent years, and even patients with apparent creatinine normalization may harbor subclinical kidney injury detectable by biomarkers, which correlates with worse 1-year survival [^115GykE3] [^112jzouy]. I should also confirm that AKI survivors have elevated long-term mortality compared with those without AKI; yes, multiple cohorts show persistent excess mortality beyond the index hospitalization, highlighting AKI as a sentinel event with systemic implications [^111uszfz] [^111FCq16].

> I need to check patient-level prognostic factors. Age, comorbidity burden, baseline kidney function, and severity of illness scores such as APACHE independently predict mortality and non-recovery; older age and preexisting CKD reduce the likelihood of full renal recovery and increase long-term mortality, whereas surgical status and trauma etiologies may carry comparatively better outcomes in some series [^1123LdjS] [^1137LaDb] [^1121AKko]. Hold on, I should verify whether duration of AKI itself modifies risk; persistent AKI beyond 48 hours is consistently associated with higher mortality than transient AKI, even after adjusting for severity, suggesting that nonresolving injury reflects more severe or maladaptive repair pathways [^112jxLAp] [^1137XBF5].

> Next, I should review process-of-care factors. Early nephrology consultation is associated with improved processes and may mitigate harm, whereas delayed consultation correlates with higher ICU mortality in observational data, though confounding by severity is possible and randomized evidence is limited [^116Y81xG]. I should confirm RRT timing data; large RCTs (ATN and AKIKI) show no mortality benefit to early versus delayed initiation in the absence of life-threatening indications, though early RRT increases catheter-related complications and metabolic derangements, so a "watchful waiting" strategy is reasonable when safe [^117XeZS2] [^114kCVZZ]. Fluid overload at RRT initiation independently predicts non-recovery, so aggressive decongestion and timely RRT for refractory volume overload are prudent to preserve renal recovery potential [^1117mdTa] [^1133qTM7].

> Let me synthesize a prognostic framework. Short-term prognosis is dominated by the severity of the precipitating illness, presence of sepsis, and need for RRT, with stage 3 AKI/RRT mortality around 40–60% in modern cohorts, and higher in sepsis-associated AKI; etiology matters, with ischemic or mixed ATN faring worse than isolated nephrotoxic injury; patient factors such as age, comorbidities, and baseline eGFR further stratify risk; and persistent AKI beyond 48 hours identifies a high-risk subgroup with worse outcomes even after severity adjustment [^117XeZS2] [^114wGoNf] [^1135ceKY] [^112jxLAp]. Long-term prognosis hinges on renal recovery trajectories; most survivors regain sufficient function to discontinue RRT, but nonresolving AKI carries a markedly higher risk of CKD, dialysis, and death, and subtle kidney injury at ICU discharge detected by biomarkers portends higher 1-year mortality, arguing for structured nephrology follow-up and risk modification after discharge [^116qAAjA] [^115GykE3] [^112jzouy].

> I should double-check practical prognostic tools. Severity scores (APACHE, SOFA), AKI stage, and the duration of AKI provide actionable risk stratification; biomarkers such as NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 can refine early prognosis and help distinguish ATN from prerenal states, though they are not yet mandated for routine care; and the furosemide stress test can identify low likelihood of early renal recovery, aiding decisions about RRT and disposition planning [^116NZ4SF] [^1169qAEP] [^112jxLAp]. Hold on, I should verify that these tools complement, not replace, clinical judgment; yes, current guidance emphasizes integrating biomarkers and functional tests with clinical context rather than relying on any single metric [^111JD9cT].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Counseling families should emphasize that mortality is primarily driven by the underlying critical illness and multiorgan failure, not the dialysis modality; that recovery of kidney function is common among survivors but not guaranteed, especially with ischemic injury, sepsis, or preexisting CKD; and that persistent or nonresolving AKI warrants closer follow-up for CKD progression and cardiovascular complications. Early, cause-directed management, avoidance of nephrotoxins, timely but judicious RRT when indicated, and early nephrology involvement are reasonable strategies to optimize outcomes, while recognizing that high-quality evidence for mortality benefit from early RRT remains elusive outside of classic indications [^117XeZS2] [^114kCVZZ] [^113EJC6w] [^1123LdjS].

In ICU patients with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), **short-term mortality is high** (40–60%) and strongly linked to severity of illness, sepsis, and multi-organ failure [^111egvkS] [^1123LdjS]. Renal recovery is common among survivors, but **persistent AKI** or **dialysis dependence** occurs in 10–20% and increases long-term mortality and chronic kidney disease risk [^116qAAjA] [^115GykE3]. Prognosis is worse with ischemic or mixed ATN than with nephrotoxic ATN, and early, aggressive supportive care — including timely RRT and nephrology consultation — improves outcomes [^1135ceKY] [^111egvkS] [^116Y81xG].

---

## Short-term prognosis

- **Mortality**: ICU patients with ATN have high short-term mortality, typically 40–60%, driven by severity of illness, sepsis, and multi-organ failure [^112ooLZ3] [^1123LdjS].

- **Severity correlation**: Mortality rises with AKI severity and organ failure burden; RIFLE "Failure" and AKIN/KDIGO Stage 3 carry the highest risk [^1123LdjS] [^114e878v].

- **Sepsis impact**: Sepsis-associated ATN has particularly high mortality, often exceeding 50% [^114wGoNf] [^112ooLZ3].

---

## Long-term prognosis

- **Renal recovery**: Most survivors regain sufficient function; ~57% normalize, ~33% have mild–moderate CKD, and ~10% have severe CKD at discharge [^116qAAjA].

- **Persistent AKI**: About 10–20% remain dialysis dependent or have persistent AKI, which increases long-term mortality and CKD risk [^111Pz8go] [^115GykE3].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: ATN survivors have higher CKD and ESRD risk than those without AKI, especially with incomplete recovery [^111FCq16] [^117KUjRb].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis** in ICU patients with ATN:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Severity of illness (APACHE, SOFA) | Higher scores predict worse outcomes [^1123LdjS] [^111Pz8go] |
| Sepsis | Increases mortality and delays recovery [^114wGoNf] [^111BGqKq] |
| Multi-organ failure | Strongly associated with mortality [^1123LdjS] |
| Ischemic or mixed ATN | Worse prognosis than nephrotoxic ATN [^1135ceKY] [^112ooLZ3] |
| Age, comorbidities | Older age and comorbidities worsen outcomes [^1137LaDb] |
| Delayed RRT initiation | Associated with higher mortality and delayed recovery [^notfound] |

---

## Impact of renal replacement therapy (RRT)

- **Timing**: Early RRT does not consistently improve survival vs delayed RRT; individualized decisions are recommended [^114kCVZZ] [^113csV6n].

- **Modality**: Continuous RRT may better suit hemodynamically unstable patients, but modality does not clearly change survival [^117G5ZvA] [^115iKrjY].

- **Intensity**: Higher intensity RRT does not improve survival or recovery vs standard intensity [^117XeZS2].

---

## Role of early nephrology consultation

Early nephrology involvement improves recognition, management, and outcomes; **delayed consultation is associated with higher mortality** and longer ICU stay [^116Y81xG] [^117CW1Bf].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

- **Biomarkers**: NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 may aid early diagnosis and risk stratification, but are not yet routine [^116Psxf6] [^1169qAEP].

- **Therapies**: No specific pharmacologic therapy has proven benefit; supportive care remains standard [^116Mvdoq] [^113pLKRg].

- **Research**: Ongoing studies target timing of RRT, fluid management, and novel therapies to improve outcomes [^114kCVZZ] [^113csV6n].

---

ICU patients with ATN have high short-term mortality, with outcomes shaped by illness severity, sepsis, and organ failures; renal recovery is common but incomplete in a substantial minority, increasing long-term risks. Early, aggressive supportive care — including timely RRT and nephrology input — **improves prognosis** [^112WN4v3] [^114LbCtV].

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute tubular necrosis [^111egvkS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is common in hospitalized patients, particularly in the intensive care unit. Over the past four decades, the mortality rate from ATN has remained at 50% to 80%.

Purpose

To review recent studies of diagnosis and treatment strategies for ATN.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search for all clinical studies of therapies for ATN, supplemented by a review of the references of the identified articles.

Study Selection

Prospective studies and major retrospective studies evaluating therapies for ATN.

Data Extraction

Data on the study sample, interventions performed, results, side effects, and duration of follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Early diagnosis of ATN by exclusion of prerenal and postrenal causes of acute renal failure, examination of urinary sediment, and analysis of urine measures (for example, fractional excretion of sodium in the absence of diuretics) can allow the early involvement of nephrologists and improve survival. Enteral rather than parenteral hyperalimentation in severely malnourished patients may improve survival. Sepsis causes 30% to 70% of deaths in patients with ATN; therefore, avoidance of intravenous lines, bladder catheters, and respirators is recommended. Because septic patients are vasodilated, large volumes of administered fluid accumulate in the lung interstitium of these patients. This condition necessitates ventilatory support, which when prolonged leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and increased mortality. More aggressive dialysis (for example, given daily) with biocompatible membranes may improve survival in some patients with acute renal failure.

Conclusions

New information about the importance of early diagnosis and supportive care for patients with ATN has emerged. However, randomized trials of these interventions are needed to test their effect on the morbidity and mortality of ATN.

### Pathophysiologic features and prevention of human and experimental acute tubular necrosis [^113pLKRg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) remains a common and potentially devastating disorder that affects as many as 5% of all hospitalized patients, with a higher prevalence in patients in critical care units. The focus of this article is on categorizing recent pathophysiologic and clinically relevant developments in the field. The vascular and tubular factors in the pathogenesis of ARF, together with the potential mechanisms of recovery and repair of the injured kidney, are discussed. A number of experimental and clinical interventions to prevent. ARF are summarized. Although the clinical treatment of these patients is still largely supportive and many recent clinical trials showed rather negative results, it is hoped that basic research will provide therapeutic tools to improve the grim prognosis of this disease in the future.

### Patients with ischaemic, mixed and nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis in the intensive care unit – a homogeneous population? [^112ooLZ3]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

During the past few decades our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of experimental ARF has advanced considerably. However, little has been integrated into clinical practice to prevent, treat, or accelerate recovery of renal function in patients with ARF. In fact, the mortality rate of patients with ARF remains high, and can exceed 60% when only ICU patients are analyzed.

The nature and severity of the factors that trigger renal failure may partly be responsible for maintaining this increased mortality rate. Nephrotoxic ARF, which is more prevalent in patients hospitalized in medical wards, is associated with lower mortality than ARF of ischaemic aetiology. However, few studies have analyzed the impact that the triggering factor (ischaemic or nephrotoxic) has on ARF mortality, or whether the prognostic factors and characteristics differ among patients with ARF from ischaemic, mixed and nephrotoxic etiology.

In the present study the 524 ICU patients with ARF presented with characteristics similar to those previously reported by other investigators (such as, advanced age, higher proportion of males, presence of multiple organ failure and high mortality rate [62%]). The distribution of the different types of ATN was also similar to those in other studies reporting frequency of ischaemic and mixed ATN. In fact, other studies conducted in ICU patients, both retrospective and prospective, have demonstrated similar trends toward a greater frequency of multifactorial aetiology and reduced incidence of isolated nephrotoxicity as the cause of ATN. However, we found mortality rates in patients with ischaemic (66%) and mixed (63%) ARF to be almost twice the rate in patients with nephrotoxic ARF (38%). Weisberg and coworkers analyzed the placebo group in the Auriculin Anaritide Acute Renal Failure Study and, consistent with the findings of the present study, reported mortality rates in patients with ischaemic and mixed ARF to be three times the rate in patients with nephrotoxic ARF. It is conceivable that ischaemia is a determining factor in mortality rates in patients with ARF. Several prospective studies have demonstrated the impact of ischaemic factors (hypotension, shock, use of vasoactive drugs, sepsis) on mortality rates in patients with ARF. By means of a prognostic score (Acute Tubular Necrosis-Individual Severity Index [ATN-ISI]), Liaño and coworkers clearly demonstrated the protective effect of nephrotoxicity and the negative impact of ischaemia on mortality rates in this population.

### Patients with ischaemic, mixed and nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis in the intensive care unit – a homogeneous population? [^112tQNJx]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute renal failure (ARF) is frequent in intensive care units (ICUs), affecting up to 30% of patients. It carries high morbidity, increases the length of hospital stay, increases hospital costs, is associated with high rates of mortality (60% or more) and is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in critically ill patients. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN), diagnosis of which is usually based on clinical findings, is the most common cause of ARF in the hospital and in the ICU. ATN may occur after ischaemic or nephrotoxic injury or after a combination of both (mixed ATN). Surprisingly, few studies have analyzed the three types of ATN separately, with almost all analyzing ATN as a single entity, without distinction between aetiologies. Even recent consensus reports did not comment on the origin of ARF.

In the present study we evaluated a large cohort of ICU patients with a diagnosis of ATN, aiming to assess whether there were significant differences in demographic data, clinical picture and mortality between ischaemic, nephrotoxic and mixed ATN.

### The intensive care medicine agenda on acute kidney injury [^116xyTFD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in the critically ill. Current standard of care mainly relies on identification of patients at risk, haemodynamic optimization, avoidance of nephrotoxicity and the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in established AKI. The detection of early biomarkers of renal tissue damage is a recent development that allows amending the late and insensitive diagnosis with current AKI criteria. Increasing evidence suggests that the consequences of an episode of AKI extend long beyond the acute hospitalization. Citrate has been established as the anticoagulant of choice for continuous RRT. Conflicting results have been published on the optimal timing of RRT and on the renoprotective effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning. Recent research has contradicted that acute tubular necrosis is the common pathology in AKI, that septic AKI is due to global kidney hypoperfusion, that aggressive fluid therapy benefits the kidney, that vasopressor therapy harms the kidney and that high doses of RRT improve outcome. Remaining uncertainties include the impact of aetiology and clinical context on pathophysiology, therapy and prognosis, the clinical benefit of biomarker-driven interventions, the optimal mode of RRT to improve short- and long-term patient and kidney outcomes, the contribution of AKI to failure of other organs and the optimal approach for assessing and promoting renal recovery. Based on the established gaps in current knowledge the trials that must have priority in the coming 10 years are proposed together with the definition of appropriate clinical endpoints.

### Management of acute kidney injury / renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit [^114LbCtV]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Common causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the ICU setting include acute tubular necrosis (due to shock, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, or procedures that compromise renal perfusion), abdominal compartment syndrome, urinary retention, and interstitial nephritis. Treatment is geared toward addressing the underlying cause. Dialysis may be required if renal injury does not resolve. Early initiation of dialysis based on the stage of AKI alone has not been shown to provide a mortality benefit. Dialysis modalities are based on the dialysis indication and the patient's clinical status. Providers should pay close attention to nutritional requirements and medication dosing according to renal function and dialysis modality.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had pre-renal ARF (defined as normalization or significant decrease in SCr over 24 hours after optimization of volume or heart function); post-renal ARF; or known or suspected diagnosis of vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, or acute interstitial nephritis. Patients were also excluded if they had a diagnosis of severe chronic renal failure (patients on chronic dialysis or with usual baseline SCr > 4 mg/dl), if hospitalization time was under 24 hours, if they did not have previous SCr measurements and history, renal ultrasound and laboratory examinations did not allow a clear diagnosis of ARF, and if the patient files were incomplete.

Characterization of the population and demographic data

The following data were recorded: age, sex, presence of a co-morbid condition, patient classification (medical or surgical), reason for ICU hospitalization, ICU hospitalization time (from ICU admission to ICU discharge or death), SCr concentration (admission, peak and discharge or death), admission APACHE II score and patient outcome.

Complications of acute renal failure

The patients were screened for various potential complications developing after the diagnosis of acute renal failure (Table 1). The use of dialysis was also recorded.

Other organ failures

Patients were analyzed for failure of other organs and systems developing at any time during their ICU stay, using the following definitions. Respiratory failure was deemed to be present if there was a need for mechanical ventilation. Acute liver failure was defined as increased total bilirubin and/or prothrombin time greater than 60 s and/or International Normalized Ratio above 1.8 and/or hepatic encephalopathy developing up to 8 weeks after the beginning of liver disease associated with increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Circulatory failure was defined as need for vasoactive drugs for maintenance of blood pressure. Central nervous system failure was considered to be present if the Glasgow Come Scale score was 8 or less. Finally, multiple organ failure was defined as simultaneous failure of three or more organs.

### Acute kidney injury: what's the prognosis? [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common (especially during critical illness), increasing in incidence, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited and functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. Emerging novel biomarkers are, however, likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis. Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill and over the past few years insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared with those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists and further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### Pathophysiology of septic acute kidney injury: what do we really know? [^116ud3yc]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Septic acute kidney injury accounts for close to 50% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit and, in its various forms, affects between 15% and 20% of intensive care unit patients. However, there is little we really know about its pathophysiology. Although hemodynamic factors might play a role in the loss of glomerular filtration rate, they may not act through the induction of renal ischemia. Septic acute renal failure may, at least in patients with a hyperdynamic circulation, represent a unique form of acute renal failure: hyperemic acute renal failure. Measurements of renal blood flow in septic humans are now needed to resolve this pivotal pathophysiological question. Whatever may happen to renal blood flow during septic acute kidney injury in humans, the evidence available suggests that urinalysis fails to provide useful diagnostic or prognostic information in this setting. In addition, nonhemodynamic mechanisms of cell injury are likely to be at work. These mechanisms are likely due to a combination of immunologic, toxic, and inflammatory factors that may affect the microvasculature and the tubular cells. Among these mechanisms, apoptosis may turn out to be important. It is possible that, as evidence accumulates, the paradigms currently used to explain acute renal failure in sepsis will shift from ischemia and vasoconstriction to hyperemia and vasodilation and from acute tubular necrosis to acute tubular apoptosis or simply tubular cell dysfunction or exfoliation. If this were to happen, our therapeutic approaches would also be profoundly altered.

### Long-term outcome of acute tubular necrosis: a contribution to its natural history [^1137LaDb]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

As long-term outcome studies of acute renal failure (ARF) are scarce and non-homogeneous, we studied 187 consecutive acute tubular necrosis (ATN) patients without previous nephropathies, discharged alive from our hospital between October 77 and December 92 and followed-up until December 99 (range 7–22 years; median 7.2). Variables were analyzed at the time of the acute episode and during follow-up. In 2000–2001 a clinical evaluation was made in 58 of the 82 patients still alive. Ten patients were lost to follow-up and 95 died. In 59% death was related with the disease present when the ATN developed. Kaplan-Meir survival curve showed 89, 67, 50, and 40% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, after discharge. Survival curves were significantly better (log-rank P < 0.001) among the youngest, those surviving a polytrauma, those without comorbidity and surprisingly those treated in intensive care units. The proportional Cox model showed that age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04 per year of age; P = 0.000), presence of comorbid factors (HR 4.29; P = 0.006), surgical admission (HR 0.45; P = 0.000), and male sex (HR 1.72; P = 0.020) were the variables associated with long-term follow-up. In the evaluated patients renal function was normal in 81%. Long-term outcome after ARF depends on absence of co-morbid factors, cause of initial admission and age. Although the late mortality rate is high and related with the original disease, renal function is adequate in most patients.

### AKI in the ICU: definition, epidemiology, risk stratification, and outcomes [^112h8swj]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has emerged as a major public health problem that affects millions of patients worldwide and leads to decreased survival and increased progression of underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent consensus criteria for definition and classification of AKI have provided more consistent estimates of AKI epidemiology. Patients, in particular those in the ICU, are dying of AKI and not just simply with AKI. Even small changes in serum creatinine concentrations are associated with a substantial increase in the risk of death. AKI is not a single disease but rather a syndrome comprising multiple clinical conditions. Outcomes from AKI depend on the underlying disease, the severity and duration of renal impairment, and the patient's renal baseline condition. The development of AKI is the consequence of complex interactions between the actual insult and subsequent activation of inflammation and coagulation. Contrary to the conventional view, recent experimental and clinical data argue against renal ischemia-reperfusion as a sine qua non condition for the development of AKI. Loss of renal function can occur without histological signs of tubular damage or even necrosis. The detrimental effects of AKI are not limited to classical well-known symptoms such as fluid overload and electrolyte abnormalities. AKI can also lead to problems that are not readily appreciated at the bedside and can extend well beyond the ICU stay, including progression of CKD and impaired innate immunity. Experimental and small observational studies provide evidence that AKI impairs (innate) immunity and is associated with higher infection rates.

### Acute kidney injury [^113Ghui6]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of acute pathology in the kidney are major clinical problems. Azotemia and oliguria represent not only disease but normal responses of the kidney to extracellular volume depletion or decreased renal blood flow. Changes in urine output and glomerular filtration rate are therefore neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of renal pathology. However, no simple alternative for the diagnosis currently exists. By examining both glomerular and tubular function, clinicians routinely make inferences not only on the presence of renal dysfunction but also on its cause. However, pure prerenal physiology is unusual in hospitalized patients, and its effects are not necessary benign. Sepsis, the most common condition associated with acute renal failure in the intensive care unit, may alter renal function without any characteristic changes in urine indices, and classification of these abnormalities as prerenal will undoubtedly lead to incorrect management decisions. The clinical syndrome known as acute tubular necrosis does not actually manifest the morphologic changes that the name implies. A precise biochemical definition of acute renal failure has never been proposed, and until recently, there has been no consensus on the diagnostic criteria or clinical definition. Depending on the definition used, acute renal failure has been reported to affect from 1% to 25% of intensive care unit patients and has led to mortality rates ranging from 15% to 60%. From this chaos, two principles emerged: first, the need for a standard definition and, second, the need to classify the severity of the syndrome rather than only consider its most severe form. The RIFLE criteria were developed to achieve these goals, and the term acute kidney injury has been proposed to encompass the entire spectrum of the syndrome, from minor changes in renal function to requirement for renal replacement therapy. Thus, acute kidney injury is not acute tubular necrosis, nor is it renal failure. Small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and are associated with significant changes in short-term and possibly long-term outcomes. The RIFLE criteria provide a uniform definition of acute kidney injury and have now been validated in numerous studies.

Assessment of hospital survival with respect to acute kidney injury duration. A total of 447 patients were included in this study, including 283 patients (63.3%) with an acute kidney injury at admission (175 and 108 patients with persistent and transient acute kidney injury, respectively). Patients with persistent acute kidney injury more frequently had stage 3 acute kidney injury (42.9% vs 30.6%; p = 0.04). Hospital survival was 76.2% (n = 125) in patients without acute kidney injury, 70.4% (n = 76) in patients with transient acute kidney injury, and 61.1% (n = 107) in patients with persistent acute kidney injury. After adjustment for confounding factors, the factors associated with lower hospital survival were the need for vasopressors (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.98) and the presence of persistent acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36–0.95). When included in the final model, stage 3 acute kidney injury was independently associated with a lower hospital survival (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98), and persistent acute kidney injury was no longer associated with outcome.

Conclusion

Two thirds of the critically ill patients with acute kidney injury have persistent acute kidney injury. Although mortality increased progressively with the duration of acute kidney injury, we found no independent association between this duration and patient outcome when the acute kidney injury severity is taken into account. Our results suggest that the classical "prerenal acute kidney injury" and "acute tubular necrosis" paradigm might be of limited interest from a pathophysiological or prognostic point of view.

### The prognostic importance of duration of AKI: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137XBF5]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

This review also focuses attention on the fact that a patient who experiences a large but transient increase in serum creatinine is prognostically different from patient who experiences a sustained increase in serum creatinine. While the current classification of AKI assigns higher risk to the first patient given the rise in creatinine is numerically higher, the findings suggest that the second patient has equal or higher risk of worse outcomes. Further research is needed as how to effectively treat such patients and whether close follow up of these patient's post- hospital discharge improves outcomes.

Duration of AKI could be similar to or atleast an overlap to the concept of "kidney recovery" at hospital discharge. Recently, Kellum et al. characterized various patterns of kidney recovery after an episode of AKI and related these patterns to long term outcomes. They found that early reversal was associated with the shortest ICU stay and best prognosis, 1-year survival, 90.2% and those who never recovered or had reversal with relapse had the worst prognosis, 1-year survival, 40%. These results are similar to our findings of longer duration of AKI with worse long-term mortality.

The findings herein have additional implications with regards to clinical trials. Using mathematical modeling of creatinine changes in AKI, it has been suggested that incorporating time to creatinine elevation into AKI definitions may be a more efficient and a less biased way of ascertainment of outcomes in interventional trials for AKI. Therefore, one could propose that AKI duration should be considered to improve the endpoints for phase 2 trials of new agents instead of just incident AKI by peak creatinine as an outcome. The downside of using incident AKI as an outcome is that an investigational drug/therapy will have to work at a particular time point or earlier (for example in pre-renal phase of Acute Tubular Necrosis, ATN) to reduce AKI incidence. In contrast, if duration of AKI is employed as an outcome, one can show the intervention to be effective if it works on any of the phases of ATN (initiation, propagation, maintenance, and recovery phases), thereby decreasing duration of AKI. Moreover, long duration of AKI might serve as an enrollment criterion for interventions that aim to abrogate the transition from AKI to CKD.

### Renal recovery from acute tubular necrosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a prospective study in critically ill patients [^116qAAjA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) resulting from irreversible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) are controversial. This prospective cohort study was designed to assess the need for short- and long-term dialysis in critically ill patients with severe ATN and to define risk factors for lack of renal recovery.

Methods

433 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed severe ATN necessitating renal replacement therapy were enrolled. Eight patients were excluded because renal biopsy revealed another cause of acute renal failure. None of the remaining 425 patients had pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency. Primary outcome criteria were recovery of renal function at discharge and ESRD status at 1 year follow-up.

Results

The overall in-hospital mortality of the cohort was 47%. At discharge, 57% of the 226 surviving patients had normal renal function, 33% had mild to moderate renal failure (serum creatinine: 1.3–3 mg/dl) and 10% had severe renal failure (serum creatinine: 3–6 mg/dl). Multivariate analysis showed that neither patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbid conditions), severity of illness (APACHE III, number of failed organs) nor mode and duration of renal replacement therapy were related to recovery of renal function. After 1 year, 76 of the surviving patients had died and in one patient chronic renal failure had progressed to ESRD.

Conclusions

If critically ill patients with normal renal function prior to the renal insults survive the precipitating cause of ATN, the overwhelming majority will recover sufficient renal function.

### Acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: current trends in incidence and outcome [^117QEheJ]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem with significant clinical and economic consequences. A number of studies point to a rising incidence of AKI in the hospital and in the intensive care unit over the past several years, and an increase in the degree of co-morbidity associated with it. Recent evidence suggests that there has been some improvement in outcomes over time. Nevertheless, the mortality associated with AKI remains unacceptably high, and further work is needed. Recently developed consensus definitions will be useful in this regard.

### Acute kidney injury in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients requiring dialysis: experience from India and Pakistan [^116RpKMt]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the first description of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) following a new coronavirus in 2019, the world has been grappling with a pandemic impacting more than 220 countries and territories worldwide. The virus, designated as COVID-19 by WHO, has as of now, affected more than 426 million people with more than 5.9 million dying of this infection. The Indian subcontinent has also seen the devastating impact of this virus.

The kidney is affected in many ways in COVID-19 infection with the most important clinical manifestation being acute kidney injury (AKI). The underlying pathophysiology of AKI is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) which develops secondary to both ischemic (volume depletion, relative intravascular volume deficit in cytokine storm) and nephrotoxic (therapy of COVID-19 infection) insults. There are also some reports of direct cytopathic effect of the virus on the kidney. The incidence of AKI is high in the hospitalized patients as many of the underlying causative factors are present in the critically ill. Almost 20% of critically ill COVID 19 infected patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) need renal replacement therapy (RRT). The mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID -19 and AKI is relatively high and development of AKI is a poor prognostic factor impacting outcome in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia.

In this study, we have examined the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and therapeutic interventions in critically ill patients with AKI admitted to the ICU in two centres, one each in India and Pakistan, with a view to looking at the prognostic factors for mortality in the Indian sub-continental population.

### Septic acute kidney injury: molecular mechanisms and the importance of stratification and targeting therapy [^114wGoNf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a very common and especially formidable clinical problem in the ICU, where mortality rates approach 25% and soar to 50 to 60% when severe enough to require renal replacement therapy. These statistics have not significantly improved over the past 50 years, though patients today are generally older and have more comorbidities. The most common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients is sepsis, and AKI occurs with regularity even in non-severe sepsis where clinically evident hemodynamic changes are not readily apparent. The combination of sepsis and AKI portends a dire clinical situation that is associated with a hospital mortality rate as high as 70%. However, the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms undergirding the association between sepsis and the clinical manifestations of AKI are not completely understood.

In this review, we will first summarize the findings of published human studies that support the concept that the pathogenesis of septic AKI in humans should not be exclusively viewed in the context of distributive shock-associated ischemia, but rather also within the context of a dysregulated and ill-defined inflammatory response to septic stimuli. We then discuss why previous attempts at modulating the inflammatory response in septic AKI may have failed, and highlight more recent trials and therapies aimed at targeted treatment based on where patients lie along the immunologic spectrum. We also discuss the role Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been shown to play in endotoxemic models of AKI, and again focus on why agents used to block TLR-related pathways may have failed to show significant clinical benefit. Finally, we review the data supporting and refuting a central role for apoptosis in septic AKI, and argue that much of the clinical manifestations in septic AKI occur prior to significant cell death secondary to apoptosis or necrosis.

Septic acute kidney injury: is it hyperemic kidney injury?

The morphologic changes that are seen in classic ischemic and toxic acute tubular necrosis are often lacking or are microscopically distinct in septic AKI. While the use of renal biopsy in the management of septic AKI is exceedingly rare in many western nations, most human studies have found no consistent histopathologic changes in septic AKI, and acute tubular necrosis is infrequently observed. In a systematic review of six studies describing histopathologic changes seen in septic AKI, Langenberg and colleagues found that tubular epithelial cell necrosis was seen in only 22% of human samples taken after septic injury. A more recent study by Takasu and colleagues examined post-mortem kidneys taken from 67 patients who died with sepsis, and while they found focal tubular injury in 78% of septic kidneys, the majority of tubular cells were normal.

### Risk factors, clinical features and outcome of new-onset acute kidney injury among critically ill patients: a database analysis based on prospective cohort study [^114ZaayU]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study found that the new-onset AKI was associated with higher 28-day mortality and longer length of hospital stay. The patients with new-onset AKI had a probability for 28-day mortality that was 0.6 times higher compared with those without AKI, even after adjusting for a large number of possible confounders. However, only persistent AKI is associated with increased 28-day mortality rather than transient AKI. The prognostic impact of transient AKI remains controversy in previous studies. A large multicenter cohort study demonstrated that both transient and persistent AKI were independently associated with a poor outcome, and that patients with persistent AKI had a higher risk of death than patients with transient AKI. Our results differ somewhat from previous studies, which focused on all hospitalized patients. Our results are similar to a recent study of septic patients that also came to the conclusion that only persistent AKI is associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality. The strong association between persistent AKI and the poor outcome can be explained as follows: the long duration of AKI indicates the exacerbated physiologic profiles and the poor prognosis. In addition, the pathophysiological mechanism of transient AKI and persistent AKI may be different. Transient AKI is considered to be "prerenal dysfunction", while AKI that has not been recovered for a long time is more related to "acute tubular necrosis". Our results suggest for future clinical research to consider that quick and spontaneous resolving AKI may dilute trials and should not be the target of new treatment trials, and highlight the importance for clinician to put more value on duration of kidney injury. The uncertainty of illness makes it difficult for intensivists to predict transient and persistent AKI, but the several independent variables reported in Table 3 could help to distinguish persistent AKI. In our result, none of the transient AKI patient had RRT even though 15.3% of them had stage 3 AKI (Table 4), and in clinical practice, RRT should be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary intervention for patients who are unlikely to develop persistent AKI.

### Acute kidney injury in non-critical care setting: elaboration and validation of an in-hospital death prognosis score [^111iYa8Q]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The analysis of causes also showed high proportion of age-related AKI. Functional AKI remains the main cause, related to medicines such as NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARA 2 or diuretics. Older age and polypharmacy are the cornerstone of functional AKI as reported by Anderson et al in a recent meta-analysis. ATN were the second major cause, mainly due to prolonged ischemia or shock. Noteworthy, obstructive etiologies only represented 10% of cases in an old manly cohort, suggesting local recruitment bias: those patients are often first addressed to the urologist. In other studies, obstructive nephropathy and acute tubular necrosis also greatly contributed to AKI. ATN, hepatorenal and cardiorenal syndromes, multiple myeloma were more observed in deceased compared to surviving patients, yet only multiple myeloma remained independently associated with death. Indeed, whatever the underlying mechanism, renal lesions are of bad prognosis during multiple myeloma. Moreover, those patients are more prone to sepsis because of their immunosuppressive status related to the disease itself or secondary to chemotherapy. Chertow et al showed immunosuppression as a major factor of death in ATN-associated AKI. Selby and colleagues described neoplasia as the third cause of death (after sepsis and cardiovascular events) during an AKI episode.

Renal replacement therapy was performed in 25% of AKI cases, and dialysis requirement was more frequent in deceased patients. Mesropian et al reported only 3.6 and 5.1% of dialyzed patients, while Schissler et al described 5.5 and 5.9%, respectively in community- and hospital-acquired AKI. On the contrary, 42 and 47% of cases were dialyzed in a Chinese report, yet including ICU patients. This shed light on the extreme subjective criteria for dialysis initiation, probably depending on the physician and the comorbidities and age of patients. Hsu et al demonstrated that older patients with high number of comorbidities are less prone to benefit from invasive procedures accompanying renal replacement therapy. Interestingly, a recent study showed a lower in-hospital mortality when physicians adhere to an algorithm providing recommendations on RRT initiation, yet only for low disease severity cases.

### Intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^117XeZS2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ATN was published by VA/NIH Acute Renal Failure Trial Network and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury. In the ATN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of intensive renal support in critically ill patients with AKI? In the ATN study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ATN study, the population was: 1124 patients (331 female, 793 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients with AKI and failure of at least one nonrenal organ or sepsis. The key exclusion criteria were > 1 hemodialysis treatment or > 24 hours of continuous RRT, prior kidney transplant, pregnancy, moribund state, acute renal failure due to an etiology other than acute tubular necrosis, or weight > 128.5 kg. In the ATN study, the interventions were: n = 563 intensive RRT (intermittent hemodialysis and sustained low-efficiency dialysis six times per week and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 35 mL/kg of body weight per hour) n = 561 less-intensive RRT (the corresponding treatments provided thrice weekly and at 20 mL/kg/hr). In the ATN study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 60 days (53.6% vs. 51.5%; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.4). In the ATN study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in the rate of recovery of kidney function by day 28 (24.3% vs. 27.4%; OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07) No significant difference in in-hospital death (51.2% vs. 48%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.47) Borderline significant increase in RRT-free days (6 vs. 7;). In the ATN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse event (51.0% vs. 49.9%, p = 0.72) and hypotension requiring treatment discontinuation (9.8% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.55). significant differences in hypokalemia (7.5% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.03) and hypophosphatemia (17.6% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.001). In the ATN study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients with AKI and failure of at least one nonrenal organ or sepsis, intensive RRT was not superior to less-intensive RRT with respect to death at 60 days.

### The assessment, serial evaluation, and subsequent sequelae of acute kidney injury (ASSESS-AKI) study: design and methods [^115qFv1e]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Definition of AKI

We recognize the limitations of the most recently proposed definitions for AKI (i.e. RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network [AKIN]), which are based only on changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output. However, despite enthusiasm for potentially more sensitive and specific novel serum and urine biomarkers, to date, none have been sufficiently validated as better measures of AKI or of subsequent prognosis than serum creatinine-based AKI criteria. A major goal of ASSESS-AKI is to provide key insights into the prognostic value of novel AKI biomarkers. Therefore, AKI will be operationalized as follows which is anticipated to capture a broad spectrum of kidney injury. For adult participants, AKI will be defined as ≥ 50% relative increase and/or absolute increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26 μmol/L) in peak inpatient serum creatinine compared with baseline outpatient serum creatinine. For pediatric participants, AKI will be defined as ≥ 50% relative increase in peak inpatient serum creatinine compared with baseline serum creatinine. We did not incorporate urine output criteria from the AKIN classification scheme because of concern about the systematic availability and quality of data about urine output, especially in non-ICU patients who are unlikely to have indwelling urinary catheters. Furthermore, incorporating the urine output criteria for AKIN might overly enrich our cohort for patients with pre-renal azotemia.

To enhance the likelihood of enrolling an adequate number of adult participants with more severe AKI, we have set an enrollment target of at least one third of AKI participants having ≥ 100% relative increase in serum creatinine. To increase the probability of having an adequate number of adult participants with AKI due to causes other than rapidly reversible pre-renal azotemia, we have set an enrollment target of at least one third of AKI participants who meet AKI criteria lasting ≥ 48 hours. These additional enrollment targets are not mutually exclusive, and we anticipate significant overlap in these pre-specified subgroups. Furthermore, study nephrologists at each participating site will review selected index hospitalization information to classify each enrolled AKI case into one of the following presumptive categories: acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and other/unknown.

### Mortality and host response aberrations associated with transient and persistent acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with sepsis: a prospective cohort study [^113roTx3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous syndrome occurring in one out of two critically ill patients, associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, cardiovascular complications, and persistent renal dysfunction. Sepsis is the main cause of AKI in intensive care units (ICUs), accounting for 50% of all cases. The complex pathophysiology of sepsis and the high burden of AKI in this context led to define the simultaneous presence of both syndromes as sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI). Except for renal replacement therapy, no specific treatment exists to date.

Besides the severity of renal dysfunction, various patterns of renal recovery may impact the outcome of S-AKI. Because the definition of recovery has been equivocal, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative Workgroup (ADQI) recently proposed to further classify AKI as "transient" or "persistent" according to a duration of less or more than 48 hours, respectively. This definition is based on expert opinion and awaits clinical validation.

The singularity of S-AKI pathogenesis has been underlined by the description of normal to increased renal blood flow and modest histopathological findings, contrasting with the long-standing theory of renal hypoperfusion-induced acute tubular necrosis. Experimental studies suggest a role for oxidative stress, inflammation, microvascular shunting, and tubular cell stress, but data in patients are scarce and the influence of the unbalanced sepsis host response on recovery from S-AKI is unknown.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence and mortality associated with transient and persistent AKI in critically ill patients admitted with sepsis using the new ADQI definitions. Additionally, we sought to determine differences in the host response to the inciting sepsis event between patients without AKI, and those with transient or persistent AKI by analysis of plasma biomarkers implicated in the pathogenesis of critical illness and whole-genome blood leukocyte transcriptomes.

This work was partially presented at the French Intensive Care Society international Congress on February 5–7, 2020, in Paris.

### Long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury [^115YSAnU]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney dysfunction is a common problem in intensive care units. It is not only associated with increased morbidity and mortality but also with increased healthcare costs. Limited healthcare budgets have now raised the issue of how much therapy should be dedicated to these critically ill patients. A precondition for any further discussion on this topic is the question on the long-term outcome and quality of life of these patients. However, only limited data are available in this field. In this review, we will focus on the existing literature, considering not only acute renal failure patients requiring renal replacement therapy but also those patients with mild or moderate impaired renal function. The intention of this review is to show that acute kidney injury is an important but often underestimated disease and a disease that deserves major attention because it is associated with impaired short- and long-term outcome. We will demonstrate that acute kidney injury patients requiring dialysis have a reasonable long-term survival rate and good quality of life. There is no doubt that aggressive intensive care unit treatment is justified in these patients, irrespective of the health costs.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients who underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy for histological diagnosis of their renal disease [^115CNw3Y]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic end-stage renal disease (ESRD). AKI is also associated with increased short- and long-term mortality rates. AKI is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome observed mainly in elderly patients with several comorbidities. These patients are usually admitted to intensive care units (ICU), and AKI is primarily attributed to sepsis in such cases. Percutaneous renal biopsy is usually contraindicated in these patients to prevent complications, and they are usually diagnosed with "acute tubular necrosis".

In contrast, some kidney diseases such as glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis, among other such clinical conditions require histopathological analysis of kidney tissue specimens to accurately determine diagnosis, disease activity and chronicity. Notably, most epidemiological studies have investigated patients with AKI have not included this patient population in the analysis. For example, a meta-analysis analyzed the worldwide incidence of AKI observed that studies primarily included patients admitted to the ICU and those who underwent cardiac surgery.

Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors associated with AKI in hospitalized patients who underwent kidney biopsy for histopathological diagnosis.

### Failing kidneys: renal replacement therapies in the ICU [^114yRzpN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) impacts between a third and a half of all intensive care unit (ICU) patients with approximately 20% of patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). It is one of the most common organ dysfunctions experienced by critically ill or injured surgical patients. Within the trauma population, incidence is greatly impacted by the type of injury with AKI occurring in up to 25% of ICU patients after blunt trauma and 40% of burn patients. A recent cohort study of patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center demonstrated an AKI incidence of 45%. 69% of the AKI group (31% of all patients) had signs of renal dysfunction at admission, but the majority experienced renal recovery within 2 days. The incidence of AKI after surgery ranges from 5% after major abdominal surgeries to nearly 50% after orthotopic liver transplantation. Common causes of AKI in the post-trauma and postsurgical groups include acute tubular necrosis resulting from renal ischemia secondary to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, or shock state, systemic inflammatory response, and nephrotoxic agents including many medications especially antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and myoglobin from rhabdomyolysis. The presence of AKI increases overall hospital mortality. A recent Trauma Quality Improvement Process (TQIP) analysis of patients with severe AKI demonstrated a mortality rate of 28%. The risk of death increases to 50% among all ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT within the first week of ICU admission.

### Risk of poor outcomes with novel and traditional biomarkers at clinical AKI diagnosis [^1169qAEP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Studies have evaluated acute kidney injury (AKI) using biomarkers in various settings, but their prognostic utility within current practice is unclear. Thus, we sought to determine the prognostic utility of newer biomarkers or traditional markers (fractional excretion of sodium [FeNa] and urea [FeUrea] and microscopy) over clinical assessment alone.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This is a prospective cohort study of adults on the first day of meeting AKI criteria. We measured urine concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and IL-18 and determined FeNa, FeUrea, and microscopy score for casts and tubular cells. Primary outcome was worsened AKI stage from enrollment to peak serum creatinine or in-hospital death.

Results

In 249 recipients, 57% were ≥ 65 years old, 48% were from intensive care, and mean baseline GFR was 69 ± 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). AKI was considered prerenal in 164 (66%), acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in 51 (20%), and "other" in 34 (14%). All mean protein biomarker concentrations, FeNa, FeUrea, and microscopy scores were statistically different between prerenal and ATN. Seventy-two patients (29%) developed the primary outcome. There was an approximate three-fold increase in adjusted risk for the outcome for upper versus lower values of NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18, and microscopy score (P values < 0.05). Net reclassification improved after adding these to baseline clinical assessment. FeNa and FeUrea were not useful.

Conclusions

On the first day of AKI, urine protein biomarkers and microscopy significantly improve upon clinical determination of prognosis, indicating their potential utility in current practice.

### Managing malaria in the intensive care unit [^116NpSS9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury

AKI in malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum, although it has been reported with other species. The WHO uses a serum creatinine of > 265 µmol litre −1 (or ≥ 3 mg dL −1) as a criterion for severe malaria, although this definition is at variance with commonly applied definitions of AKI. AKI is particularly common among individuals who did not grow up in endemic regions, suggesting that it may be more common in the malaria-naïve. – The incidence of AKI in severe malaria varies from 1 to 5% in endemic areas, but the rate of AKI is much higher in series of imported malaria (ranging from 23 to > 50%). – Cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes to glomerular and tubular vascular beds, cytokine release, immune complex deposition, hypovolaemia, and haemolysis may all be contributory. – Histopathological findings of AKI in severe malaria include acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephritis, although tubular changes are the most common findings.

All patients with falciparum malaria should be screened for AKI, which may not develop until several days after the onset of fever and can be non-oliguric. Management is supportive with maintenance of fluid balance and electrolytes and renal replacement therapy as indicated. Trials of both dopamine and epinephrine have been performed in severe malaria, but neither has been shown to improve renal oxygen metabolism nor function. Artemisinin doses do not need adjusting in AKI; however, quinine may accumulate, so doses should be reduced by one-third after 48 h of established renal failure, unless renal replacement therapy has been initiated. The prognosis of AKI associated with severe malaria is usually good, and it inevitably resolves in days to weeks. A recent UK series found that even those patients with persisting renal impairment at discharge from ICU ultimately recovered their renal function.

### Prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and AKI who initiate RRT [^112T3stj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Literature on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis who require RRT for AKI is sparse and is confounded by liver transplant eligibility. An update on outcomes in the nonlisted subgroup is needed. Our objective was to compare outcomes in this group between those diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and acute tubular necrosis, stratifying by liver transplant listing status.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis acutely initiated on hemodialysis or continuous RRT at five hospitals, including one liver transplant center. Multivariable regression and survival analysis were performed.

Results

Four hundred seventy-two subjects were analyzed (341 not listed and 131 listed for liver transplant). Among nonlisted subjects, 15% (51 of 341) were alive at 6 months after initiating RRT. Median survival was 21 (interquartile range [IQR], 8, 70) days for those diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and 12 (IQR, 3, 43) days for those diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (P = 0.25). Among listed subjects, 48% (63 of 131) received a liver transplant. Median transplant-free survival was 15 (IQR, 5, 37) days for those diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and 14 (IQR, 4, 31) days for those diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (P = 0.60). When stratified by transplant listing, with adjusted Cox models we did not detect a difference in the risk of death between hepatorenal syndrome and acute tubular necrosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.59 to 1.11, among those not listed; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.19, among those listed).

Conclusions

Cause of AKI was not significantly associated with mortality in patients with cirrhosis who required RRT. Among those not listed for liver transplant, mortality rates were extremely high in patients both with hepatorenal syndrome and acute tubular necrosis.

### Acute kidney injury [^112WN4v3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute kidney injury:

- **Definition**: AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function resulting from structural or functional injury that is characterized by decreased GFR, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria.
- **Pathophysiology**: AKI has multiple possible causes, including renal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis), or obstruction to the emptying of the kidneys (post-renal AKI).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AKI in the US is estimated at 179–317 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Hypoperfusion of the kidneys with resultant ischemic injury represents the most important group of etiologies, mediating AKI through cellular injury caused by a mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with AKI do not recover renal function by hospital discharge. In this group of patients, AKI is associated with 1-year age-adjusted mortality of approximately 60%, compared to approximately 10% in patients who recovered renal function within 7 days.

### AKI patients have worse long-term outcomes, especially in the immediate post-ICU period [^117MGxNC]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with worse outcome in the acute phase of acute illness but also in the chronic phase. In a large Danish study in this issue of Critical Care, 1-year mortality was higher in patients with AKI than in patients without AKI. Mortality was most important during the first 50 days after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas after 2 months the survival curves of patients with AKI and those of patients without AKI were similar. The reasons for this observation are not clear, but protracted critical illness and fragility after acute critical illness probably play important roles. Because we see more and more of these patients, they should be the focus of ICU research. Consequently, ICU and post-ICU care for these patients requires focus and a more integrated approach to the specific problems of these survivors of acute critical illness.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^117G5ZvA]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in HRS-AKI — indications, modality, and outcomes: In general, RRT in patients with HRS-AKI unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy is indicated as a bridge to liver transplantation (LT) for current candidates or those who may become candidates to treat volume overload, electrolyte derangements, or uremia. Prognosis remains guarded, with mortality of 59% in patients requiring > 7 days of RRT, and continuous RRT is preferred due to lower fluid shifts and reduced hemodynamic instability compared with intermittent RRT. Two-thirds of patients with HRS-AKI undergoing RRT pretransplantation recover renal function after LT; the cutoff duration of RRT predicting renal recovery is approximately 14 days, and for every additional day of dialysis pretransplantation there is a 3.6%–6% increased risk for renal nonrecovery post-transplantation. RRT is also indicated in patients with all AKI etiologies if they are LT candidates or may become candidates, and in non-candidates if they have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or when etiology is uncertain for a limited period.

### Hypoalbuminemia and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of observational clinical studies [^112UU4Y1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Included studies

The process of study selection is depicted in Fig. 1. After initial screening and examination of retrieved full clinical study reports, 51 candidate reports were selected for possible inclusion. Of those, 34 were excluded upon detailed review. By far the most common basis for exclusion, accounting for 23 of the 34 excluded reports, was lack of multivariate analysis. The typical data presentation in those studies was a univariate comparison of mean serum albumin levels between patients who did or did not develop AKI. Other grounds for exclusion were assessment of end points other than AKI in four reports, predictors other than serum albumin in three, or patients with end-stage renal disease or chronic kidney disease in four studies.

Fig. 1
Study selection process

Seventeen studies reported from 1989 to 2009 with 3,917 total patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria, including multivariate analysis of hypoalbuminemia as an independent outcome predictor, and were included in the meta-analysis. None was unpublished.

Eleven of the studies, six in surgical or intensive care unit (ICU) patients and five in other hospital environments, addressed the role of hypoalbuminemia in AKI development (Table 1). The remaining six studies dealt with the relationship between hypoalbuminemia and mortality among patients who had already developed AKI (Table 2).

In 9 of the 11 studies on AKI development, none of the study patients presented with pre-existing AKI at baseline. In the other two such studies, 93 and 92% of the patients were free of pre-existing AKI at baseline.

### Acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: an update and primer for the intensivist [^116Ayr1e]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute kidney injury is common in critically ill patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients across the spectrum of critical illness have acute kidney injury. This requires clinicians from across disciplines to be familiar with recent advances in definitions, diagnosis, prevention, and management of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit. The purpose of this concise review, therefore, is to address, for the non-nephrologist, clinically relevant topical questions regarding acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit.

Data Sources

The authors (nephrologists and intensivists) performed a directed review of PubMed to evaluate topics including the definition, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit. The goal of this review is to address topics important to the practicing intensivist. DATA SYNTHESIS AND FINDINGS: Whenever available, preferential consideration was given to randomized controlled trials. In the absence of randomized trials, observational and retrospective studies and consensus opinions were included.

Conclusions

Acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit is a clinically relevant problem requiring awareness and expertise among physicians from a wide variety of fields. Although many questions remain controversial and without definitive answers, a periodic update of this rapidly evolving field provides a framework for understanding and managing acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit.

### A worldwide multicentre evaluation of the influence of deterioration or improvement of acute kidney injury on clinical outcome in critically ill patients with and without sepsis at ICU admission: results from the intensive care over nations audit [^111BGqKq]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is more frequent, more severe, less likely to resolve once AKIN stage 3 has been reached and associated with higher mortality rates in patients with sepsis than in those without. Differences in the phase of AKI development and aetiology of AKI likely account for these observations in sepsis and non-sepsis patients. Deterioration to a more severe stage of AKI negatively influences clinical outcome, while improvement is associated with increased survival. These results emphasize the severity of the disease, which represents a tremendous burden for both patients and society.

Conclusion

Our in-hospital death prognosis score is the first to be prospectively developed and validated for AKI admitted in conventional care units. Based on current parameters, easily collected at time of admission, this score could be a useful tool for physicians and nephrologists to determine the in-hospital death prognosis of this AKI population.

### A prospective study of clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury in a tertiary care centre [^113VGLSf]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major global health problem. We aim to evaluate the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of AKI episodes in our single centre.

Methodology

We prospectively identified 422 AKI and acute on chronic kidney disease episodes in 404 patients meeting KDIGO definitions using electronic medical records and clinical data from 15th July to 22nd October 2016, excluding patients with baseline estimated GFR (eGFR) of < 15mL/min. Patients were followed up till 6months after AKI diagnosis.

Results

The mean age was 65.8 ± 14.1. Majority of patients were male (58.2%) of Chinese ethnicity (68.8%). One hundred and thirty-two patients (32.6%) were diagnosed in acute care units. Seventy-five percent of patients developed AKI during admission in a non-Renal specialty. Mean baseline eGFR was 50.2 ± 27.7mL/min. Mean creatinine at AKI diagnosis was 297 ± 161μmol/L. Renal consultations were initiated at KDIGO Stages 1, 2 and 3 in 58.9, 24.5 and 16.6% of patients, respectively. Three hundred and ten (76.7%) patients had a single etiology of AKI with the 3 most common etiologies of AKI being pre-renal (27.7%), sepsis-associated (25.5%) and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (15.3%). One hundred and nine (27%) patients received acute renal replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was 20.3%. Six-month mortality post-AKI event was 9.4%. On survival analysis, patients with KDIGO Stage 3 AKI had significantly shorter survival than other stages.

Conclusion

AKI is associated with significant in-hospital to 6-month mortality. This signifies the pressing need for AKI prevention, early detection and intervention in mitigating reversible risk factors in order to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury in non-critical care setting: elaboration and validation of an in-hospital death prognosis score [^111xZx4D]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as deterioration of renal function over a short period. This definition has been formalized for optimal data comparison between clinical studies thanks to the 2004 RIFLE, 2007 AKIN and 2012 KDIGO classifications. These classifications determine several AKI stages based on either an increase in creatinine or decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and a decrease in urine output. Moreover, these stages help to stratify the severity of AKI and the risk of in-hospital death.

Based on these definitions, epidemiological studies reported incidences of 24.4 and 384.1 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively in dialysis and non-dialysis requiring AKI. A recent meta-analysis including 154 studies based on AKI KDIGO definition reported that 20% of hospitalized adult patients experience AKI whatever the initial cause of hospitalization. Additionally, the incidence of AKI continuously increases from about 11% per year, particularly in male and elderly populations.

Despite several advances in therapeutics and substantial progress in the understanding of AKI pathogenesis, the related mortality remains high. Overall in-hospital mortality is about 23% in adults. In the setting of intensive care units (ICU), AKI-associated mortality ranges from 45 to 73.5%. Interestingly, the etiology of AKI can influence mortality rate; epidemiological studies have shown that AKI secondary to nephrotoxic agents and drugs contributes to death in up to 30% of cases, which remains high but significantly lower than in other potential etiologies. Moreover, AKI is a risk factor contributing to chronic kidney disease (CKD): the annual incidence of chronic dialysis is about 8.6% after one episode of AKI.

Most studies about AKI have been conducted in ICU. These studies have reported sepsis, as well as pulmonary, cardiac, and hepatic failure as independent risk factors for AKI-associated mortality. Yet, few epidemiological data are currently available on patients admitted to conventional medical units for AKI. Indeed, among the 154 studies included in the recent meta-analysis of Susantitaphong et al, only 7 included patients from conventional hospitalization units of nephrology. Many aspects of AKI, including etiologies and prognosis, might be different in this group of patients compared to that developing AKI in the ICU setting. Moreover, RIFLE, AKIN or KDIGO classifications are particularly difficult to use in everyday practice among conventional units, particularly the close surveillance of urine output.

### Urinary angiotensinogen predicts adverse outcomes among acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit [^114e878v]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is reflected by an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) or a decrease in urine output, the magnitude of which is used to assess the severity of renal injury using the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) or Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) staging systems. A patient's risk of both short- and long-term adverse outcomes is correlated with the severity of AKI as determined using these staging systems. For example, a large retrospective cohort study of a critically ill population reported that the odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital mortality increased from 2.07 in AKIN stage 1 patients to 2.99 in AKIN stage 3 patients. However, because sCr does not reach steady state until after an acute reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has occurred, the severity of AKI can only be definitively determined late in the disease. The conceptual framework for understanding AKI proposed by Murray et al. underscores the importance of progression from the early stages of AKI, in which an at-risk patient experiences renal injury, to later stages of the disease, which include decreased GFR, renal failure, and death. Similarly, the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for AKI highlights the need for accurate assessment of a patient's risk of adverse outcomes, notably progression to a more severe stage of AKI after renal injury has occurred.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if a patient with a small increase in sCr will worsen, improve, or stay the same. Furthermore, it is not possible to differentiate mild from severe AKI at an early time point using conventional diagnostic criteria. Biomarkers that reflect the magnitude of tubular injury at the time they are collected could serve this function. Novel AKI biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), IL-18, and Cystatin C can diagnose AKI prior to detectable changes in sCr. However, two recent studies have reported unadjusted area under the curve (AUC) values for prediction of worsening AKI between 0.58 and 0.71, suggesting that diagnostic AKI biomarkers are of lesser predictive value among patients who already have established AKI. Therefore, prognostic biomarkers that predict outcomes in patients with established AKI are needed.

### Fluid overload at initiation of renal replacement therapy is associated with lack of renal recovery in patients with acute kidney injury [^1117mdTa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) have poor short- and long-term outcomes, including the development of dialysis dependence. Currently, little is known about what factors may predict renal recovery in this population.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of 170 hospitalized adult patients with AKI attributed to acute tubular necrosis who required inpatient initiation of RRT. Data collection included patient characteristics, laboratory data, details of hospital course and degree of fluid overload at RRT initiation. The primary outcome was recovery of renal function to dialysis independence.

Results

Within 1 year of RRT initiation, 35.9% (61/170) of patients reached the primary end point of renal recovery. The median (interquartile range) duration of RRT was 11 (3–33) days and 83.6% (51/61) recovered prior to hospital discharge. Recovering patients had significantly less fluid overload at the time of RRT initiation compared to non-recovering patients (3.5 versus 9.3%, P = 0.004). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, a rise in percent fluid overload at dialysis initiation remained a significant negative predictor of renal recovery (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.00, P = 0.024).

Conclusions

In patients with AKI, a higher degree of fluid overload at RRT initiation predicts worse renal recovery at 1 year. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether interventions targeting fluid overload may improve patient and renal outcomes.

### New insights into the mechanisms of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit [^115sp1wg]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication in the intensive care unit that is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Traditional models consider reductions of global renal blood flow as the cause of acute kidney injury. However, a complex interplay between ischemia-reperfusion injury and inflammation may lead to intrarenal hypoperfusion and acute kidney injury. The role of changes of global renal blood flow as a cause for acute kidney injury remains controversial, especially in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.

### Renal medicine in the intensive care unit: a narrative review [^117CW1Bf]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease, both acute and chronic, is commonly encountered on the intensive care unit. Due to the role the kidneys play in whole body homeostasis, it follows that their dysfunction has wide-ranging implications and can affect prescribing and therapeutic management. This narrative review discusses the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, and how this relates to critically unwell patients. We cover several aspects of the management of renal dysfunction on the critical care unit, exploring some of the recurrent themes within the literature, including type and timing of kidney replacement therapy, management of acute kidney injury, as well as discussing how novel biomarkers for acute kidney injury may help to identify patients suffering from acute kidney injury as well as risk stratifying these patients. We discuss how early involvement of specialist nephrology services can improve outcomes in patients with kidney disease as well as offer valuable diagnostic and specialist management advice, particularly for patients with established end stage kidney disease and patients who are already known to nephrology services. We also explore some of the ongoing research questions that need to be answered within this arena.

### State of the art: renal recovery after AKI-from basic science to clinical practice [^117KUjRb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with a high risk of mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular morbidity. The risks are higher in patients with incomplete or no renal recovery. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms of renal recovery, list some key risk factors for nonrecovery and highlight knowledge gaps.

Methods

Narrative review of key data in the literature.

Results

Recovery from AKI is an active process. When damage to the kidney is mild, full regeneration is possible; with extensive damage, fibrosis sets in. Current strategies to achieve renal recovery focus on identification of the mechanism of injury and minimizing further insults. Nephrotoxic exposures and various forms of dialytrauma impair recovery. The likelihood that repair will be maladaptive increases with age and extent/duration of injury. Return of glomerular filtration rate to pre-injury levels does not exclude nephron loss and development of CKD. Post-discharge follow-up of AKI survivors is important, but there are ongoing uncertainties and clinical practice is variable. Research is ongoing to determine the role of pharmacological interventions.

Conclusions

The prognosis of AKI is critically tied to renal recovery, and there is great urgency to identify effective therapies.

### Short-and long-term outcomes of intensive care patients with acute kidney disease [^117F4Euo]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant problem in healthcare worldwide, with associated increased risk in both short- and long-term mortality and development of subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whilst AKI has been recognised as a common occurrence within the context of critical illness, the reported incidence in the intensive care unit (ICU) literature has varied from 30–57%. This can be attributed to differences in study populations, increasing recognition of the importance of AKI over time, and variation in the classification system used for diagnosing AKI.

Following publication of the RIFLE classification for AKI, further classifications were produced by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN)and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group. Current KDIGO classification has incorporated and adapted elements of both RIFLE and AKIN criteria to form the most current and internationally accepted criteria for diagnosing and staging AKI. Recent consensus concludes AKI should not be a treated as an isolated event, but as the beginning of a continuum of kidney disease where an initial insult can lead to both persistent kidney injury and CKD. Within this spectrum of disease, it has been postulated that persistent kidney injury should be treated as a separate entity from rapid-reversal AKI. In recognition of these different disease pathways, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in 2017 proposed the definition of acute kidney disease (AKD) as AKI (KDIGO stage 1 or greater) that persists for 7 days or longer.

This new definition was identified as an important area for research, however, little data exist regarding patients who suffer from AKD and how they differ from patients with AKI that do not develop AKD. A subsequent definition expanded on the concept of AKD being inclusive of patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 for 7–90 days. This definition offers broader diagnostic criteria but is more difficult to apply in the context of an injury acquired on ICU. Furthermore, it would require the removal of all patients with pre-existing CKD stage 3 or worse, as these patients already have eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2.

The aim of this study sought to ascertain the epidemiology and short- and long-term outcomes of patients admitted to ICU suffering from AKD and compare them to patients with a more transient AKI. The specific outcomes were to ascertain potential risk factors associated with progression to AKD, determine short- and long-term mortality in AKI and AKD groups and assess the proportion of MAKEs during the follow up period.

### Predictors of outpatient kidney function recovery among patients who initiate hemodialysis in the hospital [^1121AKko]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recent policy clarifications by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have changed access to outpatient dialysis care at end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities for individuals with acute kidney injury in the United States. Tools to predict "ESRD" and "acute" status in terms of kidney function recovery among patients who previously initiated dialysis therapy in the hospital could help inform patient management decisions.

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Incident hemodialysis patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System who initiated in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT) and continued outpatient dialysis following hospital dismissal (2006 through 2009).

Predictor

Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), acute tubular necrosis from sepsis or surgery, heart failure, intensive care unit, and dialysis access.

Outcomes

Kidney function recovery defined as sufficient kidney function for outpatient hemodialysis therapy discontinuation.

Results

Cohort consisted of 281 patients with a mean age of 64 years, 63% men, 45% with heart failure, and baseline eGFR ≥ 30mL/min/1.73m(2) in 46%. During a median of 8 months, 52 (19%) recovered, most (94%) within 6 months. Higher baseline eGFR (HR per 10-mL/min/1.73m(2) increase eGFR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16–1.39; P < 0.001), acute tubular necrosis from sepsis or surgery (HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.83–6.24; P < 0.001), and heart failure (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19–0.78, P = 0.007) were independent predictors of recovery within 6 months, whereas first RRT in the intensive care unit and catheter dialysis access were not. There was a positive interaction between absence of heart failure and eGFR ≥ 30mL/min/1.73m(2) for predicting kidney function recovery (P < 0.001).

Limitations

Sample size.

Conclusions

Kidney function recovery in the outpatient hemodialysis unit following in-hospital RRT initiation is not rare. As expected, higher baseline eGFR is an important determinant of recovery. However, patients with heart failure are less likely to recover even with a higher baseline eGFR. Consideration of these factors at hospital discharge informs decisions on ESRD status designation and long-term hemodialysis care.

### A prospective study of clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury in a tertiary care centre [^117G2L2R]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Clinical characteristics of AKI patients

A total of 422 episodes of AKI in 404 patients were identified to have AKI. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The severity of AKI was classified as KDIGO AKI Stage 1 in 238 (58.9%) patients; Stage 2 in 99 (24.5%) patients and Stage 3 in 67 (16.6%) patients. Among critically ill patients, 89 (22%) patients with AKI were detected whilst in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 43 (10.6%) in Intermediate Care Area (ICA) or High Dependency Units. Two hundred seventy-two (67.3%) patients developed AKI in the general wards, of which 67% were in Stage 1. In our study, 147 (36.1%) patients with AKI were detected in the medical departments, while 81 (20%) were detected in the cardiac units and 78 (19.3%) in the surgical departments. Ninety-eight (24.3%) patients with AKI were identified in the nephrology unit.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of the study cohort (per patient, total no = 404)

Of the 404 patients, 235 (58.2%) were male and 169 (41.8%) were female. The mean age was 65.8 ± 14.1 years, with 58.9% older than 65 years. The ethnicity distribution reflected that of our hospital population as a whole. Mean baseline serum creatinine was 150 ± 71 μmol/L, with a corresponding eGFR of 50 ± 27.7 mL/min. With regards to comorbidities, 302 (74.8%) had hypertension, 230 (56.9%) had diabetes mellitus, and 187 (46.3%) had ischemic heart disease. Seventy-eight cases (19.3%) of AKI occurred in the background of underlying malignancy. Mean serum creatinine at AKI diagnosis was 297.5 ± 160.7 μmol/L. The most frequent cause of AKI was noted to be pre-renal cause, with an occurrence in 112 (27.7%) patients, followed by sepsis-associated AKI and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) occurring in 105 (26%) and 62 (15.3%) patients, respectively. Dialysis was carried out in 109 (27%) of our AKI patients, of which 62 (56.9%) received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114YTEht]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Acute kidney injury: short-term and long-term effects [^111QZom7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common cause of organ dysfunction in critically ill adults with an incidence of around 34%, and carries an observed in-hospital mortality as high as 62%. Indeed, even a single episode of AKI carries a significant morbidity and mortality risk, with an episode of stage 1 AKI complicating a critical illness being independently associated with an increase in 10-year mortality. Moreover, the long-term effects of AKI also contribute significantly to health costs and, in the UK, has been estimated to account for about 1% of the total health and social care budget.

In this narrative review we will consider how, since a consensus has been reached, the effects of kidney injury on both short- and long-term outcomes have been highlighted.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology and outcomes — clinical burden — span multiple settings, and severe disease in critical illness is frequent and lethal; "severe AKI occurs in > 5% of critically ill patients and is associated with mortality rates of 40%-70%". Although "recovery of kidney function occurs in the majority of patients surviving an episode of AKI, many patients remain dialysis dependent or are left with severe renal impairment", and "even patients who have complete or near-complete recovery of kidney function are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD)" with superimposed AKI on CKD "associated with acceleration in the rate of progression to end-stage disease".

### Long-term outcome after intensive care: can we protect the kidney? [^115iKrjY]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Long-term outcome — mortality, morbidity and quality of life — is finally receiving attention in the field of intensive care research. A number of recent studies have focused on patient survival and kidney survival after acute renal failure. The present review focuses on the third publication from the Beginning and Ending Supportive Therapy for the Kidney Investigators Writing Committee. Their study took place in 54 intensive care units in 23 countries. The main findings of the Beginning and Ending Supportive Therapy study was that the choice of continuous renal replacement therapy as the initial therapy is not a predictor of hospital survival or of dialysis-free hospital survival, but that it is an independent predictor of renal recovery among survivors. In conclusion, the critical care research community needs to focus on long-term outcome. A number of recent studies of acute renal failure have done just that.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114WFsDK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- there are no gold standard prognostic scores for predicting severe acute pancreatitis

- severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal failure, and high mortality

- patients having persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death.

### Long-term outcomes of acute kidney injury [^111FCq16]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this review is to summarize the recent plethora of data that relate to long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury (AKI).

Recent Findings

Surviving patients with AKI are still at high risk for long-term adverse outcomes, even if serum creatinine returns to normal. After adjusting for potential confounders, many recent studies have demonstrated that AKI is independently associated with chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and premature death. Unfortunately, definitive evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that prevention or treatment of AKI prevents long-term adverse outcomes is not yet available.

Summary

AKI is clearly a prognostic marker for poor long-term outcomes, but more studies will be needed to determine whether AKI is truly causal and whether or not the risk is modifiable.

### Validated risk prediction models for outcomes of acute kidney injury: a systematic review [^116NZ4SF]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) among hospitalized patients is characterized by a sudden decline in renal function and is associated with poor long-term and short-term outcomes. The overall incidence of AKI in hospital patients ranges between 7 and 22%, and it ranges from 20 to 50% in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Increasing incidences of AKI have been reported, especially among low- to middle-income countries, and this is likely due to an increasingly complex patient population. Moreover, it has been shown that when sepsis is present at ICU admission, the prevalence of AKI is greater than 40%.

The definition of AKI has changed over the years. In 2012, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) unified the previous definitions (RIFLE and AKIN). By KDIGO definition, AKI is diagnosed by an absolute increase in SCr, at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.5µmol/L) within 48 h or by a 50% increase in SCr from baseline within 7 days, or a urine volume of less than 0.5mL/kg/h for at least 6 h. Although KDIGO is now the most accepted and used AKI criteria, recently Sparrow et al. evaluated the impact of further sub-categorizing the KDIGO-defined AKI stage 1 into two stages based on SCr criteria: stage 1a (an absolute increase of SCr of 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h) and stage 1b (a 50% relative increase in SCr within 7 days) and therefore creating a 4-stage KDIGO classification which they named KDIGO-4. In a separate study, Nateghi Haredasht et al. showed that within the KDIGO AKI stage 1, there are indeed two sub-populations with different clinical outcomes.

### Changes in the incidence and outcome for early acute kidney injury in a cohort of Australian intensive care units [^112f6LX4]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, we conducted the first large multicentre study of AKI in critically ill patients to evaluate long-term trends in incidence and mortality. In this heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients, we found a significant rise in the incidence of AKI. Moreover, despite modest changes in the profile of patients with AKI, the associated mortality has declined.

### Clinical characteristics and outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury: a single centre cohort study [^113eqUBG]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 viral infection leading to Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as an emerging pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The first case was reported in the United Kingdom (UK) on the 31st January and patient numbers rose rapidly with a corresponding increase in admissions to hospital and intensive care units (ICU) over the subsequent months. Although the majority of infected patients developed mild or no respiratory symptoms, a proportion progressed to severe lung disease characterised by acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) necessitating respiratory support or mechanical ventilation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is relatively common in both hospitalised and critically ill COVID-19 patients. In a multicentre study of more than 3000 COVID-19 ICU patients from the United States America, around 20% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy. Similarly, in the UK, during the first wave of the pandemic a quarter of intensive care unit COVID-19 patients needed renal replacement therapy. Furthermore, AKI may be associated with an ongoing requirement for renal support and prolonged hospitalization thereby imposing a significant health and resource burden.

The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is poorly understood but may involve a combination of pre-renal and intrinsic renal insults. Studies have described the virus' affiliation for the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is expressed in abundance in the kidney. The virus also directly infects tubular epithelial cells and podocytes causing significant structural damage. Proteinuria and haematuria have been commonly documented and may be indicative of intrinsic renal injury. Post-mortem findings of COVID-19 patients suggest micro-vascular occlusion, endothelial injury, diffuse acute proximal tubular injury and evidence of direct damage as a consequence of SARS CoV-2 infection.

The majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 require ventilatory support, but the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary and the characteristics and outcomes of patients with AKI have not been fully defined. Consequently we aimed to characterise the risk factors for AKI in intensive care patients with Covid-19, its incidence and patient outcomes in a single centre cohort study.

### A prospective international multicenter study of AKI in the intensive care unit [^111Pz8go]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

AKI is frequent and is associated with poor outcomes. There is limited information on the epidemiology of AKI worldwide. This study compared patients with AKI in emerging and developed countries to determine the association of clinical factors and processes of care with outcomes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This prospective observational study was conducted among intensive care unit patients from nine centers in developed countries and five centers in emerging countries. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours.

Results

Between 2008 and 2012, 6647 patients were screened, of whom 1275 (19.2%) developed AKI. A total of 745 (58% of those with AKI) agreed to participate and had complete data. Patients in developed countries had more sepsis (52.1% versus 38.0%) and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores (mean ± SD, 61.1 ± 27.5 versus 51.1 ± 25.2); those from emerging countries had more CKD (54.3% versus 38.3%), GN (6.3% versus 0.9%), and interstitial nephritis (7.0% versus 0.6%) (all P < 0.05). Patients from developed countries were less often treated with dialysis (15.5% versus 30.2%; P < 0.001) and started dialysis later after AKI diagnosis (2.0 [interquartile range, 0.75–5.0] days versus 0 [interquartile range, 0–5.0] days; P = 0.02). Hospital mortality was 22.0%, and 13.3% of survivors were dialysis dependent at discharge. Independent risk factors associated with hospital mortality included older age, residence in an emerging country, use of vasopressors (emerging countries only), dialysis and mechanical ventilation, and higher APACHE score and cumulative fluid balance (developed countries only). A lower probability of renal recovery was associated with residence in an emerging country, higher APACHE score (emerging countries only) and dialysis, while mechanical ventilation was associated with renal recovery (developed countries only).

Conclusions

This study contrasts the clinical features and management of AKI and demonstrates worse outcomes in emerging than in developed countries. Differences in variations in care may explain these findings and should be considered in future trials.

### Traditional urinary biomarkers in the assessment of hospital-acquired AKI [^113Fx8Pf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Traditional biomarkers, such as urine chemistries and urine microscopic elements, are used in the diagnosis and care of patients with AKI. Urine chemistries, such as fractional excretion of sodium and fractional excretion of urea, are useful for differentiating prerenal AKI from acute tubular necrosis only in select patients. Urine microscopy using a quantitative evaluation of the urine sediment for renal tubular epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cell casts, and granular casts has recently been shown to differentiate prerenal AKI from acute tubular necrosis and also provide prognostic information. Urine microscopy has also been noted to compare favorably with new urine biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of AKI. Thus, current information on urine diagnostics suggests that urine chemistries have a limited role in differential diagnosis of AKI, whereas urine microscopy and new urine biomarkers may be used together to differentiate prerenal AKI from acute tubular necrosis and predict such outcomes as worsened AKI, acute dialysis, and death.

### Effects of non-severe acute kidney injury on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^111bdLKm]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious medical condition estimated to affect more than ten million people around the world annually. AKI results in a 1.7- to 6.9-fold increased risk of hospital mortality, and risk-adjusted rates of AKI and mortality appear similar across the world. Patients who develop AKI also have worse kidney function at hospital discharge and thus far more risk for chronic kidney disease. However, these risks are most clearly apparent for patients with very severe AKI, such as those who receive renal replacement therapy (RRT). Milder forms of AKI are less clearly associated with adverse outcomes and thus it is unclear whether mild AKI is in the causal pathway for morbidity and mortality. For example, in a large international study of patients cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU), stage 2 or 3 AKIs were strongly associated with mortality even after risk adjustment, whereas for patients incurring only stage 1 AKI the association was attenuated and no longer significant (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–3.17; P = 0.11).

For purposes of this review, we define "non-severe AKI" as AKI that is not managed by RRT. We acknowledge that this is an imperfect definition because the decision to commence RRT is often a difficult one and there exists considerable heterogeneity across centers and among physicians, even experts. Thus, the same patient could be counted as non-severe if cared for by one clinician but severe if cared for by another. Although differences exist at the individual patient-provider level, rates of RRT for critically ill patients with AKI in general, though increasing, are relatively consistent around the world. For example, a decade ago, Uchino and colleagues found that in 23 countries on four continents 4.2% of patients admitted to the ICU received RRT for AKI and this rate was not different between world regions (95% CI 4.0–4.4%). Similarly, Hoste and colleagues recently found that in 33 countries on five continents 13.5% of all patients admitted to the ICU (excluding patients with end-stage renal disease) received RRT for AKI; again, the range was rather narrow (95% CI 12.0–15.1%). Approximately 25% of critically ill patients with AKI receive RRT; this article is about the remaining 75%.

### Early nephrology consultation can have an impact on outcome of acute kidney injury patients [^116Y81xG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have extremely high rates of mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this study were to compare clinical and laboratory characteristics of AKI patients evaluated and not evaluated by nephrologists in ICU and generate the hypothesis of the relationship between timing of nephrology consultation and outcome.

Methods

We explored associations among presence and timing of nephrology consultation with ICU stay and in-ICU mortality in 148 ICU patients with AKI at a Brazilian teaching hospital from July 2008 to May 2010. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust confounding and selection bias.

Results

AKI incidence was 30% and 52% of these AKI patients were evaluated by nephrologists. At multivariable analysis, AKI patients evaluated by nephrologists showed higher Acute Tubular Necrosis-Index Specific Score and creatinine level, more dialysis indications, lower urine output and longer ICU stay. The mortality rate was similar to AKI patients who were not evaluated. Nephrology consultation was delayed (≥ 48 h) in 62.3% (median time to consultation, 4.7 days). Lower serum creatinine levels (P = 0.009) and higher urine output (P = 0.002) were associated with delayed consultation. Delayed consultation was associated with increased ICU mortality (65.4 versus 88.2%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In AKI, patients evaluated by nephrologists seem to be more seriously ill than those not evaluated and present similar mortality rate. The delayed nephrology consultation can be associated with increased ICU mortality.

### CD4 + lymphocyte adenosine triphosphate – a new marker in sepsis with acute kidney injury? [^113vywZD]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is still a frequent and serious complication in hospitalized patients with an incidence of 5–35%. The most common cause is transient renal hypoperfusion with tubular cell dysfunction and, in more severe cases tubular cell apoptosis/necrosis. Therapeutic measures include elimination of the respective cause, stabilization of intravascular fluid volume, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, and treatment of secondary complications such as hyperkalemia and acidosis. Current diagnostic markers still do not allow an early diagnosis of AKI which partly accounts for the poor prognosis of the disease. In addition, predicting both, renal and general outcome in AKI remains difficult if not impossible. A promising candidate is the Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) which can being used for predicting the need for renal replacement therapy but not mortality in AKI. Lately, the urinary IL-18/creatinine ratio has been shown to predict persistently elevated serum creatinine levels of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl after 6 months as compared to the baseline. Nevertheless, all available diagnostic parameters are of limited value since they do not allow monitoring of tissue repair processes per se. Postischemic renal regeneration critically depends on a balanced interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory cell populations. Among those are T and B cell, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and plasma cells. However, a diagnostic method for analyzing activities of cells involved in renal tissue repair is missing yet. A pilot study on monitoring activity of CD4+ T cells in sepsis was published in 2010. This investigation revealed an association between low CD4+ ATP (ATP_CD4) content at the time of ICU admission and poor clinical outcome. Although such phenomenon is far from being understood mechanistically, CD4+ ATP contents most likely reflect activity/competence of a certain population of immunocompetent cells. Since AKI is a frequent and deleterious complication in sepsis, we aimed to investigate ATP_CD4 in septic patients with versus without AKI. Our principal goal was to evaluate the prognostic power of ATP_CD4 in terms of kidney regeneration after sepsis-associated AKI.

### Response to the NCEPOD report: development of a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis-the first 24 H [^112syyvp]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury and/or hyponatraemia

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is estimated to occur in approximately 20% of hospitalised patients with cirrhosis, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Several definitions of AKI exist, but the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of the modified RIFLE (R isk I njury F ailure L oss and E nd stage renal disease) criteria that were devised by the Acute Kidney Injury Network to detect subjects at risk of AKI. AKI is defined if any of the following criteria are met: (1) an absolute rise in serum creatinine of ≥ 26 µmol/L within 48 h; (2) a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine known or presumed to have occurred in the last 7 days; (3) a fall in urine output to < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h. It should be noted that patients with cirrhosis frequently have low baseline creatinine levels, as many have reduced muscle bulk and malnutrition. Therefore, some patients with creatinine levels within the normal range can have a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate.

AKI in patients with cirrhosis is commonly multifactorial, but prerenal AKI is most common (45%), followed by acute tubular necrosis and glomerulonephritis (32%), HRS (23%) and rarely postrenal (< 1%). It is important to identify the cause of AKI, as the underlying cause has implications on prognosis. Type 1 HRS (acute) carries a particularly poor prognosis with mortality rates approaching 100% without treatment. HRS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and current diagnostic criteria are shown in box 3. It is important to note that before a diagnosis of HRS can be made patients need to have their diuretics and nephrotoxic medications suspended and be volume expanded with albumin, so a diagnosis of HRS can usually not be made within the first 24 h. If HRS is subsequently diagnosed, patients should be treated with intravenous albumin and terlipressin, as this has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HRS.

### Acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit according to RIFLE [^1123LdjS]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To apply the RIFLE criteria "risk", "injury", and "failure" for severity of acute kidney injury to patients admitted to the intensive care unit and to evaluate the significance of other prognostic factors.

Design

Retrospective analysis of the Riyadh Intensive Care Program database.

Setting

Riyadh Intensive Care Unit Program database of 41,972 patients admitted to 22 intensive care units in the United Kingdom and Germany between 1989 and 1999.

Patients

Acute kidney injury as defined by the RIFLE classification occurred in 15,019 (35.8%) patients; 7,207 (17.2%) patients were at risk, 4,613 (11%) had injury, and 3,199 (7.6%) had failure. It was found that 797 (2.3%) patients had end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure when admitted to an intensive care unit.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients with risk, injury, and failure classifications had hospital mortality rates of 20.9%, 45.6%, and 56.8%, respectively, compared with 8.4% among patients without acute kidney injury. Independent risk factors for hospital mortality were age (odds ratio 1.02); Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission to intensive care unit (odds ratio 1.10); presence of preexisting end-stage disease (odds ratio 1.17); mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 1.52); RIFLE categories risk (odds ratio 1.40), injury (odds ratio 1.96), and failure (odds ratio 1.59); maximum number of failed organs (odds ratio 2.13); admission after emergency surgery (odds ratio 3.08); and nonsurgical admission (odds ratio 3.92). Renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality.

Conclusions

The RIFLE classification was suitable for the definition of acute kidney injury in intensive care units. There was an association between acute kidney injury and hospital outcome, but associated organ failure, nonsurgical admission, and admission after emergency surgery had a greater impact on prognosis than severity of acute kidney injury.

### Prognostic value of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^114QaQjF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

More than 5 million patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) each year in America, and 6–24% of these patients have acute kidney injury (AKI). In the presence of AKI, patient mortality increases to as high as 60–70%, especially within 1 year after ICU admission. Considering the high incidence of AKI in the ICU and its poor prognosis, an increasing number of observational studies over the past 2 decades have been devoted to identifying the clinical predictors of mortality in AKI.

Systemic inflammation is an integral part of disease progression in critical illness and is commonly associated with sepsis, leading to an increased risk of mortality. Inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of AKI, and morphological and/or functional changes in vascular endothelial cells and/or in the tubular epithelium are observed in patients with AKI. Leukocytes, including lymphocytes, infiltrate the injured kidneys and the entire body via the circulatory system and induce the generation of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, which damage the kidney and other organs. The antithrombotic effects of platelets can evolve into atherogenesis via the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas the binding of platelets to endothelial cells can trigger leukocyte transmigration and adhesion, especially in the presence of shear stress. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been introduced as a potential marker of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and tumors, which are also inflammation-related diseases. A positive monotonic association between a high PLR and a poor prognosis for these diseases has been reported. On the basis of the results of these studies, it is reasonable to speculate that the PLR might affect the prognosis of AKI. However, to the best of our knowledge, no epidemiological study to date has explored the prognostic effect of the PLR in patients with AKI.

### A worldwide multicentre evaluation of the influence of deterioration or improvement of acute kidney injury on clinical outcome in critically ill patients with and without sepsis at ICU admission: results from the intensive care over nations audit [^1127sjzQ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Influence of RRT and transition to another AKIN stage

In this study, RRT was mostly started within the first 2 days after ICU admission and predominantly in patients admitted with AKIN stage 3 who did not recover during the first week after admission. It is currently unclear whether or not early initiation of RRT may improve patient outcome despite two large clinical trials and further study, such as the ongoing STARRT-AKI trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02568722), is necessary to elucidate the effects of RRT timing on outcomes and to guide clinical decisions related to the initiation of RRT.

Although in-hospital mortality was lower in patients with renal recovery, septic and non-septic AKIN stage 3 patients who had recovered full renal function by day 7 still had a 2-fold higher in-hospital mortality rate than patients recovering from AKI stage 2 or 1 or patients without AKI. In addition, our data confirm that mortality is higher in patients who receive RRT compared to those who do not. Our hypothesis-generating data could encourage a novel approach to risk stratification in AKI for current therapy, future investigations and clinical therapeutic trials. For example, in the absence of life-threatening complications, it may be prudent to delay RRT, as a large number of patients, especially in the lower AKIN stages, recovered full renal function. Indeed, use of RRT may delay recovery of renal function. While resuscitation strategies appear not to influence the development of AKI in patients with septic shock, secondary prevention, by mitigating further toxic and haemodynamic renal insults, may represent an important therapeutic opportunity in this population. Also, models of ICU mortality and prognostic scores could likely be refined by considering the dynamic changes in renal function over time.

### Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective observational study [^112fDtfv]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Proteinuria and hematuria may simply be markers of underlying kidney disease or other organ status. Precisely, urinary abnormalities are shown in more than half of patients with acute tubular necrosis, which is the most common cause of AKI in the ICU. Accordingly, these findings may be associated with AKI or mortality via acute tubular necrosis or other baseline conditions. However, in the present study, the correlations of proteinuria or hematuria with outcomes were significant despite adjusting several baseline conditions. Furthermore, both proteinuria and hematuria had an association with the AKI cases with late onset. Investigations on the independent role of proteinuria or hematuria in kidney damage and other types of organ damage are ongoing. It is known that proteinuria induces signals for tubulointerstitial inflammation and activates fibrogenic pathways as a postulated mechanism of kidney damage. Proteinuria is also associated with endothelial dysfunction, which covers cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, other mechanisms affecting the overall outcome of proteinuria may include an increased risk of infection, thrombotic disease, or malnutrition, although thorough investigations have not been conducted. The subjects with hematuria are at risk of kidney damage because hemoglobin, heme, iron, or other molecules released from red blood cells are toxic to the kidney tubular cells and thus induce inflammatory cascades. It is intriguing that the cessation of hematuria is related to the recovery of kidney function, although this is known only in immunoglobulin A nephropathy, and there are no agents for this.

### Initiative: recommendations for awareness, recognition, and management of AKI [^113EJC6w]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Nephrology has established a new initiative, AKI!Now, with the goal of promoting excellence in the prevention and treatment of AKI by building a foundational program that transforms education and delivery of AKI care, aiming to reduce morbidity and associated mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we describe our current efforts to improve early recognition and management involving inclusive interdisciplinary collaboration between providers, patients, and their families; discuss the ongoing need to change some of our current AKI paradigms and diagnostic methods; and provide specific recommendations to improve AKI recognition and care. In the hospital and the community, AKI is a common and increasingly frequent condition that generates risks of adverse events and high costs. Unfortunately, patients with AKI may frequently have received less than optimal quality of care. New classifications have facilitated understanding of AKI incidence and its impact on outcomes, but they are not always well aligned with AKI pathophysiology. Despite ongoing research efforts, treatments to promote or hasten kidney recovery remain ineffective. To avoid progression, the current approach to AKI emphasizes the promotion of early recognition and timely response. However, a lack of awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment among health care team members and the heterogeneity of approaches within the health care teams assessing the patient remains a major challenge. Early identification is further complicated by differences in settings where AKI occurs (the community or the hospital), and by differences in patient populations and cultures between the intensive care unit and ward environments. To address these obstacles, we discuss the need to improve education at all levels of care and to generate specific guidance on AKI evaluation and management, including the development of a widely applicable education and an AKI management toolkit, engaging hospital administrators to incorporate AKI as a quality initiative, and raising awareness of AKI as a complication of other disease processes.

### Initiation strategies for renal-replacement therapy in the intensive care unit [^114kCVZZ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study AKIKI was published by Stéphane Gaudry and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury, Critical illness and Hyperkalemia. In the AKIKI study, the trial question was: what is the role of early or delayed initiation strategies for RRT in critically ill patients who have AKI but no potentially life-threatening complication directly related to renal failure? In the AKIKI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AKIKI study, the population was: 619 patients (212 female, 407 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe AKI who required mechanical ventilation, catecholamine infusion, or both and did not have a potentially life-threatening complication directly related to renal failure. The key exclusion criteria were severe laboratory abnormalities: a BUN level > 112 mg/dL, a serum potassium concentration > 6 mmol/L (or > 5.5 mmol.L despite medical treatment), a pH < 7.15 in the context of either pure metabolic acidosis (PaCO2 < 35 mmHg) or mixed acidosis (PaCO2 of ≥ 50 mmHg without the possibility of increasing alveolar ventilation), and acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload responsible for severe hypoxemia requiring an oxygen flow rate > 5 L/min to maintain a SpO2 > 95% or requiring a FiO2 > 50% in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and despite diuretic therapy. In the AKIKI study, the interventions were: n = 311 early RRT (started immediately after randomization) n = 308 delayed RRT (initiated if at least one of the following criteria was met: severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, BUN level > 112 mg/dL, or oliguria for > 72 hours after randomization). In the AKIKI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 60 (48.5% vs. 49.7%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29). In the AKIKI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients who received RRT (98% vs. 51%; RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.06). In the AKIKI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in rate of complications potentially related to AKI or RRT, with the exception of hypophosphatemia, which was more common in the early-strategy group. significant differences in catheter-related bloodstream infections (10% vs. 5%, p = 0.03). In the AKIKI study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe AKI who required mechanical ventilation, catecholamine infusion, or both and did not have a potentially life-threatening complication directly related to renal failure, early RRT was not superior to delayed RRT with respect to death at day 60.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^116Psxf6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria were introduced in 2004, defining the clinical stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome measures based on serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and urine output. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that these markers are insufficient in drawing an accurate illustration of kidney injury. Indeed, mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that accuracy and speed of patient evaluation are lacking. A great deal of evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a sensitive and specific early marker of various etiological classes of AKI and would be highly valuable in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction (kidney attack). Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring will benefit clinical decision-making in the individualized bundling of therapies and ongoing patient management. In particular, kidney protection and AKI prevention may become feasible if an earlier and more accurate diagnosis is made for AKI. Here, we discuss the opportunity to consider whether NGAL is ready for routine clinical use in a number of etiologies of AKI.

### Acute kidney injury in non-critical care setting: elaboration and validation of an in-hospital death prognosis score [^116WnJtP]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is still characterized by a high mortality rate. While most patients with AKI are admitted in conventional medical units, current available data are still obtained from studies designed for patients admitted in intensive care units (ICU). Our study aimed to elaborate and validate an in-hospital death prognosis score for AKI admitted in conventional medical care units.

Methods

We included two prospective cohorts of consecutive patients with AKI admitted between 2001 and 2004 (elaboration cohort (EC)) and between 2010 and 2014 (validation cohort (VC)). We developed a scoring system from clinical and biological parameters recorded at admission from the EC to predict in-hospital mortality. This score was then tested for validation in the VC.

Results

Three-hundred and twenty-three and 534 patients were included in the EC and VC cohorts, respectively. The proportion of in-hospital death were 15.5% (EC) and 8.9% (VC), mainly due to sepsis. The parameters independently associated with the in-hospital death in the EC were Glasgow score, oxygen requirement, fluid overload, blood diastolic pressure, multiple myeloma and prothrombin time. The in-hospital death prognosis score AUC was 0.845 +/− 0.297 (p < 0.001) after validation in the VC.

Conclusions

Our in-hospital death prognosis score is the first to be prospectively developed and validated for AKI admitted in a conventional medical care unit. Based on current parameters, easily collected at time of admission, this score could be a useful tool for physicians and nephrologists to determine the in-hospital death prognosis of this AKI population.

### Diagnosis of kidney damage using novel acute kidney injury biomarkers: assessment of kidney function alone is insufficient [^113CvAZq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome that is associated with a major burden of morbidity and mortality in a variety of high risk patient populations, many of them cared for by intensivists. Following renal transplantation, delayed graft function (DGF) caused by severe acute tubular necrosis (ATN), defined by a requirement for dialysis during the initial post-transplant week, complicates postoperative management, and if prolonged (> 14 days), adversely affects allograft survival. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and other novel biomarkers can detect AKI earlier than serum creatinine, and can predict AKI severity in high risk patient populations, including kidney transplant recipients. Hollmen and colleagues now demonstrate that elevated urine NGAL in deceased kidney donors is a significant risk factor for prolonged post-transplant DGF in recipients. These findings have clear implications with regard to potentially improved assessment of deceased donor suitability for potential renal allograft donation. These findings are also consistent with the growing evidence that severe ATN diagnosed by markedly elevated levels of AKI biomarkers is a useful predictor of the requirement for acute renal replacement therapy in AKI patients.

### Predicting one-year mortality of critically ill patients with early acute kidney injury: data from the prospective multicenter FINNAKI study [^115qmPrb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

One-year mortality is a relevant patient-centred outcome compared to discharge policy-influenced hospital mortality. Accordingly, we aimed to develop and validate predictive models for one-year mortality of critically ill patients with AKI using data available on ICU admission and another using data collected by the third day of ICU treatment.

### Clinical application of kidney biomarkers in cirrhosis [^111eowcs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common and morbid complications of decompensated cirrhosis. Management of AKI is dictated by cause: prerenal AKI is treated with volume resuscitation; hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), with intravenous albumin and vasoconstrictors; and acute tubular necrosis, with supportive care. However, differentiating between causes is difficult using creatinine-based definitions of AKI alone. The use of novel kidney biomarkers in AKI and cirrhosis provides an opportunity to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of this vulnerable population. This review examines the challenges of AKI in cirrhosis and the research experience around novel kidney biomarkers in cirrhosis. Specific focus is paid to the tubular injury marker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which has been the most studied in liver disease and has demonstrated the strongest performance in differentiating the cause of AKI (acute tubular necrosis vs functional injury such as prerenal AKI or HRS), as well as improving the prognostic performance of mortality prediction models such as the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score. We advocate for the discussion of incorporating markers such as NGAL in the next iteration of HRS guidelines and identify areas for future research in this clinical condition.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^116fmSJ7]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — acute kidney injury (AKI) differential and HRS-AKI definition in critically ill cirrhosis notes that critically ill patients with cirrhosis can have structural or functional causes of AKI, with structural causes mostly acute tubular necrosis, acute glomerulonephritis, and, rarely, acute interstitial nephritis, while functional causes related to hemodynamic abnormalities are much more common; it states that HRS-AKI is now being adopted using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition and is defined as an increase in s Cr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or ≥ 50% from baseline while fulfilling diagnostic criteria for HRS Type 1; currently published clinical trials used the older 2007 ICA definition of HRS1 with a threshold of ≥ 2.5 mg/dL in < 14 days without structural renal disease or preexisting azotemia; as estimated by the Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints in AKI Consortium, 50% of AKI episodes in cirrhosis were PRA and 35% related to ATN, with the remainder related to HRS-AKI and postrenal causes very uncommon.

### The prognostic importance of duration of AKI: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qNZrY]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized patients and is independently associated with increased risk of morbidity, mortality and length of stay. AKI also leads to long-term kidney sequelae, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal disease (ESRD) and has long-term adverse cardiovascular effects. In the United States, AKI is one of the most serious and common health complications, occurring commonly in hospitalized patients and those in critical care settings. For these reasons, accurate risk stratification/classification of AKI and its effect on long-term complications are of prime importance.

Efforts have been made to define and classify AKI for use in clinical practice and research. Beginning with risk injury failure loss end stage (RIFLE) staging system, followed by the acute kidney injury network (AKIN), and most recently, the kidney disease improving global outcomes(KDIGO), these classification systems all assess the magnitude of serum creatinine elevation (change from baseline to peak creatinine) as the primary dimension to grade severity. AKIN and KDIGO do incorporate tempo for the rate of increase as a prerequisite (rise must occur over a period of 48 h) but none of the current classification systems take into account the duration of AKI, which reflects time to recovery and could be an additional important dimension of AKI severity.

Some studies have suggested that the duration of AKI may be an important additional or independent prognostic marker of long-term mortality, progression to CKD/ESRD and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AKI in different clinical settings. Furthermore, duration of AKI has also been suggested as a better endpoint for trials of AKI. However, there has not been any systematic review or meta-analysis to quantify pooled estimates from these disparate studies. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature assessing impact of duration of AKI on survival, progression to CKD and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Subphenotypes in acute kidney injury: a narrative review [^112jxLAp]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Hypothetical patient scenarios with different AKI recovery subphenotypes and influence on renal outcomes

Severity and delayed resolution of AKI

The identification of subgroups of patients with AKI based on the trajectory of kidney function recovery after an AKI episode is also a potentially important and clinically intuitive parameter for risk stratification of AKI. In a large cohort of 47,903 adult US veteran patients, patients were subgrouped by the duration of time from peak serum creatinine to recovery of kidney function. The primary outcome was a sustained 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate or kidney failure. Patients with a protracted AKI recovery course were at higher risk for earlier loss of kidney function after recovery was complete. This study was corroborated further in a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 156,699 hospitalized, ICU and non-ICU patients focused on persistent AKI. AKI was classified as rapidly reversed AKI or persistent AKI (AKI lasting longer than 48 h with and without renal recovery) and compared to individuals with no AKI. Persistent AKI without renal recovery was associated with approximately fivefold increased hazard rates for all-cause mortality compared with no AKI in the full cohort as well as in the ICU and non-ICU subcohorts, independent of AKI severity.

Furthermore, functional tests can be used to identify patients who are likely to be AKI non-resolvers. The furosemide stress test assesses the urine output response to a large single dose of intravenous furosemide. Patients with a poor response have been found to have a higher likelihood of progression of AKI. It has been used as a method to stratify patients for intervention studies.

### Cumulative fluid accumulation is associated with the development of acute kidney injury and non-recovery of renal function: a retrospective analysis [^1133qTM7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common during critical illness, affecting > 50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is a syndrome rather than a defined diagnosis, has many different aetiologies and can develop at different stages throughout critical illness. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with short- and long-term complications and high healthcare costs. Patients who leave hospital alive remain at risk of chronic health problems, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The risk is particularly high in patients with more severe, recurrent or prolonged AKI and in those with reduced renal functional reserve.

Many patients already suffer from AKI when admitted to the ICU but a large proportion develop AKI later whilst receiving critical care. Their risk of dying is significantly higher than that of patients with AKI on admission. There is a clear need for better strategies to prevent the development of AKI during critical illness and to reduce the risk of progression in those who develop AKI. Although some risk factors are not modifiable, for instance advanced age or pre-existing CKD, others are avoidable or potentially amenable to modification, for instance exposure to nephrotoxic drugs. A better understanding of the risk of ICU-acquired AKI and the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors is essential to reduce the global burden of AKI.

The objectives of this study were (a) to identify factors associated with the development of new AKI during early stay in the ICU and (b) to ascertain risk factors for non-recovery of AKI.

### Timing of renal replacement therapy initiation for acute kidney injury [^113csV6n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition among patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and is associated with high death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a blood purification technique used to treat the most severe forms of AKI. The optimal time to initiate RRT so as to improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain. This review complements another Cochrane review by the same authors: Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different timing (early and standard) of RRT initiation on death and recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with AKI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 23 August 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS to 11 September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included all patients with AKI in ICU regardless of age, comparing early versus standard RRT initiation. For safety and cost outcomes we planned to include cohort studies and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors. The random-effects model was used and results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies enrolling 1084 participants. Overall, most domains were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to standard treatment, early initiation may reduce the risk of death at day 30, although the 95% CI does not rule out an increased risk (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence); and probably reduces the death after 30 days post randomisation (4 studies, 1056 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10; I² = 29%; moderate certainty evidence); however in both results the CIs included a reduction and an increase of death. Earlier start may reduce the risk of death or non-recovery kidney function (5 studies, 1076 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I² = 54%; low certainty evidence). Early strategy may increase the number of patients who were free of RRT after RRT discontinuation (5 studies, 1084 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.40; I² = 58%; low certainty evidence) and probably slightly increases the recovery of kidney function among survivors who discontinued RRT after day 30 (5 studies, 572 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard; however the lower limit of CI includes the null effect. Early RRT initiation increased the number of patients who experienced adverse events (4 studies, 899 participants: RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16; I² = 0%; high certainty evidence). Compared to standard, earlier RRT start may reduce the number of days in ICU (4 studies, 1056 participants: MD -1.78 days, 95% CI -3.70 to 0.13; I² = 90%; low certainty evidence), but the CI included benefit and harm.

Authors' Conclusions

Based mainly on low quality of evidence identified, early RRT may reduce the risk of death and may improve the recovery of kidney function in critically patients with AKI, however the 95% CI indicates that early RRT might worsen these outcomes. There was an increased risk of adverse events with early RRT. Further adequate-powered RCTs using appropriate criteria to define the optimal time of RRT are needed to reduce the imprecision of the results.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^111JD9cT]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Clinical and pathological characteristics of acute kidney injury caused by diquat poisoning [^113e3djr]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Diquat poisoning leads to kidney injury, hepatotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. Diquat has high mortality and no specific antidote. The pathology of acute kidney injury caused by diquat poisoning has been mainly investigated in animal studies and autopsies, and typically shows renal tubular necrosis. To our knowledge, antemortem renal biopsy has not been reported in humans. Case reports: Two males and one female presented following deliberate diquat self-poisoning. Their main clinical manifestations were abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. All developed acute kidney injury. Kidney biopsy was performed in two cases which showed acute tubular necrosis with renal interstitial edema and multifocal inflammatory cell infiltration. Treatments given included gastric lavage, catharsis, early hemoperfusion combined with continuous kidney replacement therapy or hemodialysis, administration of glucocorticoids, and antioxidant therapy. All patients survived. Discussion: Despite potentially lethal ingestions three patients survived oral diquat poisoning with intensive supportive care. No clear relationship can be made between any of the therapies given and patient outcome. Conclusions: Kidney biopsy in these patients confirmed proximal renal tubular injury was the major pathological finding although interstitial injury was also present. The role of therapies that address renal pathology requires further study.

### One-year prognosis of kidney injury at discharge from the ICU: a multicenter observational study [^112jzouy]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The association between outcome and kidney injury detected at discharge from the ICU using different biomarkers remains unknown. The objective was to evaluate the association between 1-year survival and kidney injury at ICU discharge.

Design

Ancillary investigation of a prospective observational study.

Setting

Twenty-one ICUs with 1-year follow-up.

Patients

Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and/or hemodynamic support for at least 24 hours were included.

Interventions

Serum creatinine, plasma Cystatin C, plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, plasma Proenkephalin A 119–159, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (on serum creatinine and plasma Cystatin C) were measured at ICU discharge among ICU survivors.

Measurements and Main Results

The association between kidney biomarkers at discharge and mortality was estimated using logistic model with and without adjustment for prognostic factors previously identified in this cohort. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with discharge serum creatinine less than 1.5-fold baseline at ICU discharge. Among 1,207 ICU survivors included, 231 died during the year following ICU discharge (19.2%). Estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower and kidney injury biomarkers higher at discharge in nonsurvivors. The association between biomarker levels or estimated glomerular filtration rate and mortality remained after adjustment to potential cofounding factors influencing outcome. In patients with low serum creatinine at ICU discharge, 25–47% of patients were classified as subclinical kidney injury depending on the biomarker. The association between kidney biomarkers and mortality remained and mortality was higher than patients without subclinical kidney injury. The majority of patients who developed acute kidney injury during ICU stay had elevated biomarkers of kidney injury at discharge even with apparent recovery based on serum creatinine (i.e., subclinical acute kidney disease).

Conclusions

Elevated kidney biomarkers measured at ICU discharge are associated with poor 1-year outcome, including in patients with low serum creatinine at ICU discharge.

### Risk factors for community-acquired acute kidney injury in patients with and without chronic kidney injury and impact of its initial management on prognosis: a prospective observational study [^116gfg5q]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequent disorder with an incidence of 400 per 100′000 persons per year in community-based populations. AKI has been associated with increased mortality and progression to CKI, and there is increased awareness of its ominous long-term prognosis. Most studies, however, have focused on hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) and very few studies have analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of patients with community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) despite its occurrence in 1% of hospital admissions. A prospective Spanish study demonstrated that 52% of AKI cases were HA-AKI, without specifying whether characteristics and outcomes differed from CA-AKI. A recent North-American retrospective cohort study showed that patients developing HA-AKI had more comorbidities, higher mortality rate and were more prone to need intensive care unit (ICU) care than patients with CA-AKI. Another retrospective study from the United Kingdom compared the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with CA-AKI to those with HA-AKI and also found that the latter had a grimmer prognosis in spite of similar risk factors.

An additional issue is that early recognition and management in the Emergency Department (ED) of patients with CA-AKI may have a positive impact on prognosis. In an intensive care setting, a delayed nephrology consultation was associated with higher mortality. In HA-AKI patients, early involvement of a nephrology team resulted in a lower rate of creatinine increase. However, in septic patients, early goal-directed therapy failed to reduce the incidence of AKI. Since the implementation of Kidney Disease Improving Global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to diagnose and grade AKI, no study has evaluated the impact of its early recognition and management on subsequent outcomes. There is indeed a lack of data to assess the impact of early AKI management on mortality, length of hospital stay, need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), or subsequent kidney function.

We therefore aimed to better define the characteristics and prognosis of CA-AKI in patients with and without CKI, the impact of CA-AKI recognition and management within the first 24 h, and the long-term outcomes of these patients compared to patients with stable CKI.

### Predictive performance of two types of urinary biomarkers for renal non-recovery in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: a prospective observational study [^115urTFk]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a frequently encountered condition within the intensive care unit (ICU), frequently precipitates organ dysfunction and poses life-threatening complications. Among these complications, acute kidney injury (AKI) emerges as a prevalent concern, exhibiting an incidence rate ranging from 40 to 50%. AKI is characterized by deterioration in renal function, leading to impaired regulation of extracellular volume and clearance of circulating substances. This ultimately contributes to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular events. The impact of AKI on morbidity and mortality is substantial, often resulting in an unfavorable prognosis. It is widely acknowledged that the patient's prognosis is influenced by the severity and duration of AKI. Notably, even a failure to recover renal function within 48 h can significantly affect the patient's prognosis, exerting both short-term and long-term consequences.

### One-year mortality among Danish intensive care patients with acute kidney injury: a cohort study [^111uszfz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are few studies on long-term mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). We assessed the prevalence of AKI at ICU admission, its impact on mortality during one year of follow-up, and whether the influence of AKI varied in subgroups of ICU patients.

Methods

We identified all adults admitted to any ICU in Northern Denmark (approximately 1.15 million inhabitants) from 2005 through 2010 using population-based medical registries. AKI was defined at ICU admission based on the risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification, using plasma creatinine changes. We included four severity levels: AKI-risk, AKI-injury, AKI-failure, and without AKI. We estimated cumulative mortality by the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratios (HRs) using a Cox model adjusted for potential confounders. We computed estimates for all ICU patients and for subgroups with different comorbidity levels, chronic kidney disease status, surgical status, primary hospital diagnosis, and treatment with mechanical ventilation or with inotropes/vasopressors.

Results

We identified 30,762 ICU patients, of which 4,793 (15.6%) had AKI at ICU admission. Thirty-day mortality was 35.5% for the AKI-risk group, 44.2% for the AKI-injury group, and 41.0% for the AKI-failure group, compared with 12.8% for patients without AKI. The corresponding adjusted HRs were 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80–2.13), 2.60 (95% CI 2.38 to 2.85) and 2.41 (95% CI 2.21 to 2.64), compared to patients without AKI. Among patients surviving 30 days (n = 25,539), 31- to 365 day mortality was 20.5% for the AKI-risk group, 23.8% for the AKI-injury group, and 23.2% for the AKI-failure group, compared with 10.7% for patients without AKI, corresponding to adjusted HRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.51), 1.60 (95% CI 1.37 to1.87), and 1.64 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.90), respectively. The association between AKI and 30-day mortality was evident in subgroups of the ICU population, with associations persisting in most subgroups during the 31- to 365-day follow-up period, although to a lesser extent than for the 30-day period.

Conclusions

AKI at ICU admission is an important prognostic factor for mortality throughout the subsequent year.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^113EefCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AGA best practice advice 3 — investigation is directed to determining the cause of AKI, which can be due to hypovolemic causes (volume responsive, and the most common cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis), acute tubular necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome with AKI (HRS-AKI), HRS with acute kidney disease (a type of functional renal failure of < 3 months- duration in which criteria for HRS-AKI are not met), or postrenal, which occurs only rarely; the specific type of AKI should be identified through a careful history, physical examination, blood biochemistry, urine microscopic examination, urine chemistry (Na+ and urea) and selected urinary biomarkers, and renal ultrasound.

### Prevailing patterns and predictor variables in patients with acute tubular necrosis… [^115BYHKM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The courses of 276 acute tubular necrosis patients referred for dialysis were reviewed in search for prognostic indicators. Sixty-three percent survived. Of 28 possible predictor variables, a posttoxic cause and nonoliguria were favorable, whereas myocardial infarction and peritonitis affected survival unfavorably. Total parenteral nutrition influenced survival favorably only in those with multiple complications or peritonitis. No single variable or combination predicted a lethal outcome. Since survivors were frequently restored to complete health, we advocate an aggressive therapeutic approach even in the face of multiple complications. McMurray SD, Luft FC, Maxwell DR, et al.

### Recovery of kidney function after acute kidney injury and long-term outcomes… [^115GykE3]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

eFigure. Risk of MAKE Between Patients Without AKI, Resolving AKI and Nonresolving AKI With 95% CIs. Question Is the trajectory of kidney function within 72 hours after acute kidney injury associated with 5-year clinical outcomes, such as chronic kidney disease, dialysis, and death. Findings Among 1538 participants in this prospective multicenter cohort study, the early recovery pattern after acute kidney injury was associated with long-term outcomes. In adjusted analyses, patients with a nonresolving recovery pattern after acute kidney injury had a 51% greater risk for the composite kidney-specific clinical outcome compared with patients with a resolving acute kidney injury recovery pattern, independent of traditional criteria to risk stratify patients with acute kidney injury. Meaning This study's finding suggest that the acute recovery pattern after development of acute kidney injury should be considered in evaluating the risk of long-term clinical outcomes.

Importance The severity of acute kidney injury is usually determined based on the maximum serum creatinine concentration. However, the trajectory of kidney function recovery could be an additional important dimension of AKI severity. Within the population of patients with AKI, nonresolving AKI was associated with a 51% greater risk of MAKE compared with resolving AKI. The higher risk of MAKE among patients with nonresolving AKI was explained by a higher risk of incident and progressive chronic kidney disease. Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that the 72-hour period immediately after AKI distinguishes the risk of clinically important kidney-specific long-term outcomes. The identification of different AKI recovery patterns may improve patient risk stratification, facilitate prognostic enrichment in clinical trials, and enable recognition of patients who may benefit from nephrology consultation.

Within the AKI population, nonresolving AKI was associated with a 51% greater risk of MAKE compared with resolving AKI. A substantial body of literature demonstrates that AKI in the hospital setting is associated with risks for early mortality, and a growing body of literature suggests that patients with AKI also experience adverse kidney-specific long-term outcomes. 4, 26, 27 However, AKI is common in hospitalized patients; therefore, clinicians are faced with prioritizing resources to closely monitor patients at high risk of CKD incidence or progression.

### Cause of acute tubular necrosis affects its prognosis… [^1135ceKY]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Background: Acute tubular necrosis is the most common type of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The cause of ATN can be divided into nephrotoxic, ischemic, or mixed. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the cause of ATN affects its clinical outcome. Methods: The study compares clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the placebo arm of a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of anaritide in patients with well-defined ATN. Patients were divided prospectively into groups according to the cause of ATN: pure nephrotoxic, pure ischemic, or mixed nephrotoxic and ischemic. Outcomes of interest were dialysis-free survival and all-cause mortality on day 14 and day 21. The causal groups were compared with respect to the prevalence of several comorbidities suspected of affecting the clinical outcomes. Results:

Mortality was 10% in the nephrotoxic group and 30% in the ischemic group on day 21. Dialysis-free survival was 66% in the nephrotoxic group and 41% in the ischemic group on day
21. Outcomes in the mixed and ischemic groups were similar. Compared with the nephrotoxic group, there was a significantly higher prevalence of cardiogenic shock, hypotension, sepsis, and respiratory failure and a tendency toward a higher prevalence of acute hepatic dysfunction in the ischemic group. Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in the nephrotoxic group. Among patients with ischemic ATN, dialysisfree survival improved significantly and mortality tended to decline with advancing age. Conclusions: Among patients with ATN, those in whom renal ischemia was causative had significantly higher mortality and lower dialysis-free survival than those whose ATN was purely nephrotoxic in origin.

This difference in clinical outcomes was associated with a higher prevalence of serious comorbidities in the ischemic ATN group. Advancing age was associated with improved dialysisfree survival and a tendency toward reduced mortality in patients with ischemic ATN.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management… [^1159sSiQ]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

CREATININE CLEARANCE Creatinine clearance is a direct measure of GFR, and serial creatinine clearance testing provides a more efficient and accurate assessment of renal function than serum creatinine testing. 20 Creatinine clearance can be performed in collection periods of one to 24 hours, although longer collection times increase the likelihood of errors related to inaccurate time recording and incomplete collection. 6 A cohort study of 484 patients in the ICU found that four-hour creatinine clearance testing is a valid measurement of acute kidney injury. A decrease of greater than 33% in the first 12 hours conferred a twofold elevated risk of dialysis or death.
20.

If metabolic derangements from acute kidney injury do not respond to conservative treatment, renal replacement therapy, in consultation with a nephrologist, may be required. Table 7 includes indications for initiating renal replacement therapy. 7, 35–37 A multicenter RCT of 488 patients with acute kidney injury and septic shock compared early initiation of renal replacement therapy with delayed initiation and found no difference in 90-day mortality.
38. FOLLOW-UP The transition from the hospital to the outpatient setting presents an opportunity to improve the care of patients with acute kidney injury. Follow-up three months after hospitalization is reasonable if renal function is recovered, with earlier follow-up intervals for patients with a slower recovery.

Prognosis Stage 3 acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy is associated with mortality rates between 44% and 52%. 44, 45 Observational studies have shown an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease following acute kidney injury. 3 In a cohort study that followed hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries for two years after discharge, acute kidney injury was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of end-stage renal disease in patients without preexisting chronic kidney disease and a 40-fold increase in patients with both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. 5 Acute kidney injury is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. 46, 47 A retrospective cohort study of 2, 451 hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury found that they had a 22% increased risk of developing hypertension within six months. 48.
