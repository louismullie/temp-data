## Question

What's the correct treatment for pinworm where initial treatment did not succeed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) when initial therapy has failed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify what the initial regimen was and whether it was executed correctly. Next, I will consider reinfection dynamics and household/environmental control. After that, I need to evaluate for host and disease factors that predispose to recurrence, including constipation and ectopic reservoirs. Then, I will select an evidence-based retreatment strategy, including drug choice, dosing, and potential combination therapy. Finally, I should address special populations, define follow-up and failure criteria, and outline escalation pathways if treatment continues to fail [^114DeRzc] [^111AXPMa].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because persistent pruritus ani can be due to other causes or even a different parasite; I should double-check with a tape test or paddle test for eggs and, if available, direct visualization of adult worms, while also considering mimics such as Dipylidium caninum, which can present similarly and requires different therapy, and I should remember that stool ova and parasite testing is insensitive for pinworm, so a negative stool does not exclude disease [^111AXPMa] [^112FtFyC] [^111CeW91].

> Wait, let me verify the initial regimen details before declaring failure; the standard of care is two doses of an effective agent given 2 weeks apart to target newly hatched worms, so I need to check which drug was used, whether the second dose was actually given at 14 days, whether dosing was correct for age and weight, and whether all household members were treated simultaneously, because missing the second dose or failing to treat close contacts are common reasons for apparent treatment failure [^114DeRzc] [^115yWceX] [^1143NpeZ].

> Hold on, I should verify reinfection risks next; pinworm eggs are infectious within hours and can persist in the environment, so meticulous hygiene for the patient and household for at least 2 weeks after treatment is essential, including frequent handwashing, daily bathing with attention to the perianal area, trimming nails, laundering bedding and clothing with hot water and machine drying, and avoiding dry sweeping that aerosolizes eggs, and in institutional settings, mass simultaneous treatment with repeat dosing may be necessary to break transmission cycles [^114DeRzc] [^115yWceX] [^111Qjkr5].

> I need to check for host and disease factors that predispose to recurrence; constipation is a major, often overlooked driver of treatment-refractory enterobiasis, likely by impairing expulsion of dead worms and eggs and facilitating autoinfection, so I should actively screen for and aggressively treat constipation with behavioral and pharmacologic measures, and in girls and women I should consider vaginal ectopic infection as a reservoir, which may require targeted local management in addition to systemic therapy [^1143NpeZ] [^113fcvjH].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic retreatment strategy; if the initial two-dose regimen failed despite correct administration and hygiene, I should switch the drug class to reduce the chance of partial resistance or tolerance, for example from a benzimidazole to pyrantel pamoate or vice versa, and I should confirm standard dosing: albendazole 400 mg once and repeat in 2 weeks, mebendazole 100 mg once and repeat in 2 weeks, or pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg once and repeat in 2 weeks, with albendazole generally taken on an empty stomach to optimize absorption [^113ycPoJ] [^1174RMG4] [^114DeRzc].

> But wait, what if two standard doses are insufficient; in refractory cases, I should escalate to a pulse regimen with three doses at 2-week intervals, as supported by case-based evidence, and I should also remember that although high-quality pinworm-specific RCTs are limited, broader STH data suggest benzimidazole efficacy can wane over time, so switching agents and extending intervals are reasonable strategies while maintaining strict hygiene [^113fcvjH] [^1152XMTk] [^113UqE1f].

> I should double-check whether combination therapy has a role; while data are strongest for other helminths like Trichuris, albendazole plus ivermectin has improved cure rates in some STH contexts, and although ivermectin is not first-line for pinworm, in highly refractory cases with high worm burden or suspected partial resistance, a one-time combination of albendazole with ivermectin may be considered off-label with specialist input, balancing potential benefit against limited direct pinworm evidence [^1152XMTk] [^115WMPtJ] [^114DeRzc].

> Next, I should review special populations; in pregnancy, I should generally defer treatment until the third trimester if possible and prefer mebendazole given more safety experience, and during lactation mebendazole is considered compatible due to minimal excretion, while in children under 2 years I must weigh risks and benefits and consider pyrantel pamoate as a relatively safer option with weight-based dosing, and in immunocompromised hosts I should ensure that standard two-dose therapy plus rigorous hygiene is prioritized before escalating [^114DeRzc] [^115yWceX] [^113ycPoJ].

> I will now examine follow-up and define failure; I should reassess symptoms at 2 and 4 weeks after the last dose and, if uncertainty remains, repeat a tape test, recognizing that persistence of eggs or symptoms beyond 4 weeks despite correct therapy and hygiene constitutes treatment failure and should prompt me to re-evaluate for constipation, ectopic reservoirs, or alternative diagnoses, and to escalate therapy accordingly [^114DeRzc] [^111AXPMa].

> Hold on, I should verify the escalation pathway if failure persists; after confirming adherence, completing a three-dose pulse regimen, optimizing constipation management, and ensuring household and environmental control, I should consider infectious diseases or pediatric specialty referral for evaluation of possible resistance, atypical reservoirs, or alternative diagnoses, and in institutional outbreaks, coordinate mass treatment and environmental control measures to interrupt transmission [^1143NpeZ] [^114DeRzc].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct, the initial regimen was executed properly, reinfection has been minimized, constipation and ectopic reservoirs have been addressed, and then employ a switched-agent or extended-interval strategy with strict hygiene; if these steps are followed methodically, most apparent treatment failures resolve without needing exotic therapies, and persistent cases warrant specialist input and consideration of off-label combination approaches [^114DeRzc] [^113fcvjH] [^1152XMTk].

For persistent pinworm after initial therapy, use **albendazole 400 mg orally, repeated in 2 weeks** [^113ycPoJ] [^114DeRzc]; if albendazole was used initially, switch to **mebendazole 100 mg orally, repeated in 2 weeks** [^1174RMG4] [^114DeRzc]. Treat all household contacts simultaneously to prevent reinfection [^1143NpeZ], and reinforce strict hygiene (handwashing, nail trimming, daily bathing, hot laundering of bedding, and vacuuming) [^111Qjkr5]. If symptoms persist, consider a third dose at 2-week intervals or use pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg once, repeated in 2 weeks [^113fcvjH] [^114DeRzc]. Persistent cases may reflect reinfection, ectopic infestation, or resistance; reassess diagnosis and adherence, and consult infectious disease if failure continues [^1143NpeZ] [^1152XMTk].

## Recommended retreatment regimens

Key characteristics of recommended retreatment agents:

| **Aspect** | **Albendazole** | **Mebendazole** | **Pyrantel pamoate** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dosage | 400 mg orally, repeated in 2 weeks [^113ycPoJ] [^114DeRzc] | 100 mg orally, repeated in 2 weeks [^1174RMG4] [^114DeRzc] | 11 mg/kg orally, repeated in 2 weeks [^114DeRzc] |
| Administration | Take on an empty stomach [^113ycPoJ] | Chewable tablet; may be swallowed whole or chewed [^notfound] | Available OTC; suitable for those intolerant to benzimidazoles [^114DeRzc] |
| Efficacy | High cure rates; preferred first-line agent [^111RWQGK] [^111AXPMa] | High cure rates; alternative to albendazole [^111RWQGK] [^114DeRzc] | Moderate cure rates; useful alternative [^111RWQGK] [^111AXPMa] |

---

## Adjunctive measures to prevent reinfection

Reinfection is common; **implement strict hygiene** and treat all close contacts:

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing, especially before meals and after toileting [^111Qjkr5].
- **Nail care**: Keep nails short and clean [^notfound].
- **Bathing**: Daily morning baths to remove eggs [^notfound].
- **Laundry**: Wash bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water; dry on high heat [^notfound].
- **Household cleaning**: Vacuum and damp-mop living areas regularly [^111Qjkr5].
- **Contact treatment**: Treat all household members simultaneously to prevent reinfection [^1143NpeZ].

---

## Management of persistent or recurrent infections

If infection persists after two standard doses, consider:

- **Third dose**: Administer a third dose 2 weeks after the second [^113fcvjH].
- **Alternative medication**: Switch to a different anthelmintic class (e.g. pyrantel pamoate) [^113fcvjH].
- **Ectopic infestation**: Evaluate for vaginal or other ectopic sites, especially in females [^113fcvjH] [^111RA3Hq].
- **Resistance**: Although rare, resistance may occur; consider alternative regimens or combination therapy [^1143NpeZ].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy and lactation

During pregnancy, **mebendazole** is preferred; avoid albendazole in the first trimester [^notfound]. For lactation, mebendazole is minimally excreted and considered compatible with breastfeeding [^114DeRzc].

---

### Children under 2 years

For children under 2 years, **weight-based dosing** is required; weigh risks and benefits carefully [^114DeRzc].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Confirm eradication with a **tape test** 2–4 weeks after the final dose [^notfound]. If symptoms persist, **reassess** for reinfection, ectopic infestation, or resistance [^1143NpeZ].

---

## Retreatment options

| **Medication** | **Dosage** | **Repeat dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Albendazole | 400 mg orally | 2 weeks | First-line; take on empty stomach [^114DeRzc] |
| Mebendazole | 100 mg orally | 2 weeks | Chewable tablet [^111Qjkr5] |
| Pyrantel pamoate | 11 mg/kg orally | 2 weeks | OTC; alternative option [^114DeRzc] |

---

Persistent pinworm after initial therapy should be managed with **retreatment using albendazole or mebendazole**, strict hygiene, and simultaneous treatment of household contacts. If infection persists, consider a third dose, switch medication, or evaluate for ectopic infestation or resistance.

Pruritus ani is frequently encountered in children by the primary care physician and the pediatrician. It is mainly due to an infection with pinworms, but fecal soiling, poor hygiene, local irritation, and dietary agents should also be considered. Treatment should be directed at the underlying etiology. Once these have been excluded, both general and specific measures must be initiated. There is almost no experience for local treatment modalities in children, and they cannot currently be recommended.

Pinworm infection is a very common diagnosis in young children that is not always confirmed through laboratory evaluation before empiric therapy is prescribed. This article describes a toddler who was treated several times for pinworms because small white worms were seen in her perianal area. Laboratory analysis of parasite material found in her diaper later confirmed a diagnosis of dipylidiasis. Because the signs of dipylidiasis and pinworm infection overlap and the treatments for these parasitic infections are different, the laboratory should clinically confirm suspected persistent or recurrent pinworms.

MEBENDAZOLE TABLETS, USP

CHEWABLE TABLET

100 mg

Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat an infection caused by an intestinal worm. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. In addition to your doctor's treatment, you can help prevent reinfection and infection of other people by understanding a few simple facts about worms.

PINWORM: Pinworms look like tiny white threads and live in the bowel. Usually at night, they travel to the rectal opening and lay eggs on the outside skin. This sometimes causes itching which may be very annoying. That is why restless sleep is a frequent sign of pinworms, especially in children. Scratching will cause pinworm eggs to stick to the fingers. Reinfection will result if the fingers are placed in the mouth.

The eggs, which are too small to see, contaminate whatever they come in contact with: bedclothes, underwear, hands, and food touched by contaminated hands. Even eggs floating in the air can be swallowed and cause infection. Pinworms are highly contagious. Even the cleanest and most careful people can get them.

To help prevent reinfection follow these rules:

Wash hands and fingernails with soap often during the day, especially before eating and after using the toilet.
Wear tight underpants both day and night. Change them daily.
For several days after treatment, clean the bedroom floor by vacuuming or damp mopping. Avoid dry sweeping that may stir up dust.
After treatment, wash bed linens and night clothes (don't shake them).
Keep the toilet seats clean

### Common intestinal parasites [^111AXPMa]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Parasites are a source of significant illness worldwide. In the United States, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, and trichinellosis are nationally notifiable conditions. Pinworm, the most common intestinal parasite in children, is not a locally notifiable infection. Intestinal parasites have a wide range of acute and chronic symptoms but should be suspected in those who present with diarrhea lasting more than seven days. Infections most often occur through a fecal-oral route. Symptoms tend to be worse for children, older adults, or immunocompromised individuals. To diagnose Giardia infection, stool microscopy with direct fluorescent antibody testing is recommended; metronidazole, nitazoxanide, or tinidazole is used for treatment. Microscopy with immunofluorescence is sensitive and specific for diagnosing Cryptosporidium infection. This infection is often self-resolving, but treatment with nitazoxanide is effective for symptoms lasting more than two weeks. Microscopy or polymerase chain reaction assays are recommended to diagnose Cyclospora infections, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim may be used to treat patients with persistent diarrhea. Trichinella infection is diagnosed by serum antibody testing, and severe symptoms are treated with albendazole in patients older than one year. Pinworm infections are diagnosed visually or by a tape test or paddle test; albendazole and pyrantel pamoate are both effective treatments.

### (pinworm) infestation in a child presenting with symptoms of acute appendicitis: a wriggly tale! [^114kpwZ4]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency worldwide. However, it can still present a challenging diagnosis especially in the young, elderly and those individuals of reproductive age, thus encompassing a wide spectrum of varied clinical presentations. Parasitic infections of the appendix are a rare cause of acute appendicitis. However, they must be considered in children presenting with abdominal pain. We report a case of Enterobius vermicularis infestation mimicking the features of acute appendicitis in a 10-year-old girl. This case is a cautionary reminder of the importance of considering E. vermicularis infestation in children presenting with abdominal pain, but who do not have a significantly raised white cell count or high Alvarado scores. A history of anal pruritus is the most characteristic symptom, but the parasites can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis. Prompt recognition and a high clinical index of suspicion are required to prevent an unnecessary appendicectomy. Caution is advised when performing a laparoscopic appendectomy, as in our case, to prevent contamination of the peritoneum. This infestation is easily treatable with mebendazole.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1139WYmG]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and assessment of risk bias

From each eligible randomised controlled trial we extracted number of infected participants at baseline, number of cured participants at follow-up, mean number of eggs at baseline, mean number of eggs at follow-up, percentage of egg reduction, measure of central tendency (arithmetic, geometric, or not described), information on the number of treatment arms, number of eligible treatment arms, year of publication, country, diagnostic method, age range, and time between treatment and follow-up.

Two independent reviewers (WM and JK) screened titles and abstracts for potential studies. When articles met the inclusion criteria, the entire manuscripts were scrutinised, and, for eligible trials, the data were extracted independently by the same reviewers. All included trials were assessed for quality by two different methods: that described by Jadad and colleagues, with scores ranging between 1 (lowest level) and 5 (highest level), and according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (table A in appendix 2). The latter criteria assess studies for risk of bias in six different domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Each domain is categorised into low, high, or unclear risk of bias. In case of discrepancies over extraction of data or scoring of the study quality, a third person (CS) was involved and the results discussed until consensus was reached.

### Chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain: pin the pinworm [^112YTaV6]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Enterobius vermicularis is the most common helminthic infection in the US. It is usually considered an innocuous parasite that at the most causes perianal itching. We report a case of an 84-year-old female patient from an assisted living facility who presented with symptoms of colitis for 2 months. On detailed history and exam, she was found to have E. vermicularis infection. All her symptoms resolved dramatically within 2 days after a single dose of albendazole. We want to emphasize the importance of including parasitic infections such as E. vermicularis in the differential diagnoses of patients presenting with symptoms of colitis.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^114g2J2u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Both modeling approaches agree that in most transmission settings, the present guidelines for treatment coverage need to be broadened to include the treatment of all age groups, to achieve the WHO morbidity goals. Therefore, we recommend attempting to achieve 75% community-wide coverage, while removing the option of reducing the treatment frequency as prevalence drops during a long-term MDA program.

Though WHO goals on STH are focused on morbidity control rather than (as yet) elimination as such, there is obvious benefit to coordinated assessment and continued treatment to achieve more effective morbidity control, and perhaps mitigation of ongoing costs through interruption of parasite transmission.

Methods

The protocol for this study was reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was granted exempt status. The study used data from a deidentified database. All results are presented in aggregate form, and specific patients were not identified; thus, informed consent was not required in accordance with 45 CFR §46. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data were abstracted from IBM MarketScan Research Databases for patients with private insurance from 2010 to 2018. Standard-of-care (SOC) drugs for hookworm and pinworm include albendazole, mebendazole, and over-the-counter pyrantel pamoate. Ivermectin was included because it is frequently prescribed for hookworm, although it is inferior and non-SOC. For C difficile, oral vancomycin hydrochloride, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole are SOC drugs. Individuals with outpatient diagnosis codes for each infection were selected, and prescription drug and TOCs were analyzed descriptively over time using methods previously described (eAppendix in the Supplement).

The 95% CIs were calculated and reported with the mean values of listed variables. To further evaluate the increase or decrease of proportions of those who were treated or treatment costs over time, Welch 1-tailed t test was used. P < .05 was chosen as the significance threshold. We used Stata/MP statistical software version 14.2 (StataCorp) for statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed from September 2019 to January 2020.

### Eosinophilia and potential antibody cross-reactivity between parasites in a child with pinworm and immune dysregulation: a case report [^115mM3rZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Our case has several peculiarities which deserve to be reported. First of all, it should be noted that our patient had severe hypereosinophilia prompting laboratory blood testing, which is not routinely performed when a pinworm infection is suspected: further blood testing was performed to investigate parasite serology as well as ANCA levels, considering that our patient also had allergic asthma and chronic rhinitis which could have been related to a potential diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Regarding the eosinophil count, despite the well-established correlation between eosinophilia and other helminth infections (such as those caused by Toxocara, Trichinella species, T. solium, Echinococcus, Strongyloides), it is commonly believed that Ev is not frequently associated with blood eosinophilia, especially in children, but it should be noted that these patients are usually healthy enough at the first evaluation to avoid blood testing, which is why data is probably lacking on this point. Unsurprisingly, in 2019 Shroeder et al. reported 3 cases of peripheral eosinophilia in children with pinworm and gastrointestinal complaints suggesting an association between Ev and high eosinophil count, but none of them had an eosinophil count higher than 1,500, as in our patient. In the literature, there are only a few other reports confirming that eosinophilia may be associated with enterobiasis in adults. It should be noted that in our patient the eosinophil count significantly improved after treatment with pyrantel pamoate, confirming enterobiasis as the cause, perhaps due to a long-lasting infection with a large worm burden, which was confirmed by the fact that the stool examination was positive, while it commonly detects only 5% of Ev intestinal infestations. Moreover, it should be noted that while hypereosinophilia and high levels of IgE can be found in children with severe allergic asthma, especially with atopic dermatitis, our patient, despite having a long story of hypereosinophilia, showed mild asthma symptoms, a low increase of FeNO and optimal response to asthma treatment. Notably, inhaled corticosteroids have a limited effect on peripheral eosinophilia. Thus, in our opinion, Ev should be considered in the diagnostic algorithm for eosinophilia in children, even in the absence of typical symptoms, in order to avoid more aggressive and unproductive evaluation.

### Unmasking the role of constipation in treatment-refractory enterobiasis in Bangladeshi children [^1143NpeZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In routine pediatric and gastroenterology outpatient practice, enterobiasis (enterobius vermicularis infection) is a common condition. While typically mild, chronic and recurrent cases are not uncommon and can often be refractory to standard treatment protocols. In our study, we analyzed 114 cases of treatment-refractoryenterobiasis, and notably, 96% of these children had underlying constipation, which had been previously unaddressed or inadequately treated. The hallmark symptom of symptomatic enterobius vermicularis infection is perianal itching, particularly at night, caused by the nocturnal migration of gravid female worms to the perianal region. Consistent with this, 100% of children in our study presented with perianal itching and passage of worms during nighttime. Sleep disturbances, particularly crying at night, are also commonly associated with enterobius vermicularis infection. We observed this in 64% of our patients, indicating significant discomfort and sleep disruption. Other associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, increased frequency of micturition, and nocturnal enuresis were frequently reported. These symptoms are likely multifactorial, potentially arising from both constipation and pinworm infestation. In certain cases, E. vermicularis may mimic or coexist with other gastrointestinal disorders. It has been associated with abdominal pain resembling acute appendicitis, and may cause appendicitis. Additionally, enterobiasis can occasionally present with features overlapping chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In one patient in our study, colonoscopy was performed under suspicion of IBD, but E. vermicularis was identified instead (video 3). We also observed that symptoms such as encopresis, defecation immediately after meals, frequent defecation with small-volume stools, nocturnal enuresis and abdominal distension occurred in approximately 7–10% of patients. These clinical features are strongly suggestive of occult constipation. In female children, migration of adult worms to the vaginal or vulvar area can lead to vaginal irritation, inflammation, and mucoid discharge. We identified a few such cases in our cohort, where worms were removed from the vaginal region during nocturnal observation. It's important to differentiate enterobiasis from other conditions that can mimic its presentation. For example, intestinal myiasis may be misdiagnosed as pinworm infestation, leading to ineffective treatment with antihelminthics. Similarly, in infants, cow's milk allergy can be a significant cause of recurrent perianal pruritus. In our study, however, each case was diagnosed by direct visualization of adult worms in the perianal region, which helped rule out these differential diagnoses. Traditional treatments such as herbal and ayurvedicremedies are used in South Asian countries, including Bangladesh. In our study, 18% of children had received such traditional treatments like raw garlic and neem leaves, including homeopathic and herbal medications before enrolled in this study, but none showed any clinical improvement. This use of traditional remedies reflects the strong influence of cultural practices on health-seeking behavior in the study population. Several effective antihelminthic agents are available for the treatment of enterobiasis, including mebendazole, albendazole, and pyrantelpamoate. These drugs are typically administered as a single-dose therapy, with a second dose repeated after two weeks to prevent auto-infection and ensure the elimination of newly developed adult worms. As enterobiasis often affects entire households, it is essential that all family members be treated simultaneously to prevent re-infection. In cases of recurrent infection, a "pulse regimen" — repeating doses at regular intervals over an extended period — is recommended. In our study, all included children had already undergone pulse regimen therapy with poor or no response prior to enrollment. Notably, there is a scarcity of data in the literature regarding treatment-refractory enterobiasis. One case report describes a child who continued to pass worms despite fortnightly albendazole for 6 months, with no definitive resolution. Our study found a significant association between treatment-refractory enterobius vermicularis infection and constipation. When constipation was identified and treated adequately, all cases showed complete symptom resolution. This highlights a critical and previously underexplored link. There is a lack of comparable studies evaluating how constipation may impact treatment outcomes in enterobiasis. In vivo studies have demonstrated that reduced gastrointestinal motility significantly impairs helminth clearance, whereas normal or enhanced motility is critical for effective parasite expulsion. One possible explanation is that sluggish bowel motility delays the expulsion of dead worms and eggs, allowing them to remain in the rectum and perianal region. This increases the chances of autoinfection and retroinfection. However, eight cases (four with constipation and four without) did not respond to treatment, raising the possibility of antihelminthic drug resistance or ectopic infections, especially vagina may have served as an ectopic reservoir for enterobius vermicularis, although we were unable to confirm these hypotheses. We fully acknowledge the absence of a control group as a major limitation of our study. Another key limitation is the relatively small sample size and the fact that the study was conducted in a single geographic region, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Symptom severity was not assessed and duration of follow up was short. Another point, our study did not perform routine vaginal sampling or gynecologic evaluation for genital tract infestation in female patients. We recommend conducting a well-designed study with an appropriate control group with longer follow-up to strengthen causal inference and clarify the role of constipation in treatment-refractory enterobiasis.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^116AdepM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pruritus frequently arises from infectious causes, which should be strongly considered in the initial differential diagnosis. Common infectious causes that do not cause lesions and can be evaluated quickly are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Parasitic infestations such as public lice and pinworms should also be readily considered in patients with excoriations but no other visual lesions, particularly in children and sexually active individuals, especially those with risk factors such as contact with infected individuals or children with frequent exposure to other children. If there is suspicion for STI, HIV status should be evaluated, as affected individuals are prone to more severe or recurrent infection. If lesions are present, their appearance and associated symptoms should guide the differential diagnosis. Herpetic lesions, condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis primary lesions all have distinctive appearances and can be confirmed with laboratory testing or biopsies.

Inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, AD, lichen planus (LP), and contact dermatitis, frequently cause vaginal pruritus and should be on the differential for acute and chronic vulvovaginal itching due to their intermittent and relapsing and remitting nature. Psoriasis is a chronic cause of itch accompanying well-demarcated, erythematous red plaques limited to the labia majora often misdiagnosed as candida. In AD, the presence of poorly defined erythematous plaques, excoriations, and a history of itching and scratching are key diagnostic clues. LP results in erosive lesions and scarring of the vulva, and there is often extragenital involvement. Irritant contact dermatitis causes rapid onset burning sensations with localized vesicular plaques or scaly patches. For allergic contact dermatitis, intermittent symptoms and a lack of response to standard treatments may raise suspicion for an underlying allergen, warranting further evaluation such as a patch test.

### Cutaneous mastocytosis exacerbated by pinworms in a young boy [^112yN4FM]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Cutaneous mastocytosis in children has an indolent course and undergoes spontaneous regression. Many triggering factors may cause mast cell degranulation and clinical manifestations. Knowledge of these factors is important for patients and their families. We report a case of exacerbation of urticaria pigmentosa due to mast cell degranulation caused by Enterobius vermicularis, which has not been reported before as a triggering factor.

### Increases in anti-infective drug prices, subsequent prescribing, and outpatient costs [^112Y5JGU]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The mean wholesale prices of the antiparasitic drugs albendazole (400 mg; Albenza) and mebendazole (600 mg; Emverm) increased between 2010 and 2019 from $3.16 to $582 for albendazole and from $32 to $2853 for mebendazole. In this cross-sectional study, the association of antiparasitic drug prices with prescribing and prescription-filling behaviors and total outpatient treatment costs (TOCs) are investigated for hookworm and pinworm. These results are compared with those for Clostridioides difficile, which was selected because of similar outpatient characteristics and available number and specificity of drugs available.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^116aNmim]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

It is important to consider the effect of uncertainty generated by the stochastic nature of the processes being modeled as the endline prevalence results quoted in Figures 2 and 3 are mean values. Prediction intervals for model prevalence estimates are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

The differences between models notwithstanding, our results indicate that current guidelines can produce good outcomes in SAC morbidity control in low-prevalence (and perhaps some moderate-prevalence) areas (Figure 2). However, in higher-prevalence areas, adult infection may be enough to sustain high reinfection of SAC and put achievement of the morbidity goal at risk. In those areas, community-wide transmission is beneficial. In many cases, sufficient community-wide treatment can be expected to break transmission, with obvious benefits for long-term morbidity control.

Both models predict improvement in Trichuris outcomes when both albendazole and ivermectin are administered, rather than albendazole only. Applying community-wide treatment has a greater impact on morbidity compared with the drug coadministration strategy (Supplementary Figure 1).

### Small bowel intussusception andinfestation in a 20-year-old woman [^114ggv1L]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and MRI findings of intussusception of the distal small bowel with no identifiable lead point and no visualisation of the appendix. A diagnostic laparoscopy succeeded in manually reducing the intussusception but was unable to find any candidate lead point. Intraoperatively, hyperperistalsis was observed throughout the small bowel which seemed prone to transient intussusception. Incidental appendectomy revealed an uninflamed appendix with Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infestation, the most common parasite present in appendectomy specimens worldwide. Although intussusception in young adults is an uncommon occurrence, the unique nature of this case is amplified by the concurrent finding of E. vermicularis infection of the appendix in an adolescent in western Canada, a phenomenon normally observed in paediatric populations with higher incidence in tropical areas. Although the mechanism of intussusception in this patient remains unclear, it is hypothesised that E. vermicularis colonisation acted as an irritant stimulating intestinal hypercontractility with resulting intussusception. Successful medical eradication of the pinworm in this individual may prevent future recurrence.

### Pin-site myiasis caused by screwworm fly, Colombia [^111gh3QY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Myiasis is the infestation of humans or animals with dipterous insect larvae. The term pin-site myiasis was recently adopted for a rare and emerging parasitic infection after treatment of open fractures with external metal fixators (pins). Myiasis can also occur as a result of invasion of larvae deposited by flies in wounds adjacent to these fixators. We describe a patient with pin-site myiasis caused by the Cochliomyia hominivorax screwworm fly associated with external fixators used for treatment of an open fracture of the femur.

In September 2014, a 26-year-old male soldier from the Department of Meta in central Colombia was admitted to a primary medical unit for treatment of an open fracture of the right femur after a traffic accident. The patient had no relevant medical history. After multiple surgical interventions and external fixation of the fracture, he was discharged. Two weeks later, he returned to the medical unit with edema, redness, and warmth in the area surrounding the metallic fixators. At this time, 50 larvae were observed in the surgical wound (Figure, panel A).

### Common intestinal parasites [^114ywQvd]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Intestinal parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia lamblia, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Entamoeba histolytica occur in the United States. E. vermicularis, or pinworm, causes irritation and sleep disturbances. Diagnosis can be made using the "cellophane tape test". Treatment includes mebendazole and household sanitation. Giardia causes nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. Stool ova and parasite studies are diagnostic. Treatment includes metronidazole. Sewage treatment, proper handwashing, and consumption of bottled water can be preventive. A. duodenale and N. americanus are hookworms that cause blood loss, anemia, pica, and wasting. Finding eggs in the feces is diagnostic. Treatments include albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, iron supplementation, and blood transfusion. Preventive measures include wearing shoes and treating sewage. E. histolytica can cause intestinal ulcerations, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, fever, gastrointestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Amebas can cause abscesses in the liver that may rupture into the pleural space, peritoneum, or pericardium. Stool and serologic assays, biopsy, barium studies, and liver imaging have diagnostic merit. Therapy includes luminal and tissue amebicides to attack both life-cycle stages. Metronidazole, chloroquine, and aspiration are treatments for liver abscess. Careful sanitation and use of peeled foods and bottled water are preventive.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^113PzmB4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

As parasite elimination is approached, issues related to reaching the last few infected individuals come to the fore. This is an area of active research. Recent work on systematic noncompliance with MDA treatment indicates that the importance of this factor to effective control by MDA varies between helminth species, with the longer-lived species perhaps most affected. The importance of accurate coverage data in informing policy is well understood. However, surprisingly, few longitudinal studies on compliance of individuals with anthelmintic treatment have been conducted. Such studies require individuals to be followed up over successive rounds of treatment, over a number of years. This poses considerable logistical challenges. The need for good MDA coverage data has driven the inclusion of individual-level and longitudinal data collection in the DeWorm3 study. Though the 3 dominant STH species are treated collectively in terms of the drug used and the formulation of the WHO treatment guidelines, differences are evident in required action to meet the WHO prevalence goal. Though we mirror current WHO guidelines in producing recommendations that are applicable across STH diseases as a whole, ideally the guidelines would reflect the locally dominant species and provide species-specific recommendations, as well as differentiating by disease prevalence. In very low-prevalence areas (< 10%), current guidelines may be sufficient. Less reliably, given the models' mixed predictions, the goal may be achievable in areas largely free of hookworm with Ascaris or Trichuris prevalence up to 20%. In all other circumstances, we strongly recommend community-wide treatment at high coverage. Regional circumstances and availability of data on prevalence of the different diseases will determine whether treating STH collectively or tailored by disease and local prevalence is the best approach. Where granular data are not available, we recommend community-wide treatment. In addition, given the low drug efficacy of mebendazole (rather than albendazole), we would expect more aggressive, higher-coverage MDA to be necessary where mebendazole is used. In clearing Trichuris, a more specific set of guidelines may be needed given the higher efficacy of an albendazole + ivermectin drug coadministration regimen.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1152XMTk]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our data confirm that the most widely used drugs — albendazole and mebendazole — have shortcomings in their efficacy profile, especially against infections with hookworm and T trichiura. Alarmingly, the efficacy of albendazole and mebendazole has decreased over time. As the two most widely distributed drugs in preventive chemotherapy — albendazole and mebendazole — have been in use for almost 50 years, the threat of resistance is real and immediate. For careful monitoring of potential resistance, our summary estimates might help to revise current reference figures of efficacy.

There is an imminent need to strengthen efforts to develop new drugs for soil transmitted helminths. Alternatively, old and new drugs — such as tribendimidine, oxantel pamoate, moxidectin, or ivermectin — with different efficacy profiles could be used in combination with the recommended drugs to successfully tackle infections with all three soil transmitted helminths. Only with an integrated approach combining improved sanitation, health education, and scaling up of research for new anthelmintic drugs and use of drug combinations for preventive chemotherapy will we achieve the ultimate goal to control soil transmitted helminth infections. Furthermore, future randomised controlled trials should follow a harmonised design to reduce confounders and yield improved summary estimates of efficacy of anthelmintic drugs.

Treatment

The patient was initially prescribed praziquantel for suspicion of tapeworms and advised to hold treatment until formal identification was available. Once Moniliformis moniliformis was identified, an infectious disease specialist was consulted for guidance on treatment and over-the-counter pyrantel pamoate was recommended. The patient completed three doses of 11 mg/kg pyrantel pamoate, separated by 2-week intervals. A repeat stool study was performed 2 weeks following the last treatment and was negative for ova and parasites.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1155hM2e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Drug efficacy against hookworm

For estimating the drug efficacy against hookworm, we looked at data from 7178 individuals from 38 studies (table 1; table N in appendix 2) with an average Jadad score of 2.8. Pooled estimates included 12 studies with one treatment,21 studies with two treatments, and five studies with three treatments.

The cure rate was 15.2% (95% confidence interval 9.3% to 23.9%) for placebo (table 1). The rate with levamisole (10.3%, 2.4% to 35.2%) did not differ significantly from the placebo rate, but was significantly higher with albendazole (79.5%, 71.5% to 85.6%; P < 0.001), mebendazole (32.5%, 20.8% to 46.9%; P = 0.011), and pyrantel pamoate (49.8%, 29.5% to 70.1%; P = 0.001). The one to one comparison of cure rates showed a strongly increased odds of cure after the administration of albendazole compared with mebendazole (P < 0.001), levamisole (P < 0.001), and pyrantel pamoate (P = 0.005, fig 2). The odds for levamisole were significantly lower than the odds for pyrantel pamoate (P = 0.016).

We used data from 34 studies(fig 3) to determine an egg reduction rate of 16.2% (95% confidence interval 5.3% to 27.1%) for placebo, which was significantly lower than the rates for all active treatments (table 1). Albendazole had the highest average rate of 89.6% (81.9% to 97.3%), followed by pyrantel pamoate (71.9%, 54.7% to 89.0%), levamisole (61.8%, 30.3% to 93.3%), and mebendazole (61.0%, 52.0% to 69.9%). The one to one comparison showed a significant difference between albendazole and mebendazole (P < 0.001, fig 2).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^114bSp5i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Ivermectin — mechanistic rationale and empirical use in COVID-19 — is described as an anti-parasitic agent that is FDA-approved for onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis and is used off-label for the treatment of many parasitic infections, and although it has in vitro activity against some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, it has no proven therapeutic utility. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 requires concentrations considerably higher than those achieved in human plasma and lung tissue to reach the in vitro IC50, and ivermectin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in in vitro and in vivo studies hence hypothesized to have a mechanism beyond its anti-viral effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Since ivermectin is generally well tolerated, it was empirically evaluated in uncontrolled studies for COVID-19, alone and in combination with other off-label medications.

### Eosinophilia and potential antibody cross-reactivity between parasites in a child with pinworm and immune dysregulation: a case report [^111CeW91]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intestinal parasitic infections are common in humans, especially among young children. These conditions are often asymptomatic and self-limiting, and diagnosis is mainly based on the search for ova and parasites in the stools since serology may be biased due to cross reactivity between parasites. Pinworm is common in children and is not usually associated with hypereosinophilia; adhesive-tape test is the gold standard testing for the microscopic detection of Enterobious vermicularis (Ev) eggs.

Case presentation

A 13-year-old boy was referred due to a self-resolving episode of vomiting and palpebral oedema after dinner, together with a history of chronic rhinitis, chronic cough, absolute IgA deficiency and Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypereosinophilia (higher value = 3140/µl). On evaluation we detected only palpable thyroid and hypertrophic nasal turbinates. Food allergy was excluded, but skin prick tests showed sensitization to house dust mites and cat epithelium and spirometry showed a marked obstructive pattern with positive bronchodilation test prompting the diagnosis of asthma for which maintenance inhaled treatment was started. Chest x-ray and abdomen ultrasound were negative. Further blood testing showed positive IgG anti-Echinococcus spp. and Strongyloides stercoralis and positive IgE for Ascaris, while Ev were detected both by the adhesive tape test and stool examination, so that we made a final diagnosis of pinworm infection. Three months after adequate treatment with pyrantel pamoate the adhesive-tape test turned out negative and blood testing showed a normal eosinophil count. The child later developed also type 1 diabetes.

Conclusions

We suggest the need to investigate for enterobiasis in children with hypereosinophilia and to consider autoimmunity as a potential confounding factor when interpreting serology for helminths.

### Pinworm control and risk factors of pinworm infection among primary-school children in Taiwan [^111PZ6bF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2001). Low credibility.

Longitudinal pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infection rates were estimated at a mass screening for first-grade children during 1991–1996; children were provided medication at the screening. This campaign was able to decrease the infection rates for the 1991 cohort from 16.3% to 0.6%. A case-control study was further conducted for the investigation of risk factors among fourth-graders. Cases comprised 429 children with at least one infection between September 1996 to June 1999, and controls were 280 randomly selected uninfected classmates. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire survey to report students' personnel hygiene habits. The case-control study revealed that significant factors associated with the infection included playing on the floor (odds ratio [OR], 2.5), nail biting (OR, 2.1), failure to wash hands before meals (OR, 1.7) and living in nonapartment dwellings (OR, 1.6). Girls were at a higher, but not significant, risk (OR, 1.4), than boys. In conclusion, inadequate personal hygiene increases the risk for pinworm infection. The mass screening-medication campaign can be adapted to countries with a similar parasitic problem.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1147T8aq]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Drug efficacy against A lumbricoides

We evaluated 44 studies with an average Jadad score of 2.5 and a total of 7273 participants positive for A lumbricoides (table N in appendix 2 gives detailed numbers) to evaluate the effect of the four anthelmintic drugs against A lumbricoides (fig 1). Pooled estimates were based on 19 studies with only one treatment,22 studies with two treatments, and three studies with three eligible treatments.

The four anthelmintic drugs investigated showed highly significant superiority (all P < 0.001) over placebo (the average cure rate with placebo was 12.7% (95% confidence interval 6.7% to 22.7%; table 1). Estimated average cure rates were 95.7% (93.2% to 97.3%) for albendazole, 96.2% (92.3% to 98.1%) for mebendazole, 97.3% (84.2% to 99.6%) for levamisole, and 92.6% (85.6% to 96.3%) for pyrantel pamoate. There were no significant differences among the four treatments in the one to one comparison (fig 2).

Thirty three studies reported egg reduction rates(fig 3). All treatment arms showed significantly higher rates (P < 0.001) than placebo (20.7%, 95% confidence interval 14.7% to 26.7%; table 1), while there were no significant differences between the rates with the four treatments (fig 2). The highest estimated egg reduction rate (98.5%, 94.9% to 100.0%) was for albendazole, followed by 98.0% (94.0 to 100.0) for mebendazole, 96.4% (82.3 to 100.0) for levamisole, and 94.3% (88.3 to 100.0) for pyrantel pamoate.

Recommendations.

5 We suggest screening for latent tuberculosis infection in patients likely to require prolonged corticosteroids (weak, low).
6 We suggest screening or empiric therapy for S. stercoralis in patients likely to require prolonged corticosteroids (weak, low).
7 We recommend that all patients with NCC undergo a fundoscopic examination before initiation of anthelminthic therapy (strong, moderate).
8 We suggest that the patient with NCC, who has probably acquired NCC in a non-endemic area have their household members be screened for tapeworm carriage (weak, low). Remark: This is a public health issue and can often be addressed by the local health department.

Evidence summary.

Management of NCC often involves the use of corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory therapy. Depending on the anticipated dose and duration of therapy and prior exposures, the patients may be at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including reactivation tuberculosis. Testing for latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is frequently performed in patients with NCC. It is recommended for all patients who will undergo prolonged treatment with corticosteroids. The course of steroids used for many patients with SEL from NCC is often not a clear indication for prophylactic therapy for latent tuberculosis. By contrast, when a month or more of therapy is anticipated, experts believe that patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis and considered for chemoprophylaxis, as would be the case for any subject from endemic areas.

Corticosteroids increase the risk for S. stercoralis hyper infection. S. stercoralis is co-endemic with T. solium in many areas. However, the prevalence is poorly defined in most populations. There is considerable controversy about how best to prevent Strongyloides hyper infection in patients from Strongyloides -endemic areas, who will be treated with steroids. The rates of hyperinfection are low, and most patients with NCC are treated with albendazole along with steroids, which may successfully treat most patients. Strategies for prevention of strongyloidiasis hyperinfection range from testing all patients for larvae in stool, serologic testing in all patients, stool and/or serologic testing only in symptomatic patients, or empiric treatment with ivermectin. Stool studies require specialized testing for Strongyloides such as Baermann's concentration method. Even when performed, the sensitivity is poor even when testing multiple specimens. Serologic tests for antibody are more sensitive but have lower specificity. Because of difficulty in diagnosis, some authorities recommend empiric treatment with ivermectin rather than depending on imperfect testing.

### Eosinophilia and potential antibody cross-reactivity between parasites in a child with pinworm and immune dysregulation: a case report [^1149QaMA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Positivity for specific IgG anti- Echinococcus spp. and Strongyloides stercoralis by ELISA commercial kits and positive IgE for Ascaris were also detected (64.2 KUA/L, normal values up to 0.1), while the search for antibodies against Taenia solium, Toxocara spp. and Trichinella spp. as well as the search for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA were negative. Tropical causes of eosinophilia such as Wuchereria bancrofti infection, were not investigated considering their rarity in our country and the fact that the patient had never travelled abroad. Then, we performed chest x-rays and abdominal ultrasound, which were normal, while in the third sample, stool examination showed positivity for pinworms, which was confirmed by the adhesive-tape test. The boy later revealed that he had suffered for at least 2 years of perianal pruritus. We administered two doses of pyrantel pamoate, separated by 2 weeks, to all household members and, three months later, the adhesive-tape test was repeated and turned out negative. Spirometry showed an improvement of all ventilatory parameters with negative bronchodilator test and FeNO was normal (12 ppb). Blood testing showed a normal eosinophil count (Fig. 1) and persisting positive serology for Strongyloides, while Western blot (Wb) for Echinococcus was negative and IgE levels dropped to 2230 U/mL. Component-resolved diagnostics related to HDM allergy demonstrated sensitization to tropomyosin (Der p 10 IgE > 100 KUA/L). The patient and his parents were relieved by the efficacy of the treatment. Unfortunately, a couple of months later, the boy was admitted due to onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus; blood testing continued to show normal eosinophil count 6 and 12 months later. Notably, symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis as well as thyroid function tests were controlled since the start of levothyroxine treatment and during the entire period of follow up.

Figure
Pin-site myiasis in a 77-year-old man 12 years after tibial osteosynthesis, Colombia. A) Open wound in the man's left leg, showing multiple insect larvae. B, C) Cochliomyia hominivorax screwworm fly larvae extracted from the wound. Arrow 1 indicates the spinose bands; note the spines arranged in 4 rows that separate each segment. Arrow 2 indicates its mouthhooks. Scale bars indicate 2 mm (B) and 1 mm (C).

We removed a total of 100 larvae from the wound and identified them, using published methods, as larvae of Cochliomyia hominivorax, the New World screwworm fly (Figure, panel B); the larvae have well-differentiated mouthhooks and 12 segments separated by spinose bands with spines arranged in 4 rows and an opened posterior spiracle. The identification of the larvae is based primarily on the presence or absence of internal breathing tubes (Figure, panel C). The life cycle of C. hominivorax flies is ≈21 days in warm climates, such as this patient's area of residence, and slightly longer in cooler climates. The adult female mates only once and lays her elongated white eggs along the edges of wounds on warm-blooded animals.

After 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy and daily debridement and irrigation, the wound appeared to be healing without evidence of bacterial or parasitic infection. Monthly follow-up for up to 6 months is expected.

Other authors have previously reported pin-site infestation with maggots; we found a total of 7 cases since 2005 (,–). We did not find reports of a case in which the infestation complicates a chronic nonhealed surgical wound in the pin site 12 years after intervention. This patient had medical comorbidities and poor care of the pin site, as did previously reported case-patients. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the leg revealed poor perfusion, which probably affected the healing of the wound.

This case highlights the role of myiasis as a complication of surgical wounds, especially in pin sites. Appropriate debridement, washing, and antimicrobial treatment for bacteria and ectoparasites should help to prevent evolution of the infection to osteomyelitis and sepsis.

### Parasitic worm therapy for allergy: is this incongruous or avant-garde medicine? [^115iqKuF]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Helminth (worm) therapy has already been used in clinical trials associated with allergy. These were generally small scale, safety orientated trials of short duration, justified by epidemiological and experimental data indicating potentially beneficial immune modulation by some parasites. However, parasites by definition are disadvantageous to their hosts, and helminth infection in particular almost invariably induces an allergic phenotype, rendering this somewhat paradoxical therapeutic approach for allergy open to scrutiny. Is parasitic worm therapy for allergy incongruous medicine, or avant-garde medicine? In the present article, we assess the strength of evidence supporting the use of helminth therapy for allergy and critically appraise the trials already completed. Then, should this approach prove successful, we suggest strategies to improve the delivery of helminth therapy, and ways to discover immune response modifiers derived from worms.

DISCUSSION

Eosinophilic meningitis can be caused by a number of parasites, but most cases worldwide are attributable to A. cantonensis.DNA diagnosis is currently achieved with a species-specific assay based on the ITS1 developed by the CDC. Before the development of ITS1 PCR, retrieval and subsequent morphological identification of nematodes from spinal fluid was the only way to verify that the etiologic agent was indeed A. cantonensis. This finding was both rarely noted and time-consuming. Advancements in DNA diagnosis are an improvement on the classical parasitological diagnosis. However, current PCR assays on CSF are still somewhat hit or miss; ITS1 was found to have an ∼33% failure rate in CSFeven in progressed disease, whereas the recently developed Acan3990 assay based on repeated elements in the A. cantonensis genome was determined to be up to 1,000× more sensitive than the ITS assay.

If anthelminthic treatment is withheld until diagnosis by DNA detection, the result may be life-threatening disease and/or long-term neurological sequelae. Treatment with anthelminthics in the 7- to 21-day window post–symptom onset is positively corroborated by experimental studies – and by epidemiology, and is expressly indicated as prophylaxis when known or suspected exposure to a slug or snail occurs in certain endemic regions. A recent studyhas demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of pyrantel pamoate (OTC pinworm medicine) as a postexposure prophylactic and has been included in the clinical treatment protocols at Hilo Medical Center, Hilo, HI. From rat studies, we know that after ingestion, the parasite moves quickly from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. – In the definitive host, the L3 parasites can reach the peripheral blood by 53 minutes postchallengeand the central nervous system in < 17 hours. L3 exposure by other routes may take even less time if the bloodstream is accessed directly through abraded skin, unabraded skin, and/or mucous membranes.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PYQUVI. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PYQUVI. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including PYQUVI, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PYQUVI use in the presence of such infections unless PYQUVI is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PYQUVI therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PYQUVI withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including PYQUVI, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PYQUVI in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including PYQUVI, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including PYQUVI, in patients with cerebral malaria.

Results

Characteristics of included studies and bias assessment

We identified 301 potential studies of albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate for treating soil transmitted helminth infections (fig 1). From these, we excluded 245: 82 were not randomised, 87 used a different dose regimen, 37 had follow-up longer than six weeks, 23 used only drug combinations, and data were not extractable from 16 (table B in appendix 2). From the 56 remaining studies, one included only egg reduction rates, while 10 did not report egg reduction rates. A total of 44 studies had data on cure rates against A lumbricoides, and 38 presented data on hookworm and T trichiura. For the analysis of egg reduction rates we included 34 studies for hookworm and 33 for A lumbricoides and T trichiura. Studies including treatments consisting of placebo and albendazole and albendazole and mebendazole were most common. The inconsistency plot showed considerable differences between odd ratios of cure from direct and indirect comparisons for some of the drug pairs (fig C in appendix 3), but none of these differences reached significance.

The percentages of studies in the lowest categories for risk of bias were 41.1% for random sequence generation, 30.4% for allocation concealment, and 51.8% for incomplete outcome data. The percentage of studies in the highest category for risk of bias was largest for blinding of participants and personnel (25.6%). The category of unclear risk was largest in all criteria other than "incomplete outcome data". This was especially pronounced among studies published before the year 2000 (table M in appendix 2).

Prediction of time to egg clearance using pre-treatment (pre-T x) enterotypes (ET).

Clearance is defined as two consecutive samples with no eggs (Trichuris trichiura or hookworm) detected and an average egg count between days 14 and 28 equal to zero. A significant hazard ratio above one indicates that the patient is reaching the event (clearance of eggs) at a faster rate. ALB-IVE albendazole and Ivermectin, ALB albendazole, ref. reference category, HR (95% CI) hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), T x treatment.

Associations between success- and failure-associated enterotypes and daily post-treatment eggs per gram of stool counts. Using a survival analysis, we confirm that patients presenting ET3 pre-treatment are more likely to be both, faster and more efficiently cured of a T. trichiura infestation using the albendazole and ivermectin-based treatment than those presenting ET1 and ET2 (P = 0.0002; Fig. 5A, left-half). The same observation applies in the context of hookworm infections (P = 0.009; Fig. 5A, right-half). Overall efficacy of 33.3% against T. trichuris was observed. ET-specific efficacy was 5.8% for patients with ET1, 16.6% for patients with ET2, and 68.8% for patients with ET3. Overall efficacy against hookworm was 47.2%. Patients with ET3 revealed the highest CR of 78.6% at 14-days post-treatment whereas patients with ET1 and ET2 reached only 31.3% and 16.6% cure in this time frame, respectively. Daily egg patterns also largely reflect these findings (Fig. 5B). A sharp decrease of EPG counts is observed immediately following treatment, irrespective of treatment arm or baseline enterotype. For T. trichiura EPG counts, this decrease was more pronounced in the combination therapy arm (−98.2% average EPG at day 5) than the monotherapy arm (−72.9% average EPG at day 5) which correlates with increased efficacy observed for the combination therapy at the recommended follow-up examination (days 14–28). Notably, EPG counts increase after the initial drop for patients with ET1, and to a lesser extent, patients with ET2, for both types of infections. There was no difference when comparing EPG count decrease for hookworms between treatment arms with an average decrease of 99.1% and 99.3% at day 5 for the combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively.

Discussion

Summary of key findings

Albendazole, the most widely used anthelmintic drug against A lumbricoides and hookworm, is highly effective, both in terms of cure rates and egg reduction rates. With about 134 million doses distributed in 2015, mebendazole is the second most widely used drug for infections with soil transmitted helminths. It has high efficacy against A lumbricoides and low activity against hookworm. Levamisole and pyrantel pamoate have high efficacy against A lumbricoides, and pyrantel pamoate has moderate efficacy against hookworm. The weakness of the currently available drugs is their low efficacy against T trichiura, for which mebendazole showed the best performance. This finding emphasises the urgent need for new drugs with higher efficacy against T trichiura for preventive chemotherapy programmes.

Our review provides up to date evidence on the efficacy of the four recommended anthelmintic drugs — albendazole, mebendazole, and the less widely used levamisole and pyrantel pamoate — based on a thorough review of the literature. For the first time a network-meta analysis was applied, and we meta-analysed summary estimates on egg reduction rates, a key parameter for efficacy of anthelmintic drugs.

Strength and limitations

The main strength of our study was the innovative data analysis including the two measures of efficacy of anthelmintic drugs: cure rates and egg reduction rates. By applying a network meta-analysis, we could increase the evidence by including the efficacy results of a higher number of randomised controlled trials than in a previous meta-analysis. Furthermore, the model from Kessels and colleaguesallowed the inclusion of studies with only one eligible treatment arm. To assess consistency of estimates, we compared odd ratios of cure from direct and indirect comparisons of the treatments with a plot (fig C in appendix 3). Although some of the differences were quite large, potentially challenging the validity of the indirect comparisons, none of the differences reached significance.

The reviewed randomised controlled trials cover the past 50 years of research. This inevitably leads to huge qualitative differences among the studies, which reflects the main challenge and limitation of our analyses. There were major disparities among the included studies, which affect drug efficacy — for instance, diagnostic method, infection intensity at baseline, statistical analyses, and sample size.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^117D7cuJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We used the risk ratio (RR) to compare the treatment and control groups for dichotomous outcomes. We presented all treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed‐effect model if there was no moderate or substantial heterogeneity. If there was clinical heterogeneity or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random‐effects model. We planned to summarize continuous data (means and SDs) using mean differences (MDs).

Unit of analysis issues

We did not include cluster‐RCTs. See Data extraction and management for our intended methods should we have found such studies.

Certainty of the evidence

We used the principles of the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence associated with all main outcomes (Schünemann 2011). The GRADE approach appraises the certainty of a body of evidence considering within study risk of bias, the directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables using the GRADEpro software (GRADEpro).

Dealing with missing data

We assessed missing outcomes data and reported the proportion of participants lost to follow‐up for each study. We used the number of available participants at the time point at which the outcome was measured as the denominator.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot for overlapping CIs and outlying data and we used the Chi² test with a P value of 0.1 to indicate statistic significantly heterogeneity, and the I² statistic. We used an I² statistic of 50% to denote moderate heterogeneity and 75% or greater to denote substantial heterogeneity. We intended to investigate possible causes of heterogeneity in subgroup analyses.

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to construct funnel plots to assess publication bias, but did not as there was a limited number of trials in each analysis.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review and meta-analysis is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension statement for network meta-analysis. The study protocol is provided in appendix 1. We conducted an electronic literature search on PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical trials, and the WHO library database. All studies from 1960 until 31 December 2016 were considered. The search was not restricted to any language, and, in case of non-English articles, native speakers were consulted for full text translations. The triple MeSH search terms included "albendazole", "mebendazole", "levamisole", and "pyrantel pamoate" combined with either "trial", "study", or "case report" and " Ascaris lumbricoides ", "ascariasis", "hookworm", " Ancylostoma duodenale ", " Necator americanus ", " Trichuris trichiura ", "trichuriasis", or "soil-transmitted helminths" (table A, appendix 1).

To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be level 1 randomised controlled trials that reported the efficacy against A lumbricoides, hookworm, and T trichiura in terms of cure rates, egg reduction rates, or both. For this review we selected randomised controlled trials that included at least one treatment arm of the currently recommendedsingle dose regimens of albendazole (400 mg), mebendazole (500 mg), levamisole (80 mg or 2.5 mg/kg), or pyrantel pamoate (10 mg/kg). There were no age restrictions. Studies were excluded if they were not randomised controlled trials, used different drug regimens (such as multiple doses or different drug regimens), or combined different drugs or if the follow-up was shorter than one or longer than six weeks.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community. We did not evaluate whether the studies included in the review had any patient involvement.

Follow-Up

The rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for < 2 weeks after treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for > 2 weeks can be attributed to multiple factors. Treatment failure can occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty application of topical scabicides. These medications do not easily penetrate into thick, scaly skin of persons with crusted scabies, perpetuating the harboring of mites in these difficult-to-penetrate layers. In the absence of recommended contact treatment and decontamination of bedding and clothing, persisting symptoms can be attributed to reinfection by family members or fomites. Finally, other household mites can cause symptoms to persist as a result of cross-reactivity between antigens. Even when treatment is successful, reinfection is avoided, and cross-reactivity does not occur, symptoms can persist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis.

Retreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can be considered for those persons who are still symptomatic or when live mites are observed. Use of an alternative regimen is recommended for those persons who do not respond initially to the recommended treatment.

Management of Sex Partners and Household Contacts

Persons who have had sexual, close personal, or household contact with the patient within the month preceding scabies infestation should be examined. Those identified as being infested should be provided treatment.

Management of Outbreaks in Communities, Nursing Homes, and Other Institutional Settings

Scabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing homes, hospitals, residential facilities, and other communities. Control of an epidemic can only be achieved by treating the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be considered in these settings, especially if treatment with topical scabicides fails. Mass treatment with oral ivermectin is highly effective in decreasing prevalence in settings where scabies is endemic. Epidemics should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^115qwQGY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). We summarized continuous outcomes using mean differences with 95% CIs. For some studies we utilized only data from HIV‐positive participants and the trial authors provided the raw data accordingly.

HIV disease progression is associated with a decline in CD4+ cell counts and an increase in viral load. A favourable effect of deworming drugs on CD4+ cell count therefore refers to either a larger increase in CD4+ cell count or a smaller depletion in CD4+ cell count. A suppressive effect on viral load refers to either a reduction in viral load, or a smaller increase in viral load.

Unit of analysis issues

For trials with repeat outcome measurements over time, we utilized and reported the study's final outcome measure reflecting the whole follow‐up time for each individual participant. For studies with 2 x 2 factorial designs in which there were more than one treatment group we chose not to combine experimental intervention groups into a single group and risk loss of information regarding the effects of different antihelminthic treatments. Rather, we chose to present the interventions separately and divide the total number of participants in the control group to account for multiple comparisons in meta‐analyses. The means and standard deviations were left unchanged as recommended in Section 16.5.4 of the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011). This method only partially overcomes the unit‐of‐analysis error (because the resulting comparisons remain correlated). However, an advantage of this approach is that it allows for investigations of heterogeneity across intervention arms.

Dealing with missing data

We contacted trial authors where there were missing or unclear data. We considered missing data resulting from losses to follow‐up to be missing at random unless there were indications otherwise.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed heterogeneity amongst trials by inspecting the forest plots (to detect overlapping CIs) and the I² statistic with a level of 50% to denote moderate levels of heterogeneity, as well as by applying the Chi² test with a P value of 0.10 to indicate statistical significance, as described in Section 9.5.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

Assessment of reporting biases

We could not perform an assessment of the likelihood of reporting bias due to an insufficient number of included trials.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF VIABLE INTRAPARENCHYMAL NCC (VPN)

V. What is the role of antiparasitic drugs in VPN?

Recommendations.

11 In patients with untreated hydrocephalus or diffuse cerebral edema, we recommend management of elevated intracranial pressure alone and not antiparasitic treatment (strong, moderate). Remarks: The management of patients with diffuse cerebral edema should be anti-inflammatory therapy such as corticosteroids, whereas hydrocephalus usually requires a surgical approach.
12 In the absence of elevated intracranial pressure, we recommend the use of antiparasitic drugs in all patients with VPN (strong, moderate).
13 For patients with one to two viable parenchymal cysticerci, we recommend albendazole monotherapy for 10–14 days compared with either no antiparasitic therapy (strong, high) or combination antiparasitic therapy (weak, moderate). Remarks: The usual dose of albendazole is 15 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses for 10–14 days with food. We recommend a maximum dose of 1,200 mg/day.
14 We recommend albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) combined with praziquantel (50 mg/kg/day) for 10–14 days rather than albendazole monotherapy for patients with more than two viable parenchymal cysticerci (strong, moderate).
15 We suggest retreatment with antiparasitic therapy for parenchymal cystic lesions persisting for 6 months after the end of the initial course of therapy (weak, low).

VI. What is the role of anti-inflammatory therapy in management of VPN?

Recommendation.

16 We recommend adjunctive corticosteroid therapy begun before antiparasitic drugs rather than no adjunctive therapy in all patients treated with antiparasitic therapy (strong, moderate).

VII. What is the role of antiepileptic drugs in VPN?

Recommendations.

17 We recommend antiepileptic drugs in all NCC patients with seizures (strong, low).
18 In patients with few seizures before antiparasitic therapy, resolution of the cystic lesion on imaging studies, and no seizures for 24 consecutive months, we suggest that tapering off and stopping antiepileptic drugs be considered (weak, moderate).
19 In the absence of controlled data, the choice of antiepileptic drugs should be guided by local availability, cost, drug interactions, and potential side effects (fact, no grade).

### Efficacy and safety of albendazole in hookworm-infected preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and adults in Côte D'ivoire: a phase 2 randomized, controlled dose-finding trial [^1114HT6p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Though PC with benzimidazoles has been successfully used as a cornerstone of control programs, efficacy against hookworm remains moderate (cure rates [CRs] of 79.5% for 400 mg albendazole and 32.5% for 500 mg of mebendazole). Several studies have shown that multiple doses of albendazole over an increased number of days have higher efficacy; however, this strategy could prove difficult during mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. A single dose that is greater than 400 mg may be more efficacious and effective at curing hookworm infection, though an optimal dose has not been identified, and limited evidence on the efficacy and safety for PSAC and adults is available. The novel aim of this trial is to characterize the dose-response relationship for the efficacy and safety of albendazole against hookworm in PSAC, SAC, and adults.

### Albendazole: a broad spectrum anthelminthic for treatment of individuals and populations [^114HQwPJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is over 25 years ago since the original animal research was conducted into albendazole. This review highlights some important steps in fundamental research and the management of helminth disease that have occurred in the past year, appearing in the published literature.

Recent Findings

In recent years there have been several published studies on lymphatic filariasis and on the impact of albendazole treatment on growth and nutrition. Recent work consolidates some of these data and supplies substantive evidence of benefit especially in the area of hookworm anaemia. Why treatment of helminths actually produces these effects has not been understood, but investigations have begun to highlight the underlying mechanisms that relate to immunity. During the last year several reviews of diagnosis and management of helminth diseases have been published which provide much needed guidance on the effective use of albendazole, and its place in treatment overall. In common with many other parasitic diseases, the validity of using single agents is being challenged, and combination therapy is being investigated at the experimental level and in clinical practice to improve therapeutic responses and to reduce the risk of resistance to the limited range of drugs currently available.

Summary

Albendazole has changed from being a drug for individuals with worms to one to treat communities and provide benefit in public health terms. In systemic parasitic disease, however, albendazole remains a treatment for individuals. Nearly 20 years of research and of clinical use has refined the tool, but new investigations suggest that much additional study is required before we fully understand helminth parasites and the benefits of treating them.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UqE1f]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The efficacy of albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate has been assessed in a systematic review for different dose regimensand by means of meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials for single doses. Albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate had high efficacy against A lumbricoides in terms of cure rates. Only albendazole was found to be efficacious in single dose regimen against hookworm (cure rate 72%). Both albendazole and mebendazole had unsatisfactory results against T trichiura at single doses with cure rates of 28% and 36%, respectively. Of concern, recent results from randomised trials on Pemba Island (Tanzania) showed even lower cure rates for albendazole (2.6%) and mebendazole (11.8%) against T trichiura.

We updated the findings from the two systematic reviews, including new evidence and applying network meta-analysis methods. The comparison of intervention effects among randomised controlled trials with conventional meta-analysis is limited by the constraint that only drugs tested in the same study can be compared. In contrast, network meta-analysis draws strength from direct and indirect comparisons through common comparators (such as placebo). Furthermore, multiple drugs can be compared and ranked. In addition, for the first time we meta-analysed egg reduction rates, the standard key parameter for drug efficacy. Our analysis provides current evidence on anthelmintic drug efficacy, which is of considerable relevance to policy makers as they call for an adaptation of current treatment guidelines.

A single trial compared treatment with albendazole alone to albendazole combined with praziquantel. There were trends toward more rapid resolution and fewer residual calcifications in the combination arm, but the results were not statistically significant.

The duration of albendazole therapy for SEL in different studies has ranged from 3 to 30 days. In comparative studies, no significant differences were demonstrated comparing 7 and 28 days, 7 and 14 days, or 2 and 15 days (although there was a trend toward a better response in the latter). Based on that data, our panel suggests that therapy should be administered for 7–14 days.

XII. What is the role of anti-inflammatory therapy in SEL?

Recommendation.

26 We recommend that patients with SEL treated with antiparasitic drugs should also be treated with corticosteroids initiated before antiparasitic therapy (strong, moderate).

Evidence summary.

In the meta-analysis of Otte et al.randomized studies of corticosteroids alone (i.e. not concomitantly with antihelminthic drugs) in patients with SEL did not demonstrate a significant impact on lesion resolution, seizure recurrence, or development of calcifications. However, that analysis misinterpreted data from one study. The group assignments were different in the abstract (suggesting worse with steroids) than in the body of the article and conclusions (steroids were better). If that study was analyzed correctly, the results would have been statistically significant. A subsequent meta-analysis using network analysis noted that the combination of albendazole plus corticosteroids had the optimal effect on lesion resolution and recurrent seizures.

XIII. How should patients with SEL be followed?

Recommendation.

27 We suggest that MRI be repeated at least every 6 months until resolution of cystic lesions for patients with SEL (weak, low).

Evidence summary.

There are limited data on optimal follow-up of patients with SEL due to NCC. Most controlled trials have followed the patients at 3–6 months after therapy. Data suggest that imaging studies often normalize and antiepileptic drugs can often be discontinued after 6 months of therapy. Based on this, follow-up at 6 months appears to be important.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^116hyx5T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If an Orapred ODT-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
If an Orapred ODT-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including Orapred ODT. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with Orapred ODT. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including Orapred ODT, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid Orapred ODT use in the presence of such infections unless Orapred ODT is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic Orapred ODT therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, Orapred ODT withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including Orapred ODT, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating Orapred ODT in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including Orapred ODT, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including Orapred ODT, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### Review of the WHO guideline on preventive chemotherapy for public health control of strongyloidiasis [^115RJxbk]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Strongyloidiasis is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis that is estimated to affect 300–600 million people across Asia, Africa, South and central America, and the Pacific. This neglected parasitic disease is most known for its ability to persist as a lifelong infection due to autoinfection and its risk of hyperinfection and disseminated disease during immunosuppression, which has a more than 60% case fatality. Despite the large global burden of strongyloidiasis, there have been no large-scale public health programmes or WHO guidelines directed towards its control and elimination. However, over the past decade, key scientific and policy changes along with requests from endemic countries have led to WHO incorporating strongyloidiasis into its 2021–30 roadmap and public health targets for control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases. In 2024, WHO published its first guideline on public health control of strongyloidiasis with a single recommendation: in endemic settings with a Strongyloides stercoralis infection prevalence of 5% or higher (measured either with Baermann or agar plate culture from stool specimens), WHO conditionally recommends mass drug administration with single-dose ivermectin (200 μg/kg; oral therapy) in all age groups from 5 years and older to reduce strongyloidiasis. This Review, written by the 2023–24 strongyloidiasis guidelines development group along with WHO colleagues and international experts, presents a summary of the recently published WHO guideline recommendation for strongyloidiasis, and the supporting evidence, considerations for public health implementation, and future research needs.

### Public health deworming programmes for soil-transmitted helminths in children living in endemic areas [^116zMaSK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

Conducting field trials to test this intervention is complex and challenging, and researchers have worked hard to generate this body of research evidence. There is now a reasonable amount of evidence from trials in a range of settings, including high‐, moderate‐, and low‐burden areas. There have also been 18 trials that have assessed the effects of multiple doses of deworming (Analysis 2.1), six of which were cluster‐RCTs. These are particularly important because they can detect the 'real life' community level effects of treatment that include possible effects from a reduction in worm transmission (Bundy 2009).

The certainty of the evidence tends to be moderate to low for most outcomes related to risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency and indirectness. The certainty is lower for the nutrition outcomes‐mainly because the large effects seen in the three older studies that showed larger effects, and with the other studies showing smaller or no effects. This reduces the certainty of the evidence.

We maintained the meta‐analysis across studies spanning 30 years and downgraded the certainty for heterogeneity and indirectness, as we just do not know whether these older studies reflect current effects with primary health care and lower worm endemicities.

Potential biases in the review process

Statistical errors in analysis

Of the 10 cluster‐RCTs, three did not take adequate account of cluster randomizations (Alderman 2006 (Cluster); Hall 2006 (Cluster); Rousham 1994 (Cluster)). This has the potential substantive impact on the interpretation of the trials. For example, the significant difference between intervention and control quoted on the cover of the BMJ for Alderman 2006 (Cluster) assumed 27,995 children had been individually randomized. When we clarified this with the trial authors, they provided the BMJ with a correction, which showed that no significant difference was detected in weight gain between intervention and control groups; this corrected result has been used in the meta‐analysis in this trial.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^116JfQ26]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (ARM and PB) independently extracted data from the included trials using standardized data extraction forms for randomized trials, as detailed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

We extracted the following characteristics from each included trial.

Administrative details: identification; author(s); published or unpublished; year of publication; year in which study was conducted; funding source.
Details of study: study design; randomization method; duration; completeness of follow‐up; country and location of the study; setting (for example, urban or rural, hospital or clinic); method(s) of recruitment; number of participants by trial arm.
Characteristics of participants: age; gender; socioeconomic status; HIV clinical staging (if available); antiretroviral (ART) status.
Details of intervention: medication; dose; duration; number of treatments; control group.
Details of outcomes: primary outcome; unit of measurement; change in viral load; change in CD4+ count; change in rate of clinical HIV disease progression (changes in the WHO or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staging); nutritional indicators; adverse events; mortality.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (ARM and PB) independently evaluated the methodological quality of included clinical trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps were taken to reduce the risk of bias across five domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; and incomplete outcome data.

For sequence generation and allocation concealment, we reported the methods used. For blinding, we described who was blinded and the blinding method. For incomplete outcome data, we reported the percentage and proportion of participants lost to follow‐up. We categorized our 'Risk of bias' judgements as either 'low', 'high', or 'unclear'. Where risk of bias was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification and resolved any differences of opinion through discussion.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1122WwHH]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Drug efficacy against T trichiura

We used data from 38 studies (average Jadad score of 2.6), including 8841 participants positive for T trichiura (table 1; table N in appendix 2) for analysis of cure rates of the four drugs against T trichiura. Pooled estimates were based on 16 trials with one treatment,19 studies including two treatments, and three studies with three treatments.

The cure rate was 8.6% (95% confidence interval 4.1% to 17.1%) with placebo, which was not significantly different from the rates with levamisole (29.5%, 6.1% to 72.9%) and pyrantel pamoate (20.2%, 7.3% to 44.7%; table 1). Albendazole and mebendazole showed significantly higher efficacy than placebo, with estimated cure rates of 30.7% (21.0% to 42.5%; P < 0.001) and 42.1% (25.9% to 60.2%; P < 0.001), respectively. We found no significant differences among the rates of the four treatments comparing them one to one (fig 2).

We used 33 studies for analysis of the egg reduction rates(fig 3). The average rate was 19.2% (95% confidence interval 6.9% to 31.4%) for placebo, which was significantly lower than the rates for albendazole (P < 0.002), mebendazole (P < 0.001), and pyrantel pamoate (P = 0.008) but comparable with the rate for levamisole (28.3%, 6.7% to 49.8%; table 1). The highest rate of 66.0% (54.6% to 77.3%) was estimated for mebendazole, which was significantly higher than the rate for albendazole (49.9%, 39.0% to 60.6%; P < 0.001) and levamisole in the one to one comparison (fig 2). For pyrantel pamoate the rate was 47.5% (25.5% to 69.6%).

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112CQeh7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

To deal with potential publication bias, we compared results of smaller and larger studies in an interaction analysis. We might have slightly overestimated the effect of albendazole against hookworm, where the cure rate showed an almost significant negative association with study size (P = 0.053). While the cure rates of A lumbricoides showed positive or stable associations with study size for all treatments, the rates of T trichiura after treatment with albendazole and mebendazole slightly decreased with increasing study size, yet not significantly. Thus, we did not find consistent evidence of publication bias (table J in appendix 2). The small number of available and eligible studies for levamisole is another limitation of our work. Consequently, all estimates relating to levamisole (cure rates, egg reduction rates, and odd ratios) have wide confidence intervals. Nonetheless, we present the first pooled estimates of efficacy for levamisole against hookworm, showing a low average cure rate (10.3%, with an upper 95% confidence limit of 35.2%), which conflicts with the fact that the drug is recommended for the treatment.

Clinical implications

Efficacy of anthelmintic drugs is defined by cure rates and egg reduction rates. As both parameters have to be taken into consideration in comparisons of the efficacy of the drugs for each helminth species, the comparison was done qualitatively. Against A lumbricoides we found no significant differences, and all drugs had high efficacy. Albendazole had the highest efficacy for treating hookworm infections with significantly higher cure rates, followed by pyrantel pamoate, and lowest efficacy for levamisole and mebendazole when used at single oral doses. With regard to T trichiura infections, mebendazole had the highest, yet only moderate, efficacy, with significantly higher egg reduction rates than albendazole. The cure rates of levamisole and pyrantel pamoate did not differ from placebo.

### Evidence-based guidelines for screening and management of strongyloidiasis in non-endemic countries [^1171urut]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal parasitic infection becoming increasingly important outside endemic areas, not only because of the high prevalence found in migrant populations, but also because immunosuppressed patients may suffer a potentially fatal disseminated disease. The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidance for screening and treatment of strongyloidiasis in non-endemic areas. A panel of experts focused on three main clinical questions (who should be screened and how, how to treat), and reviewed pertinent literature available in international databases of medical literature and in documents released by relevant organizations/societies. A consensus of the experts' opinion was sought when specific issues were not covered by evidence. In particular, six systematic reviews were retrieved and constituted the main support for this work. The evidence and consensus gathered led to recommendations addressing various aspects of the main questions. Grading of evidence and strength of recommendation were attributed to assess the quality of supporting evidence. The screening of individuals at risk of the infection should be performed before they develop any clinical complication. Moreover, in immunosuppressed patients, the screening should be mandatory. The screening is based on a simple and widely accessible technology and there is now a universally accepted treatment with a high efficacy rate. Therefore, the screening could be implemented as part of a screening program for migrants although further cost-effectiveness studies are required to better evaluate this strategy from a public health point of view.

### Safety of hookworm infection in individuals with measurable airway responsiveness: a randomized placebo-controlled feasibility study [^113kN7DK]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Assessment of subject blinding

All participants were asked at their final study visit, before being unblinded, if they thought they knew whether they had received hookworm or placebo infection. Of the 14 individuals in the placebo group who completed the study, three correctly thought they had received placebo, five that they had received hookworm, and six did not know. Of the 13 with hookworm infection who completed the study, eight correctly thought that they had received hookworm, two thought they had received placebo, and three did not know.

Follow-up

All participants who received hookworm were provided with mebendazole at the end of the study to eradicate the infection. However, 11 of the 13 participants who completed the study chose not to take the treatment, citing either a perceived improvement in hayfever symptoms, or that they wished to see if they had a change in symptoms the following year. In accordance with our protocol, participants in the placebo group were offered hookworm infection at the end of the trial, of whom 11 chose to be infected.

### Deflazacort oral (deflazacort oral suspension) [^116LCNvF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If a deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

If a deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with deflazacort oral suspension. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid deflazacort oral suspension use in the presence of such infections unless deflazacort oral suspension is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic deflazacort oral suspension therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, deflazacort oral suspension withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating deflazacort oral suspension in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including deflazacort oral suspension, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^112vYuch]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ascaris lumbricoides is a common infection, and mainly affects children living in low‐income areas. Water and sanitation improvement, health education, and drug treatment may help break the cycle of transmission, and effective drugs will reduce morbidity.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, ivermectin) for treating people with Ascaris infection.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, three other databases, and reference lists of included studies, without language restrictions, up to 4 July 2019.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin in children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included trials. A third review author checked the quality of data extraction. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare dichotomous outcomes in treatment and control groups. We used the fixed‐effect model for studies with low heterogeneity and the random‐effects model for studies with moderate to high heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative cure rates in the comparison groups.

Main results

We included 30 parallel‐group RCTs, which enrolled 6442 participants from 17 countries across Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America. Participants were from 28 days to 82 years of age, recruited from school, communities, and health facilities. Twenty studies were funded or co‐funded by manufacturers, while 10 studies were independent of manufacturer funding. Twenty‐two trials had a high risk of bias for one or two domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting).

Single dose of albendazole (four trials), mebendazole (three trials) or ivermectin (one trial) was compared to placebo. Parasitological cure at 14 to 60 days was high in all the studies (illustrative cure of 93.0% in the anthelmintic group and 16.1% in the placebo group; RR 6.29, 95% CI 3.91 to 10.12; 8 trials, 1578 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Single dose of albendazole is as effective as multiple doses of albendazole (illustrative cure of 93.2% with single dose, 94.3% with multiple doses; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; 3 trials, 307 participants; high‐certainty evidence); or as single dose of mebendazole (illustrative cure of 98.0% with albendazole, 96.9% with mebendazole; RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; 6 trials, 2131 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Studies did not detect a difference between a single dose of albendazole and a single dose of ivermectin (cure rates of 87.8% with albendazole, 90.2% with ivermectin; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 3 trials, 519 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Across all the studies, failure after single dose of albendazole ranged from 0.0% to 30.3%, mebendazole from 0.0% to 22.2%, and ivermectin from 0.0% to 21.6%.

The egg reduction rate (ERR) measured up to 60 days after the treatment was high in all treated groups, regardless of the anthelmintic used (range 96% to 100%). It was not possible to evaluate parasitological cure by classes of infection intensity.

No included trials reported complication or serious adverse events. Other adverse events were apparently similar among the compared anthelmintic groups (moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence). The most commonly reported other adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache, and fever.

Authors' conclusions

Single‐dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin all appeared effective against Ascaris lumbricoides infection, yielding high parasitological cure and large reductions in eggs excreted, with no differences detected between them. The drugs appear to be safe to treat children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. There is little to choose between drugs and regimens in terms of cure or adverse events.

### Deflazacort (Emflaza) [^11415x3M]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If an EMFLAZA-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
If an EMFLAZA-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated.

Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.

Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with EMFLAZA. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.

Fungal Infections

Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid EMFLAZA use in the presence of such infections unless EMFLAZA is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic EMFLAZA therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, EMFLAZA withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended.

Amebiasis

Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating EMFLAZA in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.

Strongyloides Infestation

Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Cerebral Malaria

Avoid corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, in patients with cerebral malaria.

Albendazole-based therapy — adverse effects and monitoring: Hepatic or hematologic toxicity during prolonged therapy "only requires discontinuation in < 1% of cases", and "Reversible alopecia may also occur in up to 10% of cases", with most patients tolerating continuous therapy. Dose intensification has been reported: "Higher doses (30 mg/kg/day) have been used… but there are limited data on safety", and "Few adverse events were noted with duration of up to 4 weeks". For safety monitoring, "patients who will receive albendazole or albendazole plus praziquantel for > 14 days should be monitored with complete blood counts and liver enzymes during the first month", and while "The optimal frequency of monitoring is unknown", the panel felt that "monitoring laboratory test weekly is adequate". During prolonged courses, "liver enzymes should continue to be monitored with the frequency based on clinical indications and tolerance". If toxicity occurs, "In the presence of absolute neutropenia or elevation of transaminase > 5 times the upper limits of normal, albendazole should be withheld until laboratory tests normalize and alternative approaches considered (eg, praziquantel or no anthelmintics)".

### Hookworm infection [^114t68pA]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Hookworms are soil-transmitted nematode parasites that can reside for many years in the small intestine of their human hosts; Necator americanus is the predominant infecting species. Adult worms feed on the blood of a host and can cause iron deficiency anaemia, especially in high-risk populations (children and women of childbearing age). Almost 500 million people in developing tropical countries are infected, and simulation models estimate that hookworm infection is responsible for > 4 million disability-adjusted life years lost annually. Humans mount an immune response to hookworms, but it is mostly unsuccessful at removing adult worms from the bowel. Accordingly, the host switches to an immune-tolerant state that enables hookworms to reside in the gut for many years. Although anthelmintic drugs are available and widely used, their efficacy varies and the drugs do not prevent reinfection. Thus, other control strategies aimed at improving water quality, sanitation and hygiene are needed. In addition, efforts are underway to develop a human hookworm vaccine through public-private partnerships. However, hookworms could also be a resource; as hookworms have the capability to regulate the host's inflammation, researchers are experimentally infecting patients to treat some inflammatory diseases as an approach to discover new anti-inflammatory molecules. This area of endeavour might well yield new biotherapeutics for autoimmune and allergic diseases.

### Patients with delusional infestation (delusional parasitosis) often require prolonged treatment as recurrence of symptoms after cessation of treatment is common: an observational study [^113oBtv4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Delusional infestation (DI) is an uncommon psychiatric disorder in which patients present with the false and fixed belief of infestation. Numerous studies have demonstrated improvement with pharmacological treatment; however, recurrence rates on cessation of treatment remain unknown.

Objectives

To assess the clinical response and recurrence rates following treatment for DI.

Methods

All patients with DI seen in our combined dermatology/psychiatry clinic to date (n = 73) were offered pharmacological therapy. Patients were contacted to complete a telephone questionnaire to assess clinical outcomes, including remission and recurrence rates following treatment.

Results

Fifty-nine of 73 (81%) patients with DI received treatment, of whom 40/59 (68%) reported improvement or resolution of symptoms, and the remaining 19/59 (32%) failed to respond. Fifteen of 40 patients with DI completed a course of treatment, 12/40 patients are still undergoing treatment, and outcomes are unknown for 13/40. Of those who completed treatment, 11/15 (73%) reported total remission for at least 9months after discontinuing treatment (range 9months-2.5years). Recurrence of symptoms occurred in 4/15 (27%) within 4months of stopping treatment.

Conclusions

Pharmacological treatment of DI can be effective, particularly in a combined dermatology/psychiatry clinic. Most treated patients have a good prognosis, and a remission period can be expected. However, more than 25% of patients may relapse on stopping treatment, with the greatest risk being within the first few months of discontinuation. These patients may require longer treatment courses, or long-term maintenance therapy for symptom control, although further studies are needed to provide recommended guidelines on drug and dosing regimen.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^115X3VTY]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

Preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay of helminthiases control, since it remains among the most cost-effective global public health control measures. Albendazole and mebendazole, which are variably efficacious against the different soil-transmitted helminths, are the most widely used drugs. We were interested in learning whether treatment efficacy could be improved by an adapted treatment regimen in a setting such as Pemba Island which, even though community members have been receiving treatment once or twice a year for 25 years, is still characterised by intense helminth transmission and persisting high prevalence rates. Using a double-blind trial design we evaluated the multiple dose (3 day, 6 dose course) treatment of mebendazole, which is recommended globally and in Tanzania for individual treatment, versus the single dose regimen widely used for population-based treatment.

We found clear evidence that the multiple, six-dose treatment schedule of mebendazole is significantly more effective at curing hookworm infections than a single dose of mebendazole. In our trial, only 13% of children were cured after a 500 mg single dose of mebendazole. On the other hand, the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole cured almost all hookworm-infected children (CR = 98%) which is in agreement with exploratory studies in the early 1970s. To our knowledge, only four RCTs, conducted in Iran, Thailand, Brazil and Papua New Guinea, assessed the effect of the multiple dose mebendazole on hookworm infections. In these studies, CRs ranged from 35 to 94%. Although these studies reported different baseline infection intensities, there seems to be no correlation between the intensity of infection and CRs.

### Clinical overview of pinworm infection… [^114DeRzc]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Mebendazole and albendazole are available for prescription to treat pinworm.
- Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription.
- Consider safety precautions of medications in different populations. Prevention In addition to treatment, strict adherence to proper hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent pinworm infection and spread. Advise household members and other contacts to also follow good hygiene practices, including recommendations for bathing and laundering of clothing and bedding. Control can be difficult in childcare centers, schools, and other facilities because the rate of repeat infections is high. In facilities or institutions, mass and simultaneous treatment, repeated in two weeks, can be effective. Treatment and recovery The medications used for the treatment of pinworm are either mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, or albendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription.

Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs. Health practitioners and parents should weigh the health risks and benefits of these drugs for patients under two years of age. Drug Dosage and duration Notes Mebendazole Adults and children: 100 mg orally; repeat in two weeks Pyrantel pamoate Adults and children: 11 mg/kg orally; repeat in two weeks Available in oral suspension, capsules, or chewable tablets. Albendazole Adults and children: 400 mg orally once; repeat in two weeks Take on an empty stomach. Oral mebendazole, oral pyrantel pamoate, and oral albendazole are all available for human use in the United States. The safety of drugs used to treat pinworm have not been studied for. pregnant women.

If the pinworm infection is compromising the pregnancy then treatment can be considered, but it should be withheld until the 3rd trimester when the risk, if any, to the fetus is likely to be reduced. Breastfeeding should not be withheld during mebendazole therapy. Only about 2% – 10% of an oral dose is absorbed, and the amounts of the drug excreted in milk are below the level of detection and appear to be clinically insignificant. Excretion in breast milk of the other drugs used to treat pinworm is not as well characterized. Care precautions Mebendazole Treatment in Pregnancy Mebendazole is a pregnancy category C drug. Data on the use of mebendazole in pregnant women are limited. The available evidence suggests no difference in congenital anomalies in the children of women treated with mebendazole during mass drug administration campaigns compared with those who were not.

In MDA campaigns in countries where soil-transmitted helminths are common, World Health Organization has determined that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks and WHO allows use of mebendazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. However, in a pregnant woman infected with a soil-transmitted helminth, balance the risks of treatment for the fetus with the risks of disease progression in the woman in the absence of treatment. Pregnancy Category C: Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus plus there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. Prescribe mebendazole only if the potential benefits to the woman justify the potential risks to the fetus. Treatment during lactation Mebendazole is minimally excreted in breast milk. WHO classifies mebendazole as compatible with breastfeeding and allows its use in lactating women.

### Clinical overview of pinworm infection… [^115yWceX]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Mebendazole and albendazole are available for prescription to treat pinworm.
- Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription.
- Consider safety precautions of medications in different populations. Prevention In addition to treatment, strict adherence to proper hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent pinworm infection and spread. Advise household members and other contacts to also follow good hygiene practices, including recommendations for bathing and laundering of clothing and bedding. Control can be difficult in childcare centers, schools, and other facilities because the rate of repeat infections is high. In facilities or institutions, mass and simultaneous treatment, repeated in two weeks, can be effective. Treatment and recovery The medications used for the treatment of pinworm are either mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, or albendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available without prescription.

Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs. Health practitioners and parents should weigh the health risks and benefits of these drugs for patients under two years of age. Drug Dosage and duration Notes Mebendazole Adults and children: 100 mg orally; repeat in two weeks Pyrantel pamoate Adults and children: 11 mg/kg orally; repeat in two weeks Available in oral suspension, capsules, or chewable tablets. Albendazole Adults and children: 400 mg orally once; repeat in two weeks Take on an empty stomach. Oral mebendazole, oral pyrantel pamoate, and oral albendazole are all available for human use in the United States. The safety of drugs used to treat pinworm have not been studied for. pregnant women.

If the pinworm infection is compromising the pregnancy then treatment can be considered, but it should be withheld until the 3rd trimester when the risk, if any, to the fetus is likely to be reduced. Breastfeeding should not be withheld during mebendazole therapy. Only about 2% – 10% of an oral dose is absorbed, and the amounts of the drug excreted in milk are below the level of detection and appear to be clinically insignificant. Excretion in breast milk of the other drugs used to treat pinworm is not as well characterized. Care precautions Mebendazole Treatment in Pregnancy Mebendazole is a pregnancy category C drug. Data on the use of mebendazole in pregnant women are limited. The available evidence suggests no difference in congenital anomalies in the children of women treated with mebendazole during mass drug administration campaigns compared with those who were not.
