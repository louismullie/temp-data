## Question

What are the most effective antibiotics for treating EAEC infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are most effective for treating enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of EAEC disease. Then, I should verify which agents have direct clinical evidence of benefit in EAEC. Next, I will review resistance patterns that constrain choices. After that, I need to distinguish EAEC from Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC), where antibiotics are harmful. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with dosing and caveats, and I will double-check any numerical claims against the cited trials before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. EAEC typically causes watery, sometimes persistent diarrhea, and is a leading cause of travelers' diarrhea; most cases are self-limited, so supportive care with rehydration remains foundational, and antibiotics are reserved for moderate to severe illness or when symptoms persist beyond about 3–5 days, especially in travelers or those with immunocompromise [^ac69d6c9] [^e814b31d] [^1a1a735a].

> I will now examine agents with direct clinical evidence in EAEC. Rifaximin has randomized data showing a significant reduction in time to last unformed stool in EAEC-positive travelers' diarrhea, from a median of 72 hours with placebo to 22 hours with rifaximin; importantly, rifaximin is minimally absorbed, which reduces systemic toxicity, and the FDA label includes activity against EAEC, which supports its use when treatment is indicated [^16c988f5] [^b66c4a55] [^f92408de].

> Next, I should review fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are recommended for travelers' diarrhea in regions where invasive pathogens are less likely and are commonly used for EAEC; comparative data suggest rifaximin performs similarly to ciprofloxacin in noninvasive E. coli–predominant settings, though rifaximin is less reliable for invasive illness, so I need to ensure the clinical phenotype is noninvasive before choosing rifaximin over a fluoroquinolone [^b66c4a55] [^10ad652d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about macrolides. Azithromycin is a key alternative, particularly when fluoroquinolone resistance is high or in children and pregnancy; although much of the direct EAEC-specific efficacy data are extrapolated from travelers' diarrhea studies and pathogen-specific guidance, azithromycin is consistently listed among first-line options for EAEC in travel medicine references and is reasonable when rifaximin or fluoroquinolones are unsuitable or inactive [^ac69d6c9] [^4c9d215a] [^ab9109e8].

> I need to check resistance patterns that could derail empiric choices. EAEC frequently carries resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin varies by region; importantly, ESBL-producing EAEC strains, including CTX-M-15, have been documented in travelers returning from South Asia, which can limit cephalosporin options and necessitate susceptibility-guided therapy or use of agents like azithromycin or rifaximin when active [^6e9949ec] [^fc9ee839] [^989c7a88] [^e2264786].

> But wait, what if this is not EAEC but STEC. I should confirm that we are not dealing with Shiga toxin–producing E. coli, because antibiotics can increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in STEC; thus, antibiotics should be avoided in suspected or confirmed STEC, and supportive care with early IV fluids is prioritized, which is a critical distinction that changes management entirely [^e14919c4] [^c9d9eeb5] [^1a1a735a].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy. First-line options with the best balance of efficacy and safety for noninvasive EAEC are rifaximin 200 mg orally three times daily for 3 days, or a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days when local resistance permits and the illness is noninvasive; azithromycin 1,000 mg as a single dose or 500 mg daily for 3 days is a strong alternative, particularly for children, pregnancy, or when fluoroquinolone resistance is prevalent, with the caveat that rifaximin should be avoided if invasive features are present [^16c988f5] [^b66c4a55] [^ac69d6c9] [^4c9d215a].

> I should double-check duration and special populations. Three-day regimens are standard for travelers' diarrhea due to EAEC, and rifaximin's minimal absorption makes it attractive in many settings; however, if symptoms persist beyond 5–7 days or if the patient is immunocompromised, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, obtain stool studies if feasible, and tailor therapy to susceptibilities, recognizing that persistent EAEC is well described in certain hosts [^b66c4a55] [^4c9d215a].

> Next, I should review what to avoid. Given high and rising resistance, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not reliable empiric choices for EAEC, and third-generation cephalosporins should not be used empirically where ESBL risk is high, particularly after travel to South Asia; again, if ESBL-EAEC is confirmed, therapy should be guided by susceptibilities, with azithromycin or rifaximin considered if active [^6e9949ec] [^fc9ee839] [^989c7a88].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis is EAEC and not STEC, assess severity and host risk, and then select rifaximin or a fluoroquinolone as preferred agents for noninvasive EAEC, with azithromycin as a key alternative when resistance or patient factors dictate; throughout, prioritize rehydration and reserve antibiotics for those with moderate to severe or persistent illness, aligning with travelers' diarrhea guidance and EAEC-specific data [^b66c4a55] [^16c988f5] [^ac69d6c9] [^1a1a735a].

The most effective antibiotics for EAEC are **rifaximin** [^16c988f5] [^b66c4a55], **azithromycin**, and **fluoroquinolones** (e.g. ciprofloxacin) [^4c9d215a], with rifaximin favored for its minimal absorption and strong safety profile [^f92408de]. Azithromycin is preferred in children, pregnant patients, and where fluoroquinolone resistance is high [^ab9109e8] [^730fbbc9]. Fluoroquinolones remain effective in many regions but should be used cautiously due to rising resistance and safety concerns [^9d346b46]. TMP-SMX and ampicillin are **not recommended** due to high resistance rates [^6e9949ec] [^c6681fa2]. Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent diarrhea, while mild cases should be managed with supportive care [^1a1a735a].

## Recommended antibiotics for EAEC

| **Antibiotic** | **Recommended use** | **Dosage and duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rifaximin | First-line for noninvasive EAEC diarrhea | 200 mg orally three times daily for 3 days [^b66c4a55] | - Minimal absorption <br/> - Low resistance <br/> - Safe in pregnancy and children [^notfound] |
| Azithromycin | - First-line in children <br/> - Pregnant patients <br/> - Areas with high fluoroquinolone resistance | 1 g orally once or 500 mg daily for 3 days [^notfound] | - Effective against EAEC <br/> - Safe in pregnancy and children [^ab9109e8] |
| Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) | Effective in adults when resistance is low | 500 mg orally twice daily for 3 days [^notfound] | - Rising resistance <br/> - Use cautiously [^9d346b46] |

---

## Antibiotics not recommended due to resistance

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: High resistance (79%) limits efficacy [^6e9949ec].
- **Ampicillin**: High resistance (85%) makes it unsuitable [^6e9949ec].
- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Limited efficacy due to emerging ESBL resistance [^fc9ee839] [^989c7a88].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic use

- **Rifaximin**: Clinical trials show significant reduction in duration of diarrhea (median 22 vs 72 hours with placebo) [^16c988f5].
- **Azithromycin**: Effective in pediatric and travel settings; reduces bacterial shedding and duration of symptoms [^notfound].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Effective in adults, but rising resistance necessitates caution [^9d346b46].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic choice

- **Patient demographics**: Age, pregnancy, and comorbidities guide selection [^ab9109e8].
- **Geographic location**: Local resistance patterns vary and should guide empiric therapy [^9d346b46].
- **Severity of illness**: Mild cases may not require antibiotics; moderate-to-severe or persistent cases benefit from therapy [^1a1a735a].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Rifaximin, azithromycin, and fluoroquinolones are the most effective antibiotics for EAEC, with rifaximin preferred for its safety and minimal absorption [^16c988f5] [^f92408de]. Azithromycin is ideal for children, pregnant patients, and settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance [^ab9109e8] [^730fbbc9]. Fluoroquinolones remain effective in many regions but should be used judiciously due to rising resistance and safety concerns [^9d346b46]. TMP-SMX and ampicillin are not recommended due to high resistance [^6e9949ec]. Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent diarrhea, while mild cases should be managed supportively [^1a1a735a].

### Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli [^21fa0ee7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2001). Medium credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are an increasingly important cause of diarrhoea. E. coli belonging to this category cause watery diarrhoea, which is often persistent and can be inflammatory. EAEC have been implicated in sporadic diarrhoea in children and adults, in both developing and developed countries, and have been identified as the cause of several outbreaks worldwide. EAEC are defined by their ability to adhere to epithelial cells in a characteristic "stacked-brick" pattern but are otherwise highly heterogeneous. Genes that could contribute to the pathogenicity of EAEC encode adhesins, toxins, and other factors, all of which are only partially conserved. Practicable tools are needed to improve diagnosis and identify risk factors. EAEC-infected individuals can be treated with fluoroquinolones but there is a need to examine alternative treatment protocols.

### CTX-M-15-producing enteroaggregative Escherichia coli as cause of travelers' diarrhea [^fc9ee839]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea remains a major public health problem, causing substantial illness and disability. Almost 50% of patients with travelers' diarrhea require treatment with antimicrobial drugs because of persistence or severity of signs and symptoms. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is among the most common diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes recognized. The first-choice agents for treating EAEC infections are quinolones, rifaximin, azithromycin, and cephalosporins. However, the number of pathogenic E. coli strains resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents has increased, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime) associated with production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) limits therapeutic options.

Although ESBL production has mainly been shown in extraintestinal E. coli infections, studies concerning effects of ESBLs in intestinal E. coli infections are scarce. The worldwide spread of CTX-M-15 type ESBLs has led these β-lactamases to replace TEM- and SHV-type ESBLs in Europe, Canada, and Asia and become one of the major groups of ESBLs studied. Of the different CTX-M–type ESBLs, CTX-M-15 has become the most widely distributed enzyme worldwide. It was first identified in an isolate from India in 1999 and thereafter became prevalent around the world. CTX-M-15 enhances hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime. A particular clone of CTX-M-15–producing E. coli, characterized by phylogenetic type (phylotype) B2 and sequence type 131 (ST131), seems to be largely responsible for international epidemics of CTX-M–producing E. coli. Sequence types (STs) are grouped into clonal complexes by their similarity to a central allelic profile.

ST131 is a singleton and therefore does not belong to a clonal complex. Molecular epidemiologic studies have suggested that the sudden increase in CTX-M-15–producing E. coli worldwide was mainly caused by this single clone (ST131) and that foreign travel to high-risk areas, such as the Indian subcontinent, might play a partial role in the spread of this clone across continents. The bla CTX-M-15 gene is usually found downstream from the insertion sequence IS Ecp1, which may be involved in the clone's dissemination and expression. We describe molecular epidemiology and plasmid analyses of 5 CTX-M-15–producing EAEC isolates from patients with travelers' diarrhea who had traveled from Spain to India.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) treatment risks — treatment of STEC O157 and likely non-O157 STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 with fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, TMP-SMX, and metronidazole in patients of all ages should be avoided because of evidence of harm; very limited data on macrolide antibiotics provide insufficient evidence of benefit and some evidence for harm favoring avoidance, and because the Shiga toxin profile is often unknown and no clear benefit exists for treating less virulent STEC infections with antibiotics, avoidance of antimicrobials is recommended among people with suspected STEC infections.

### Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli diarrhea in travelers: response to rifaximin therapy [^16c988f5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

We have recently shown that enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) strains commonly cause travelers' diarrhea. The study was designed to determine whether U.S. travelers with EAEC diarrhea responded to rifaximin therapy.

Methods

In a multicenter placebo-controlled clinical trial of travelers' diarrhea without non-EAEC pathogens we evaluated 2 doses of rifaximin. EAEC was sought in stool samples in enrolled subjects by HEp-2 cell assay. Response to rifaximin (both groups combined) and placebo were evaluated in EAEC-positive and EAEC-negative patient groups.

Results

Compared with placebo, rifaximin shortened the postenrollment illness in travelers with EAEC diarrhea (median, 22 vs. 72 hours; P = 0.03). In subjects with EAEC-negative diarrhea, the median duration of post-treatment diarrhea was shorter with rifaximin (33 hours) than with placebo (52 hours), but this difference was not significantly different (P = 0.14).

Conclusions

Improvement of EAEC-mediated diarrhea with antibiotic treatment supports the pathogenicity of this organism in travelers to developing countries. The study provides information on the value of the poorly absorbed drug rifaximin in therapy of travelers' diarrhea.

### Why antibiotics should not be used to treat Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^d18f0ee1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been much debate about treating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections with antibiotics. No data convincingly demonstrate that antibiotics are better than no antibiotic treatment at all, and many studies suggest antibiotics increase the risk of developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This topic is timely, because emerging technology enables rapid identification of STEC-infected patients, and we anticipate questions about management will increase. This review is designed to familiarize readers with the series of observations that underlie our recommendations.

Recent Findings

The long debate over antibiotics in STEC infections appears resolved by gradually accruing information that show that antibiotics do not benefit infected patients. In fact, they are associated with an increased likelihood of developing HUS. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that low risk of bias studies find a clear association between antibiotic use and development of HUS. Subsequent publications do not refute these findings.

Summary

In high-income countries, antibiotics should not routinely be given to patients with acute diarrhea unless testing demonstrates a pathogen for which antibiotics are indicated, and STEC infection has been excluded. Future work to prevent HUS should focus on preventing primary infections, and mitigating extraintestinal consequences of STEC gut infections.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^b66c4a55]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Rifaximin for traveler's diarrhea — Rifaximin has been shown to be effective against diarrheagenic E. coli and, versus placebo, was associated with a higher percentage of travelers cured. In EAEC, a 200 mg dose administered three times a day reduced time to last unformed stool versus placebo, 22 vs. 72 h. Versus ciprofloxacin, there was no significant difference for cure or treatment failure, and another study showed no overall advantage of ciprofloxacin over rifaximin, although a subgroup with invasive illness showed a reduced benefit following treatment with rifaximin.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) — antimicrobial therapy for infections attributed to STEC O157 and other STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 (or if the toxin genotype is unknown) should be avoided (strong, moderate), whereas antimicrobial therapy for infections attributed to other STEC that do not produce Shiga toxin 2 (generally non-O157 STEC) is debatable due to insufficient evidence of benefit or the potential harm associated with some classes of antimicrobial agents (strong, low).

### Treatment of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^181eaffd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The management of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections is reviewed. Certain management practices optimize the likelihood of good outcomes, such as avoidance of antibiotics during the pre-hemolytic uremic syndrome phase, admission to hospital, and vigorous intravenous volume expansion using isotonic fluids. The successful management of STEC infections is based on recognition that a patient might have an STEC infection, and appropriate use of the microbiology laboratory. The timeliness of STEC identification cannot be overemphasized, because it avoids therapies prompted by inappropriate additional testing and directs the clinician to focus on effective management strategies. The opportunities during STEC infections to avert the worst outcomes are brief, and this article emphasizes practical matters relevant to making a diagnosis, anticipating the trajectory of illness, and optimizing care.

### CTX-M-15-producing enteroaggregative Escherichia coli as cause of travelers' diarrhea [^989c7a88]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The Study

The study included all patients with diarrhea who visited the Tropical Medicine Unit of Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain, during 2005 and 2006. Patients with diarrhea that started during or shortly after (< 5 days) a stay in a developing country were eligible. After the participants provided informed consent, clinical and epidemiologic data were collected.

Among all eligible participants, infection with EAEC and no other enteropathogen was found for 51. Of these 51 EAEC isolates, 5 from patients who had traveled to India were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Resistance phenotypes indicated ESBL production. MICs for antimicrobial agents and susceptibility class were determined by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints guideline (Table 1). All strains were resistant to penicillins; second-, third-, and fourth-generation cephalosporins; and all β-lactamase–inhibitor combinations except piperacillin/tazobactam. Apart from β-lactam susceptibility, the strains showed resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents, such as fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and monobactams (aztreonam). Positive amplification with specific primers and sequencing for the bla CTX-M-15 gene provided positive genotypic confirmatory test results for ESBL production.

### Genomic characterization of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli from children in Mali [^30b48817]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

It is estimated that diarrhea causes at least 1.5 million deaths annually, mostly in children < 5 years of age. Although in aggregate the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) pathotypes comprise the most common bacterial pathogens worldwide, each DEC pathotype is clinically, epidemiologically, and pathogenetically distinct. For some pathotypes, the key virulence factors are known, at least in part, whereas for other pathotypes, the key virulence genes and how they coordinately function in the setting of enteric disease remain elusive.

The enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) pathotype has been implicated in travelers' diarrhea, in endemic diarrhea among children in both industrialized and resource-poor countries, and in persistent diarrhea among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus. A recent outbreak of Shiga toxin–producing EAEC highlights its pathogenic potential. Despite this, the molecular epidemiology of EAEC infection remains unclear, largely due to imperfect recognition of the true pathogenic factors within the broadly defined pathotype.

Most EAEC strains colonize the intestinal mucosa via the aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAFs), which include at least 4 major antigenic variants. AAFs are transcriptionally regulated by an AraC/XylS family activator called AggR. AggR is also required for expression of genes encoding dispersin (the aap gene), the Aat dispersin translocator, and the chromosomal cluster termed Aai, encoding a type VI secretion system. Factors not under AggR control include the Air adhesin, a regulator termed EilA, the EAEC heat-stable toxin EAST-1 (encoded by the astA gene), and a set of toxins termed the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs).

SPATEs have been organized phylogenetically into 2 classes. Members of class 1 are cytotoxic to epithelial cells; class 1 SPATEs found in EAEC strains include the plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) and its 2 homologs, Sat and SigA. The class 2, or noncytotoxic, SPATEs include Pic, a mucinase that promotes intestinal colonization. As with cytotoxic SPATEs and Pic, we have recently reported that the class 2 SPATE SepA is found commonly among EAEC strains. SepA is a cryptic protease originally described in Shigella species, and is reported to contribute to intestinal inflammation. Importantly, none of these factors are found in all EAEC isolates, and no single factor has ever been consistently implicated in EAEC virulence.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (bloody diarrhea), IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to assess the benefit or the potential harm of antimicrobial therapy for patients with infections attributed to other STEC that do not produce Shiga toxin 2, which are generally non-O157 STEC.

### Recommendations for diagnosis of Shiga toxin – producing Escherichia coli infections by clinical laboratories [^21909a13]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical considerations — accurate, rapid identification of STEC, particularly of E. coli O157:H7, is critical for patient management and disease control, and therefore the types of microbiologic tests chosen, performed, and reported and subsequent communication with treating clinicians are critical. Prompt and proper treatment of patients with a positive or presumptively positive STEC culture requires rapid and clear diagnostic enteric microbiology and reporting of data.

### Targeting virulence traits: potential strategies to combat extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli infections [^932cf20d]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are able to colonize, invade and induce disease in body niches outside the gastrointestinal tract. The emergence of (multi)resistant ExPEC variants calls for alternative antimicrobial strategies with a reduced pressure on selection of antibiotic resistances. We report on recent research efforts to target such virulence traits or to interfere with ExPEC colonization of extraintestinal niches in order to prevent or treat ExPEC infections and reduce the risk of further emergence of antibiotic resistances.

### Antimicrobial drug-resistant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections, Michigan, USA [^8c2b6957]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although we found no significant difference by stx profile, strains possessing stx 1 only were more commonly resistant than strains with stx 2 alone (p = 0.27 by Fisher exact test). All 23 (100%) resistant non-O157 STEC and 1 (12.5%) resistant O157 strain had stx 1 only. Strains positive for eae were less likely to be resistant (n = 27; 8.4%) than eae -negative strains (n = 4; 23.5%); this nonsignificant difference (p = 0.07 by Fisher exact test) could be due to small sample sizes. All 8 resistant O157 strains and 18 (78.3%) of 23 resistant non-O157 strains had eae, demonstrating correlations between virulence genes and serogroups.

Overall, we detected a high frequency of resistance among non-O157 STEC (11.2%), similar to findings from Mexico (15%), although we evaluated fewer drugs. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was low despite its routine use for treating enteric infections, perhaps because resistance development in E. coli requires multiple mutations. Resistance frequencies in STEC were low relative to other E. coli pathotypes such as extraintestinal E. coli, which may be attributable to differences in the source of the infections.

### Phylogenetic analysis of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) isolates from Japan reveals emergence of CTX-M-14-producing EAEC O25: H4 clones related to sequence type 131 [^e2fe6807]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes acute or persistent diarrhea. The aggR gene is widely used as a marker for typical EAEC. The heterogeneity of EAEC is well known; however, there are few reports on the phylogenetic relationships of EAEC. Recently, CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing EAEC strains have been reported worldwide. To characterize EAEC strains in Japan, we investigated the population structure of EAEC. A total of 167 aggR-positive strains isolated from stool specimens from diarrheal patients in Kagoshima (139 strains) and Osaka (28 strains), Japan, between 1992 and 2010 were examined for the prevalence of EAEC virulence markers, the blaCTX-M gene, and the capacity to form biofilms. Multilocus sequence typing was also conducted. EAEC strains were widely distributed across four major E. coli phylogroups. Strains of O111:H21/clonal group 40 (CG40) (30 strains), O126:H27/CG200 (13 strains), and O86a:H27/CG3570 (11 strains) in phylogroup B1 are the historical EAEC clones in Japan, and they exhibited strong biofilm formation. Twenty-nine strains of EAEC O25:H4/CG131 were identified in phylogroup B2, 79% of which produced CTX-M-14. This clone has emerged since 2003. The clone harbored plasmid-encoded EAEC virulence genes but not chromosomal virulence genes and had lower biofilm-forming capacity than historical EAEC strains. This clone most likely emerged from a pandemic uropathogenic O25:H4/sequence type 131 clone by acquiring an EAEC virulence plasmid from canonical EAEC. Surveillance of the horizontal transfer of both virulence and ESBL genes among E. coli strains is important for preventing a worldwide increase in antimicrobial drug resistance.

### Association between pathogenic variants of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and growth in children under 5 years of age in the global enteric multicenter study [^f1fcd98b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Childhood malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of death from diarrhea, pneumonia, and other infectious diseases, as well as growth failure, cognitive delay, and productivity loss. Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli causes the most common bacterial gastrointestinal infection in developing nations, especially among infants and young children aged under 2 years. –

In developing nations, acute diarrhea is still the most common cause of infantile diarrhea and the most common attributing factor for malnutrition. Several variants of E. coli constitute the nonpathogenic gut microbiome. However, some variants of E. coli have evolved with the capacity to exert virulence causing different manifestations of gastrointestinal illness and account for the most common cause of childhood diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea (enterotoxigenic E. coli or ETEC), chronic diarrhea (enteroaggregative E. coli or EAEC), and watery diarrhea in children are all clinical symptoms associated with diarrheagenic E. coli infection (enteropathogenic E. coli or EPEC).

### High frequency of antimicrobial drug resistance of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in infants in Peru [^6e9949ec]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

In a prospective passive diarrhea surveillance cohort study of 1,034 infants of low socioeconomic communities in Lima, Peru, we determined the prevalence and antimicrobial drug susceptibility of the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The prevalence of diarrheagenic E. coli was 29% (161 of 557) in children with gastroenteritis and 30% (58 of 195) in the control group without diarrhea. The most common E. coli pathogens in diarrhea were enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) (14%), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (7%), diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) (4%), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (4%). Diarrheagenic E. coli as a group exhibited high levels of antimicrobial drug resistance in diarrheal cases to ampicillin (85%), cotrimoxazole (79%), tetracycline (65%), and nalidixic acid (28%). Among individual E. coli groups in patients with diarrhea, DAEC and EAEC exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline and nalidixic acid than EPEC and ETEC. Antimicrobial drug resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole were more frequent in E. coli isolated from diarrheal samples than controls, which reflected greater antibiotic exposure in patients with gastroenteritis.

INTRODUCTION

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an important causative agent of both acute and persistent diarrhea among adults and children worldwideand it has been among the most common E. coli pathotypes causing diarrhea among children less than 5 years of age in some developing countries. Several outbreaks of EAEC diarrhea have been reported in both developed and developing nations and infants are the most affected.EAEC has been implicated in travelers' diarrheaand persistent diarrhea among human immunodeficiency virus–infected individuals. This pathotype was implicated in a massive outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome in Germany in 2011. The clinical presentation of EAEC infection is characterized by watery and mucoid diarrhea with low-grade fever and insignificant vomiting.

The pathogenesis of EAEC diarrhea is thought to comprise colonization of the intestinal mucosa, followed by elaboration of enterotoxins and cytotoxins and the release of proinflamatory cytokines from infected epithelial cells, induced by the EAEC adherence factors called aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF). In addition, EAEC strains characteristically enhance mucus secretion from the mucosa, potentially trapping the bacterium in a bacterium-mucus biofilm. A distinctive feature of EAEC is its ability to elicit characteristic stacked brick-liked aggregative adherence to HEp-2 or HeLa cells, a test that remains the gold standard to identify this pathotype.EAEC strains express several genes that may confer virulence and are highly heterogeneous regarding the combination of these virulence genes, which are encoded on the bacterial chromosome or on an EAEC-specific plasmid-designated pAA. The majority of EAEC strains harbor a transcriptional activator of the AraC/XyIS called AggR, which control genes on both the plasmid and the chromosome. Among the genes under AggR control includes those that encode the AAF where at least five variants exist. These genes encoding the major structural pilin subunits are designated as aggA (AAF/I), aafA (AAF/II), agg3A (AAF/III), agg4A (AAF/IV), and agg5A (AAF/V). Other plasmid-borne potential virulence factors include the EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1) (encoded by the astA gene), an anti-aggregation protein called dispersin (encoded by the aap gene), and a transporter apparatus for dispersin called Aat (encoded by the aat genes). EAEC frequently harbor members of the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs), which have been described as enterotoxins and cytotoxins. The heat-labile enterotoxin/cytotoxin called Plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet)has been implicated in causing cytotoxic effects on the human intestinal mucosa. Other SPATEs carried by EAEC strains include the cryptic protease called SepA, and the mucinase called Pic (protein involved in intestinal colonization), which is encoded on the chromosome. Other important chromosomal gene that encodes virulence markers include 1) Irp2 (iron repressible high-molecular-weight protein 2) a protein responsible for yersiniabactin biosynthesis and 2) flagellin, which interacts with the epithelial cells, leading to the secretion of an intestinal interleukin-8. The EAEC genome has been found to be markedly mosaic; thus, the various putative virulence factors are found inconsistently among individual strains, suggesting that some strains considered EAEC may be truly virulent, and others not.

### The emerging clinical importance of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli [^ef2b6278]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

In 1982, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome were linked to infection with Escherichia coli O157:H7, a serotype now classified as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Thereafter, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with non-O157 STEC serogroups were reported, with the frequency of non-O157 STEC illness rivaling that of O157:H7 in certain geographic regions. In the United States, non-O157 E. coli may account for up to 20%-50% of all STEC infections. A high index of suspicion, paired with options to test for non-O157 STEC infection, are necessary for early recognition and appropriate treatment of these infections. Supportive care without the use of antibiotics is currently considered to be optimal treatment for all STEC infections. This commentary provides a perspective on the non-O157 STEC as human pathogens, how and when the clinician should approach the diagnosis of these organisms, and the challenges ahead.

### Treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^41c2337b]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a specialized group of E. coli that can cause severe colonic disease and renal failure. Their pathogenicity derives from virulence factors that enable the bacteria to colonize the colon and deliver extremely powerful toxins known as verotoxins (VT) or Shiga toxins (Stx) to the systemic circulation. The recent devastating E. coli O104:H4 epidemic in Europe has shown how helpless medical professionals are in terms of offering effective therapies. By examining the sources and distribution of these bacteria, and how they cause disease, we will be in a better position to prevent and treat the inevitable future cases of sporadic disease and victims of common source outbreaks. Due to the complexity of pathogenesis, it is likely a multitargeted approach is warranted. Developments in terms of these treatments are discussed.

### Role of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli virulence factors in uropathogenesis [^53f80660]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

A multiresistant clonal Escherichia coli O78:H10 strain qualifying molecularly as enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) was recently shown to be the cause of a community-acquired outbreak of urinary tract infection (UTI) in greater Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1991. This marks the first time EAEC has been associated with an extraintestinal disease outbreak. Importantly, the outbreak isolates were recovered from the urine of patients with symptomatic UTI, strongly implying urovirulence. Here, we sought to determine the uropathogenic properties of the Copenhagen outbreak strain and whether these properties are conferred by the EAEC-specific virulence factors. We demonstrated that through expression of aggregative adherence fimbriae, the principal adhesins of EAEC, the outbreak strain exhibited pronouncedly increased adherence to human bladder epithelial cells compared to prototype uropathogenic strains. Moreover, the strain was able to produce distinct biofilms on abiotic surfaces, including urethral catheters. These findings suggest that EAEC-specific virulence factors increase uropathogenicity and may have played a significant role in the ability of the strain to cause a community-acquired outbreak of UTI. Thus, inclusion of EAEC-specific virulence factors is warranted in future detection and characterization of uropathogenic E. coli.

Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) clinical importance of prompt diagnosis highlights that early, appropriate treatment might mitigate complications and that laboratory identification underpins public health response; prompt and accurate diagnosis is important because appropriate treatment with parenteral volume expansion early in infection might decrease renal damage and improve patient outcome, antibiotic therapy in STEC infection might be associated with more severe disease, and prompt laboratory identification of STEC strains is essential for control measures, outbreak response, detection of new serotypes, and monitoring trends.

E. coli O157:H7 can cause potentially lethal illness in hosts of all ages. These patients often are evaluated and treated by gastroenterologists. The treating physician should administer adequate hydration, usually parenterally, and avoid the use of antibiotics and antimotility agents. The physician needs to notify immediately the appropriate public health authorities of the diagnosis and to ensure that the isolate is recovered by the microbiologist and forwarded for molecular linkage analyses.

### Recommendations for diagnosis of Shiga toxin – producing Escherichia coli infections by clinical laboratories [^9a17432a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and patient management in STEC infection — Detection of O157 STEC should prompt immediate initiation of steps such as parenteral volume expansion to reduce the risk for renal damage and the spread of infection, and early diagnosis is important for determining the proper treatment promptly. Initiation of parenteral volume expansion early in the course of O157 STEC infection might decrease renal damage and improve patient outcome. Conversely, antibiotics might increase the risk for HUS in patients infected with O157 STEC, and antidiarrheal medications might worsen the illness. Early diagnosis of STEC infection also might prevent unnecessary procedures or treatments such as surgery or corticosteroids for patients with severe abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea.

### Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli as a major etiologic agent in traveler's diarrhea in 3 regions of the world [^e814b31d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) has been reported to cause traveler's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in children in developing countries and in immunocompromised patients. To clarify the prevalence of EAEC in traveler's diarrhea, we studied 636 US, Canadian, or European travelers with diarrhea: 218 in Guadalajara, Mexico (June — August 1997 and 1998), 125 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica (September 1997 — May 1998), and 293 in Goa, India (January 1997 — April 1997 and October 1997 — February 1998). Stool samples were tested for conventional enteropathogens. EAEC strains were identified by use of the HEp-2 assay. EAEC was isolated in 26% of cases of traveler's diarrhea (ranging from 19% in Goa to 33% in Guadalajara) and was second only to enterotoxigenic E. coli as the most common enteropathogen in all areas. Identification of EAEC reduced the number of cases for which the pathogen was unknown from 327 (51%) to 237 (37%) and explained 28% of cases with unknown etiology. EAEC was a major cause of traveler's diarrhea in 3 geographically distinct study areas.

### Rifaximin (Xifaxan) [^f92408de]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Rifaximin is a semi-synthetic derivative of rifampin and acts by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase blocking one of the steps in transcription. This results in inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis and consequently inhibits the growth of bacteria.

Resistance

Resistance to rifaximin is caused primarily by mutations in the rpoB gene. This changes the binding site on DNA dependent RNA polymerase and decreases rifaximin binding affinity, thereby reducing efficacy. Cross-resistance between rifaximin and other classes of antimicrobials has not been observed.

Antibacterial Activity

Rifaximin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1.1)]:

Aerobic bacteria
Gram-negative bacteria
Escherichia coli (enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains)

Susceptibility Testing

### Natural history of enteroaggregative and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection among US travelers to guadalajara, Mexico [^e9393b82]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The natural history of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) infection was studied among 40 US travelers who provided weekly stool samples for 4 weeks after arrival in Mexico. At enrollment, 5 subjects were colonized by EAEC and 3 by ETEC. During the first 2 weeks after enrollment, 12 developed EAEC diarrhea, 7 developed ETEC diarrhea (5 with mixed EAEC/ETEC diarrhea), 13 had EAEC colonization, and 7 had ETEC colonization. During the third and fourth weeks, 4 experienced EAEC diarrhea, 2 experienced ETEC diarrhea (1 with mixed EAEC/ETEC diarrhea), 31 had EAEC colonization, and none had ETEC colonization. Plasmid DNA analysis showed a high degree of heterogeneity among EAEC isolates. Symptomatic EAEC infection occurred early after arrival in Guadalajara, Mexico, and was as common as ETEC infection. Asymptomatic EAEC infection was recurrent.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was demonstrated in five independent, multidrug-resistant isolates of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) from the United Arab Emirates, representing 11.3% of the EAEC isolates recovered during 1 year. All five isolates carried the bla(CTX-M-15) and the bla(TEM-1) genes, the former positioned 48 bp downstream of an ISecp1 element. In two isolates, the bla(CTX-M-15)and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on a 95-kb plasmid. This is the first detailed description and characterisation of ESBL production in enteroaggregative E. coli and also the first report of CTX-M-producing organisms encountered on the Arabian Peninsula.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^ab9109e8]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea affects millions of persons who travel to developing countries each year. Food and water contaminated with fecal matter are the main sources of infection. Bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella are common causes of traveler's diarrhea. Parasites and viruses are less common etiologies. Travel destination is the most significant risk factor for traveler's diarrhea. The efficacy of pretravel counseling and dietary precautions in reducing the incidence of diarrhea is unproven. Empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antibiotics and loperamide is effective and often limits symptoms to one day. Rifaximin, a recently approved antibiotic, can be used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in regions where noninvasive E. coli is the predominant pathogen. In areas where invasive organisms such as Campylobacter and Shigella are common, fluoroquinolones remain the drug of choice. Azithromycin is recommended in areas with quinolone-resistant Campylobacter and for the treatment of children and pregnant women.

### Infectious colitis excluding E. coli O157: H7 and C. difficile [^d2cdcc25]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Colitic infection caused by a variety of organisms may have an extremely varied presentation, course, and treatment response. Current data have provided great insights into the pathophysiology of these various organisms and their clinical presentation, course, and treatment outcomes. As clinicians develop a better understanding of the colon, its immunologic defense mechanisms, and the virulence factors of such organisms, they will be better able to evaluate these infections as well as newer colonic infections yet unknown. It is important to know if and when to treat such organisms to prevent the dilemma of drug-resistant strains, as seen already in a variety of well-known infections, such as Campylobacter and others. Knowledge of such colonic targets will be more important in an era of ever-growing resistance to and wide use of antibiotic regimens.

### Association between azithromycin therapy and duration of bacterial shedding among patients with Shiga toxin-producing enteroaggregative Escherichia coli O104: H4 [^33d20bea]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

An outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (STEC O104:H4) infection with a high incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) occurred in Germany in May 2011. Antibiotic treatment of STEC infection is discouraged because it might increase the risk of HUS development. However, antibiotic therapy is widely used to treat enteroaggregative E coli infection. In the German outbreak, a substantial number of patients received prophylactic azithromycin treatment as part of a therapeutic regimen with the C5 antibody eculizumab.

Objective

To analyze the duration of bacterial shedding in patients with STEC infection who did and did not receive oral azithromycin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Patients

At a single center in Lübeck, Germany, 65 patients with STEC infection, including patients with HUS as well as STEC-infected outpatients without manifestation of HUS, were investigated between May 15 and July 26, 2011, and were monitored for a mean of 39.3 days after onset of clinical symptoms.

Main Outcome Measure

Carriage of STEC after azithromycin therapy.

Results

Twenty-two patients received oral azithromycin and 43 patients did not receive antibiotic treatment. Among antibiotic-treated patients, long-term STEC carriage (> 28 days) was observed in 1 of 22 patients (4.5%; 95% CI, 0%-13.3%) compared with 35 of 43 patients (81.4%; 95% CI, 69.8%-93.0%) who were not treated with antibiotics (P < .001). All 22 patients receiving azithromycin treatment had at least 3 STEC-negative stool specimens after the completion of treatment, and no recurrence of STEC was observed in these patients. As proof of principle, 15 patients who initially were not treated with antibiotics and were long-term STEC carriers were treated with oral azithromycin given for 3 days and subsequently had negative stool specimens.

Conclusion

Treatment with azithromycin was associated with a lower frequency of long-term STEC O104:H4 carriage.

### Enteric pathogen carriage in early childhood is associated with elevated CRP, lower IGF-1 and linear growth deficits: the ELICIT study in rural tanzania [^33b6d569]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The main underlying hypothesis of this RCT was that in an area where children have a high prevalence of enteric pathogen carriage, intervention with antimicrobials covering multiple pathogens would reduce carriage and thus improve growth. In this intervention, participants received a dose of azithromycin (or placebo) every 3 months starting at age 6 months (targeting Campylobacter, Shigella and multiple pathogenic E. coli species) and a 3-day course of nitazoxanide at 12 and 15 months (covering Giardia and Cryptosporidium). However, we previously reported that not only did we not see improved growth among those randomised to receive antimicrobials, we did not see sustained reduction in pathogen burden. By 2 weeks after antimicrobial dosing, there were short-term reductions in Campylobacter jejuni/coli, EAEC, Shigella/ EIEC and tEPEC; however, by 3 months later, there was a return of pathogens.

Interestingly, this is the first analysis for this study in which we report that participants who received non-study penicillins had higher LAZ, with adjusted models showing a positive correlation between the cumulative number of penicillin courses and 18-month LAZ. This contrast in association with higher LAZ between the intervention antimicrobials and non-study may relate to (1) the lower antimicrobial exposure for the intervention (one dose of azithromycin every 3 months) compared with non-study use (presumably a complete course of treatment) or (2) the difference in antimicrobial used, with penicillins potentially having been more effective in this setting. Still, use of all non-study antimicrobials was only associated with a decrease in Giardia — and was associated with an increase in prevalence of EAEC, potentially due to reverse-causation, as we cannot determine whether these children were placed on antimicrobials because of their symptoms from EAEC.

Enteric fever and STEC antimicrobial guidance — bloody diarrhea: People with clinical features of sepsis who are suspected of having enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy after blood, stool, and urine culture collection (strong, low), antimicrobial therapy should be narrowed when antimicrobial susceptibility testing results become available (strong, high), and if an isolate is unavailable and there is a clinical suspicion of enteric fever, antimicrobial choice may be tailored to susceptible patterns from the setting where acquisition occurred (weak, low). Antimicrobial therapy for people with infections attributed to STEC O157 and other STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 (or if the toxin genotype is unknown) should be avoided (strong, moderate), whereas antimicrobial therapy for people with infections attributed to other STEC that do not produce Shiga toxin 2 is debatable due to insufficient evidence of benefit or the potential harm associated with some classes of antimicrobial agents (strong, low).

### Outbreak of Escherichia coli O104: H4 infections associated with sprout consumption-Europe and north America, may-July 2011 [^c61ea2a1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

Surveillance conducted in the United States during the outbreak identified six cases associated with the outbreak; four were complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome. These are the first documented cases of STEC O104:H4 in the United States. None of the U.S. patients recalled consumption of sprouts, the outbreak vehicle.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Adherence to recommended STEC diagnostic testing is critical in detecting illnesses and outbreaks attributable to non-O157 STEC. High-quality public health infrastructure allows for comprehensive responses and rapid control of outbreaks that might involve similarly rare pathogens.

During May 26–June 16, six confirmed cases were identified in five states: Arizona (one), Massachusetts (one), Michigan (two), North Carolina (one), and Wisconsin (one). Ages of patients ranged from 38 to 72 years (median: 52 years); two patients were female. Five reported travel to or from Germany in the 3 weeks before their illness; the additional secondary case was in a close relative of a patient who had traveled. Patients reported consumption of various fresh produce items while in Germany, such as tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers. However, none recalled consumption of sprouts, the food vehicle ultimately implicated in the outbreak. All patients had diarrhea, including four (66%) with bloody diarrhea. Four (66%) patients were reported by physicians to have developed HUS, requiring dialysis and ventilator support. One patient died.

Microbiologic characterization of the pathogens isolated from clinical specimens demonstrated STEC O104:H4 within all specimens, with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. This strain combines features of the STEC and enteroaggregative (EAEC) pathotypes of Escherichia coli. All isolates were positive for the stx2a gene, which encodes a Shiga toxin variant often associated with severe E. coli illness, such as bloody diarrhea or HUS. Additionally, all isolates were positive for the aggR gene, which encodes a regulator of virulence plasmid and chromosomal genes and is characteristic of EAEC. The strains were negative for the eae gene, which encodes a mucosal adherence protein in most STEC. Isolates from the six patients had almost identical antimicrobial resistance profiles; all were resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

### What's new in enteric infectious diseases at home and abroad [^1189bb3b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was designed to focus on the important research in the area of acute infectious diarrhea published within the past year. PubMed was reviewed for articles published in 2004 and 2005 relating to pathogen-specific diarrhea and for travelers' diarrhea to identify the newly published articles.

Recent Findings

New studies continue to show the importance of the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli as causes of acute and persistent diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli has recently been shown to be an unrecognized cause of community-acquired diarrhea in infants in the USA. Genetic factors explain an increased susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea among international travelers. Also, poorly non-absorbed rifaximin (< 0.4%) was shown to be an effective drug when used prophylactically to prevent bacterial diarrhea during high risk travel.

Summary

Studies will continue to define the etiology of diarrhea and to better understand the epidemiology and prevention of infectious diarrhea. Antibacterial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens is a growing problem, leading to the search for newer antibacterial drugs. Diarrhea due to bacterial agents in international travelers can be prevented and treated successfully by antibacterial drugs. The nonabsorbed rifamycin drug, rifaximin, appears to be ideally suited to become the important new drug in prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea. Studies are underway to determine the value of the drug in preventing invasive forms of diarrhea during travel to Asia and in the prevention of the commonly occurring post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

### Escherichia coli O157 [^497ec3cd]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Escherichia coli O157 is an uncommon but serious cause of gastroenteritis. This bacterium is noteworthy because a few, but significant, number of infected people develop the haemolytic uraemic syndrome, which is the most frequent cause of acute renal failure in children in the Americas and Europe. Many infections of E coli O157 could be prevented by the more effective application of evidence-based methods, which is especially important because once an infection has been established, no therapeutic interventions are available to lessen the risk of the development of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. This Review takes into account the evolution and geographical distibution of E coli O157 (and its close pathogenic relatives); the many and varied routes of transmission from its major natural hosts, ruminant farm animals; and other aspects of its epidemiology, its virulence factors, the diagnosis and management of infection and their complications, the repercussions of infection including costs, and prevention.

### Medical and economic impact of extraintestinal infections due to Escherichia coli: focus on an increasingly important endemic problem [^f0a0a853]. Microbes and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is probably the best-known bacterial species and one of the most frequently isolated organisms from clinical specimens. Despite this, underappreciation and misunderstandings exist among medical professionals and the lay public alike regarding E. coli as an extraintestinal pathogen. Underappreciated features include (i) the wide variety of extraintestinal infections E. coli can cause, (ii) the high incidence and associated morbidity, mortality, and costs of these diverse clinical syndromes, (iii) the pathogenic potential of different groups of E. coli strains for causing intestinal versus extraintestinal disease, and (iv) increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated "killers". Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli. New treatments and prevention measures will be needed for improved outcomes and a diminished disease burden.

### Therapy for and prevention of traveler's diarrhea [^10ad652d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea associated with international travel is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, or noroviruses. Early studies to define these enteropathogens took place at the University of Maryland during the Theodore E. Woodward years. Although a reduction in the rate of diarrhea may be possible through avoidance of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated, a more effective preventive strategy is to administer nonabsorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin each day during trips to areas where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high (i.e., high-risk areas). For the self-treatment of diarrhea that occurs during travel, all persons planning trips to high-risk areas should take with them medication with expected activity against the prevalent bacterial enteropathogens: rifaximin (for the treatment of common afebrile, nondysenteric diarrhea), a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin. Further study is needed to determine whether it is possible to avoid important morbidity associated with diarrhea and the development of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with chemoprophylaxis and/or early effective treatment.

### Characterization of Escherichia coli isolates from hospital inpatients or outpatients with urinary tract infection [^fc09c14b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common cause of community- and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). Isolates from uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs express a variety of virulence traits that promote the efficient colonization of the urinary tract. In contrast, nosocomial UTIs can be caused by E. coli strains that differ in their virulence traits from the community-acquired UTI isolates. UPEC virulence markers are used to distinguish these facultative extraintestinal pathogens, which belong to the intestinal flora of many healthy individuals, from intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC). IPEC is a diarrheagenic pathogen with a characteristic virulence gene set that is absent in UPEC. Here, we characterized 265 isolates from patients with UTIs during inpatient or outpatient treatment at a hospital regarding their phylogenies and IPEC or UPEC virulence traits. Interestingly, 28 of these isolates (10.6%) carried typical IPEC virulence genes that are characteristic of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC), although IPEC is not considered a uropathogen. Twenty-three isolates harbored the astA gene coding for the EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1), and most of them carried virulence genes that are characteristic of UPEC and/or EAEC. Our results indicate that UPEC isolates from hospital patients differ from archetypal community-acquired isolates from uncomplicated UTIs by their spectrum of virulence traits. They represent a diverse group, including EAEC, as well as other IPEC pathotypes, which in addition contain typical UPEC virulence genes. The combination of typical extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and IPEC virulence determinants in some isolates demonstrates the marked genome plasticity of E. coli and calls for a reevaluation of the strict pathotype classification of EAEC.

### Recommendations for diagnosis of Shiga toxin – producing Escherichia coli infections by clinical laboratories [^4646c8d9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Shiga toxin — producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a leading cause of bacterial enteric infections in the United States. Prompt, accurate diagnosis of STEC infection is important because appropriate treatment early in the course of infection might decrease the risk for serious complications such as renal damage and improve overall patient outcome. In addition, prompt laboratory identification of STEC strains is essential for detecting new and emerging serotypes, for effective and timely outbreak responses and control measures, and for monitoring trends in disease epidemiology. Guidelines for laboratory identification of STEC infections by clinical laboratories were published in 2006. This report provides comprehensive and detailed recommendations for STEC testing by clinical laboratories, including the recommendation that all stools submitted for routine testing from patients with acute community-acquired diarrhea (regardless of patient age, season of the year, or presence or absence of blood in the stool) be simultaneously cultured for E. coli O157:H7 (O157 STEC) and tested with an assay that detects Shiga toxins to detect non-O157 STEC. The report also includes detailed procedures for specimen selection, handling, and transport; a review of culture and nonculture tests for STEC detection; and clinical considerations and recommendations for management of patients with STEC infection. Improving the diagnostic accuracy of STEC infection by clinical laboratories should ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment of these infections in patients and increase detection of STEC outbreaks in the community.

### Despite predominance of uropathogenic / extraintestinal pathotypes among travel-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, the most commonly associated clinical manifestation is travelers' diarrhea [^e2264786]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Despite growing concern about the surge of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates, many clinicians overlook the potential risks asymptomatic intestinal colonization by ESBL-PE may pose to travelers. Our finding that a large proportion of imported ESBL-PE strains qualify molecularly as presumptive intestinal or extraintestinal pathogens suggests that more travel-acquired ESBL-PE may cause infections than has been recognized previously.

We found that 13 of 90 (14%) of the travel-acquired ESBL-PE strains were DEC, usually EAEC, a known cause of TD. Most ESBL-producing EAEC strains originated in South Asia, which has the highest rates reported for both TD and ESBL-PE acquisition, and here had the highest proportion of DEC among travel-acquired ESBL-PE strains (28% vs 7% for other regions combined).

Recent research on TD has documented stool pathogens among both symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers, rendering causality ambiguous in individual cases. However, at the population level, in appropriately controlled studies, EAEC and other intestinal pathogens have been more prevalent among symptomatic than asymptomatic travelers. Here, 12 of 13 (92%) volunteers with ESBL-producing DEC had TD, although (as is typical of TD) 10 of 13 had other potentially contributory stool pathogens (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, although the ESBL-producing DEC strain may not have accounted for the symptoms in all 12 TD cases, it probably contributed to some, especially the 3 in which ESBL-producing EAEC was the sole pathogen detected. Indeed, we have previously shown within the same cohort, in a 382-subject subgroup without antibiotic use, DEC strains to be significantly associated with TD (for EAEC: odds ratio [OR], 2.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.5–4.4]); for ETEC: OR, 5.9 [95% CI, 2.9−11.9]; and for EPEC: OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0−2.7]).

Abstract

Background

One-third of the 100 million travelers to the tropics annually acquire extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE), with undefined clinical consequences.

Methods

Symptoms suggesting Enterobacteriaceae infections were recorded prospectively among 430 Finnish travelers, 90 (21%) of whom acquired ESBL-PE abroad. ESBL-PE isolates underwent polymerase chain reaction–based detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) pathotypes (enteroaggregative E. coli [EAEC], enteropathogenic E. coli [EPEC], enterotoxigenic E. coli [ETEC], enteroinvasive E. coli, and Shiga toxin–producing E. coli), and extraintestinal pathogenic/uropathogenic E. coli (ExPEC/UPEC). Laboratory-confirmed ESBL-PE infections were surveyed 5 years before and after travel.

Results

Among the 90 ESBL-PE carriers, manifestations of Enterobacteriaceae infection included travelers' diarrhea (TD) (75/90 subjects) and urinary tract infection (UTI) (3/90). The carriers had 96 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, 51% exhibiting a molecular pathotype: 13 (14%) were DEC (10 EAEC, 2 EPEC, 1 ETEC) (12 associated with TD) and 39 (41%) ExPEC/UPEC (none associated with UTI). Of ESBL-PE, 3 (3%) were ExPEC/UPEC-EAEC hybrids (2 associated with diarrhea, none with UTI). Potential ESBL-PE infections were detected in 15 of 90 subjects (17%). The 10-year medical record survey identified 4 laboratory-confirmed ESBL-PE infections among the 430 travelers, all in subjects who screened ESBL-PE negative after returning home from their index journeys but had traveled abroad before their infection episodes.

Conclusions

Half of all travel-acquired ESBL-producing E. coli strains qualified molecularly as pathogens. Extraintestinal and uropathogenic pathotypes outnumbered enteric pathotypes (41% vs 14%), yet the latter correlated more closely with symptomatic infection (0% vs 92%). Despite more ESBL-PE strains qualifying as ExPEC/UPEC than DEC, travel-acquired ESBL-PE are more often associated with TD than UTI.

### Drug-resistant diarrheogenic Escherichia coli, Mexico [^c6681fa2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

DE were identified in 62 (14%) of 430 patients, the second highest proportion after that of rotavirus (41%). Other pathogens isolated were Shigella spp. (9%), Salmonella spp. (3%), Cryptosporidium spp. (0.9%), and Campylobacter spp. (0.7%). Of the 2,120 analyzed strains, 170 (8%) were positive for at least 1 DE gene. As shown in Table 1, ETEC was the most prevalent DE group isolated in patients, closely followed by EAEC (only characterized in the Villahermosa study) and then by atypical EPEC (aEPEC [eae A+ bfp –]). Most STEC strains were stx 2+ or stx 1+ eae A+, none expressed the O157 lipopolysaccharide antigen, and only 1 contained the hly A gene.

Table 1
Diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DE) isolated from patients with diarrhea

*ETEC, enterotoxigenic E. coli; EAEC, enteroaggregative E. coli; aEPEC, atypical enteropathogenic E. coli; STEC, Shiga toxin–producing E. coli; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; EIEC, enteroinvasive E. coli.
†All diarrheogenic E. coli strains isolated from patients with diarrhea; in general, 5 E. coli strains were isolated from each patient.

Antimicrobial resistance patterns for patients that had DE included 65% resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 73% to ampicillin (Table 2). Resistance to ≥ 3 antimicrobial drugs (multidrug resistance) was 58%. The antimicrobial resistance patterns for the strains were similar to the ones described above for the patients. Thus, of the 170 strains 105 (62%) were multidrug resistant, 145 (85%) were resistant to tetracycline, 124 (73%) to ampicillin, 127 (75%) to TMP-SMX, 29 (17%) to chloramphenicol, 4 (2%) to gentamicin, and none to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. Most isolated strains per patient showed similar susceptibility. Comparison of resistance patterns between patients belonging to different DE groups showed that aEPEC was significantly less resistant (p < 0.05, chi-square test) to ampicillin and TMP-SMX than ETEC and EAEC.

### Gnotobiotic piglet infection model for evaluating the safe use of antibiotics against Escherichia coli O157: H7 infection [^cb369163]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), especially O157:H7, cause bloody diarrhea, and in 3%-15% of individuals the infection leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or other complications. Use of antibiotics to treat STEC infections is controversial. Here, we describe the use of piglets to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of action of antibiotics in these infections.

Methods

The effects of 2 antibiotics on STEC toxin production and their mechanisms of action were first determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and subsequently evaluated clinically in the gnotobiotic piglet infection model.

Results

In vitro treatment of clinical and isogenic strains with ciprofloxacin increased the production of Stx2 via phage induction but not the production of Stx1. Azithromycin caused no significant increase in toxin production. After treatment with ciprofloxacin, infected piglets had diarrhea and the severe fatal neurological symptoms associated with Stx2 intoxication. Characteristic petechial hemorrhages in the cerebellum were more severe in ciprofloxacin-treated animals than in control animals. In contrast, azithromycin-treated piglets survived the infection and had little or no brain hemorrhaging.

Conclusions

The increased in vitro toxin production caused by ciprofloxacin was strongly correlated with death and an increased rate of cerebellar hemorrhage, in contrast to the effect of azithromycin. The piglet is a suitable model for determining the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics available to treat patients.

### Validation of treatment strategies for enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O104: H4 induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome: case-control study [^0e952906]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotic treatment

The use of antibiotics to treat enterohaemorrhagic E coli infection is controversial. In theory antibiotic treatment may lead to higher toxicity through an intestinal Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, with a massive release of shiga toxin through bacterial death during the prodromal phase of diarrhoea. This concept is supported by a mouse model with shiga toxin producing E coli, showing that treatment with fluoroquinolone resulted in a higher release of toxin and mortality. A report in 71 children with enterohaemorrhagic E coli O157:H7 induced diarrhoea described that five of nine children receiving antibiotics developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome compared with five of 62 children not receiving antibiotics. In our patient cohort, all but one medical centre did not use antibiotic treatment. In this centre patients were treated with a combination of at least two antibiotics sensitive to enterohaemorrhagic E coli (meropenem and ciprofloxacin and additionally rifaximin in patients on intensive care ward) after a diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. None of the patients treated with antibiotics developed signs of toxic shock. Enterohaemorrhagic E coli was eradicated about eight days earlier than in the other centres and the rates of seizures and mortality were improved. None of the patients required intestinal surgery. In this centre the lower incidence of seizures might also be explained by a more aggressive use of prophylactic antiepileptics in patients with neurological symptoms. Nevertheless, the results are encouraging as they suggest that the production and potential drug induced release of shiga toxin might be irrelevant and that pre-emptive antibiotics do not worsen the clinical course of established haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Moreover, in contrast with previous studies the antibiotic strategy was more aggressive. Patients simultaneously received at least two (many even three) antibiotics effective against enterohaemorrhagic E coli, which might have contributed to the beneficial outcome. As antibiotics seem to improve, but definitely do not worsen, the course of the infection we believe that they are beneficial in the later stages of the disease when the prodromal phase with diarrhoea has nearly subsided. Mice infected with different enterohaemorrhagic E coli O157:H7 strains have shown lower mortality and weight loss if treated with rifampicin compared with placebo. Therefore it could be speculated that a suitable antibiotic combination strategy at the onset of bloody diarrhoea in (enteroaggregative) enterohaemorrhagic E coli infections might even prevent the development of haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

### Structural basis of aggregative adherence fimbriae II interactions with sialic acid, mucin, and human intestinal cells [^a9720db5]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in the United States and the second most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. In 2011, a Shiga toxin-producing EAEC of serotype O104:H4 caused an international foodborne outbreak, resulting in 3,816 cases of gastroenteritis, 845 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and 54 deaths. EAEC also causes diarrhea in developing countries, with most children experiencing at least one episode by 2 years of age. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic EAEC infection correlates with growth faltering in children in developing settings. WHO estimated in 2021 that 149 million children worldwide experienced growth faltering, which leads to life-long deficits in growth, cognitive abilities, and socioeconomic potential. Inflammation is generally associated with growth faltering, but how EAEC contributes is obscure.

EAEC was first identified by a distinct adherence pattern to HEp-2 epithelial cells found to be mediated by the aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAFs), which are required for attachment to intestinal cells and the gastrointestinal mucosa. EAEC virulence factors are encoded on a virulence plasmid (pAA) and chromosomal islands, and expression of many of these factors, including AAF, is controlled by the transcriptional activator AggR. EAEC strains express one of five related AAF variants designated AAF/I–V. AAFs are chaperone-usher fimbriae related to the Dr family of adhesins. The structures of major and minor subunits of AAF types I, II, IV, and V have been reported. In a recent study that evaluated the prevalence of each AAF-type amongst EAEC strains collected in the Global Enteric Multi-Center Study across three geographical sites (Bangladesh, Mali, and Mozambique), AAF/I and AAF/IV were found to be the most common (23% and 22% of strains, respectively), with AAF/V (16%), AAF/III (9%), and AAF/II (8%) being less prevalent. AAF/II is produced by EAEC strain 042, which causes diarrhea in human volunteers. We have shown that AAF/II determines both the abundance and location (within the mucus layer) of EAEC 042 adherence to colonoids, an updated model system of the human gastrointestinal mucosa.

### Association of putative enteroaggregative Escherichia coli virulence genes and biofilm production in isolates from travelers to developing countries [^a3086bf4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an emerging enteric pathogen that causes acute and chronic diarrhea among children, human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, and travelers to developing regions of the world. The pathogenesis of EAEC strains involves the production of biofilm. In this study, we determined the association between presence of putative EAEC virulence genes and biofilm formation in 57 EAEC isolates (as defined by HEp-2 adherence) from travelers with diarrhea and in 18 EAEC isolates from travelers without diarrhea. Twelve nondiarrheagenic E. coli isolates from healthy travelers were used as controls. Biofilm formation was measured by using a microtiter plate assay with the crystal violet staining method, and the presence of the putative EAEC virulence genes aap, aatA, aggR, astA, irp2, pet, set1A, and shf was determined by PCR. EAEC isolates were more likely to produce biofilm than nondiarrheagenic E. coli isolates (P = 0.027), and the production of biofilm was associated with the virulence genes aggR, set1A, aatA, and irp2, which were found in 16 (40%), 17 (43%), 10 (25%), and 27 (68%) of the biofilm producers versus only 4 (11%), 6 (6%), 2 (6%), and 15 (43%) in non-biofilm producers (P = 0.008 for aggR, P = 0.0004 for set1A, P = 0.029 for aatA, and P = 0.04 for irp2). Although the proportion of EAEC isolates producing biofilm in patients with diarrhea (51%) was similar to that in patients without diarrhea (61%), biofilm production was related to the carriage of aggR (P = 0.015), set1A (P = 0.001), and aatA (P = 0.025). Since aggR is a master regulator of EAEC, the presence of aap (P = 0.004), astA (P = 0.001), irp2 (P = 0.0006), pet (P = 0.002), and set1A (P = 0.014) in an aggR versus an aggR-lacking background was investigated and was also found to be associated with biofilm production. This study suggests that biofilm formation is a common phenomenon among EAEC isolates derived from travelers with or without diarrhea and that multiple genes associated with biofilm formation are regulated by aggR.

### Treatment and prevention of enterococcal infections – alternative and experimental approaches [^8f3a5915]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Enterococci are one of the leading types of organisms isolated from infections of hospitalised patients and the third most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. They contribute significantly to patient mortality and morbidity, as well as healthcare costs. The emergence of resistance against virtually all clinically available antibiotics and the ability to transfer these resistance determinants to other pathogens demonstrates the urgency for an improved understanding of enterococcal virulence mechanisms, and the development of alternative treatment and prevention options. This article reviews new antimicrobials, vaccine targets, bacteriophage therapy, as well as treatments targeting virulence factors and biofilm, for their potential to treat and/or prevent enterococcal infections. Although clinical isolates often cause serious infections, so-called 'non-pathogenic' strains are used as therapeutics in the form of probiotics. Understanding the differences between true pathogens and beneficial commensals may help to evaluate future treatment and prophylactic options.

The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Comparative pathogenomics of: polyvalent vaccine target identification through virulome analysis [^b8fa1f3a]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Shiga-toxin-producing(STEC) strains have acquired the phage-associated Stx toxin. This pathotype is a foodborne illness that can produce a wide range of symptoms from asymptomatic to life-threatening hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Technically, pathogenic STEC strains that have the ability to cause disease in humans are called enterohemorrhagic(EHEC) and belong predominantly to seven serotypes, including the well-known O157:H7 serotype. In practice, however, the terms STEC and EHEC are used somewhat interchangeably, along with verotoxigenic(VTEC). In addition to the Stx toxin, the most prominent virulence factor found in these strains is the LEE pathogenicity island, which encodes intimin among other things. Other described virulence genes in the literature include espP, lpf, efa, toxB, eibG, ehaA, ompA, iha, and paa.

Enteroaggregative(EAEC) is an emerging diarrheagenic pathotype that is characterized by its "stacked-brick" adherence pattern on Hep-2 cells. This pathotype is a serious cause of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and traveler's diarrhea. EAEC can be asymptomatic, but during symptomatic infections the most common symptoms are watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

During an outbreak of bloody diarrhea in Europe in 2011, a new hybrid pathotype called enteroaggregative hemorrhagic(EAHEC) was described. All known members of this pathotype are EAEC strains of the O104:H4 serotype that have acquired the Stx phage.

Enterotoxigenic(ETEC) is a pathotype that gets its name for the plasmid-transmitted heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). These strains can carry one or both toxins. LT is similar to cholera toxin and has a similar mechanism of action. ST is a much smaller peptide that binds to guanylate cyclase to increase cyclic GMP in the small intestines. ETEC is the most common cause ofdiarrheagenic disease and the leading cause of traveler's diarrhea. It is also a major cause of acute infectious diarrhea, which accounts for an estimated 20% of all childhood deaths.

### Morbidity and mortality due to Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea: the global burden of disease study 1990–2016 [^814c2ab1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Although shigellosis occurs worldwide, the greatest burden is among children in low-income countries. Repeated infection is not uncommon because of the multiple serotypes associated with illness, and the decrease in the incidence of disease with increasing age shows that immunity eventually develops. Shigella is also a major cause of illness among travellers, deployed military personnel, and expatriates in LMICs, and is associated with persistent diarrhoea (≥ 14 days) in these populations. Among travellers, shigella and ETEC are associated with chronic functional bowel disorders among 10–15% of individuals after acute episodes of disease. Both pathogens can be associated with irritable bowel syndrome and shigella can also trigger reactive arthritis.

Both shigella and ETEC are important causes of diarrhoea and dysentery in people older than 5 years, with an estimated 100 million episodes occurring annually among those aged 5–14 years. Both agents also have epidemic potential in both younger and older age groups. Repeated infections and symptomatic episodes due to these pathogens can also induce or exacerbate stunting and other forms of malnutrition, reduce immune function, and increase the propensity for subsequent chronic inflammatory bowel disease. These infections can also hinder cognitive development, with adverse consequences on school performance and economic status. Oral rehydration salts and, when appropriate and available, antimicrobials are used as treatment. The rise of antibiotic-resistant enteric bacteria, particularly shigella, has made the prevention of infectious diarrhoea, and the need for an effective vaccine, an even greater public health priority.

Shigella and ETEC vaccine candidates are currently in various phases of research and development. ETEC and Shigella spp are antigenically diverse, encompassing two toxins and over 25 colonisation factors for ETEC, and 50 serotypes or subtypes for shigella, which makes the development of vaccines challenging. Efforts to develop vaccines for ETEC have focused on inducing antitoxin and anti colonisation antigen immunity, because studies show that antibodies against both antigen types can contribute to protection and thus have potential for vaccines. The most common colonisation factors associated with ETEC diarrhoea are CFA/I, CS3, and CS6. The basis of most shigella vaccines is the O-polysaccharide, which confers protective immunity that is specific to serotype and subserotype. The most common shigella serotypes are Shigella flexneri 2a, 6, 3a, and Shigella sonnei. Live attenuated, killed whole cell, and subunit vaccines containing various combinations and presentations of these antigens are in clinical development alone or as combined vaccines against shigella and ETEC.

Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in enteric infections are now observed across the globe in low-income and middle-income as well as high-income settings owing to global travel and overlapping social drivers. Pathogen-specific risk factors for spread are now also associated with specific AMR phenotypes and profiles. Several of the drivers of AMR intersect with risk factors for enteric infections and are preventable. Concerted focus on OneHealth prevention strategies for enteric infections and AMR are likely to be of significant benefit in optimizing public health outcomes.

Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Unitary tract infection treatment: when to use what agents including beta-lactam combination agents [^2fc255fa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the authors review antibiotic treatment options for both acute uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infection (UTI). In addition, they also review regimens used in the setting of drug-resistant pathogens including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacterals, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterals and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas, which are encountered with increasing frequency.

### Despite predominance of uropathogenic / extraintestinal pathotypes among travel-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, the most commonly associated clinical manifestation is travelers' diarrhea [^0c722e22]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In previous reports, most carriers of travel-acquired ESBL-PE strains have remained asymptomatic; symptomatic/clinical ESBL-PE infections have been considered rare, with UTI as the most common clinical manifestation. Our data suggest a theoretical maximum rate of 17% for any symptomatic ESBL-PE infection during travel (TD: 12 [13.3%]; UTI: 3 [3.3%]) among our 90 travelers with travel-acquired ESBL-PE.

We recognize we may have missed some cases in which ESBL-producing DEC caused TD but were no longer detected upon the subjects' return to Finland, since travel-acquired ESBL-PE sometimes disappear during travel (A. Kantele, unpublished observation). This may be more likely for certain DEC types than others; for example, EAEC apparently persists longer than ETEC. Likewise, because the posttravel stools were collected soon after return, we may have failed to capture some nonsevere cystitis and TD episodes, if symptoms developed only after stool sampling (ie, we may have detected the incipient pathogen during its latent/incubation phase, unaware that it later caused an infection). With respect to TD, since 12 of 13 subjects with ESBL-DEC had already reported TD during travel, data on (later-occurring) posttravel symptoms could theoretically have added at the most only the single subject who had not reported TD during travel.

Our theoretical maximum rate of 12 TD and 3 UTI cases caused by travel-acquired ESBL-PE among 90 colonized subjects contradicts the common view that UTI is the most frequent clinical consequence of such colonization. Indeed, although this is evidently the case in developed countries, our results — a novel observation — suggest that for travelers visiting tropical regions, TD outnumbers UTI as a clinical correlate of travel-acquired ESBL-PE. This appears logical as TD pathogens directly reach their target — ie, the intestinal mucosa — while the pathogenesis of UTI requires that the colonizing strains access the urinary tract.

All 3 strains with overlapping intestinal and extraintestinal pathotypes qualified as EAEC, an established association. Of note, we have not encountered an overlap between ExPEC/UPEC and other DEC pathotypes than EAEC. Although the selective forces that favor such EAEC-ExPEC/UPEC hybrid strains remain undefined, EAEC-related adhesins may confer both uroepithelial and enterocyte adherence, and EAEC can cause UTI.

Laboratory procedures.

Stool examination for white blood cells/red blood cells, ova, and parasites including Cyclospora was performed on a fresh stool specimen by direct stool microscopy at the two hospitals. Four swabs taken from the original stool sample were placed in modified Cary-Blair transport media. Stool was also saved in polyvinyl alcohol/formalin, and three aliquots of stool (∼1 g each) were cryopreserved and stored at –80°C at the Water Reed Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) Research Unit Nepal.

Stool from both sites was inoculated onto primary plating media and enrichment media for detection of enteric bacteria as described previously. Up to five lactose-fermenting and five non-lactose-fermenting E. coli colonies were isolated from each sample. Culture for Campylobacter was done using a Millipore filtration technique before and after enrichment, and samples were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37°C. Identification of bacterial enteropathogens Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio spp. Aeromonas spp. Plesiomonas shigelloides, Arcobacter, and Campylobacter spp. was performed by standard microbiological technique and biochemical testing.

Bacterial isolates were saved in a nutrient agar slant tubes and sent to AFRIMS in Thailand for confirmation, characterization, serotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Escherichia coli colonies were tested by DNA hybridization with specific digoxigenin-labeled polynucleotide probes for detection of diarrheagenic E. coli, ETEC, EAEC, enteroinvasive E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Shigella-like toxin-producing E. coli. Isolates of Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and diarrheagenic E. coli (ETEC, EAEC, EPEC) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to azithromycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and cefixime using the disk diffusion method. – These antibiotics are representative of classes of antibiotics available in Nepal.

Common intestinal parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium were also identified at AFRIMS using a commercial ELISA kit (ProSpecT; Remel, Lenexa, KS) on stool samples. Testing for rotavirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus was performed using a commercial ELISA (RIDASCREEN; R-Biopharm, Damstadt, Germany), and norovirus was tested by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction.

### Markers of inflammation in bacterial diarrhea among travelers, with a focus on enteroaggregative Escherichia coli pathogenicity [^e095aa9f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The intestinal inflammatory response of traveler's diarrhea acquired in Goa, India, and Guadalajara, Mexico, was studied. Fecal lactoferrin was found in stool samples in which enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli, or Salmonella or Shigella species were isolated, with Shigella-positive cases showing the highest level. Samples from cases of Shigella-associated diarrhea had the highest concentrations of fecal cytokines. Travelers to India who had EAEC-associated diarrhea showed elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-8 (median, 341.15 pg/mL) and IL-1beta (median, 749.90 pg/mL). Although 15 travelers to Mexico who had EAEC-associated diarrhea had a median concentration of 0 pg/mL for both IL-8 and IL-1beta, 2 had high levels of IL-8 (1853 and 11,786 pg/mL), and 5 showed elevated levels of IL-1beta (1–1240 pg/mL). Samples from patients in India who had pathogen-negative diarrhea or from patients in Mexico who had asymptomatic EAEC infection were negative for cytokines. Bacterial pathogens causing traveler's diarrhea commonly produce intestinal inflammation, although a subset of patients with EAEC-associated diarrhea fail to develop an inflammatory response.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^cc8e2034]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy

Empirical antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role in the effective management of IAIs; as inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with less favourable patient outcomes and the emergence of AMR, it is crucial to prescribe antibiotics correctly, with the right spectrum of activity, at the right time, for the right duration and with the right dosage. Optimizing antibiotic prescribing in the hospital setting results in improved treatment effectiveness and patient safety. This minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection and mitigates the risk of selecting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The growing emergence of MDR organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, particularly concerning Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial treatment should be started when a treatable infection has been recognized or strongly suspected. Misuse and abuse of antimicrobial agents, combined with the inappropriate application of infection prevention and control measures, are recognized as major drivers of the increasing prevalence of AMR.

AMR has become a global threat to public health systems in recent decades. Italy is ranked among the lowest-performing countries in AMR control in Europe by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), primarily due to alarmingly high levels of AMR observed in Italian hospitals. In January 2017 a team of experts in antimicrobial stewardship selected by the ECDC planned a four-day visit to Italy to investigate and evaluate the situation in the country regarding prevention and control of AMR. In the report drafted by the ECDC Committee, the experts highlighted the threat represented by the AMR, and the crucial necessity to design a national plan of action to address this burden.

In 2022, the ECDC published an interesting document evaluating the health impact of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA. The report, covering the period from 2016 to 2020, showed that the overall burden of infections attributed to AMR pathogens, adjusted for population size, was highest in Greece, Italy, and Romania. In Italy, an alarming pattern of resistance involving MDR and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has emerged in recent years, and multi-resistant Enterobacterales are now a major concern in daily clinical practice. This phenomenon may be partially attributed to a high average age of the population, predisposing to the development and spread of AMR. However, it is likely to be influenced by a poor perception of the AMR burden. Hence, there is a critical need to raise awareness among Italian healthcare workers regarding the importance of the management of infections, including IAIs.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Despite predominance of uropathogenic / extraintestinal pathotypes among travel-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, the most commonly associated clinical manifestation is travelers' diarrhea [^a855d04f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Extraintestinal and Combined Pathotypes

Of the 96 ESBL-producing E. coli fecal isolates, 39 (41%) qualified as ExPEC and/or UPEC, that is, presumptive extraintestinal pathogens (Table 1). Of these, 3 (8%) carried markers of combined intestinal and extraintestinal pathotypes (2 EAEC + ExPEC, 1 EAEC + ExPEC + UPEC).

Antibiotic Resistance Profiles

Among the 96 isolates, resistance was common to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, but rare or absent to carbapenems and nitrofurantoin (Table 3). Resistance prevalence, which varied significantly by pathotype for tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, was lowest among DEC isolates, intermediate among pathotype-negative isolates, and highest among ExPEC/UPEC-only isolates (P < .01 for all comparisons of DEC isolates vs ExPEC/UPEC-only isolates).

Phylogroups

Phylogroup distribution and extraintestinal virulence gene content varied significantly by pathotype (Table 4). Most non-ExPEC/UPEC isolates belonged to phylogroups A and B1, whereas nearly all ExPEC/UPEC isolates belonged to groups D and F. Likewise, STc10 predominated among non-ExPEC/UPEC isolates, whereas STc38, STc405, and STc648 predominated among ExPEC/UPEC isolates. Consistent with the virulence gene–based criteria for ExPEC and UPEC, all extraintestinal virulence genes studied were twice or more as prevalent among ExPEC/UPEC isolates as among non-ExPEC/UPEC isolates.

Although the use of CRP in the diagnosis and severity assessment of AD reached consensus in voting, willingness to adopt into clinical practice did not. After presenting the evidence in support for this strong recommendation, consensus was ultimately achieved upon live re-voting by both SAGES and EAES DCC participants. While 63% of surgeons surveyed reported not using CRP routinely in their practice, the majority were willing to implement this recommendation, which may be facilitated by the availability and low-cost of testing, and that it did not preclude replacing other diagnostic tests. On the other hand, the recommendation to use imaging selectively in the suspected diagnosis of AD, which was supported in voting, did not reach consensus with respect to change in practice, and even after two consecutive rounds of voting.

One notable topic of disagreement that also highlighted differences in opinion and clinical practice across both sides of the Atlantic is the role of antibiotics in non-complicated AD. Consensus was achieved by live re-voting among EAES members but not by SAGES members, even after presenting data from several multinational randomized controlled trials concluding that omission of antibiotics was safe and did not alter patient recovery nor complication rates. Reasons for this discrepancy that may be specific to North American surgeons including concerns over medico-legal repercussions of not "treating" patients with a diagnosis of AD, and reluctance to go against patient expectations with negative impact on future referrals. Another reason may be strong practice preferences that are difficult to change. Many physicians may consider that the benefits of antibiotics to largely outweigh the risks although in this age of increasing antibiotic resistance, public health considerations are of increasing importance. Similarly, although the recommendation against routine colonic evaluation after resolution of an uncomplicated episode of AD was supported in voting, consensus to adopt this recommendation in clinical practice was supported by EAES but not SAGES participants. While this recommendation follows typical practice in European nations, physicians may be reluctant to change practice in North America based on physician and patient expectations with respect to screening.

### Despite predominance of uropathogenic / extraintestinal pathotypes among travel-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, the most commonly associated clinical manifestation is travelers' diarrhea [^c6617307]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In 13 of 90 (14%) returning Finnish travelers with travel-acquired ESBL-PE, the strains were DEC (mainly EAEC), with a high associated TD attack rate (92%). By contrast, in 40% the strains represent ExPEC and/or UPEC, yet with no associated clinical disease (extraintestinal infection attack rate, 0%). The only potential index travel–associated extraintestinal ESBL-PE infections were 3 cases of cystitis, involving subjects whose travel-acquired ESBL-producing E. coli strain was neither ExPEC/UPEC nor DEC. Thus, among travel-acquired ESBL-PE strains, the most frequent pathotype is ExPEC/UPEC, yet pathotype-consistent clinical manifestations are more common among hosts colonized by DEC than ExPEC/UPEC strains. The maximum total rate of ESBL-PE infections among colonized individuals was estimated at 17%; instead of UTI, the most commonly associated clinical manifestation of travel-acquired ESBL-PE was diarrhea.

Background

Little is known about diarrhea etiology and antibiotic resistance in developing countries where diarrhea is a major public health problem.

Methods

To describe diarrhea etiology and antibiotic resistance patterns in Cambodia, 600 children aged 3 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea (cases) and 578 children without diarrhea (controls) were enrolled from a hospital in Phnom Penh. Stool samples were collected, and pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns were described.

Results

The most frequently isolated pathogens in these cases were enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (20%) and rotavirus (26%). Enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Shigella, Aeromonas, rotavirus, and adenovirus were statistically significantly associated with diarrhea. Among cases, vomiting was associated with viral infections, whereas bloody stool was associated with Shigella. Enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. Approximately 50% of Campylobacter coli and 30% of Campylobacter jejuni isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Over 33% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, and almost 100% of Shigella isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Conclusions

These data on the etiology of diarrhea and antibiotic resistance patterns in Cambodia will have significant effect on local public health policies and on local resource prioritization practices.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

Key points
- Most intestinal E. coliinfections can be managed symptomatically.
- Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.
- Early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure in children with STEC infection. Diagnosis E. coli infection is diagnosed when the bacteria are identified from the sample of a patient with an acute diarrheal illness. Treatment Hydration Most E. coli infections can be managed symptomatically. Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated. Evidence from studies of children with STEC O157 infection indicates that early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure. Antibiotics Antibiotics used to treat infection with diarrheagenic E. coli other than STEC include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifaximin.

Clinicians treating a patient whose clinical syndrome suggests STEC infection should be aware that administering antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Resistance to antimicrobials is increasing worldwide. The decision to use an antibiotic should be carefully weighed against the severity of illness, the possibility that the pathogen is resistant, and the risk of adverse reactions, such as rash, antibiotic-associated colitis, and vaginal yeast infection. Antimotility agents Antimotility agents should be avoided for patients with bloody diarrhea; treatment should be reassessed if symptoms have not improved in 48 hours. Antimotility agents also should not be given to patients with STEC infection because these agents may increase the risk of complications, including toxic megacolon, HUS, and neurologic complications. No known data show that kaolin-pectin compounds or lactobacillus slow diarrhea or relieve abdominal cramping. HUS diagnosis HUS is diagnosed using standard blood chemistry and blood count tests. HUS treatment HUS is treated with supportive care, including the management of fluids and electrolytes. In some cases, treatment may involve:

- Dialysis
- Transfusions of red blood cells, platelets, or both With good supportive care, most people with HUS recover completely. Outcomes are typically better for children than adults.

Methods

An extensive review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases, limited to the English language. The resulting information was shared by an international task force from 79 different countries combined in the AGORA (Antimicrobials: A Global Alliance for Optimizing their Rational Use in Intra-Abdominal Infections) project. The resulting document, detailing current knowledge and opinion, is presented in this position and consensus statement. The document is presented in light of the aim to facilitate clinical guidance in the rational use of antimicrobials for intra-abdominal infections.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.
