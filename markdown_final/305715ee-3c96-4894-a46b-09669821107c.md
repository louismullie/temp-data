## Question

What are the common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic framework for cannabis withdrawal in DSM-5. Then, I should verify the most frequently reported symptoms across high-quality reviews and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine the typical time course and peak severity. After that, I need to check prevalence estimates and risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful symptom profile and note special populations and differentials, making sure I cross-check each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor. DSM-5 recognizes cannabis withdrawal as a distinct syndrome requiring at least three characteristic symptoms developing within about one week after cessation or marked reduction of heavy, prolonged cannabis use, with symptoms causing clinically significant distress or impairment; the core symptom domains include irritability/anger/aggression, anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, appetite or weight disturbance, restlessness, depressed mood, and somatic symptoms such as headaches, sweating, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain [^1177wb3Z] [^114Mh7iQ].

> Now, I should verify which symptoms are most commonly reported in clinical and research populations. Multiple authoritative reviews converge on a consistent cluster: anxiety, irritability or anger/aggression, sleep disturbance (insomnia, vivid dreams), depressed mood, and decreased appetite or weight loss; less common but still recognized physical symptoms include chills, sweating, headache, physical tension, and abdominal pain, which aligns with DSM-5 somatic features and is repeatedly emphasized in clinical management summaries [^113NFYvp] [^116c8gbt].

> Wait, let me verify the time course so I don't overgeneralize. Onset typically occurs within 24–48 hours after cessation or substantial reduction, symptoms generally peak around days 2–6, and in heavy users may persist for 2–3 weeks or longer; some mood symptoms like anger or depressed mood can peak after two weeks, and sleep disturbances may continue for several weeks, which matches both observational and expert consensus descriptions [^113NFYvp] [^111WqZfm] [^112mE2Qb].

> I need to check prevalence and risk gradients to contextualize how "common" these symptoms are. A large meta-analysis of 23,518 participants found an overall pooled prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome of about 47% among regular or dependent users, with markedly higher rates in clinical samples: 17% in population-based cohorts, 54% in outpatient samples, and 87% in inpatient samples; risk is higher with daily use, comorbid tobacco or other substance use, and in those meeting criteria for cannabis use disorder, which is consistent across multiple analyses [^111TQe18] [^111oBbPh] [^113PUGug].

> Hold on, I should verify how these symptoms map back to DSM-5 domains to ensure diagnostic fidelity. The commonly reported symptoms fit squarely within DSM-5's required clusters: irritability/anger/aggression, anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, appetite/weight disturbance, restlessness, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as headache, sweating, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain; this mapping supports the clinical validity of the syndrome and guides screening and diagnosis in practice [^1177wb3Z] [^114Mh7iQ].

> But wait, what about special populations and clinical contexts where the presentation might differ or be overlooked. In adolescents and young adults, withdrawal symptoms are common and can be clinically significant, with prospective data showing high endorsement of restlessness, appetite change, and craving, and DSM-5-based withdrawal has been linked to earlier relapse in youth; in severe mental illness, abrupt cessation can precipitate agitation and worsening symptoms, and in perioperative settings, clinicians should anticipate withdrawal around days 3–5 and monitor with validated scales, given overlap with postoperative complications and potential need for short-term cannabinoid agonists in select cases [^113ye9Yk] [^113JZ9cG] [^116QFPCK] [^1149YJUK] [^111fqBs3].

> I should double-check the differential so we don't misattribute symptoms. Many cannabis withdrawal features are nonspecific and overlap with tobacco withdrawal, anxiety and mood disorders, and withdrawal from other substances; careful temporal linkage to cannabis cessation, exclusion of other substance withdrawal, and attention to comorbid psychiatric conditions are essential, and validated tools like the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist or Cannabis Withdrawal Scale can aid assessment, though heterogeneity across instruments should be acknowledged [^111zs8ei] [^111QHVf1] [^113VQ5zL].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure I haven't missed anything critical. Common cannabis withdrawal symptoms, in order of frequency and clinical salience, include anxiety, irritability or anger/aggression, sleep disturbance with insomnia or vivid dreams, depressed mood, decreased appetite or weight loss, restlessness, and somatic symptoms such as headache, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain; these typically begin within 24–48 hours, peak by days 2–6, and can persist 2–3 weeks in heavy users, with prevalence around 47% overall and substantially higher in clinical samples, especially with daily use and comorbid substance use [^113NFYvp] [^111WqZfm] [^111TQe18].

---

The most common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are **irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and depressed mood** [^113NFYvp], typically beginning within 24–48 hours [^113NFYvp] and peaking at days 2–6 [^111WqZfm]. Physical symptoms such as **headache, sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, and tremors** [^1149YJUK] are also reported [^113NFYvp]. Prevalence is about 47% among regular users [^111TQe18], with higher risk in daily users and those with comorbid substance use or psychiatric disorders [^113PUGug]. Symptoms usually resolve within 1–2 weeks [^112mE2Qb], but can persist longer in heavy or chronic users [^111WqZfm] [^113NFYvp].

## Common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are **well-documented** and typically fall into psychological, physical, and behavioral categories [^114Mh7iQ]:

| **Symptom category** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Psychological | - Irritability <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Depressed mood <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Craving for cannabis [^1177wb3Z] [^113NFYvp] |
| Physical | - Headache <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Tremors <br/> - Chills <br/> - Fatigue [^1149YJUK] [^113NFYvp] |
| Behavioral | - Sleep disturbances (insomnia, vivid dreams) <br/> - Decreased appetite <br/> - Difficulty concentrating <br/> - Aggression [^1177wb3Z] [^113NFYvp] |

---

These symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria [^1177wb3Z], which require at least three symptoms developing within one week of reduced cannabis use and causing significant distress or impairment [^1177wb3Z].

## Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms

The prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms varies by population and level of use. A meta-analysis of 23,518 participants found an overall pooled prevalence of **47%** among regular or dependent cannabis users [^111TQe18]. Prevalence is higher in clinical settings — 54% in outpatient samples and 87% in inpatient samples [^111oBbPh] — compared with 17% in population-based samples [^111TQe18]. Risk factors include daily cannabis use, comorbid tobacco or other substance use, and psychiatric comorbidity [^113PUGug] [^114kgj5a].

---

## Timeline of cannabis withdrawal symptoms

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms follow a **predictable timeline**:

- **Onset**: 24–48 hours after cessation or significant reduction in use [^113NFYvp] [^111WqZfm].
- **Peak**: Days 2–6, with symptoms typically intensifying during this period [^113NFYvp] [^111WqZfm].
- **Duration**: Most symptoms resolve within 1–2 weeks, though some may persist longer in heavy or chronic users [^113NFYvp] [^112mE2Qb].

---

## Factors influencing severity and duration

Several factors influence the **severity and duration** of cannabis withdrawal symptoms:

- **Frequency and quantity of use**: Daily or heavy use increases severity and duration [^113NFYvp] [^113Qz8nm].
- **Potency of cannabis**: Higher THC potency is associated with more severe withdrawal [^113EJNHa].
- **Comorbid substance use**: Tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use exacerbates symptoms [^111QHVf1].
- **Psychiatric comorbidity**: Anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders worsen withdrawal [^112nZzGh].
- **Genetic factors**: Genetic variation accounts for up to 50% of individual differences in withdrawal severity [^111WqZfm] [^1165a1dg].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are clinically significant because they can precipitate **relapse** and impair daily functioning [^113NFYvp]. Management is primarily supportive, including psychoeducation, behavioral therapies, and symptomatic medications for specific symptoms (e.g. sleep aids, **anxiolytics**) [^113EJNHa] [^1157Twre]. No medications are currently approved specifically for cannabis withdrawal, though **cannabinoid agonists (e.g. dronabinol)** have shown promise in reducing withdrawal severity [^116ENrL6] [^111fqBs3].

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are common and clinically significant, typically including irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and depressed mood, with physical symptoms such as headache, sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, and tremors [^113NFYvp] [^1177wb3Z] [^1149YJUK]. Symptoms usually begin within 24–48 hours, peak at days 2–6, and resolve within 1–2 weeks, though they may persist longer in heavy or chronic users [^1127LDCa] [^113Qz8nm].

Importance

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS)-a diagnostic indicator of cannabis use disorder-commonly occurs on cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use. To date, the prevalence of CWS syndrome has not been well described, nor have the factors potentially associated with CWS.

Objectives

To estimate the prevalence of CWS among individuals with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids and identify factors associated with CWS.

Data Sources

A search of literature from database inception to June 19, 2019, was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest, Allied and Complementary Medicine, and Psychiatry online, supplemented by manual searches of reference lists of included articles.

Study Selection

Articles were included if they (1) were published in English, (2) reported on individuals with regular use of cannabinoids or cannabis use disorder as a primary study group, (3) reported on the prevalence of CWS or CWS symptoms using a validated instrument, (4) reported the prevalence of CWS, and (5) used an observational study design (eg, cohort or cross-sectional).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

All abstracts, full-text articles, and other sources were reviewed, with data extracted in duplicate. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome prevalence was estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis model, alongside stratification and meta-regression to characterize heterogeneity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome prevalence was reported as a percentage with 95% CIs.

Results

Of 3848 unique abstracts, 86 were selected for full-text review, and 47 studies, representing 23 518 participants, met all inclusion criteria. Of 23 518 participants included in the analysis, 16 839 were white (72%) and 14 387 were men (69%); median (SD) age was 29.9 (9.0) years. The overall pooled prevalence of CWS was 47% (6469 of 23 518) (95% CI, 41%-52%), with significant heterogeneity between estimates (I2 = 99.2%). When stratified by source, the prevalence of CWS was 17% (95% CI, 13%-21%) in population-based samples, 54% in outpatient samples (95% CI, 48%-59%), and 87% in inpatient samples (95% CI, 79%-94%), which were significantly different (P < .001). Concurrent cannabis (β = 0.005, P < .001), tobacco (β = 0.002, P = .02), and other substance use disorders (β = 0.003, P = .05) were associated with a higher CWS prevalence, as was daily cannabis use (β = 0.004, P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that cannabis withdrawal syndrome appears to be prevalent among regular users of cannabis. Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of CWS in order to counsel patients and support individuals who are reducing their use of cannabis.

DEPENDENCE, WITHDRAWAL STATES AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Description

Cannabis withdrawal refers to symptoms that occur after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in the use of cannabis products containing Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis. These symptoms occur most often in regular and heavy cannabis users and the most common symptoms are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less commonly reported physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Cessation of short‐term cannabidiol (CBD), a non‐psychoactive cannabinoid, does not appear to result in withdrawal.

Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6. The duration and severity of cannabis withdrawal is associated with the amount of cannabis consumed before cessation, but can vary considerably. In heavy users withdrawal symptoms can occur for up to 2–3 weeks or longer.

Prevalence

A meta‐analysis pooling studies of more than 20 000 regular and dependent cannabis users estimated that 47% of individuals reported cannabis withdrawal measured by standardized scales. The prevalence in community samples was 17%, increasing to 54% in outpatient samples and 87% in inpatients.

The prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms is higher in users with a history of daily cannabis use, concurrent cannabis and tobacco use and other substance use disorders.

Objectives of management

Cannabis withdrawal does not carry a high risk of severe adverse outcomes. The presence of medical or psychiatric comorbidities such as polysubstance use and dependence may result in more severe complications and symptoms of cannabis withdrawal, necessitating additional management. The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that it may undermine abstinence by precipitating a relapse to cannabis use which immediately relieves these symptoms. Irritability and mood effects can also negatively impact personal relationships and work productivity.

Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are classed as new psychoactive substances (NPS) and are made in clandestine laboratories. Unlike cannabis, SCBs are a heterogeneous group that may contain multiple, typically synthetic compounds with broad structural diversity and are therefore not reviewed in this paper. SCBs can be 2–100 times more potent than THC, are more likely to result in problematic use and faster development of tolerance and potentially result in more severe withdrawal than natural cannabis. Their mechanisms and effects remain poorly understood.

Key Points

Questions

What is the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome among individuals with regular or dependent use of cannabis, and which factors are associated with cannabis withdrawal syndrome?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of observational studies including 23 518 participants, the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome was found to be 47%. Factors that were associated with higher cannabis withdrawal syndrome were clinical settings (particularly inpatient and outpatient vs population settings), concurrent tobacco or other substance use, and daily cannabis use.

Meaning

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome appears to be common among regular users of cannabis, particularly those in outpatient and inpatient settings and individuals with substance use disorders; clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome to counsel patients and support individuals who are reducing their use of cannabis.

### Review of the validity and significance of cannabis withdrawal syndrome [^1141tn4w]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The authors review the literature examining the validity and significance of cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Findings from animal laboratory research are briefly reviewed, and human laboratory and clinical studies are surveyed in more detail. Converging evidence from basic laboratory and clinical studies indicates that a withdrawal syndrome reliably follows discontinuation of chronic heavy use of cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol. Common symptoms are primarily emotional and behavioral, although appetite change, weight loss, and physical discomfort are also frequently reported. The onset and time course of these symptoms appear similar to those of other substance withdrawal syndromes. The magnitude and severity of these symptoms appear substantial, and these findings suggest that the syndrome has clinical importance. Diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal syndrome are proposed.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS

The management of substance withdrawal typically includes pharmacological agents which reduce clinically significant withdrawal symptoms. Cannabis does not have any approved medications for MAW, despite a well‐recognized and clinically significant withdrawal profile. A number of novel agents have been examined with some promising results (Table 2). This is an important avenue of future research, with some agents showing early efficacy. For this reason, cannabis agonists have been cautiously used 'off‐label' for cannabis withdrawal.

The mainstay of cannabis withdrawal management has been psychosocial education, supportive counselling and behavioural therapies. Despite the wide use of these approaches in clinical practice, few empirical studies have been conducted. These approaches need to be evaluated in controlled research settings. Given the heterogeneity of cannabis withdrawal features and substantial individual variations between patients, new developments in the management of cannabis use disorder and withdrawal are likely to include more targeted behavioural approaches (e.g.). The provision of increased on‐line and digital approaches to assist patients in managing cannabis withdrawal may improve accessibility and reduce costs, compared to face‐to‐face health services.

The legalization of non‐medical cannabis use in a number of high‐income countries has reduced cannabis prices and increased sales of high‐potency cannabis products in these jurisdictions. The cannabis industry is lobbying to reduce cannabis taxes, opposing restrictions on maximum THC levels and promoting the sale of high‐potency cannabis such as cannabis edibles, oils, extracts and waxes. Although the effects of these changes have not yet been formally evaluated, increased use of high‐potency cannabis is likely to increase the risks for CUD and the severity of withdrawal. Public health messaging should include independent information and advice on the risks of using higher‐potency cannabis.

### A review of the published literature into cannabis withdrawal symptoms in human users [^113uUWN5]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Recent experimental papers have been published suggesting the appearance of withdrawal symptoms upon the cessation of cannabis use in human users and proposing the introduction of a diagnostic category for such symptoms. Research also continues to be published into the physiological effects of cannabis on animals via self-administration paradigms and the use of cannabinoid antagonists. Animal research does not provide a clear picture of a consistent withdrawal effect. The literature on withdrawal symptoms appearing in human users following the cessation of cannabis is investigated in this paper to clarify this issue further and enhance the scientific and lay debate on the status of the drug. Methodological weaknesses in the literature are highlighted. These include variable levels of drug-dose administered in laboratory conditions, lack of controlled studies and the absence of definitions of the withdrawal syndrome sought. It is suggested that the studies conducted to date do not provide a strong evidence base for the drawing of any conclusions as to the existence of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome in human users, or as to the cause of symptoms reported by those abstaining from the drug. On the basis of current research cannabis cannot be said to provide as clear a withdrawal pattern as other drugs of abuse, such as opiates. However, cannabis also highlights the need for a further defining of withdrawal, in particular the position that rebound effects occupy in this phenomenon. It is concluded that more controlled research might uncover a diagnosable withdrawal syndrome in human users and that there may be a precedent for the introduction of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome before the exact root of it is known.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^113Qz8nm]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cannabis withdrawal is a well-characterized phenomenon that occurs in approximately half of regular and dependent cannabis users after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in cannabis products that contain Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This review describes the diagnosis, prevalence, course and management of cannabis withdrawal and highlights opportunities for future clinical research.

Methods

Narrative review of literature.

Results

Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6, with some symptoms lasting up to 3 weeks or more in heavy cannabis users. The most common features of cannabis withdrawal are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less common physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Despite limited empirical evidence, supportive counselling and psychoeducation are the first-line approaches in the management of cannabis withdrawal. There are no medications currently approved specifically for medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Medications have been used to manage short-term symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleep, nausea). A number of promising pharmacological agents have been examined in controlled trials, but these have been underpowered and positive findings not reliably replicated. Some (e.g. cannabis agonists) are used 'off-label' in clinical practice. Inpatient admission for MAW may be clinically indicated for patients who have significant comorbid mental health disorders and polysubstance use to avoid severe complications.

Conclusions

The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that its symptoms may precipitate relapse to cannabis use. Complicated withdrawal may occur in people with concurrent mental health and polysubstance use.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177wb3Z]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cannabinoids are the most commonly used group of illicit drugs, and cannabis use and dependence are estimated to have increased over the past 2 decades. Despite common perceptions that cannabis is relatively harmless, there is substantial evidence to support an association between cannabis use and several medical, neurocognitive, functional, and psychosocial sequalae. The known short-term risks of cannabinoid use include impaired short-term memory and motor coordination, altered judgment, paranoia, and psychosis. Similarly, long-term effects of cannabinoid use include addiction, altered brain development, poor educational outcomes, cognitive impairment, diminished quality of life, increased risk of chronic respiratory tract and psychotic disorders, injuries, motor vehicle collisions, and suicide.

In parallel with other substance withdrawal syndromes, a cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS) — originally proposed by Budney and colleagues, — has received recognition in recent years. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome symptoms occur reliably following a specific time course with cessation of cannabis use, were transient, could be ameliorated by readministration of cannabis, and were clinically significant. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome was recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and requires the presence of at least 3 of the following symptoms developing within 7 days of reduced cannabis use: (1) irritability, anger, or aggression; (2) nervousness or anxiety; (3) sleep disturbance; (4) appetite or weight disturbance; (5) restlessness; (6) depressed mood; and (7) somatic symptoms, such as headaches, sweating, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

Several studies using varied approaches have characterized CWS, and resulting prevalence estimates have ranged from 11.1% to 94.2%. Hence, although there is concern about the risks associated with cannabinoid use and CWS, to our knowledge, there currently exists no comprehensive quantitative synthesis of the magnitude of risk and how elevated that risk might be relative to the general population among people with regular or problematic cannabinoid use.

The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the prevalence of CWS and identify contributors to heterogeneity in reported results. We sought to produce age-specific and sex estimates of CWS prevalence where possible.

### The marijuana withdrawal syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^112NFfY1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

A subset of marijuana smokers develop a cannabis use disorder and seek treatment for their marijuana use on their own initiative. A less well-known consequence of daily, repeated marijuana use is a withdrawal syndrome, characterized by a time-dependent constellation of symptoms: irritability, anxiety, marijuana craving, decreased quality and quantity of sleep, and decreased food intake. Treatment studies show that rates of continuous abstinence are low (comparable to relapse rates for other abused drugs), and more treatment options are needed. The objective of this review is to update clinicians on the current state of marijuana research and to describe features of marijuana withdrawal to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of cannabis use disorders.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^1117UcxH]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannabis dependence

Individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) generally experience greater severity and duration of cannabis withdrawal symptoms than those without CUD. This is most probably related to the greater frequency and quantity of their cannabis use and their heavier exposure to THC. CUD is characterized by persistent cannabis use despite negative effects on the social functioning and physical or mental health of the user or the health of other individuals. Two diagnostic systems classify and define the severity of the disorder: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)‐5 and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐11. CUD severity is coded in DSM‐5 as mild (presence of two to three symptoms), moderate (presence of four to five symptoms) or severe (presence of six or more symptoms). ICD‐11 classifies cannabis use into hazardous cannabis use (potential to cause harm), harmful pattern of cannabis use (causing harm) and cannabis dependence.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^111zs8ei]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal severity

In most instances, cannabis withdrawal is not severe and does not have a high risk of severe adverse outcomes. Medical or psychiatric comorbidities increase the risk of severity and the requirement for additional management. Cannabis withdrawal severity can be evaluated by a clinical examination of the number and intensity of DSM‐5 or ICD‐11 cannabis withdrawal features and by administering standardized measures of cannabis withdrawal. Unlike symptoms of other substance use disorders (SUDs), DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 assess only the presence or absence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms, rather than their severity. The most clinically relevant criterion is the degree of patient distress or impairment in functioning. This can be assessed both subjectively (e.g. anxiety, sleep quality) and objectively (e.g. weight loss, fever).

The two most widely used cannabis withdrawal scales are the 16‐item marijuana withdrawal checklist (MWC), a revised version of the original 22‐item scale, and the 19‐item cannabis withdrawal scale (CWS; see Supporting information). Both the MWC and CWS were developed before DSM‐5. There is considerable overlap of features between DSM‐5 and MWC and CWS, but not complete concordance. An adaption of the MWC, the 14‐item composite withdrawal scale (WDS), corresponds more closely with cannabis withdrawal symptoms described in the DSM‐5. By comparison with other substance withdrawal scales (e.g. alcohol withdrawal scale), there has been limited psychometric validation of the various cannabis withdrawal scales.

Differential diagnosis

Because many cannabis withdrawal symptoms are not specific to cannabis, a differential diagnosis needs to determine if they are better explained by withdrawal from another substance (e.g. tobacco or alcohol) or are symptoms of a comorbid mental disorder or medical condition.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UpLf7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome appears to be common among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids, with an overall pooled prevalence of 47% in this meta-analysis. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome was more common in men, participants from clinical samples, individuals with comorbid drug or tobacco use, and those with a higher level of cannabis use. Clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of CWS and should consider screening for CWS, particularly among those who are at greater risk, in order to counsel patients and support individuals who are reducing their use of cannabis.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114y2e7F]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis identified 50 studies that examined the prevalence of CWS. Overall, it was estimated that nearly half (47%) of all people with regular or dependent cannabinoid use will experience cannabis withdrawal. Other factors associated with CWS included study setting; concurrent tobacco, cannabis, and drug use disorders; and intensity of cannabis use. We did not find CWS to be associated with sex, age, race/ethnicity, or psychiatric comorbidity. The quality of the literature was rated as being fair for the majority of studies considered.

Many professionals and members of the general public may not be aware of cannabis withdrawal, potentially leading to confusion about the benefits of cannabis to treat or self-medicate symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders. For example, when medical marijuana clients were asked about actual symptom relief, fewer than half report such relief, while othersreported return of anxiety symptoms on cessation of use, suggesting the symptoms might be due to cannabis withdrawal. Because many CWS criteria are depression or anxiety symptoms, regular users may seek cannabis to obtain short-term symptom relief, unaware that this use could perpetuate a longer-term withdrawal problem.

Clinicians should be aware of CWS as it is associated with clinically significant symptoms, which can trigger resumption of cannabis use and serve as negative reinforcement for relapse during a quit attempt. The clinical significance of CWS is shown by the fact that it can be impairing, that cannabis or other substances are used to relieve it, by its association with trouble quitting use, and by its negative prognostic association. The clinical significance of CWS is also supported by epidemiologic evidence, as studies involving latent variable modeling have shown that adding withdrawal to other CUD criteria improves model fit. Personality traits, psychiatric comorbidity, age at onset, level of cannabis use, severity of cannabis dependence, and concurrent drug and alcohol use have been proposed as other risk factors that may play a role in increasing risk of cannabis relapse following a quit attempt.

### Are specific dependence criteria necessary for different substances: how can research on cannabis inform this issue? [^1121DgWb]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Research on cannabis dependence is used to comment on the similarities and differences among the substance dependence disorders, and to address the issue of whether specific versus generic substance dependence diagnostic criteria might offer the most fruitful approach to diagnosis. If cannabis dependence can be diagnosed and characterized adequately using the extant generic Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) dependence criteria, then one could argue that these diagnostic guidelines are valid and of high utility for substances with more well-accepted dependence syndromes.

Methods

A brief, selective critical review of research on cannabis withdrawal and on the validity and internal consistency of cannabis dependence as assessed via DSM criteria for cannabis dependence was performed.

Results

Findings from these reports indicate that cannabis dependence is much more similar to than different from other types of substance dependence, even with regard to withdrawal. The generic DSM-IV dependence criteria can be applied fairly well to cannabis, and yield findings similar to that observed with other substance dependence disorders. However, across substances, the generic criteria may not discriminate cases in a manner consistent with the underlying constructs of abuse and dependence, and cross-substance differences probably exist in the general dependence severity level and specific symptom profiles.

Conclusions

The use of generic DSM-IV criteria appears to work as well for cannabis dependence as for other substances, yet the more important question might be as to whether we can do better by developing more sophisticated generic criteria or by using substance specific criteria.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^111WqZfm]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

GOLD‐STANDARD CURRENT PRACTICE

Setting and rationale for inpatient/outpatient

Inpatient admission is rarely required for uncomplicated medically assisted withdrawal (MAW). Supervised or inpatient treatment for withdrawal should be considered if the patient is a polysubstance user and has a history of complicated withdrawal from these other substances. If exacerbation of a mental health condition is likely to produce major functional impairment, or increase the risk of self‐harm, supervised inpatient MAW should also be considered. Medical oversight is recommended for patients with medical conditions that may be adversely affected by substance withdrawal. Individuals who have been unable to manage their cannabis use in an outpatient setting should be considered for inpatient support.

Time‐frame

The onset of cannabis withdrawal symptoms typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation of use. The early phase of withdrawal is usually characterized by insomnia, irritability, decreased appetite, shakiness and, less often, sweating and chills. These early symptoms are most likely to peak at days 2–6. They improve as THC levels reduce over 7 days of abstinence. Anger and aggression and depressed mood may occur as early as 1 week into cannabis withdrawal but typically peak after 2 weeks of abstinence (Figure 1). Sleep disturbances may continue for several weeks or longer.

FIGURE 1
Typical course of cannabis withdrawal.

THC‐COOH is generally associated with severity of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome, as measured by scores on the MWC. Future research studies may determine if THC‐COOH levels can more precisely guide the management and duration of cannabis withdrawal. Figure 1 displays typical reductions in mean daily creatinine‐normalized THC‐COOH levels after abstinence in heavy, chronic cannabis users.

There is a large amount of variation in the course and severity of cannabis withdrawal. Some patients who report low levels of cannabis use and few CUD symptoms (e.g. only two to three DSM‐5 criteria) report uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that significantly impair their day‐to‐day functioning. There are limited empirical data on the degree to which individual differences in physical, psychiatric or metabolic factors contribute to cannabis withdrawal severity. Up to 50% of between‐individual differences in cannabis withdrawal can be attributed to genetic variation. Some studies of recreational and regular cannabis users and those seeking treatment report that females may experience more severe cannabis withdrawal symptoms than males, even when matched for cannabis use and other demographic characteristics.

### The international cannabis toolkit (iCannToolkit): a multidisciplinary expert consensus on minimum standards for measuring cannabis use [^112mE2Qb]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstinence can be associated with stress, withdrawal and strong cravings in frequent users. Withdrawal symptoms typically onset between 2 and 3 days, peak after 2 to 6 days and last for 4 to 14 days. This time course is consistent with the reversal of cannabinoid receptor downregulation in PET imaging studies.
'In the past month, on how many days have you used cannabis?' (Record n days/month from: never, 0 to 30)

This item is a brief assessment of frequency of cannabis use. It is similar to items with established validity and reliability in quantifying frequency of alcohol use, for example, item 1 of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test: 'How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?' with answers including, never; monthly or less; 2 to 4 times a month; 2 to 3 times a week; 4 or more times a week. This item enables a full range of cannabis use frequencies to be reported by the individual, allowing a more fine grained understanding of cannabis exposure, such as how the number of days of cannabis use are associated with problematic use.

In line with international monitoring recommendations from the EMCDDA, we classify 'daily or near‐daily use' as 20 + days per month (i.e. daily or near daily use). Use on 20 + days a month is strongly indicative of high risk use because ~32% of daily users meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, (DSM‐5) criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD). When this universal item is used, ratings of frequent use (20 + days per month) warrant a more detailed assessment of their cannabis use (setting‐specific measures) and associated health effects.

### Cannabis based medicines and cannabis dependence: a critical review of issues and evidence [^1127LDCa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

A specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome – one aspect of dependence – is well-recognised and affects around 50% of daily users and typically begins 1–2 days after cessation, peaks at 2–6 days and remits at 1–2 weeks. Prominent symptoms include craving, sleep problems, nightmares, anger, irritability, dysphoria and nausea. This can be precipitated by the Cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) receptor antagonist rimonabant. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms in humans correlate with reductions in brain CB1 receptor availability during acute abstinence.

Cannabis, THC and dependence

The main cannabinoid with psychoactive properties is THC, which was made a Schedule 1 drug under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as it has the capacity to produce a state of dependence. A wealth of pharmacological evidence supports the role of THC as the addictive agent within cannabis. THC produces the effects that recreational cannabis users seek; they report liking it and wanting more and this increases with acute THC dosage. In addition, cannabis with higher THC content (for example, 5% versus 2%) produces stronger reinforcement in human choice paradigms. THC binds to the CB1 receptor to exert its psychoactive effect and CB1 receptor antagonists have been found to precipitate withdrawal in mice that have been exposed to THC. In addition, studies have found that acute administration of THC is reinforcing in humans whether or not CBD is co-administered. As the reinforcement of drug use is considered to be one component in the transition from voluntary to compulsive use, these findings suggest that cannabis with high THC content increases vulnerability to dependence. Indeed, clinically, increases in the number of new entrants into treatment for cannabis use disorder have followed increases in THC potency. The risk of recreational cannabis dependence is more common with high potency THC strains with a low CBD content, large amounts consumed, high frequency use (heavy, daily) and with starting use early in adolescence.

### Cannabis withdrawal predicts severity of cannabis involvement at 1-year follow-up among treated adolescents [^111FC356]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Controversy exists regarding the inclusion of cannabis withdrawal as an indicator of dependence in the next revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This study contrasted the concurrent and predictive validity of three operational definitions of cannabis withdrawal in a sample of treated adolescents.

Design

Prospective study of treated adolescents with 1-year follow-up.

Setting and Participants

Adolescents (n = 214) were recruited from intensive out-patient treatment programs for substance abuse, and followed at 1 year (92% retention). Youth who were included in the analyses reported regular cannabis use.

Measurements

The number of DSM-IV cannabis abuse and dependence symptoms at baseline and 1-year follow-up, past year frequency of cannabis use at baseline and follow-up, and periods of abstinence at 1-year follow-up. Cannabis withdrawal was defined based on (i) the presence of two or more cannabis withdrawal symptoms; (ii) a definition proposed by Budney and colleagues (2006) that requires four or more withdrawal symptoms (four-symptom definition); and (iii) the use of latent class analysis to identify subgroups with similar cannabis withdrawal symptom profiles.

Findings and Conclusions

All three definitions of cannabis withdrawal demonstrated some concurrent validity. Only the four-symptom and latent class-derived definitions of withdrawal predicted severity of cannabis-related problems at 1-year follow-up. No cannabis withdrawal definition predicted frequency of use at follow-up. Further research is needed to determine the clinical utility and validity of the four-symptom definition, as well as alternative definitions of cannabis withdrawal, to inform revisions leading to DSM-V and ICD-11.

Table 2.
Subgroup Analyses of Factors Associated With Cannabis Withdrawal Syndrome Prevalence

Abbreviations: CUD, cannabis use disorder; CWS, cannabis withdrawal syndrome; DSM-III-R, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition-Revision; DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition; DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition; NA, not applicable.

We used meta-regression to explore potential variables that may have accounted for the high heterogeneity observed for CWS prevalence (Table 3; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Several methodologic features of studies and participant characteristics were significantly associated with CWS prevalence in meta-regression. The prevalence of CWS was higher with greater proportions of participants who reported daily cannabis use (β = 0.004, P < .001), had cannabis use disorder (β = 0.005, P < .001), had comorbid tobacco use (β = 0.002, P = .02), and had comorbid drug use (β = 0.003, P = .05).

Table 3.
Meta-regression Analyses of Factors Associated With Prevalence of Cannabis Withdrawal

We explored the association of each study with pooled estimates via sensitivity analysis with leave-out-one meta-analysis, allowing the removal of each study from the evaluation. This analysis did not change the pooled prevalence of CWS substantially.

The potential for publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and by applying rank correlation tests, Egger tests, and the trim and fill method (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The results did not suggest any evidence to support that a significant bias existed within this review.

Of the 50 studies, most (36 [72%]) had an overall rating of fair quality, while 2 studies (4%) were rated as good and 12 studies (24%) were rated as poor (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The most frequently met quality criteria were ascertainment of exposure, reported by 36 studies (72%), and comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis, reported by 26 studies (52%). A number of items were inconsistently completed, including demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study, which was reported by 3 studies (6%), and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts, with rates of attrition and complete follow-up reported by 7 studies (14%).

### Cannabis withdrawal in the United States: results from NESARC [^114kgj5a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Although cannabis is the most widely abused illicit drug, little is known about the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal and its factor structure, clinical validity, and psychiatric correlates in the general population.

Method

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions participants were assessed, in 2001–2002, with structured in-person interviews covering substance history, DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders, and withdrawal symptoms after cessation of use. Of these, 2613 had been frequent cannabis users (≥ 3 times/week), and a "cannabis-only" subset (N = 1119) never binge-drank or used other drugs ≥ 3 times/week.

Results

In the full sample and subset, 44.3% (SE = 1.19) and 44.2% (SE = 1.75), respectively, experienced ≥ 2 cannabis withdrawal symptoms, while 34.4% (SE = 1.21) and 34.1% (SE = 1.76), respectively, experienced ≥ 3 symptoms. The symptoms formed 2 factors, one characterized by weakness, hypersomnia, and psychomotor retardation and the second by anxiety, restlessness, depression, and insomnia. Both symptom types were associated with significant distress/impairment (p < .01), substance use to relieve/avoid cannabis withdrawal symptoms (p < .01), and quantity of cannabis use (among the cannabis-only users p < .05). Panic (p < .01) and personality (p > .01) disorders were associated with anxiety symptoms in both samples, family history of drug problems was associated with weakness symptoms in the subset (p = .01), and depression was associated with both sets of symptoms in the subset (p ≤ .05).

Conclusion

Cannabis withdrawal was prevalent and clinically significant among a representative sample of frequent cannabis users. Similar results in the subset without polysubstance abuse confirmed the specificity of symptoms to cannabis. Cannabis withdrawal should be added to DSM-V, and the etiology and treatment implications of cannabis withdrawal symptoms should be investigated.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WiYSC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

We screened a total of 3848 unique citations, of which 86 were screened in full, and 47 were included in the review (Figure 1), reporting on 50 unique cohorts. In total, 23 518 participants were represented across cohorts (median [SD] age, 29.9 [9.0] years; 16 839 white [72%]; and 14 387 men [69%]). Twenty-five cohorts (50%) were of treatment-seeking individuals. Most of the cohorts came from North America (38 [76%]), Australia (7 [14%]), or Europe (6 [12%]) (Table 1). Participants in included sources were obtained from primarily clinical samples (inpatient: 7 [14%] and outpatient: 28 [56%]) or population-based samples (15 [30%]). Individual cohorts varied widely in size (12–2613). Reporting of cohort demographics was incomplete; for example, fewer than half of the cohorts reported the baseline cannabis intake. Eighteen cohorts reported the percentage who had experienced lifetime CWS, and the remaining 32 reported current (past year) CWS prevalence.

Figure 1.
PRISMA Flowchart of Study Selection

Search and selection process applied during the systematic review.

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome was identified by a variety of clinician-administered instruments (including the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale), self-reported rating scales (including the Marijuana Withdrawal Symptom Checklist), and semistructured clinical interviews (involving the Time-Line-Follow-Backand the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM). Across studies, the specific instruments used were the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Schedule, the Customary Drinking and Drug Use Record, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module, the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale, the Marijuana Quit Questionnaire, the Marijuana Withdrawal Symptom Checklist, the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM, and the Time-Line-Follow-Back.

Need for pre‐detoxification harm reduction

Cannabis pre‐detoxification harm reduction strategies are not well studied and there is no standard practice. As with other substances, an incremental and slow reduction in cannabis intake and/or use of lower THC products over an extended period (weeks) may reduce the probability and severity of withdrawal symptoms.

Risks/benefits

There are few risks related directly to cannabis withdrawal. The greatest risk is relapse. Previously highlighted in this review is elevated risk of polysubstance use and concurrent withdrawal from higher‐risk substances. If cannabis withdrawal exacerbates depression (± suicide), anxiety and psychosis, then risks are increased and more regular monitoring and delay in detoxification may be clinically indicated. All medications carry risk of side‐effects. Consideration should be given to the potential side‐effects of using pharmacotherapies that are largely untested in this population, compared to the temporary uncomfortable withdrawal period.

Non‐pharmacological interventions

To our knowledge, there are no high‐quality studies on the most effective behavioural approaches and no studies that compare the effectiveness of behavioural and pharmacological approaches to managing withdrawal. Most pharmacological studies of withdrawal include some form of concurrent behavioural intervention, but the differential efficacy of these behavioural approaches has not been assessed (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Pharmacotherapy studies for cannabis withdrawal

A 12‐week single‐arm cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) study randomly assigned 13 regular cannabis users to selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors (SSRI) or placebo. It found no significant differences on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) scores (adapted for cannabis) between patients who relapsed and those who did not. Changes in CIWA scores in response to CBT were not reported nor any differences between those given SSRI or placebo.

Despite limited evidence, standard clinical practice typically includes psychoeducation on the course and symptoms of withdrawal, coping with craving exercises, nutrition, hydration, physical exercise and sleep hygiene. It can also include motivational approaches and coping skills training. Skills training in CBT such as relaxation approaches, pleasant activity scheduling, managing stress/mood/anger and goal‐setting may be of clinical benefit.

Physical exercise has been associated with improved scores in the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire — short form (MCQ‐SF) in a pilot study (n = 10) of non‐treatment‐seeking, cannabis‐dependent adults. Standard sleep hygiene protocols and CBT‐insomnia (CBT‐I) may improve sleep in cannabis withdrawal, but this has not been well studied.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus guidelines on the management of the perioperative patient on cannabis and cannabinoids [^1149YJUK]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative cannabis withdrawal symptoms (CWS) — presentation, risk stratification, and monitoring: Cannabis withdrawal symptoms (CWS) can occur in the postoperative period, with the DSM-5 criteria including the abrupt cessation of prolonged or heavy cannabis use accompanied by three or more symptoms including irritability or anger, anxiety, insomnia, decreased appetite, restlessness, altered mood and a physical symptom causing significant discomfort such as abdominal pain, tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache. Symptoms of CWS can occur 24 to 72 hours after cannabis cessation, peak in the first week, and can last up to 2 weeks. A Canadian panel of experts suggested that there should be a high index of suspicion for cannabis withdrawal postoperatively in patients who consume greater than 1.5 g/day of inhaled cannabis or 20 mg/day THC-dominant cannabis oil, and patients consuming a cannabis product with an unknown phytocannabinoid content more than 2–3 times per day are at risk for cannabis withdrawal. Cannabis users who are at risk for withdrawal should be monitored for cannabis withdrawal postoperatively, the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale can be used to monitor the severity of the withdrawal symptoms, and hospitalized withdrawal can manifest as disrupted sleep, inadequate pain control, changes in opioid use, agitation, restlessness, and early discontinuation of treatment. Regular cannabis use is associated with a down-regulation and desensitization of cortical and subcortical CB1 receptors, which begins to reverse after 24–48 hours of abstinence before returning to normal in approximately 4 weeks. The panel states that CWS may present in the postoperative period, that highest risk patients are those consuming high quantities or unknown amounts of THC containing products, and that risk is considered to be less with CBD dominant (≥ 10:1 CBD to THC) products (Level of certainty: Moderate).

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis use disorder [^115gDT27]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (a problematic pattern of cannabis use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress). This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in May 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal and/or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who are likely to be dependent.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: 1) abstinence at the end of treatment; 2) intensity of withdrawal including craving; 3) nature, incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and 4) severe AE (SAE); 5) withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects and whether the planned medication regimen was modified in response to adverse effects; 6) completion of scheduled treatment. Important outcomes were: 1) cannabis use at the end of treatment; 2) number of participants engaged in further treatment; 3) economic outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias in results included in meta-analyses using the risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) tool.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effect meta-analysis where possible. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we reported results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 37 RCTs (3201 participants). Most were undertaken in the United States (29), Australia (4), Israel (2), Canada (1) and the United Kingdom (1), mainly recruiting adults (mean age 22–41 years), with four studies only including young people (mean age 17–21 years). In 32 studies, most of the participants were male (56–92%). Five studies targeted participants with comorbidities (depression (2), bipolar disorder (1), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1)). Eleven studies received study medicines from the manufacturing company and none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Thirty-six studies compared active medications and placebo; one study compared four active medications. Medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the potential for synthesis.

Synthesis Of Results

Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.52; 4 studies, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; 2 studies, 270 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may be no more likely with cannabidiol (RR 2.23, 95% CI 0.54 to 9.32; 1 study, 68 participants; low-certainty evidence) or with anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.92; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence), when compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain. AE and SAE. There was probably little to no difference in the likelihood of AEs in participants treated with THC preparations (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 5 studies, 507 participants), cannabidiol (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 2 studies, 57 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.07; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.11; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.13; 4 studies, 331 participants) or oxytocin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.47; 1 study, 16 participants) (both low-certainty evidence), compared with placebo. SAE may be no more likely with THC preparations (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.9; 7 studies, 584 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.33; 2 studies, 418 participants), PF-04457845 (RR 4.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 99.48; 2 studies, 298 participants), compared with placebo (all low-certainty evidence). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was more likely with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.86; 5 studies, 257 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. There may be little to no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations (RR 1.77, 95%CI 0.4 to 7.85; 5 studies, 507 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.03 to 12.53; 2 studies, 418 participants) compared with placebo (both low-certainty evidence). We found that completion of treatment was probably not more likely with cannabidiol (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 92 participants), anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03; 6 studies, 407 participants), N-acetylcysteine (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23; 2 studies, 418 participants), or PF-04457845 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; 2 studies, 298 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in participants treated with THC (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; 7 studies, 582 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all the clinically-important pharmacotherapies investigated and, for half of their outcomes, the quality of the evidence was low (44%) or very low (11%). Given the limited evidence of efficacy, those pharmacotherapies should still be considered experimental for treating cannabis use disorder. The greater withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects seen with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may limit their therapeutic value.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^115fLRg8]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal assessment

Cannabis is commonly used with tobacco, and in treatment‐seeking cannabis users approximately two‐thirds also use tobacco. Tobacco withdrawal symptoms overlap with cannabis withdrawal and may have a similar intensity and time‐course. Table 4 outlines the withdrawal features observed in this complex case and possible management. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be considered during the withdrawal period and post‐detoxification if the patient desires to quit nicotine.

TABLE 4
Complex case: observed and self‐report symptoms and possible management

The decision to recommend inpatient admission or outpatient withdrawal in this presentation relies upon an accurate assessment of the brief psychotic episodes and their potential impact on the patient's functioning. Withdrawal from other substance use that may increase risk of adverse outcomes (e.g. alcohol other CNS depressants, opioids) is not present. The patient denies suicidal thoughts, but reports dysthymic mood that is typical for him. He states that his cannabis use is heavier at night in an attempt to improve his sleep, and ceasing use has impaired sleep quality. He reports that his partner of 15 years is highly supportive of his cessation attempt and committed to a substance‐free relationship.

The patient reported a preference for home detoxification. He attended with his partner, who reports that they can monitor him closely over the next 5 days. The patient consented to attending primary care appointments daily over the next week. The main management approach to consider is a cannabinoid agonist (e.g. nabilone, off‐label) that could be slowly titrated upwards. If probable cannabis‐related withdrawal psychosis persists, inpatient withdrawal is indicated. Quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic) was introduced in this consultation for review over the following 5 days.

The patient and his partner were provided with psychoeducation on: the course and symptoms of withdrawal, exercises to cope with craving, nutrition, hydration, physical exercise and sleep hygiene. Basic skills in relaxation approaches and managing anger and aggressive behaviour were reviewed in the consultation. Admission to a CBT‐based outpatient relapse prevention programme was recommended and a referral provided.

Figure 2.
Prevalence of Cannabis Withdrawal in People With Cannabis Use Disorder

Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms across 3 clinical settings: population-level samples, outpatient clinical samples, and inpatient clinical samples. The studies by Smith et al (2013), Mennes et al (2009), and Vorspan et al (2010) included 2 or more substudies.

When stratified by study setting, the prevalence of CWS in population-based samples was 17% (95% CI, 13%-21%; n = 15 studies; n = 17 475 participants), 54% in outpatient samples (95% CI, 48%-59%; n = 28 studies; n = 5684 participants), and 87% in inpatient samples (95% CI, 79%-94%; n = 7 studies; n = 357 participants). The difference between these groups was statistically significantly different (χ 2 = 0.172, P < .001) (Table 2). Significant heterogeneity existed within the estimates for population-based samples (I 2 = 98%), outpatient-based samples (I 2 = 92%) and inpatient-based samples (I 2 = 74%). The subgroup analysis based on sex did not find any differences in the prevalence of CWS among men (27%) compared with women (26%) (χ 2 = 0.172, P = .99). Similarly, there was no association between CWS prevalence and age, race/ethnicity, method of CWS ascertainment, method of CUD diagnosis, comorbid alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric disorder, or geographic region. Furthermore, CWS estimates were significantly higher among studies measuring lifetime rather than current CWS prevalence (χ 2 = 0.314, P < .001), among cohort studies rather than cross-sectional surveys (χ 2 = 0.194, P < .001), and among studies involving participants who were seeking treatment compared with those who were not (χ 2 = 446.32, P < .001).

Psychiatric comorbidity

There is a well‐documented dose–response relationship between the level of cannabis use, CUD and psychiatric comorbidity. A differential diagnosis therefore requires assessment of concurrent mental health disorders, symptoms of which may be exacerbated by or mimic cannabis withdrawal. In a national stratified Australian sample, 70% of adults who met CUD criteria in the past year had at least one other psychiatric disorder. In US national surveys, having a CUD in the past 12 months is associated with increased risk of post‐traumatic stress disorder [PTSD; odds ratio (OR) = 4.3], personality disorder (OR = 4.8), mood disorders (OR = 3.8) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.8). Heavy cannabis use increases psychosis risk, and cannabis use worsens symptoms of schizophrenia.

Physical comorbidities

It is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive description of physical conditions that should be considered in a differential diagnosis for cannabis withdrawal. As cannabis withdrawal symptoms can mirror other physical disorders, a comprehensive medical review with an emphasis on gastrointestinal and neurological systems is recommended.

Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the extent of analysis. Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other pharmacotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported. Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N-acetylcysteine (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence) or with N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin, oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### A genetic perspective on the proposed inclusion of cannabis withdrawal in DSM-5 [^1165a1dg]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Various studies support the inclusion of cannabis withdrawal in the diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) in the upcoming DSM-5. The aims of the current study were to (1) estimate the prevalence of DSM-5 cannabis withdrawal (criterion B), (2) estimate the role of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in cannabis withdrawal and (3) determine the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on cannabis withdrawal overlap with those on DSM-IV-defined abuse/dependence.

Method

The sample included 2276 lifetime cannabis-using adult Australian twins. Cannabis withdrawal was defined in accordance with criterion B of the proposed DSM-5 revisions. Cannabis abuse/dependence was defined as endorsing one or more DSM-IV criteria of abuse or three or more dependence criteria. The classical twin model was used to estimate the genetic and environmental influences on variation in cannabis withdrawal, along with its covariation with abuse/dependence.

Results

Of all the cannabis users, 11.9% met criteria for cannabis withdrawal. Around 50% of between-individual variation in withdrawal could be attributed to additive genetic variation, and the rest of the variation was mostly due to non-shared environmental influences. Importantly, the genetic influences on cannabis withdrawal almost completely (99%) overlapped with those on abuse/dependence.

Conclusions

We have shown that cannabis withdrawal symptoms exist among cannabis users, and that cannabis withdrawal is moderately heritable. Genetic influences on cannabis withdrawal are the same as those affecting abuse/dependence. These results add to the wealth of literature that recommends the addition of cannabis withdrawal to the diagnosis of DSM-5 CUD.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^1157Twre]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Medication use in clinical practice

No medications have been shown to be effective in MAW in randomized controlled trials (Table 2). In clinical practice, short‐term symptomatic medications have been used for (a) non‐specific general cannabis withdrawal syndrome features and (b) for specific withdrawal symptoms (e.g. sleep, nausea, anxiety, appetite stimulation) to improve patient comfort and retention during withdrawal (Table 3). As with all prescribing, a comprehensive medical, medicine and drug and alcohol use history should guide the use and doses of these medications. All medications have side‐effects and these need to be balanced against potential benefits from their unknown efficacy in this population.

### Perioperative cannabis use in bariatric patients: a review of outcomes and proposed clinical pathway for management [^1141HykV]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of cannabis withdrawal typically occur within 24–72 hours of cessation and peak within the first week of cessation. The diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal according to the DSM-V include three or more symptoms (irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, restlessness, depressed mood, abdominal pain, fevers, headache, tremors, diaphoresis) causing significant distress. Cannabis withdrawal may present similarly to common post-operative complications, such as anastomotic leak or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, it is important to maintain a high level of suspicion for other post-operative complications and test for them as indicated.

Components of cannabis interact with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and may potentiate or attenuate the effects of important medications including warfarin, direct-acting oral anticoagulants, clopidogrel, as well as other antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, and anti-depressants. Published case reports show cannabis may inhibit the metabolism of warfarin leading to increased plasma concentrations and bleeding risk. Cannabidiol inhibits CYP2C19, an isoenzyme responsible for the transformation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. This could result in subtherapeutic levels metabolite and possibly increased risk of stroke. Larger studies are warranted to better understand the mechanisms behind the drug-drug interactions.

In 2023, the ASRA analyzed current literature and offered consensus recommendations graded A-D, based on the present level of evidence. Recommendations graded A or B offer a high certainty of substantial (A) or moderate (B) benefit to patients. Grade A recommendations included universal screening before surgery (including type of product used, last consumption, route, frequency of use), postponement of surgery in patients with altered mental status suggesting acute cannabis intoxication, and counseling frequent users of the negative effects on post-operative pain control. Notably, moderate evidence exists to suggest that smoking cannabis may have deleterious effects on airway resistance and adverse respiratory events; however, no Grade A or B recommendations were made to suggest smoking cannabis should preclude patients from elective surgery. This data suggests all patients should be screened for cannabis use but an individualized approach should be employed for those undergoing general anesthesia who use cannabis. Special consideration may be had for patients who have concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^113d3yUH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Adolescent and young adult substance use — psychosis risk and early management highlights that psychosis risk is relevant across substances and especially with cannabis; longitudinal studies note that early-onset cannabis use before age 16 years, chronic/persistent, high-frequency, and high–THC potency can precipitate or exacerbate psychosis, and meta-analyses conclude heavy cannabis use increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Caution is warranted in assigning a new psychotic diagnosis during substance withdrawal because symptoms can last for weeks to months after discontinuation, and when symptoms are observed only in intoxication or withdrawal they are likely to diminish and disappear within a week to a month of abstinence; the recommendation in the first month of abstinence is to recognize and treat these symptoms with cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT)–based approaches and supportive medications for withdrawal symptoms and monitoring, rather than giving a separate psychiatric diagnosis with pharmacological treatment. Observational studies and clinical trials show that mental health problems increase with increased alcohol and cannabis use and that abstinence from and reduction in alcohol and cannabis use are associated with improvements in mental health symptoms, including in youth.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HVXEN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) or its equivalent (ie, cannabis dependence with or without cannabis abuse) was analyzed as defined by the study authors using varying criteria sets, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th Revision, with or without the use of interview guides, such as the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interviewor the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM. The overall proportion of participants with CUD was 34.7% (n = 8275). In population studies, estimates ranged from 8% to 34%. In outpatient-based samples, estimates ranged from 30% to 74%. In inpatient-based samples, estimates ranged from 72% to 98%.

Meta-analysis identified that the overall pooled prevalence of CWS in patients with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids was 47% (95% CI, 27%-37%). There was significant heterogeneity observed in this estimate (I 2 = 99.2%, P < .001; 50 studies; n = 23 518), with proportions of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.13–0.20) for population, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.49–0.59) for inpatient, and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.93) for inpatient (Figure 2). The range of CWS across studies varied from 8% to 100%.

### Cannabis withdrawal and psychiatric intensive care [^116QFPCK]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Cannabis use is common in people with severe mental illness and its adverse effects on outcomes are well established. However, adverse outcomes may also result from cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS). CWS includes symptoms such as agitation, irritability, and aggression, and typically peaks after 3 to 5 days of abstinence.

Objective

To assess whether cannabis use prior to admission is associated with an increase in the risk of transfer to a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) during the cannabis withdrawal risk period.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used clinical data from a secondary mental health care database and took place at 4 psychiatric hospitals in London, United Kingdom, between January 2008 and December 2023. Patients included adults admitted to general psychiatric wards and PICUs. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to February 2025.

Exposure

Cannabis use was determined from clinical records, using natural language processing and manual review.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was transfer from a general ward to PICU during the cannabis withdrawal risk period (3 to 5 days after presentation to the hospital). Secondary outcomes included admission to PICU at any time point. Outcomes were analyzed according to cannabis use status with multivariable models, which adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, tobacco use, stimulant use, comorbid alcohol or substance use disorder, and admission year.

Results

There were 52 088 hospital admissions identified, of which 4691 involved admission to a PICU (9.0%). Cannabis users were more likely to be admitted to a PICU than nonusers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.33–1.55; P < .001). There were 1236 admissions where the patient was transferred to PICU after initial admission to a general ward (mean [SD] age, 33.4 [10.4] years; 810 male [66%] and 426 female [34%]). At 3 to 5 days postpresentation (the risk period for cannabis withdrawal), transfer from a general ward to a PICU was more common in cannabis users (31.0%) than nonusers (24.2%) (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.81; p = 0.04). The association was particularly evident in women (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.22–3.39; p = 0.007) and in those older than 35 years (aOR, 2.53; 95%CI: 1.52–4.21; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

People with severe mental illness who are cannabis users may develop cannabis withdrawal syndrome shortly after hospital admission, and this can exacerbate their mental state.

POST‐DETOXIFICATION PROGNOSIS

In prospective clinical studies in adults and adolescents with CUD the presence and severity of cannabis withdrawal does not predict cannabis use after completion of MAW. However, Davis et al. found that adolescents who met DSM‐5 criteria for cannabis withdrawal relapsed to cannabis use sooner than those who did not meet DSM‐5 criteria. More studies with larger patient numbers are required to confirm these findings. Regular cannabis users subjectively report that withdrawal symptoms reduce their desire to abstain from cannabis.

### Cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^117SUqEM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Psychiatric and dependence-related effects of cannabis — chronic cannabis use carries long-term psychiatric risks, which may be correlated with cumulative exposure including age of first use, and may be associated with an increased risk for developing depressive disorders and may exacerbate psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Ten percent of adults with chronic cannabis use may also develop cannabis use disorders, associated with clinically significant impairment or distress, including using more cannabis than expected and difficulty in cutting back on use. Outside of oncology, a randomized trial found that participants who received a medical cannabis card had an almost two times greater incidence (17% versus 9%) of developing cannabis use disorder within 12 weeks than controls without a medical cannabis card. Clinicians should also recognize that long-term daily cannabis users may experience non–life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after cessation of cannabis, with symptoms that usually occur within 3 days after cessation and may last up to 14 days.

### Relief of cannabis withdrawal symptoms and cannabis quitting strategies in people with schizophrenia [^116zkwnx]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

This study examined the response to cannabis withdrawal symptoms and use of quitting strategies to maintain abstinence in people with schizophrenia. A convenience sample of 120 participants with schizophrenia who had at least weekly cannabis use and a previous quit attempt without formal treatment were administered the 176-item Marijuana Quit Questionnaire to characterize their "most serious" (self-defined) quit attempt. One hundred thirteen participants had withdrawal symptoms, of whom 104 (92.0%) took some action to relieve a symptom, most commonly nicotine use (75%). 90% of withdrawal symptoms evoked an action for relief in a majority of participants experiencing them, most frequently anxiety (95.2% of participants) and cannabis craving (94.4%). 96% of participants used one or more quitting strategies to maintain abstinence during their quit attempt, most commonly getting rid of cannabis (72%) and cannabis paraphernalia (67%). Religious support or prayer was the quitting strategy most often deemed "most helpful" (15%). Use of a self-identified most helpful quitting strategy was associated with significantly higher one-month (80.8% vs. 73.6%) and one-year (54.9% vs. 41.3%) abstinence rates. Actions to relieve cannabis withdrawal symptoms in people with schizophrenia are common. Promotion of effective quitting strategies may aid relapse prevention.

Polysubstance use

People with a CUD are more likely to use other substances. In nationally representative US surveys, people with a CUD in the past 12 months were six times more likely to have an alcohol use disorder and nine times more likely to have another drug use disorder. Three in four cannabis users seeking treatment for a CUD will have another SUD. Because of the high prevalence of comorbid substance use and dependence, it is important to know if the patient only wants to cease cannabis use, or some or all of the substances that they use. In outpatient settings the patient may prefer to continue to use other substances. There are insufficient studies to decide whether it is better to withdraw from multiple substances sequentially or concurrently. In an inpatient setting, all non‐prescribed substances are usually stopped.

Withdrawal from other substances (whether prescribed or recreational) can produce similar symptoms to cannabis withdrawal. For example, opiate and alcohol withdrawal can produce irritability, anger or aggressive behaviour, shakiness, insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood, decreased appetite and weight loss, headache, sweating or chills, abdominal cramps and muscle aches. In the case of alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens, this is a medical emergency. A key tool in a differential diagnosis is the cessation of cannabis use with 24–48 hours of onset and an improvement in symptoms after 4–7 days of abstinence, with careful assessment of other substance use and abstinence patterns.

We know little about interactions between the effects of cannabis and other drugs, but polysubstance use may increase the severity of withdrawal. Cannabinoid receptors are major targets, directly or indirectly, for many drugs of abuse including prescription analgesics, but interactions between these drugs are poorly understood. Additive intoxication and withdrawal effects may occur when cannabis is combined with central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcohol and opioids (e.g. drowsiness, ataxia) and some benzodiazepines or new psychoactive substances (NPS). Patients who co‐use tobacco and cannabis report more withdrawal symptoms than those who use cannabis without tobacco. A clinical priority should be to identify which substances have been used and to manage the withdrawal symptoms of the highest‐risk substances or substance combinations.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^114Mh7iQ]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurobiological evidence

The cannabis plant contains approximately 120 cannabinoids, the most studied of which are THC and CBD. The body's own endogenous cannabinoids act as partial agonists of the body's CB1 and CB2 receptors, as does THC, whereas CBD acts as an allosteric modulator of these receptors. The psychoactive effects of THC are underpinned by its strong affinity for CB1 receptors, which are predominantly distributed within the brain. CB1 antagonists, such as rimonabant, reduce the subjective effects of cannabis, demonstrating the role of CB1 binding in the psychoactive effects of cannabis use. THC has a much lower affinity for the CB2 receptor that is predominantly found in immune cells. Conversely, CBD has a stronger affinity for the CB2 receptor, but has a relatively much lower affinity for either receptor than THC.

There are endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitters in humans and other animals. The best‐characterized are anandamide (AEA) and 2‐arachidonoylglycerol (2‐AG). These endocannabinoids are degraded by enzymes that include fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) for anandamine and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) for 2‐AG. THC is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. FAAH binding is reduced in chronic and recent cannabis users, and inhibition of FAAH using PF‐04457845 has been shown to reduce cannabis withdrawal.

There is good neurobiological and clinical evidence for a pharmacologically specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome. CB1 antagonists precipitate specific withdrawal symptoms in animal models of cannabis dependence. In human studies, administration of CB1 agonists (THC) blocks or relieves withdrawal symptoms. Neurobiological and clinical studies indicate that symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are consistent with the core symptoms of other substance withdrawal syndromes and reflect neurochemical changes in the limbic system.

Cannabis withdrawal criteria DSM‐5 and ICD‐11

Withdrawal was included as a distinct disorder and as a CUD diagnostic criterion item in DSM‐5. Cannabis withdrawal is also included in ICD‐11 (Table 1).

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111WShY9]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The finding that the prevalence of CWS was substantially higher in clinical populations — particularly inpatient samples — is consistent with the notion of a bidirectional association between cannabis use and mental health disorders. This finding is compatible with previous reviews, which have consistently reported that one-third of regular cannabis users in the general population, and 50% to 95% of heavy users in treatment or research studies, report symptoms of CWS. This finding may indicate that people with CWS are more likely to present to clinicians for help compared with those without CWS, notwithstanding the fact that CWS can be diagnosed and untreated. Whether there is an interaction or cumulative association between CWS prevalence and rates of presentation for clinical care is speculative at this point and requires further study. With this in mind, if CWS reflects underlying CUD pathologic factors, it may be an indication of underlying addictive burden and increase the likelihood of people being in clinical care as opposed to having CUD in the community without clinical support. The association between CWS and CUD may also be related to the central theories of substance initiation, whereby cannabinoids may be used to self-medicate psychiatric symptomsor may precipitate or aggravate existing mental health conditions.

Several studies have attempted to determine the best tools for diagnosing CWS, but there has generally been poor correlation between rating scales. Despite within-sample heterogeneity, CWS prevalence estimates were similar irrespective of ascertainment method in our study. Stratification of CWS ascertainment methods did not reconcile heterogeneity in prevalence estimates; however, this does not mean that all CWS instruments are equal. Until there are methodologic guidelines and consensus on the best tools to screen for CWS, to our knowledge, these are the most comprehensive available data. The treatment of CUD is particularly challenging because there are no efficacious medications currently available, even with cannabinoid replacement therapies, such as nabilone, nabiximols, or dronabinol.

### Cannabis withdrawal in chronic cannabis users with schizophrenia [^1179oose]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic users of cannabis often report withdrawal symptoms after abstinence from use, but little is known about cannabis withdrawal in people with schizophrenia.

Methods

Cannabis use patterns and withdrawal symptoms in adults with schizophrenia who had at least weekly cannabis use before attempting to quit without formal treatment were assessed with the Marijuana Quit Questionnaire (MJQQ), a 176-item, semi-structured questionnaire.

Results

120 participants, predominantly African-American (62.5%) and male (76.7%), met inclusion criteria. 20.1% reported that their first regular cannabis use (median age 15 years [range 8–48]) preceded their age at first psychotic symptoms (20 [4–50] years). Twenty (16.7%) participants met lifetime criteria for cannabis abuse; 98 (81.7%) met surrogate criteria for lifetime cannabis dependence. Withdrawal symptoms were reported by 113 (94.2%) participants, with 74.2% reporting ≥ 4 symptoms. The most frequently reported withdrawal symptoms were craving for cannabis (59.2%), feeling anxious (52.57%), feeling bored (47.5%), feeling sad or depressed (45.8%), feeling irritable or jumpy (45.0%), feeling restless (43.3%), and trouble failing asleep (33.3%). One hundred-and-four (92.0%) participants took some action to relieve at least one of their withdrawal symptoms during their index-quit attempt, including 26 (23.0%) participants who reported resuming cannabis use.

Conclusion

Cannabis withdrawal is a clinically significant feature of cannabis use among people with schizophrenia, may serve as a negative reinforcer for relapse, and deserves greater attention in treatment and research. Clinical Trials registration NCT00679016.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^116ENrL6]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannabis withdrawal pharmacotherapy

There are no medications approved to manage the cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Research on MAW has increased during the past 15 years, but remains less developed than for other drugs of abuse.

Nineteen placebo‐controlled studies (17 Clinical; two experimental) and one open‐label, non‐placebo controlled trial have been reported (Table 2). Sixteen were randomized designs. Fewer than half (n = 9) report cannabis withdrawal (or individual cannabis withdrawal symptoms) as a primary outcome and only three recruited more than 50 participants in the medication arm, two of which found a significant benefit from medication over placebo (dronabinol, quetiapine). Attrition among the 17 clinical studies was typically greater than a third of the sample.

In the studies that used standardized measures of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome, six reported greater improvement in those given a cannabinoid medication than placebo (dronabinol, quetiapine, nabiximols, gabapentin, oral THC). Ten studies did not. This included trials of bupropion, FAAH inhibitor PF‐04457845 for the majority of the withdrawal period, lithium, dronabinol and lofexidine, bupropion, nabiximols, extended‐release zolpidem, guanfacine, escitalopram and nabilone. Some medications produced greater reductions in individual symptoms of cannabis withdrawal (e.g. zolpidem extended‐release improved some features of sleep, nabilone reduced craving and anxiety) than placebo. This was not true in all cases (e.g. divalproex did not reduce irritability, depression and anxiety and topiramate did not improve mood).

The research on medications for MAW in treatment‐seeking, cannabis‐using populations is limited by the small number and low quality of studies. Larger replication studies are required to test the efficacy of agents that have shown promising results in small studies. MAW largely treats its symptoms with agents known to reduce them, but many of these drugs have not been well studied in people with CUD and their off‐label use is of uncertain efficacy and safety.

### Progression of cannabis withdrawal symptoms in people using medical cannabis for chronic pain [^113zp317]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Research from cohorts of individuals with recreational cannabis use indicates that cannabis withdrawal symptoms are reported by more than 40% of those using regularly. Withdrawal symptoms are not well understood in those who use cannabis for medical purposes. Therefore, we prospectively examined the stability of withdrawal symptoms in individuals using cannabis to manage chronic pain.

Design, Setting, Participants

Using latent class analysis (LCA) we examined baseline cannabis withdrawal to derive symptom profiles. Then, using latent transition analysis (LTA) we examined the longitudinal course of withdrawal symptoms across the time points. Exploratory analyses examined demographic and clinical characteristics predictive of withdrawal class and transitioning to more or fewer withdrawal symptoms over time. A cohort of 527 adults with chronic pain seeking medical cannabis certification or re-certification was recruited between February 2014 and June 2015. Participants were recruited from medical cannabis clinic waiting rooms in Michigan, USA. Participants were predominantly white (82%) and 49% identified as male, with an average age of 45.6 years (standard deviation = 12.8).

Measurements

Baseline, 12-month and 24-month assessments of withdrawal symptoms using the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist-revised.

Findings

A three-class LCA model including a mild (41%), moderate (34%) and severe (25%) symptom class parsimoniously represented withdrawal symptoms experienced by people using medical cannabis. Stability of withdrawal symptoms using a three-class LTA at 12 and 24 months ranged from 0.58 to 0.87, with the most stability in the mild withdrawal class. Younger age predicted greater severity and worsening of withdrawal over time.

Conclusions

Adults with chronic pain seeking medical cannabis certification or re-certification appear to experience mild to severe withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms tend to be stable over a 2-year period, but younger age is predictive of worse symptoms and of an escalating withdrawal trajectory.

### The prevalence of cannabis withdrawal and its influence on adolescents' treatment response and outcomes: a 12-month prospective investigation [^116MyUPQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal, a diagnostic indicator of cannabis use disorder, is often minimized or ignored as a consequence of cannabis use, particularly among adolescents. This study aims to characterize cannabis withdrawal among adolescents in outpatient treatment for substance use disorder and evaluate the clinical significance of withdrawal as a predictor of substance-related outcomes.

Methods

Adolescent outpatients (N = 127) reporting cannabis as their drug of choice (n = 90) were stratified by the presence of withdrawal and compared on demographic and clinical variables at treatment intake. Hierarchical linear models compared the effect of withdrawal on percentage days abstinent (PDA) and related outcomes over a 1-year follow-up period.

Results

Adolescents reporting withdrawal (40%) were more likely to meet criteria for cannabis dependence, have higher levels of substance use severity, report more substance-related consequences, and have a mood disorder. Withdrawal was not associated with PDA over the follow-up period; however, this relationship was moderated by problem recognition such that adolescents reporting withdrawal and a drug problem improved at a greater rate with respect to PDA than those who did not recognize a problem with drugs and did not report withdrawal.

Discussion

Withdrawal is common among adolescent outpatients and is associated with a more clinically severe profile. In this sample, all adolescents reporting withdrawal met criteria for cannabis dependence, suggesting that withdrawal is a highly specific indicator of cannabis use disorder. Although withdrawal does not seem to be independently associated with substance use outcomes posttreatment, moderating factors such as drug problem recognition should be taken into account when formulating treatment and continuing care plans.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VQ5zL]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

There are a number of strengths of this study. First, to our knowledge, this is the largest systematic review of cannabis withdrawal among people with CUD, and the first meta-analysis. Second, the quality of the majority of studies evaluated was fair. However, this study has limitations that should be considered in the appraisal of the evidence presented by this review. The largest limitation is the wide range of tools used to define CUD and CWS, which contributed to the large heterogeneity across studies. While the broad spectrum of included studies likely contributed to heterogeneity, the inclusion of only validated rating scales may have mitigated the heterogeneity somewhat. Although sex proportions were reported in overall samples, sex-specific prevalence estimates were only reported by a subset of studies (n = 15). As this is a study-level meta-analysis, a limitation of the methods is that individual-level characteristics were not explored. There was also limited representation of studies from all geographic regions, with only 1 study from South America and none from Africa; this limitation hampered our ability to estimate the prevalence of CWS across all continents. However, our subgroup analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in prevalence of CWS across the regions evaluated, which suggests that geographic regions may not play a substantial role in estimating CWS prevalence. There was also limited information about CWS in specific patient subgroups. There are other issues that are likely to influence CWS, which could not be addressed in this meta-analysis, including the changing products that are being used, which may affect tolerance, dependence, and CWS. However, this information is not available in most clinical studies to date. There was also a lack of individual-level analyses, which may be considered as another limitation of this study. In addition, few studies reported the amounts of concurrent substance use or cannabinoid levels in bodily fluids (eg, urine and blood), precluding a more focused analysis on the association between these measures and CWS prevalence.

### Cannabis withdrawal syndrome: an important diagnostic consideration in adolescents presenting with disordered eating [^115XSzpa]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Although previously thought to have no withdrawal symptoms, there is now convergent evidence for a cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS), criteria for its diagnosis, and evidence of its impact in the adolescent population. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome represents an important and under-recognized consideration in adolescents with disordered eating. We describe three clinical cases of adolescents presenting to an eating disorders program with primary complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms, food avoidance, and associated weight loss. They did not meet the criteria for an eating disorder, but did fulfill the DSM-5 criteria for CWS. This report emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of heavy cannabis use in adolescents presenting with gastrointestinal complaints, and eating disorder symptoms, including weight loss.

### Prospective assessment of cannabis withdrawal in adolescents with cannabis dependence: a pilot study [^113ye9Yk]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively identify and assess withdrawal symptoms in adolescents with cannabis dependence.

Method

Twenty-one adolescents ages 13 to 19 years voluntarily entering residential and day/outpatient substance abuse programs, with cannabis dependence as their only current substance of dependence, were assessed using the Teen-Addiction Severity Index, Substance Use Survey, Cannabis Withdrawal Scale, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Childhood Diagnoses Substance Use Disorders Module. Weekly assessments continued for 4 weeks. Thirteen youths attained a minimum of 2 weeks of abstinence.

Results

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms were present in adolescents. Cannabis withdrawal was greatest in the first 2 weeks of abstinence with evidence that it continued well into week 3. Most withdrawal symptoms were endorsed with a high degree of frequency. Those symptoms endorsed with the greatest severity were restlessness, appetite change, and thoughts of and cravings for cannabis, with the highest ratings occurring in week 1. Over the course of the study, participants reported fewer symptoms with decreasing levels of severity. Youth ratings of overall severity of withdrawal were significantly and positively correlated with withdrawal symptoms of irritability (r = 0.56), depression (r = 0.56), twitches and shakes (r = 0.57), perspiring (r = 0.57), thoughts of (r = 0.86), and cravings for (r = 0.69) cannabis.

Conclusions

Findings support the presence of clinically significant cannabis withdrawal symptoms in adolescents with cannabis dependence seeking substance abuse treatment. This study also provides supporting evidence suggesting a vulnerability of adolescents to physiological cannabis dependence. The study supports the addition of cannabis withdrawal as a distinct entity for inclusion in DSM-V.

### Cannabis withdrawal and psychiatric intensive care [^116ju7qH]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis use in people with severe mental illness can exacerbate psychotic symptoms and is associated with an increased risk of violence. A study in London, United Kingdom, found that recent cannabis users had 5 times higher odds of violence during emergency psychiatric assessments. Those with cannabis dependence may also experience adverse outcomes as a result of cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS). CWS has been described following the abrupt cessation of cannabis use in heavy users. It typically begins within 24 to 48 hours and peaks between 2 to 6 days. The symptoms include anxiety, irritability, anger, disturbed sleep, restlessness, depressed mood, loss of appetite, headache, and sweating.

There are no recommended treatments for CWS in clinical practice. Therefore, people with cannabis dependence are at risk of developing CWS when they are admitted to hospital. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between cannabis use prior to hospital admission and the subsequent need for psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU), an index of deteriorating mental state and increased risk of violence and aggression. We focused on the period 3 to 5 days after presentation to hospital, when CWS is most likely to be evident. This hypothesis was preregistered.

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117H5ZCm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer (A.B.), and all material marked as excluded was reviewed by a second person (R.T.) to ensure accuracy in first-pass screening. At this stage, the criteria were purposely broad to allow inclusion of any relevant studies. To be included, studies had to be published in English and report original research using any observational design (eg, cross-sectional or cohort) that reported on CWS in individuals with regular or dependent cannabis or synthetic cannabinoid use. The exact definition of regular cannabinoid use varied across cohorts, and we summarize the studies' criteria and characteristics in Table 1. Case reports and series were excluded. Full-text articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers (A.B. and C.S.), with discrepancies resolved by consensus or via consultation with a third reviewer (R.T. E.R.H. or D.P.S.) when consensus was not reached. Articles were included if they (1) were published in English, (2) reported individuals with regular or dependent cannabinoid use as a primary study group, (3) reported CWS or CWS symptoms using a validated instrument, and (4) reported the prevalence of CWS in individuals with regular or dependent cannabinoid use. For studies that used the same sample of data, those providing the most detailed information were included, and the others were kept for reference.

3. Cannabis intoxication and dependence

3.1. Acute adverse effects

Cannabis use can lead to intoxication, defined as a series of "clinically significant problematic behavioural or psychological changes (eg, impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, and social withdrawal) that develop during, or shortly after, cannabis use". The experience of feeling "high" after cannabis use is variable and subjective, depending on the dose, the environment, and previous experience and expectations of the drug user. The most common acute adverse effects are panic attacks and other forms of anxiety, mostly reported by naive users. Because cannabis impairs psychomotor skills, reaction time, and motor coordination, its use leads to increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. Current cannabis users have higher rates of hospitalization for injury from all causes than former cannabis users or nonusers.

3.2. Cannabis use disorders

DSM-5 CUDs is now a single diagnostic entity including abuse and dependence; it is prevalent (2.54% 12-month prevalence among U.S. adults), associated with comorbidity and disability, and largely untreated. Moreover, CUD often presents comorbidly with psychotic disorders. Preclinical studies support the evidence that exposure to THC leads to dependence. Cannabis can induce tolerance in humans, and dependence. Because cannabis is eliminated slowly from the body, withdrawal symptoms are generally mild. Nevertheless, discontinuation of long-term frequent cannabis use can induce anger, decreased appetite, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, and sleep difficulties, suggesting that the alleviation of abstinence symptoms contributes to the maintenance of daily cannabis use. Recent evidence, from the Netherlands, has shown an association between changes over time in average THC content in the type of cannabis available and rates of admission to specialist cannabis treatment units.

### Cannabis withdrawal and psychiatric intensive care [^1153ikYz]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that patients who had been using cannabis prior to psychiatric hospital admission were more likely to need intensive clinical care. In particular, it showed that cannabis users were more likely than nonusers to be transferred to PICU 3 to 5 days after presentation to hospital, the period when cannabis withdrawal is most evident. These findings build upon previous research that described episodes of psychosis which appear to have been triggered by CWS.

In post hoc analyses, we found that the associations were driven by women and older patients. The endocannabinoid system is sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that women experience more severe cannabis withdrawal. There is also some evidence from psychosis populations that those with a severe cannabis use disorder at illness onset are more likely to continue to use drugs, an association that could explain the association observed in older patients.

In a meta-analysis, 40% of regular cannabis users from inpatient samples reported CWS. In one study, 47% of participants reported at least 4 symptoms that were of a severe intensity. A systematic review of studies investigating cannabinoid agonist replacement therapy for CWS included 10 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials and found promising effects on withdrawal symptoms and treatment retention, as well as encouraging safety data. However, none of the trials recruited patients with severe psychiatric disorders. This is a important limitation, as the risks associated with cannabinoid receptor agonists may be greater in people with a psychiatric disorder.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this study include the large sample size and use of a rich clinical dataset. The main limitation of the study is the quality of data on cannabis use, which relied on clinical assessments that may not be accurate. We did not assess cannabis withdrawal symptoms, the extent of cannabis use, the severity of cannabis use disorder, or equivalent metrics for tobacco and stimulant use. Additionally, we did not collect data on the prescription of antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, or nicotine replacement therapy, which could potentially mitigate the effects of cannabis withdrawal.

### Prolonged cannabis withdrawal in young adults with lifetime psychiatric illness [^112nZzGh]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Young adults with psychiatric illnesses are more likely to use cannabis and experience problems from use. It is not known whether those with a lifetime psychiatric illness experience a prolonged cannabis withdrawal syndrome with abstinence. Participants were fifty young adults, aged 18–25, recruited from the Boston-area in 2015–2016, who used cannabis at least weekly, completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to identify Axis I psychiatric diagnoses (PD+ vs PD-), and attained cannabis abstinence with a four-week contingency management protocol. Withdrawal symptom severity was assessed at baseline and at four weekly abstinent visits using the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale. Cannabis dependence, age of initiation, and rate of abstinence were similar in PD+ and PD- groups. There was a diagnostic group by abstinent week interaction, suggesting a difference in time course for resolution of withdrawal symptoms by group, F(4,46) = 3.8, p = 0.009, controlling for sex, baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms, and frequency of cannabis use in the prior 90days. In post hoc analyses, there was a difference in time-course of cannabis withdrawal. PD- had significantly reduced withdrawal symptom severity in abstinent week one [t(46) = -2.2, p = 0.03], while PD+ did not report improved withdrawal symptoms until the second abstinent week [t(46) = -4.1, p = 0.0002]. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms improved over four weeks in young people with and without a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. However, those with a psychiatric illness reported one week delayed improvement in withdrawal symptom severity. Longer duration of cannabis withdrawal may be a risk factor for cannabis dependence and difficulty quitting.

### Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence [^115uxYYU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit drug in the world. Demand for treatment of cannabis use disorders is increasing. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or supportive care for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to 4 March 2014), MEDLINE (to week 3 February 2014), EMBASE (to 3 March 2014) and PsycINFO (to week 4 February 2014). We also searched reference lists of articles, electronic sources of ongoing trials and conference proceedings, and contacted selected researchers active in the area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving the use of medications to reduce the symptoms and signs of cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in participants diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. All review authors confirmed the inclusion decisions and the overall process.

Main Results

We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 958 participants. For 10 studies the average age was 33 years; two studies targeted young people; and age data were not available for two studies. Approximately 80% of study participants were male. The studies were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. Three studies were at risk of attrition bias. All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications included preparations containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (two studies), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (two studies), mixed action antidepressants (three studies), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (three studies), an atypical antidepressant (two studies), an anxiolytic (one study), a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (one study) and a glutamatergic modulator (one study). One study examined more than one medication. Diversity in the medications and the outcomes reported limited the extent that analysis was possible. Insufficient data were available to assess the utility of most of the medications to promote cannabis abstinence at the end of treatment. There was moderate quality evidence that completion of treatment was more likely with preparations containing THC compared to placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55; 2 studies, 207 participants, P = 0.006). There was some evidence that treatment with preparations containing THC was associated with reduced cannabis withdrawal symptoms and craving, but this latter outcome could not be quantified. For mixed action antidepressants compared with placebo (2 studies, 179 participants) there was very low quality evidence on the likelihood of abstinence from cannabis at the end of follow-up (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.41), and moderate quality evidence on the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21). For this same outcome there was very low quality evidence for the effects of SSRI antidepressants (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53; 2 studies, 122 participants), anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.46; 2 studies, 75 participants), and the atypical antidepressant, bupropion (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; 2 studies, 92 participants). Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant) and N-acetylcysteine (glutamatergic modulator) was insufficient for quantitative estimates of their effectiveness, but these medications may be worth further investigation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many of the outcomes the quality was downgraded due to small sample sizes, inconsistency and risk of attrition bias. The quantitative analyses that were possible, combined with general findings of the studies reviewed, indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, atypical antidepressants (bupropion), anxiolytics (buspirone) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (atomoxetine) are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Preparations containing THC are of potential value but, given the limited evidence, this application of THC preparations should be considered still experimental. Further studies should compare different preparations of THC, dose and duration of treatment, adjunct medications and therapies. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin and the glutamatergic modulator N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

### Nabilone therapy for cannabis withdrawal presenting as protracted nausea and vomiting [^111GBGvc]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Cannabis is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs worldwide. Psychoactive properties of the principal compound, δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol include euphoria, a sense of relaxation and increased appetite. Chronic cannabis use has been associated with the development of a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms typically begin within 24 h of abstinence and manifest as irritability, nervousness, sleep disturbances and decreased appetite. There is growing evidence that supports the use of plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids for the treatment of cannabis withdrawal. In this case report, we present 20-year-old woman who developed protracted nausea and vomiting secondary to cannabis withdrawal and was successfully treated with nabilone. Nausea and vomiting is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal syndrome and is an uncommon symptom presentation.

### The co-occurring use and misuse of cannabis and tobacco: a review [^112yHQtf]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Cannabis and tobacco use and misuse frequently co-occur. This review examines the epidemiological evidence supporting the life-time co-occurrence of cannabis and tobacco use and outlines the mechanisms that link these drugs to each other. Mechanisms include (i) shared genetic factors; (ii) shared environmental influences, including (iii) route of administration (via smoking), (iv) co-administration and (v) models of co-use. We also discuss respiratory harms associated with co-use of cannabis and tobacco, overlapping withdrawal syndromes and outline treatment implications for co-occurring use.

Methods

Selective review of published studies.

Results

Both cannabis and tobacco use and misuse are influenced by genetic factors, and a proportion of these genetic factors influence both cannabis and tobacco use and misuse. Environmental factors such as availability play an important role, with economic models suggesting a complementary relationship where increases in price of one drug decrease the use of the other. Route of administration and smoking cues may contribute to their sustained use. Similar withdrawal syndromes, with many symptoms in common, may have important treatment implications. Emerging evidence suggests that dual abstinence may predict better cessation outcomes, yet empirically researched treatments tailored for co-occurring use are lacking.

Conclusions

There is accumulating evidence that some mechanisms linking cannabis and tobacco use are distinct from those contributing to co-occurring use of drugs in general. There is an urgent need for research to identify the underlying mechanisms and harness their potential etiological implications to tailor treatment options for this serious public health challenge.

### DSM-V research agenda: substance abuse / psychosis comorbidity [^112A1rXW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

For diagnosis of patients with comorbid psychotic symptoms and substance use disorders (SUDs), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, makes clear distinctions between independent psychotic disorders (eg, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and substance-induced syndromes (eg, delirium, dementias). Most substance-induced psychotic symptoms are considered to be short lived and to resolve with sustained abstinence along with other symptoms of substance intoxication and withdrawal. These guidelines are challenged by practical difficulties in distinguishing between substance-induced and independent psychoses and by mounting evidence that marijuana use may be a contributing cause of schizophrenia. To inform the diagnostic distinction between substance-induced vs independent psychotic symptoms, 2 kinds of information could be sought from longitudinal research: (a) identification of early markers that clearly differentiate the 2 conditions and (b) more precise information about duration of psychotic symptoms induced by different substances. Evidence of this type could emerge from reanalysis of existing data from large-scale longitudinal studies of community samples. To inform possible nosological changes related to the possible schizophrenia-inducing role of marijuana (eg, designating a "cannabis-induced" subtype), a wide range of research evidence will be needed to clarify the relationship between effects of cannabis and schizophrenia symptoms. Ultimately, the ideal psychiatric nomenclature will define syndromes on the basis of established etiology and/or pathophysiology. Given the strong association between SUDs and psychotic disorders, research on the neurobiology of psychotic disorders could fruitfully include subjects with comorbid SUDs to shed light on shared etiology and pathophysiology.

### Cannabis based medicines and cannabis dependence: a critical review of issues and evidence [^112cCuqH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

To date, the clinical assessment of problematic cannabis use has been largely informed by the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test short form (CUDIT-SF) as well as the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test revised (CUDIT-R). Both of these were designed to tap problematic use, including dependence, in recreational users. They were not intended nor validated for that purpose. To address this, several of us (HVC, CH, AKS) are currently developing a measure to specifically assess problematic medical cannabis.

Despite this paucity of evidence, the United Nations' Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2018 declared that dependence is a probable outcome of daily medical cannabis use and that the risk of dependence might be as high as one in three persons. Those using THC related compounds daily (e.g. for chronic pain) may have a greater risk of dependence over those using it weekly for chemotherapy-induced nausea. However, at present there is a lack of data to support these claims and they provide no structure as to how they might be substantiated.

From a scientific perspective to prove evidence of dependence we would need to see:

1. Increased use over time consistent with tolerance. This would need to be independent of the intended therapeutic increase of dose.
2. Significant withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped. There are two withdrawal syndromes that we may see:
(a) Discontinuation syndrome: an appearance of symptoms that were not part of the original disorder for which the CBMP was prescribed include craving, sleep problems, nightmares, anger, irritability, dysphoria and nausea.
(b) Rebound syndrome: an increase in the severity of symptoms of the original condition.
3. Craving for the drug. This would be characterised by a loss of control over medication use. Even if medical cannabis may not be pleasurable it may still be craved once use is established, as can happen with other medicines such as opioids.

### The synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome [^114G9mX9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the effects of synthetic cannabinoids. There has been only one previous report of a withdrawal syndrome from synthetic cannabinoids. We report two cases of a withdrawal syndrome from prolonged habitual use of synthetic cannabinoids.

Discussion

Withdrawal from delta-9-THC has been described as a syndrome of anxiety, myalgias, chills, and anorexia. Synthetic cannabinoids are potent than delta-9-THC and thus the withdrawal syndrome is similar but more severe; however the symptoms do not seem to improve with delta-9-THC. The differences in presentation could be due to the fact that synthetic products may contain several heterogeneous compounds, including amphetamine-like substances.

Conclusions

The acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be characterized mainly by anxiety and tachycardia in the absence of any neurological findings or electrolyte disturbances. We describe two patients with symptoms consistent with withdrawal presumably due to synthetic cannabinoid use. The most appropriate treatment for such patients remains unknown, however benzodiazepines are a reasonable first line approach and quetiapine may have some efficacy.

### Updates in the use of cannabis for insomnia [^115a64WG]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize recent updates in the area of cannabis use for insomnia.

Recent Findings

Cannabis products have continued to become more potent, particularly in regard to delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration. Additionally, the use of cannabis has continued to become more accepted with less legal restrictions. The reported use of cannabis for relief of symptoms in sleep disorders appears to be increasing, however the specific effects of cannabinoids on sleep varies with cannabinoid type and concentration. Some evidence supports claims of efficacy of cannabinoids in sleep disorders such as insomnia, while other evidence is either lacking or in some cases contradictory. Regular cannabis use has been associated with withdrawal which can profoundly alter sleep. Also, clinicians should be aware of the potential effects of cannabis on the metabolism of other medications as well as the fact that cannabis use has been reported in a significant number of women in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy.

Summary

Cannabis use has been becoming more and more prevalent in the setting of relaxed restrictions and easier consumer level access to cannabis and cannabis products. A relative paucity of high quality evidence regarding the effects of cannabis on sleep and the treatment of insomnia symptoms remains. The optimal type, concentration, ratio, and dosage form of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia symptoms needs further clarification. As the trend of acceptance and use of cannabis continues, more high quality evidence to help guide clinicians in their recommendations will hopefully become available.

### Care of the patient using cannabis [^113NSgWy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The past 2 decades have seen a revolution in legal access to cannabis, driven largely by activists and business interests. As a result, the population of cannabis users nationwide-especially daily users-has grown significantly. An estimated 4.5–7 million persons in the United States now meet criteria for cannabis use disorder annually. This article focuses on the effects of cannabis use, intoxication, and withdrawal while also reviewing the developmental pathways of cannabis use disorder as well as evidence-based pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments.

### Cannabis based medicines and cannabis dependence: a critical review of issues and evidence [^111oakwm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical problems associated with cannabis use were once diagnosed as either 'cannabis abuse' or 'cannabis dependence' in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM‑IV‑TR). In the most recent version (DSM‑5), these categories were amalgamated into a single diagnosis of 'cannabis use disorder' (CUD), as described in Table 1. DSM-5 defines CUD as: 'A problematic pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the symptoms from the three lists in Table 1, occurring within a 12-month period'. Mild CUD is associated with having two or three of these symptoms, moderate CUD with four or five symptoms, and severe CUD with six or more symptoms. One advantage of combining abuse and dependence criteria is the provision of a clearer continuum between mild and severe presentations as previously all cases of dependence also met criteria for abuse. Another advantage is that dependence on a medicine is often a common and 'normal' situation. For example, stopping the use of a prescribed pain killer does not necessarily lead to drug-seeking behaviours but individuals may be dependent upon them for pain relief.

Table 1.
Cannabis use disorder symptoms from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM‑IV‑TR) to DSM-5 with likely frequency of symptom based on the literature related to medical cannabis use and justification for likelihood.

For recreational users, the estimated chances of becoming dependent on cannabis after any lifetime exposure is 8.9%, which is considerably lower than for cocaine (20.9%), alcohol (22.7%) or tobacco (67.5%). Nevertheless, the clinical need for treatment of cannabis dependence is substantial and increasing across North America, Europe and Oceania. In Europe, cannabis now accounts for more first‑time entrants to drug treatment services than any other illicit drug. Globally, the United Nations reports that cannabis dependence is now the primary reason for drug treatment across the world (39%), surpassing numbers receiving opioid treatment (33%).

### Prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms among people with regular or dependent use of cannabinoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DSLEq]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Data on the prevalence of CWS information were extracted and, where possible, grouped to be consistent with previous CWS rating instruments developed by cannabinoid expert groups (eTable 3 in the Supplement). If data reporting in the publications was incomplete, supplementary information and documents were searched to locate missing data. If supplementary information could not be located or did not provide the necessary data needed, primary study authors were contacted by email for additional information.

The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. This scale uses a star system to evaluate nonrandomized studies regarding 3 domains of quality (selection, comparability, and outcome) using 8 criteria: representativeness of the exposed cohort, selection of the nonexposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study, comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis, assessment of outcome, sufficient length of follow-up for outcomes to occur, and adequacy of follow-up of the cohort. Individual star scores for each criterion were tallied to provide an overall quality score, where the greater the quality score, the higher the methodologic quality of the study (maximum score: 8 points). Studies that achieved a total rating of 6 points or higher were considered to be of the highest quality, studies that achieved a total rating of fewer than 2 points were considered to be of lowest quality, and those between 2 and 5 points were rated as fair quality. Study information necessary for quality assessment was extracted to the Excel template by one reviewer (A.B.) and double checked by a second (C.S.). Discrepancies were resolved via consultation with a third reviewer (R.T. E.R.H. or D.P.S.).

### Association between recent cannabis consumption and withdrawal-related symptoms during early abstinence among females with smoked cocaine use disorder [^111naEj3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of cannabis on clinical outcomes of treatment services for other drug use disorders remains unclear. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of recent cannabis consumption on the severity of cocaine withdrawal and depressive symptoms during a 3-week inpatient treatment program for women with cocaine use disorder. The second goal of this study was to test the effect of recent alcohol or tobacco use on the aforementioned outcomes.

Methods

This was a longitudinal study with 2 assessment time points: at enrollment and upon discharge from a medically managed intensive inpatient unit. The sample was composed of 214 early abstinence females with cocaine use disorder. Cocaine withdrawal and depressive symptoms were measured using the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) and the Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI-II). Recent substance use was evaluated using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI-6).

Results

Patients with cocaine use disorder and with frequent recent cannabis use reported higher severity of cocaine withdrawal and depressive symptoms after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment. Neither recent alcohol nor tobacco use was associated with increased CSSA or BDI outcomes, suggesting these substances play a minor role compared to recent cannabis use in affecting withdrawal-related symptoms.

Conclusions

The assessment of recent cannabis use may help identify patients in need of additional treatment to manage severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms and depressive symptoms during early abstinence.

### Efficacy and safety of a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor (PF-04457845) in the treatment of cannabis withdrawal and dependence in men: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 2a single-site randomised controlled trial [^111sY3Q2]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs worldwide. Cannabis use disorder is characterised by recurrent use of cannabis that causes significant clinical and functional impairment. There are no approved pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorder. One approach is to potentiate endocannabinoid signalling by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of the FAAH-inhibitor PF-04457845 in reduction of cannabis withdrawal and cannabis use in men who were daily cannabis users.

Methods

We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase 2a trial at one site in men aged 18–55 years with cannabis dependence according to DSM-IV criteria (equivalent to cannabis use disorder in DSM-5). After baseline assessments, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive PF-04457845 (4 mg per day) or placebo using a fixed block size of six participants, stratified by severity of cannabis use and desire to quit. Participants were admitted to hospital for 5 days (maximum 8 days) to achieve abstinence and precipitate cannabis withdrawal, after which they were discharged to continue the remaining 3 weeks of treatment as outpatients. The primary endpoints were treatment-related differences in cannabis withdrawal symptoms during hospital admission, and week 4 (end of treatment) self-reported cannabis use and urine THC-COOH concentrations in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01618656.

Findings

Between Sept 12, 2012, and Jan 18, 2016, 46 men were randomly assigned to PF-04457845 and 24 to placebo. Adherence to study medication was 88%, as confirmed by video-calling and pill count, and corroborated by corresponding drug and anandamide concentrations in blood. Relative to placebo, treatment with PF-04457845 was associated with reduced symptoms of cannabis withdrawal (first day of treatment mean symptom score 11·00 [95% CI 7·78–15·57] vs 6·04 [4·43–8·24]; difference 4·96 [0·71–9·21]; p adj = 0·048; second day of treatment 11·74 [8·28–16·66] vs 6·02 [4·28–8·47]; difference 5·73 [1·13–10·32]; p adj = 0·035) and related mood symptoms during the inpatient phase. Additionally, treatment with PF-04457845 was associated with lower self-reported cannabis use at 4 weeks (mean 1·27 joints per day [95% CI 0·82–1·97] vs 0·40 [0·25–0·62]; difference 0·88 [0·29–1·46]; p = 0·0003) and lower urinary THC-COOH concentrations (mean 657·92 ng/mL [95% CI 381·60–1134·30] vs 265·55 [175·60–401·57]; difference 392·37 [17·55–767·18)]; p = 0·009). Eight (17%) patients in the PF-04457845 group and four (17%) in the placebo group discontinued during the treatment period. During the 4-week treatment phase, 20 (43%) of 46 participants in the PF-04457845 group and 11 (46%) of 24 participants in the placebo group had an adverse event. There were no serious adverse events.

Interpretation

PF-04457845, a novel FAAH inhibitor, reduced cannabis withdrawal symptoms and cannabis use in men, and might represent an effective and safe approach for the treatment of cannabis use disorder.

### Heavy cannabis use, dependence and the brain: a clinical perspective [^114QFRfz]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

Despite the unclear and highly variable long‐lasting effects of heavy cannabis use and CUD, prognosis can be assumed to be worse for cannabis users with higher CUD severity. As evidence‐based CUD treatments are limited and abstinence rates are low (6‐month follow up: 24–35% 149, 150), prevention is pivotal. Heavy users in contact with health professionals should therefore always be encouraged to stop or reduce use to prevent further escalation. Among those that seek treatment, cognitive deficits may reduce treatment attendance 134. While some cognitive deficits may precede CUD, cognitive deficits appear to recover for those maintaining abstinence 151, 152.

Although more studies are needed to confirm this and study its mechanisms, odds for long‐term abstinence (with or without treatment) and cognitive recovery may be negatively influenced by withdrawal severity 123, 153, use of cannabis with high THC: CBD ratios 152, age of onset 152, CUD severity 68 and comorbid mental disorders 153. Although increased risk of developing a CUD is highly undesirable, self‐medication for anxiety, PTSD, depression and psychosis‐related symptoms should be taken into account 93.

While reducing cannabis use might improve treatment for comorbid psychiatric disorders, aggravation of symptoms combined with craving and withdrawal after reducing cannabis use may also cause setbacks in treatment. Importantly, effective pharmacotherapy for comorbid psychiatric disorders may reduce cannabis use as a consequence 154.

To date, no strong causal relationship between cannabis use and neurological disorders, such as brain cancer and stroke, has been established. The effect of continued cannabis use or abstinence on the prognosis of neurological disorders is therefore unclear.

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^113iEarw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cannabis and mental health disorders — evidence synthesis: A National Academies review reports moderate evidence that cannabis use is associated with increased risk for the development of depression and social anxiety disorder — but not other anxiety disorders; limited evidence links cannabis use with increased severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms, and it supported a dose-response effect on suicidality while high quality research on PTSD development or depressive disorder course was found to be lacking. Evidence appears strongest for associations with psychotic symptoms or disorders, particularly among individuals with a genetic predisposition, with a 2014 review rating the cannabis–schizophrenia relationship as "medium" and a synthesis of five fair-to-high quality reviews suggesting a "moderate to large" dose-dependent association with psychotic disorder development. Acute adverse effects — particularly among naive users — may include anxiety, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and/or panic, are likely exacerbated by higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, may account for up to 25–30% of cannabis-related emergency department visits, and anxiety and depression may also be reported with cannabis withdrawal.

### Longitudinal study of risk factors predicting cannabis use disorder in UK young adults and adolescents [^111dfQfp]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis has been used by humans for at least five millennia. Today, roughly 228 million people worldwide use cannabis for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Like many other drugs, cannabis carries a risk of addiction, clinically defined as cannabis use disorder (CUD). The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines CUD as problematic cannabis use leading to clinically significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Symptoms include using more cannabis than intended, an inability to stop use despite harm, and tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Individuals with CUD may also experience reduced quality of life alongside a higher risk of mental health, cognitive, and physical problems, such as mood and psychotic disorders. Although the estimated prevalence varies between different studies, the best available evidence suggests that between 9%and 22%of those who try cannabis eventually go on to develop CUD. Therefore, CUD affects a substantial minority of people who use cannabis (PWUC), and it is important to understand which risk factors predict CUD development.

The number of people seeking treatment for CUD in Europe has increased over the past 15 years, placing a major strain on healthcare services. While behavioural and psychosocial interventions show some efficacy, at least in the short term, there are no approved pharmacotherapies for CUD. In addition to this burden within treatment services, the vast majority of PWUC meeting criteria for CUD do not enter treatment. Improving the efficacy and maximising the cost/benefit ratio of treatment and prevention measures requires the ability to identify those most at risk, so that interventions targeting these groups can be developed. In addition to using cannabis frequently and at large quantities, male gender (odds ratio, OR~2), adolescent age (OR~3), and more problematic use of other substances such as alcohol (OR~1.5–2.5) and tobacco (OR~4, based on one study) have all been identified as risk factors for CUD. However, findings have not been consistent across studies, possibly due to differences in design, samples, and measurement tools, and up-to-date replication in different populations and settings is necessary.

### Effectiveness and safety of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sYEQZ]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

A further limitation of our article may be that we only planned to undertake pairwise meta‐analyses (as outlined in our prospectively registered protocol) and, as such cannot form conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of all PSIs.

There has been some work on outcome toolkits, advocating for trialists to shift focus from abstinence (our primary outcomes) toward severity of CUD and level of cannabis use (our secondary outcome), as these are considered to be more relevant from a harm reduction perspective. However, there is still no agreed core outcome set for CUD and we found considerable variability in outcome definitions and measures across all studies. Additionally, prospectively registered protocols were not available for 15 of 22 studies, of which five of 15 were published before 2005, when trial registration requirements were implemented in medical journals. As such, it is unclear whether our selected outcomes were not measured, or were measured but not reported, and we consider the implications of publication bias in Data S6. Abstinence was measured using self‐report or urine tests, with limited details on thresholds for detecting presence of cannabinoids and which measure had informed the outcome assessment when both were collected. The definition of 'continuous' abstinence also varied across studies (6–14 weeks). Using different measures and timeframes within the abstinence outcomes likely contributed to moderate between‐study heterogeneity, which in turn reduces the certainty of findings.

Only two studies assessed safety outcome and both reported that no adverse events had occurred. Neither provided a definition of 'adverse event' or details on measurement. Reasons for participant dropout were poorly reported across all studies. In combination with substantial missing data, this was a common source of high RoB in the results. Cannabis craving was reported in one study only and none reported on the intensity of withdrawal. This was unexpected considering the nature of the PSIs, some of which included training in affect management and dealing with withdrawal. For individuals with CUD, withdrawal symptoms can occur within the first week of ceasing cannabis use. Except for the studies of CM‐abstinence, it was not clear whether or when participants were expected to stop using cannabis. Therapeutic goals may extend beyond abstinence and include reduction in cannabis use or improvement in functioning, where withdrawal symptoms may be less likely to occur.

Assessments in clinical practice

The DSM and ICD are the golden standards for diagnosing CUD and other psychiatric disorders. According to the DSM‐5, CUD can be defined as problematic cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairments or distress 54. While the ICD‐10 121 and old DSM‐4 122 still differentiated between abuse and dependence, the DSM‐5 classifies CUDs as mild (two to three criteria), moderate (four to five criteria) or severe (six or more criteria), depending on the presence of any of 11 diagnostic criteria over a period of 12 months 54. The diagnostic criteria pertain to loss of control, social problems, use in risky situations and physical dependence. In addition, the DSM‐5 includes craving and cannabis withdrawal syndrome as novel diagnostic criteria. Withdrawal symptoms include nausea, headaches, mood changes, aggression, appetite changes and craving. These symptoms normally peak within the first week of abstinence, and severity has been associated with heaviness of cannabis use 123.

Reliable and commonly used DSM‐ and ICD‐based structured interviews to diagnose and assess the severity of CUD include the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID), Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) and World Mental Health‐Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHM‐CIDI). Although used mainly in academic settings, multiple brief questionnaires have been developed to assess and screen the severity of use‐related problems [e.g. Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test Revised (CUDIT‐R) 124, Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test (CUPIT) 125, Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) 126) and quantity of use; for example, time‐line follow‐back (TLFB) 127. These measures have good psychometric properties and are time‐efficient, making them a valuable addition in clinical practice to gather helpful information about quantity and patterns of use 128.

### New drugs of abuse and withdrawal syndromes [^112JGBPV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

New drugs of abuse continue to emerge, including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and hallucinogens. It is important to recognize their individual psychopharmacologic properties, symptoms of intoxication, and symptoms of withdrawal. Providers must be vigilant of acute medical or psychiatric complications that may arise from use of these substances. Treatment of the patient also includes recognition of any substance use disorders as well as comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although pharmacologic treatments for substance use disorder (of the drugs included in this article) are limited, there are a variety of psychotherapeutic modalities that may be of some benefit.

Efficacy of CBD for SUD treatment

Consistent with previous studies, we found mixed evidence regarding the potential of CBD to help manage and treat SUDs. The most common observation from the SRs included, especially those characterized by a high methodological quality, indicated that nabiximols (CBD:THC 1:1) may be beneficial in treating withdrawal and craving symptoms associated with cannabis cessation. Some studies hypothesized that CBD might modulate certain acute effects of THC, such as anxiety or psychosis‐like symptoms. However, this observation was not consistently supported across studies, and there is no conclusive evidence that CBD either induces or moderates THC effects. A recent study found that CBD does not mitigate the acute effects caused by THC. Moreover, a recent RCT found no evidence that CBD, at any dose, protects against the acute effects of THC.

Moreover, interventions using THC and CBD‐containing medications (nabiximols in the case of our included reviews) for SUDs may also benefit from psychotherapeutic interventions commonly used in SUD treatment, such as Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as complementary approaches. For CUD in particular, such interventions, namely CBT, are currently the first‐line treatments in the absence of established medication strategies. Nabiximols may reinforce the impact of psychotherapeutic interventions given its effect on cannabis craving and use.

When considering abstinence, reduction, or cessation of use of cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, heroin or other psychoactive substances, evidence supporting the efficacy of CBD is limited and inconclusive. In particular, the effects of nabiximols on withdrawal and craving symptoms associated with cessation have not translated into reductions in use or improvements in abstinence. Moreover, findings should be interpreted in the context of the methodological quality of existing SRs, which is unequal. We consistently observed positive effects of nabiximols on cannabis withdrawal and cravings across most SRs and particularly in those of high quality. This underscores the potential therapeutic benefits of the CBD: THC combination for treating cannabis use disorder. However, it is important to note that we could not conclude to these effects with regard to tobacco use, heroin cravings because of the low methodological quality of studies in these areas, pointing to the need for additional high‐quality research.

### Construct validity of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder diagnosis and severity levels in adults with problematic substance use [^117ThCRE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The DSM-5 definition of cannabis use disorder (CUD) differs from DSM-IV by combining abuse and dependence criteria (without the legal criterion) and including withdrawal and craving criteria. Information on construct validity of the DSM-5 CUD diagnosis and severity levels is lacking. This study examines the associations between DSM-5 CUD and severity classification and a set of concurrent validators. Adults with problematic substance use were recruited from two settings: a research setting in an urban medical center and a suburban inpatient addiction treatment program. Participants who reported past-year cannabis use (n = 392) were included in this study and completed a semi-structured, clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Regression models estimated the associations between binary DSM-5 CUD and severity levels with a set of validators, including cannabis use variables, psychopathology, and functional impairment. DSM-5 CUD and all severity levels were associated with cannabis use validators, including number of days used, self-reporting that cannabis use was a major problem, and greater cannabis craving. DSM-5 CUD and severe CUD were associated with other psychiatric disorders and social impairment. Findings add information about the validity of DSM-5 CUD diagnosis and severity levels, with severe CUD receiving the strongest support from its association with validators across all domains, as distinct from the mild and moderate CUD measures that were associated with cannabis-specific validators alone. Severe CUD is likely to require more intensive treatment to bolster physical, psychiatric, and social functioning, whereas the mild and moderate severity thresholds provide useful information for identifying less severe disorders for prevention and brief intervention.

### Sex-specific associations of alcohol withdrawal in patients admitted for the treatment of alcohol use disorder [^1169e7u4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There are sex differences in the pattern of alcohol consumption and in the complications of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We aimed to identify sex-specific differences in the factors associated with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) among patients that requested a first treatment for AUD.

Methods

We enrolled 313 patients (75% men) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) AUD diagnosis that started treatment between 2014 and 2016. We collected socio-demographics, the type and amount of alcohol and other substances consumed, and clinical and laboratory parameters. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) AUD criteria, AWS occurred when patients experienced 2 or more clinical signs/symptoms and/or consumed alcohol to relieve symptoms. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with AWS according to sex.

Results

The median age of participants was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 43–54 years). The median age of starting alcohol consumption was 16 years (IQR: 14–18 years). Notably, 69% of participants smoked tobacco, and 61% had a family history of AUD; 18% currently used cannabis, and 7.7% used cocaine. Overall, 73% of patients exhibited AWS criteria, and men (76.5%) were more likely than women (64.6%) to report AWS (P = 0.038). In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with AWS were the age at starting alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] for every 5 years = 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69–2.08), and cannabis use (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.04–7.7) in men, and a family history of AUD in women (OR = 2.85 95% CI: 1.07–7.54).

Conclusions

factors associated with AWS differ by sex which may have clinical implications for proactive management of AWS during treatment for AUD.

### Cannabis use is associated with a small increase in the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting: a retrospective machine-learning causal analysis [^112hwKxj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Paradoxically, cannabinoids can also elicit nausea, as seen in Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS), a condition associated with heavy daily use of cannabis. CHS has been theorized to be caused by either a buildup of toxic chemicals found in cannabis or the downregulation of CB1 receptors in chronic cannabis use. Genetic differences in the P450 enzyme family responsible for cannabinoid metabolism may also play a role. Withdrawal symptoms after cessation of chronic cannabis use include nausea, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, restlessness, depressed mood, and physical discomforts such as abdominal pain, and typically begin within 24–48 h, with onset depending upon the type of cannabinoid used, the route of ingestion, and the frequency and amount of consumption. Withdrawal timing and severity may also have a genetic component. Kebir et al. recently described the presence of a polymorphism in a cannabinoid transporter which can significantly alter THC levels in the blood and body stores resulting in more severe withdrawal symptoms. Interestingly, Schilienz et al. found cannabinoid withdrawal symptoms to be more severe in females, specifically nausea, though nausea was less common than other physical symptoms of withdrawal.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^1127BCcf]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Presentation

A 48‐year‐old male presented to a primary care provider with stomach cramps, headache and elevated anxiety symptoms that have prevented him from working for 48 hours. He stated that while he has been off work, he has heard infrequent but multiple unfamiliar voices telling him that he is going to lose his job. The patient reports that he has been having relationship problems with his partner of 15 years, primarily due to his substance use. He ceased all substance use 60 hours prior to the assessment.

Psychosocial history

The patient is currently on sick leave but has a history of stable employment. He is married with no children. There are financial concerns due to time off work.
Medical history: he reports stomach cramps, headache, irritability/anger, loss of appetite, some chills and sweating. Previous history of hypertension, disturbed sleep, mild–moderate sleep apnoea; body mass index (BMI) is 35.
Psychiatric history: currently reports elevated anxiety and a history and previous diagnosis of unipolar depression. Denies history of schizophrenia or psychotic disorders. [Clinician query: cannabis withdrawal‐induced psychosis.] Denies thoughts of self‐harm.
Medication: escitalopram 20 mg (non‐compliant), captopril 25 mg (non‐compliant), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (non‐compliant).

Substance use history

The patient reports daily use of cannabis (average 2 g per day, or approximately eight joints), nicotine 15 'tailor‐made' manufactured cigarettes per day plus 'spins' loose tobacco with high THC content cannabis plant 'buds'. He reports infrequent use of alcohol (average three standard drinks peer week) and non‐prescribed prescription opioids (oxycodone 10 mg when available, typically one tablet per fortnight). The patient states his longest drug‐free period occurred 15 years ago for 6 months after meeting his now partner (aged 33 years). He scores 6 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), where ≥ 16 is suggestive of alcohol‐related problems, 13 on the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), where ≥ 3 of 15 is indicative of cannabis‐related problems and 10 (range = 0–10) on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), indicating a high level of dependence. He reports no history of significant substance withdrawal.

### Elevated striatal glutamate + glutamine in recreational cannabis users during abstinence [^115H7zu7]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannabis withdrawal symptoms contribute to relapse, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesize that cannabis withdrawal may be associated with a reset of regional γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate concentrations secondary to changes in the endocannabinoid system during abstinence and conducted a study on this issue. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect the associated changes of these neurochemicals in twenty-six frequent, recreational cannabis users and eleven age-matched non-using controls. Twenty users (8F/12M) and ten control (5F/5M) participants completed a verified 21-day abstinence period. Striatal GABA and glutamine concentrations were measured at baseline and on abstinence days 7 and 21 in conjunction with measures of cannabis withdrawal symptoms and mood state. Cannabis users reported increased self-reported ratings of cannabis-withdrawal-symptoms on abstinence day 7 relative to controls. Striatal glutamate + glutamine (Glx) group concentrations were elevated in cannabis users at baseline and abstinence days 7 and 21 (F = 7.16, p = 0.012), and changes in GABA concentration and withdrawal symptoms between baseline and abstinence day 7 were positively correlated (r = 0.550, p = 0.010). In addition, baseline striatal GABA concentrations were negatively correlated with withdrawal symptoms on abstinence day 7 (r = -0.680, p = 0.003). Our data demonstrate that striatal Glx was elevated in cannabis users and baseline striatal GABA correlated with withdrawal during the abstinence. In addition, striatal GABA may temporally correlate with self-reported withdrawal symptoms during the initial days of abrupt cannabis abstinence. These findings provide preliminary evidence that striatal GABA and Glx are associated with the severity of cannabis withdrawal.

Postoperative CWS treatment — trial data, regulatory context, and recommendations: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 50 treatment-seeking outpatients for CUD, and gabapentin 1200 mg significantly decreased withdrawal symptoms as measured by the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist compared with placebo. The panel acknowledges that dronabinol and nabilone are not FDA-approved for this indication in the United States, and that both are approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Recommendation 1 states that patients using cannabis should be counseled regarding the risk of CWS and that postoperatively, patients that consume cannabis routinely should be monitored for CWS using a validated and reliable scale (Grade C). Recommendation 2 states that the expert panel came to the consensus that initiating a cannabinoid agonist such as dronabinol at a low dose is the best choice to treat severe CWS postoperatively (Grade C).

### Lithium carbonate in the management of cannabis withdrawal in humans: an open-label study [^116jL1rd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the world. Estimates suggest that approximately 10–20% of cannabis users meet criteria for cannabis dependence and a significant proportion experience withdrawal discomfort on cessation of use. To date, there has been an absence of any clinically validated treatments to manage withdrawal. The current study is an open-label trial exploring the utility of lithium carbonate for the management of cannabis withdrawal symptoms in treatment seeking adult humans. In total, 20 participants were recruited to the study (19 men). All met DSM-IV cannabis-dependence criteria and had been smoking cannabis daily or almost daily for a mean 9 years. Participants were admitted to an inpatient detoxification facility and prescribed lithium 500 mg b.d. for 7 days. Cannabis withdrawal was assessed daily with the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (MWC). Two participants were withdrawn from the trial because of possible adverse effects. Sixty percent of participants completed the 7-day treatment program. Follow-up was conducted at a mean of 107 days following treatment. The mean percentage of days abstinent in the period between treatment cessation and follow-up was 87.57%. Twenty-nine percent of participants (n = 5) reported continuous abstinence that was biochemically verified at follow-up. Agreement between self-reported cannabis use and urinalysis at follow-up was moderate (kappa = 0.47). Significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety and cannabis-related problems were also reported. This study provides evidence for the potential clinical utility and safety of lithium in the management of cannabis withdrawal. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial is recommended.

### Treatment of adolescent cannabis use disorders [^116vCSJi]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes treatments for cannabis use disorder (CUD) in adolescents. The best supported CUD treatments are cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, including family-based models that facilitate environmental changes and youth-focused models that incorporate skills training, motivational interviewing, and contingency management to promote reductions in cannabis use. Some medications show promise in reducing cannabis craving and withdrawal symptoms. Further research is needed on the efficacy and implementation of existing treatments given the changes in cannabis use trends over time and on emerging technologies that may expand access to evidence-based CUD treatments.

### Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in substance users: a comparison across substances [^112rRgzv]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) are reported to be increased among persons using illicit substances, but little is known about the comparative frequency with which the symptoms occur with abuse of different substances. To establish this, we interviewed individuals who had wide experience of commonly used drugs.

Methods

Four hundred seventy-six intravenous drug users, crack-cocaine users, and heroin snorters recruited via street outreach were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Model to assess dependence on a number of substances including amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids. As a part of this assessment, we assessed a history of delusions and hallucinations in the context of use of, or withdrawal from, these specific substances.

Results

From 27.8% to 79.6% users of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, dependence for that specific substance. The prevalence of psychotic symptoms associated with each specific substance ranged from users with no diagnosis to users with severe dependence as follows: amphetamines (5.2%-100%), cannabis (12.4%-80.0%), cocaine (6.7%-80.7%), and opiates (6.7%-58.2%). The risk of psychotic symptoms increased for respondents who abused (odds ratio [OR], 12.2) or had mild (OR, 17.1), moderate (OR, 47.0), or severe dependence (OR, 114.0) on cocaine when compared to those who were users with no diagnosis. A similar pattern was evident in cannabis, opiate, and amphetamine users.

Conclusions

Most users dependent on illicit substances experience psychotic symptoms in the context of use of, or withdrawal from, these substances. Psychotic symptoms increased with the severity of the substance use disorders for all 4 substances. These findings emphasize the importance of developing services to target this population as they are at a heightened risk for developing psychotic symptoms.

### Cannabis withdrawal symptoms in people with regular or dependent cannabinoid use… [^114kB5YV]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Cannabis withdrawal syndrome appears to be common among regular users of cannabis, particularly those in outpatient and inpatient settings and individuals with substance use disorders; clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of cannabis withdrawal syndrome to counsel patients and support individuals who are reducing their use of cannabis. Importance Cannabis withdrawal syndrome — a diagnostic indicator of cannabis use disorder — commonly occurs on cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use. To date, the prevalence of CWS syndrome has not been well described, nor have the factors potentially associated with CWS. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that cannabis withdrawal syndrome appears to be prevalent among regular users of cannabis. Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of CWS in order to counsel patients and support individuals who are reducing their use of cannabis. sequalae.

2 The known short-term risks of cannabinoid use include impaired short-term memory and motor coordination, altered judgment, paranoia, and psychosis. 3 Similarly, long-term effects of cannabinoid use include addiction, altered brain development, poor educational outcomes, cognitive impairment, diminished quality of life, increased risk of chronic respiratory tract and psychotic disorders, injuries, motor vehicle collisions, and suicide. 3, 4. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome was recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 9 and requires the presence of at least 3 of the following symptoms developing within 7 days of reduced cannabis use: irritability, anger, or aggression; nervousness or anxiety; sleep disturbance; appetite or weight disturbance; restlessness; depressed mood; and somatic symptoms, such as headaches, sweating, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

Clinicians should be aware of CWS as it is associated with clinically significant symptoms, which can trigger resumption of cannabis use and serve as negative reinforcement for relapse during a quit attempt. 28, 41 The clinical significance of CWS is shown by the fact that it can be impairing, 84 that cannabis or other substances. In our study, CWS was more frequently encountered among patients with comorbid tobacco and drug use. Although our study did not identify an association between psychiatric comorbidity or alcohol use and CWS prevalence, the prevalence of CUD comorbidity is known to be substantially higher among individuals with a primary anxiety, 44, 95, 96 mood, 34, 97 eating, 61 or psychotic disorder46, 98, 99 relative to the general population.

### Marijuana abstinence effects in marijuana smokers maintained in their home environment… [^111n6dac]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Results An overall measure of withdrawal discomfort increased significantly during the abstinence phases and returned to baseline when marijuana smoking resumed. Craving for marijuana, decreased appetite, sleep difficulty, and weight loss reliably changed across the smoking and abstinence phases. Aggression, anger, irritability, restlessness, and strange dreams increased significantly during one abstinence phase, but not the other. Collateral observers confirmed participant reports of these symptoms. Early inpatient laboratory studies10–12 confirmed the animal research. Cessation following the administration of marijuana cigarettes or oral THC produced decreased appetite, irritability, restlessness, sleep difficulties, and uncooperativeness. Two recent placebo-controlled inpatient studies13, 14 extended these findings by examining abstinence effects following moderate dosing of oral THC or smoked marijuana.

Both studies demonstrated withdrawal effects that included anxiety, decreased contentment and food intake, depressed mood, irritability, restlessness, sleep difficulty, and stomach pain. This outpatient study validated specific symptoms of marijuana withdrawal, and showed they were reliable and clinically significant. These symptoms increased during marijuana abstinence, returned to baseline when marijuana smoking resumed, and increased again when abstinence was reinitiated, suggesting that they were caused by cessation of marijuana use. Collateral observers confirmed participant reports, providing further support for their validity and significance. The withdrawal symptoms observed in the present study were also consistent with those reported in clinical and general population studies.

15, 29–31 For example, 67% of marijuana-dependent adolescents in residential care described a history of marijuana withdrawal symptoms that included irritability, restlessness, depressed mood, sleep difficulty, and fatigue or yawning. 29 A previous study15 of adults seeking treatment for marijuana dependence showed a similar but more severe pattern of withdrawal symptoms than that observed in the present study. The affective symptoms observed during short-term marijuana abstinence overlap substantially with those observed in other drug withdrawal syndromes. 33 Studies34, 35 in laboratory animals indicate that reductions in mesolimbic dopamine transmission and elevations in extracellular-releasing factor concentrations observed in the limbic system following withdrawal from cannabinoids closely resemble the responses seen with other major drugs of abuse.

The behavioral consequences of these neurobiological changes observed during withdrawal are consistent with the type of negative affective symptoms reported by our participants and by patients withdrawing from other substances. Such findings have led to speculation that negative affect may be the common hallmark of withdrawal across most drugs of abuse. 36.

### Understanding your risk for cannabis use disorder… [^112pkNeV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Some people who use cannabis will develop cannabis use disorder, meaning that they are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing health and social problems in their lives.
- The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is greater in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently. Signs of cannabis use disorder Fast Statistics
- Approximately 3 in 10 people who use cannabis have cannabis use disorder.
- It is estimated that people who use cannabis have about a 30% likelihood of becoming addicted.
- The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is greater in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently.

The following are signs of cannabis use disorder:

- Using more cannabis than intended
- Trying but failing to quit using cannabis
- Spending a lot of time using cannabis
- Craving cannabis
- Using cannabis even though it causes problems at home, school, or work
- Continuing to use cannabis despite social or relationship problems
- Giving up important activities with friends and family in favor of using cannabis
- Using cannabis in high-risk situations, such as while driving a car
- Continuing to use cannabis despite physical or psychological problems
- Needing to use more cannabis to get the same high. People who have cannabis use disorder may also be at a higher risk of other negative consequences, such as problems with attention, memory, and learning. Cannabis use disorder and increased THC concentration Some people who have cannabis use disorder may need to use more and more cannabis or greater concentrations of cannabis over time to experience a "high.

" The greater the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis, the stronger the effects the cannabis may have on the brain. The amount of THC in cannabis has increased over the past few decades. Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain are exposed to high concentrations of THC or how recent increases in concentrations affect the risk of someone developing cannabis use disorder. There is moderate evidence that high THC concentration cannabis use by adolescents and young adults is associated with continued use and development of future mental health symptoms and disorders.

### 7 common withdrawal symptoms | Quit smoking… [^113Sc5ur]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Having urges or cravings to smoke Almost everyone who smokes regularly has cravings or urges to smoke when they quit. They may be mild or can sometimes feel overwhelming. Figuring out how to deal with cravings is one of the most important things you can do to stay successful.
2. Feeling irritated, grouchy, or upset It is very common to feel irritated or grouchy when you quit. Even many people who have never smoked know this is part of quitting. Knowing this is normal can be helpful. Ways to manage: Remind yourself that you likely feel this way because your body is getting used to being without nicotine. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself why you're quitting.
3. Feeling jumpy and restless Feeling jumpy or restless during the first days or weeks after quitting is normal. Just like your mind gets irritated without nicotine at first, the rest of your body can, too. Ways to manage: Doing some physical activity can help shake loose your jumpiness.

Get up and walk around for a bit if you feel restless. Try cutting back on coffee, tea, and other caffeinated drinks. When you quit smoking, caffeine lasts longer in your body.
4. Having a hard time concentrating You may notice that it is harder to concentrate in the first days after you quit — this is very common. Ways to manage: Try to cut yourself some slack, especially in the first days after you quit. Try to limit activities that require strong concentration if you can.
6. Feeling hungrier or gaining weight It's normal for your appetite to increase some when you quit. And your body may not burn calories quite as fast. You may also eat more because of the stress of quitting or to have something to do with your hands and mouth. Food may even be more enjoyable because your senses of smell and taste are not being dulled by all that smoke.
7. Feeling anxious, sad, or depressed People who smoke are more likely to have anxiety or depression than people who don't smoke.

Some people feel mood changes for a short time after they quit smoking. Watch for this, especially if you've ever had anxiety or depression. For some people, smoking may seem like it helps with anxiety or depression, but don't be tricked. Smoking might make you feel better in the short-term, but that's because the nicotine in cigarettes stops the discomfort of withdrawal.

### Cannabis health effects… [^117WL5uc]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Cannabis health effects There are health risks associated with using cannabis regardless of how it is used. These include: Cannabis Use Disorder. People who use cannabis can struggle with physical dependency and controlling their use. This is concerning as there is evidence suggesting the use of highly concentrated THC products is associated with more severe cannabis use disorder symptoms. While approximately 3 in 10 persons who report cannabis have a cannabis use disorder, this figure is rising. Some signs and symptoms of cannabis use disorder include trying but failing to quit using cannabis or giving up important activities with friends and family in favor of using cannabis. The risk of developing cannabis use disorder is stronger in people who start using cannabis during youth or adolescence and who use cannabis more frequently.

Keep Reading: Understanding Your Risk for Cannabis Use Disorder Brain Health Cannabis use directly affects brain function — specifically the parts of the brain responsible for memory, learning, attention, decision making, coordination, emotions, and reaction time. Keep Reading: Cannabis and Brain Health Heart Health. Cannabis can make the heart beat faster and raise blood pressure immediately after use. It could also lead to increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and other vascular diseases. Keep Reading: Cannabis and Heart Health Driving Cannabis, like alcohol, negatively affects several skills required for safe driving. You can choose not to drive — and remind your friends and family to do the same — after using cannabis.
- It can slow reaction time and ability to make decisions.
- Cannabis can impair coordination and distort perception.
- The use of multiple substances at the same time can increase impairment.
- Some studies have shown an association between cannabis use and car crashes; however, more research is needed. Keep Reading: Cannabis and Driving. Lung Health Smoked cannabis, regardless of how it is smoked, can harm lung tissues and cause scarring and damage to small blood vessels. Keep Reading: Cannabis and Lung Health Mental Health Cannabis use has been linked to social anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, but scientists don't yet fully understand the relationships between these mental health disorders and cannabis use.
