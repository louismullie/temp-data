## Question

New recommendations regarding beta blockers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about new recommendations regarding beta-blockers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline landscape and where major societies align or diverge. Then, I should verify condition-specific recommendations: hypertension, heart failure phenotypes, coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, and perioperative care. Next, I will examine precision medicine updates, especially CPIC pharmacogenomics. After that, I should check safety, contraindications, and key drug interactions, including any new safety signals. Finally, I need to synthesize a practical decision framework and note implementation gaps and future directions, making sure I cross-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me set the context first. The most consequential shifts include the ESH 2023 move to elevate beta-blockers to first-line status for hypertension, the continued preference in ESC 2024 for reserving beta-blockers to compelling indications, reinforcement of early beta-blockade in ACS, refined heart failure phenotyping with a clear emphasis on HFrEF benefit but not HFpEF, and the CPIC 2024 guidance introducing genotype-informed metoprolol dosing. Wait, I should also flag the perioperative reassessment and the emerging aortic dissection signal from 2025, both of which warrant cautious interpretation pending replication and alignment with established guidance [^115Jjf5N] [^112JZRK2] [^111AaNUP] [^112KWNTD] [^1154RHLK] [^111Vj4ht].

> Now, hypertension positioning. Hold on, I should verify the split: ESC 2024 recommends initial combination therapy built around a RAS blocker plus a CCB or diuretic, and it reserves beta-blockers for compelling indications like angina, post-MI, HFrEF, or heart rate control, whereas ESH 2023 elevates beta-blockers to the same tier as the other major classes for general use. Meanwhile, Hypertension Canada 2025 endorses initial combinations that do not include beta-blockers as preferred first-line in uncomplicated cases. I need to ensure the controversy about stroke protection is stated accurately: meta-analytic comparisons suggest less stroke protection with beta-blockers compared with some other classes, a point emphasized by critics and nuanced by ESH authors who argue for considering global cardiovascular benefit and BP-lowering equivalence. The practical takeaway is that outside Europe, beta-blockers remain generally non-preferred first-line in uncomplicated hypertension absent compelling indications [^116nKqcH] [^112JZRK2] [^116wAucT] [^1172LuL6] [^115Jjf5N].

> For ACS and chronic coronary disease contexts, I should confirm timing and scope. The 2025 ACC/AHA ACS guideline specifies early oral beta-blocker initiation within 24 hours for ACS patients without contraindications to reduce reinfarction and arrhythmias. Let me check real-world applicability: registry-based analyses suggest over 90% of post-MI patients meet trial-based eligibility for beta-blockers, though prescribing still lags eligibility. This reinforces beta-blockers as core secondary prevention after MI unless contraindicated [^111AaNUP] [^1163QU2a].

> Turning to heart failure, let me think about phenotype. In HFrEF, beta-blockers remain a cornerstone across guidelines alongside RAS inhibition, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors; real-world registries confirm persistent high uptake around 90% or more. Wait, I should verify HFpEF carefully, because I initially thought there was a blanket "no benefit at all" statement. Let me verify: ESC 2024 emphasizes SGLT2 inhibitors as outcome-improving therapy for HFpEF and discusses ARBs/MRAs in selected patients for BP and hospitalization reduction; it does not recommend beta-blockers to improve HFpEF outcomes. So I should correct my wording: there is no guideline-supported beta-blocker outcome benefit in HFpEF; the focus is on SGLT2 inhibitors and BP control with other classes rather than routine beta-blockade for HFpEF per se [^112ZisQb] [^112a6Ugf] [^114Vfgfd] [^1172HN9b].

> For atrial fibrillation, I need to check rate-control guidance. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline continues to endorse beta-blockers as first-line options for long-term rate control, along with nondihydropyridine CCBs, with beta-blockers preferred when HFrEF is present. That aligns with practice patterns and comorbidity-driven selection. I should confirm that rhythm-control strategies and HF phenotype considerations do not alter this foundational rate-control role in most cases, which they do not [^1111A18w].

> Perioperative management has been re-examined. I should confirm the current consensus: continue chronically prescribed beta-blockers through the perioperative period; avoid routine prophylactic initiation in beta-blocker–naïve patients. The STS working group highlights heterogeneity and insufficient granularity in existing datasets, cautioning against using preoperative beta-blockade as a blunt quality metric without better evidence. So, continuation yes, routine new starts no, pending higher-quality real-world data [^112Qc9Kd] [^1154RHLK].

> Precision medicine is a notable new area. Let me verify CPIC's metoprolol-specific recommendations. The 2024 CPIC guideline concludes that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have substantially higher metoprolol exposure with greater heart rate effects, and it provides actionable guidance to reduce dose for poor metabolizers. Importantly, CPIC found insufficient evidence to guide genotype-based prescribing for other beta-blockers or for ADRB1/ADRB2/ADRA2C/GRK4/GRK5 variants at this time. I should emphasize that implementation entails either preemptive or reactive genotyping workflows where available [^112KWNTD] [^115wK5nB] [^115op15J].

> Safety and contraindications need careful confirmation. FDA labeling underscores absolute contraindications such as bronchial asthma, overt cardiac failure or decompensated HF, greater than first-degree AV block, cardiogenic shock, and severe bradycardia. Even cardioselective agents can precipitate bronchospasm in patients with obstructive airway disease, so caution is warranted and many labels advise avoidance. Let me double-check bronchodilator labeling: beta-blockers can blunt beta-agonist effects and trigger severe bronchospasm in asthma, with only cautious use of cardioselective agents when no alternatives exist. These constraints should be front-of-mind in prescribing [^111EpNJr] [^117DA4Kq] [^115v5V7k] [^1173oBUo].

> Key drug–drug interactions should be reviewed next. Hold on, I should verify the high-risk combinations: coadministration with nondihydropyridine CCBs such as verapamil or diltiazem can cause severe bradycardia, high-grade AV block, heart failure, or cardiovascular collapse. Clonidine withdrawal with concurrent beta-blockade can precipitate rebound hypertension. Alpha-blocker first-dose hypotension can be prolonged with beta-blockers, and catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine have additive bradycardia/hypotension. Topical or systemic beta-blockers and other negative chronotropes may potentiate systemic beta-blockade, necessitating close monitoring [^1176kpNu] [^114dtk4a].

> An emerging safety signal requires cautious synthesis. The 2025 JAHA population-based study associates long-term beta-blocker use with a higher risk of both type A and type B aortic dissections among hypertensive patients versus non–beta-blocker antihypertensives, hypothesizing smaller reductions in central aortic pressure and potential aortic wall stiffening. But wait, this conflicts with longstanding post-dissection practice where beta-blockers are first-choice for rate and shear reduction, and with ESC guidance to use nondihydropyridine CCBs only when beta-blockers are contraindicated. I should emphasize this is a provocative observational signal that needs replication and nuanced patient-level confounder assessment before overturning secondary prevention standards in aortic disease [^111Vj4ht] [^116MPFJa] [^113Lp5iH].

> Non-cardiovascular indications remain relevant. Let me confirm migraine prophylaxis: VA/DoD 2024 and AAFP 2025 recommend propranolol and also metoprolol as first-line options for prevention. For rosacea, nonselective beta-blockers may reduce flushing in selected patients, albeit with a less robust evidence base and the same respiratory cautions in susceptible patients. These uses should be individualized with comorbidity screens and interaction checks [^111FTuZ9] [^11363dJ4] [^115WUsd2].

> Pulling this into a decision framework, I need to ensure indications are matched to evidence. Strong, consensus indications include HFrEF, post-MI secondary prevention, symptomatic angina requiring heart rate control, and AF rate control, with hypertension reserving beta-blockers for compelling indications rather than routine first-line outside ESH 2023. Conditional or controversial uses include uncomplicated hypertension as first-line (favored by ESH but generally not by ESC, Canadian, and US guidance), HFpEF where outcome benefit is not established and SGLT2 inhibitors are prioritized, and perioperative initiation which should be avoided in naïve patients. Genotype-guided dosing is actionable for metoprolol in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, with insufficient evidence for other agents [^112ZisQb] [^111AaNUP] [^1111A18w] [^112JZRK2] [^116wAucT] [^112KWNTD].

> Finally, I should review implementation gaps and future directions. Real-world data show persistent underuse of secondary prevention beta-blockers post-MI relative to eligibility, regional variability, and shifting antihypertensive patterns with declining beta-blocker monotherapy following guideline changes. The STS group calls for more granular perioperative data, and the aortic dissection findings demand replication and mechanistic work on central pressure and aortic biomechanics. Expanding and validating pharmacogenomics beyond metoprolol is another clear research need, with health system integration for CPIC-guided dosing [^1163QU2a] [^1137KQLo] [^117AuR32] [^1154RHLK] [^111Vj4ht] [^112KWNTD].

---

Beta-blockers remain essential for HFrEF, post-MI, angina, and AF rate control, but are now **not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension** unless there is a compelling indication [^112JZRK2] [^112ZisQb] [^1111A18w]. They should be **continued perioperatively** if already prescribed, and early oral beta-blockers are recommended in ACS without contraindications [^111AaNUP] [^112Qc9Kd]. For migraine prophylaxis, propranolol or metoprolol are first-line; propranolol is also recommended for essential tremor and considered for rosacea flushing [^11363dJ4] [^111FTuZ9] [^115WUsd2]. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in asthma, severe bradycardia, and heart block, and should be used cautiously with calcium channel blockers and CYP2D6 inhibitors [^111EpNJr] [^1176kpNu].

---

## Cardiovascular indications

### Heart failure

In heart failure, beta-blockers are a cornerstone of therapy for HFrEF, **reducing mortality and hospitalizations**; initiate and titrate to target doses unless contraindicated [^112ZisQb]. They are not routinely recommended for HFpEF and should be used only for specific indications, such as AF or ischemic heart disease.

---

### Myocardial infarction (MI)

In myocardial infarction (MI), beta-blockers should be **initiated early (< 24 hours)** in acute coronary syndromes without contraindications to reduce reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias [^111AaNUP]. This applies when contraindications are absent [^111AaNUP].

---

### Coronary artery disease (CAD) and angina

In coronary artery disease (CAD) with symptomatic angina, beta-blockers are **recommended for symptom control and ischemia reduction** [^112JZRK2]. They serve as antianginal therapy in appropriate patients [^112JZRK2].

---

### Atrial fibrillation (AF)

For atrial fibrillation (AF), beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are recommended for **long-term rate control** [^1111A18w]. Agent selection should be guided by comorbidities [^1111A18w].

---

## Hypertension management

For uncomplicated hypertension, beta-blockers are **no longer first-line** unless there is a compelling indication such as CAD, HF, or AF [^112JZRK2]. They may be considered in resistant hypertension, particularly when heart rate control is needed [^117ADaty].

---

## Perioperative management

Continue beta-blockers **perioperatively** in patients already on therapy to reduce perioperative cardiovascular events [^112Qc9Kd]. Initiation should be reserved for high-risk patients, with careful titration and monitoring.

---

## Non-cardiovascular indications

- **Migraine prophylaxis**: Propranolol or metoprolol are first-line options [^11363dJ4].

- **Essential tremor**: Propranolol is recommended.

- **Rosacea**: Nonselective beta-blockers may reduce flushing symptoms [^115WUsd2].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include asthma, severe bradycardia, heart block, **cardiogenic shock**, and hypersensitivity to beta-blockers [^111EpNJr]. Use beta-blockers cautiously in patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

---

## Drug interactions

Use caution when combining beta-blockers with verapamil or diltiazem due to risk of **bradycardia and heart block** [^1176kpNu]. CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase beta-blocker levels, particularly metoprolol, requiring dose adjustments.

---

## Emerging evidence and future directions

Pharmacogenomic approaches such as **CYP2D6 genotype-guided dosing** for metoprolol are recommended to optimize therapy and minimize adverse effects [^112KWNTD]. Development of novel beta-blockers with improved selectivity and safety profiles is ongoing.

---

In summary, beta-blockers remain essential in HFrEF, post-MI, angina, and AF rate control, while **not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension**; **continue perioperatively** when already prescribed, with use tailored to comorbidities, contraindications, and drug interactions.

Beta-blockers are widely used medications for a variety of indications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Genetic variability in pharmacokinetic (e.g. CYP2D6) and pharmacodynamic (e.g. ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, GRK5) genes has been studied in relation to beta-blocker exposure and response. We searched and summarized the strength of the evidence linking beta-blocker exposure and response with the six genes listed above. The level of evidence was high for associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and both metoprolol exposure and heart rate response. Evidence indicates that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers experience clinically significant greater exposure and a lower heart rate in response to metoprolol compared with those who are not poor metabolizers. Therefore, we provide therapeutic recommendations regarding genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer status and metoprolol therapy. However, there was insufficient evidence to make therapeutic recommendations for CYP2D6 and other beta-blockers or for any beta-blocker and the other five genes evaluated (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).

---

### Inderalla [^1176kpNu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta-blocker are administered a calcium-channel-blocking drug with negative inotropic and/or chronotropic effects. Both agents may depress myocardial contractility or atrioventricular conduction.

There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with the concurrent use of verapamil and beta-blockers. Co-administration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high-degree heart block, and heart failure.

- **ACE inhibitors**: When combined with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta-blockers. Inderal LA should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

- **Alpha blockers**: Prazosin has been associated with the prolongation of first-dose hypotension in the presence of beta-blockers. Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta-blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

- **Reserpine**: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

### Migraine headache prophylaxis [^11363dJ4]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, specifically in relation to migraine prophylaxis, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend offering beta-blockers such as propranolol or metoprolol as a first-line option.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons preoperative beta blocker working group interim report [^1154RHLK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly occurs after cardiac surgery and is associated with multiple adverse outcomes. Older randomized trials suggested that perioperative β-blockade reduced postoperative AF, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) composite measure includes β-blocker administration preoperatively within 24 hours of surgery and at discharge. However, some more recent studies suggest preoperative β-blockade has limited value and question its continuation as an STS quality measure.

- **Methods**: In 2022, an STS preoperative beta blocker working group was formed with representatives from the STS and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists. Published randomized trials, observational studies, societal guidelines, and the state of available data from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD) were reviewed.

- **Results**: Review of existing studies reveals substantial heterogeneity or insufficient detail regarding specific β-blockers used, timing of initiation, management of patients on chronic β-blockade, and whether other proarrhythmic or antiarrhythmic drugs were used concurrently. Further, β-blocker data currently collected in the STS ACSD lack sufficient granularity.

- **Conclusions**: Because a new randomized trial seems unlikely, the working group believes that more granular data on real-world practice would facilitate assessment of the value of preoperative β-blockade, development of best practice recommendations, and evaluation of their continued appropriateness as an STS quality measure.

### Secondary prevention therapies in real-world patients with myocardial infarction: Eligibility based on randomized trials supporting European and American guidelines [^1163QU2a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the applicability of the eligibility criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited in guideline recommendations for a real-world cohort of patients receiving secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction from the EPICOR registries.

- **Methods**: Recommendations provided by American and European guidelines for acute myocardial infarction were categorized into general (applying to all patients) and specific (applying to patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure). Randomized controlled trials cited in these recommendations were selected, and their entry criteria were applied to our international cohort of 18,117 patients.

- **Results**: A total of 91.5% of patients were eligible for beta blockers (84.6% for general, and 5.9% for specific recommendations), 97.7% were eligible for renin-angiotensin system inhibitor recommendations (69.9% for general, 27.9% for specific), and 4.1% were eligible for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (only specific recommendations). The percentages of patients with eligibility criteria who were discharged with a prescription of the recommended therapies were 80%-85% for beta blockers, 70%-75% for ACEI/ARB, and 29% for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. There were large regional variations in the percentage of eligible patients and in those receiving the medications, such as 95% in Northern Europe and 57% in Southeast Asia for beta blockers.

- **Conclusion**: Most real-world acute myocardial infarction patients are eligible for secondary prevention therapies based on RCTs supporting guideline recommendations.

### Clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 genotypes and beta-blocker therapy [^115wK5nB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). High credibility.

Beta‐blockers are widely used medications for the treatment of various cardiovascular and non‐cardiovascular indications, such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, anxiety, and glaucoma. Certain beta‐blockers are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme into mostly inactive metabolites (except for carvedilol, which is metabolized by CYP2D6 into both pharmacologically active and inactive metabolites). Some CYP2D6 genotypes have been associated with higher plasma concentrations of some beta‐blockers, potentially leading to more pronounced effects on vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure.

In addition, genetic variation in the pharmacodynamic genes ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 has also been studied in relation to beta‐blocker pharmacodynamics and clinical response, though the clinical implications of such variation are unclear. The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with information that facilitates the interpretation of clinical genotype test results to guide beta‐blocker prescribing and to discuss the evidence linking genetics to beta‐blocker exposure and response. Detailed guidelines for the use of beta‐blockers, reflections on the cost‐effectiveness of genotyping, or whether to order a genotype test prior to beta‐blocker prescribing are beyond the scope of this document. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC®) guidelines are periodically updated.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116nKqcH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, especially concerning the choice of antihypertensives, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating combination blood pressure-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. It is preferable to combine a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or diuretic. Combination treatment should be avoided in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^111Pn6Qg]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

**BB and trials with combination of antihypertensive drugs**: No specifically designed trial has evaluated the protective effect of combination treatment versus placebo or an untreated patient group. However, in virtually all placebo-controlled trials that show a reduction of cardiovascular outcomes, most patients randomized to the treatment group were given a second and even a third antihypertensive drug after initial monotherapy. This leaves no doubt as to the protective effect of the combination treatment strategy. This conclusion is further supported by a meta-analysis of trials where outcomes were analyzed in relation to the intensity of BP-lowering treatment. The analysis demonstrated reduced outcomes with treatment using three or more drugs versus approximately two drugs, or with two or more drugs versus approximately one antihypertensive drug. Additionally, it has been emphasized that in at least three placebo-controlled trials, β-blockers (BBs) were used in combination with diuretics, resulting in a major reduction of cardiovascular outcomes. Specifically, there was a 40% to 42% reduction in stroke for older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^114Zvivw]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

We address the reasons why, unlike other guidelines, the 2023 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension regard β-blockers (BBs) as major drugs for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system.

- **Reduction of blood pressure**: BBs reduce blood pressure, the main factor responsible for treatment-related protection, not less than other drugs.
- **Reduction of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality**: BBs reduce pooled cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in placebo-controlled trials, where there has also been a sizeable reduction of all major cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes.
- **Global cardiovascular protection**: BBs have been associated with lower global cardiovascular protection in two, but not in several other comparison trials, where the protective effect of BBs versus other major drugs has been similar or even greater. There is a slightly smaller or no difference in global benefit in large trial meta-analyses, with a similar protective effect when comparisons extend to BBs in combination versus other drug combinations.

We mention the large number of cardiac and other comorbidities for which BBs are elective drugs. Criticism is expressed against the exclusion of BBs due to their lower protective effect against stroke in comparison trials, because for still uncertain reasons, differences in protection against cause-specific events (stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease) have been reported for other major drugs. These partial data cannot replace global benefits as the main deciding factor for drug choice, especially in the general hypertensive population.

### Heart failure in Europe: Guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction - the ESC EORP Heart Failure III Registry [^1111XjZc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Low credibility.

In 2016, there were no specific recommendations for any disease-modifying treatment in HFmrEF or HFpEF. Still, a vast majority of patients in HF III received ACEi/ARB and beta-blockers. It is unknown if indications have been primarily HF or some comorbidity such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or diabetic kidney disease. Post-hoc analyses of randomized HFpEF trials, and the 2021 guidelines suggest that use in HFmrEF may be reasonable, whereas in HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%) there appears to be no benefit at all from ARBs or beta-blockers.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^116Y2Yw7]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

In the pharmacological treatment of primary, uncomplicated hypertension — defined as hypertension without an identifiable secondary cause and without diabetes or cardiovascular comorbidity — most international guidelines consider several antihypertensive medication (AHM) classes to be equivalent first-line options. In this context, equivalence refers to comparable average efficacy in lowering blood pressure (BP) and reducing cardiovascular risk at the population level. These classes include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), thiazide diuretics, and, to a lesser extent, beta-blockers. Historically, diuretics and beta-blockers were the most commonly used AHM classes, but more recently, CCBs and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibitors, particularly ACE inhibitors, have gained popularity.

Although guidelines recommend that general practitioners (GPs) select from these equivalent classes, there is a notable lack of research on whether GPs actually perceive these medications as interchangeable — that is, whether they feel free to select any class without a specific guideline-driven rationale — or whether they hold specific preferences when managing primary, uncomplicated hypertension. Variations in prescription patterns may arise based on factors such as patient age, BP levels, or side effects associated with certain AHM classes.

Exploring clinical expertise — a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine — could offer valuable insights into how GPs implement guidelines.

### Implementation of guideline-recommended therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction according to heart failure duration: An analysis of 55 581 patients from the Swedish Heart Failure (SwedeHF) registry [^112a6Ugf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

Use of heart failure therapies in the entire population varies according to the duration of heart failure. Within the intervals of less than 3 months, 3 to 12 months, and more than 12 months from heart failure diagnosis, the distribution of patients on various therapies was as follows: RASI or ARNI usage was 93%, 92%, 90%, and 89%; ARNI alone was 9.8%, 17%, 19%, and 22%; MRA was 35%, 43%, 44%, and 46%; beta-blockers were 92%, 92%, 92%, and 91%; and SGLT2i was 26%, 30%, 19%, and 28%, respectively.

- **Therapy use in patients with heart failure duration greater than 12 months**: These patients were more often prescribed diuretics (83%) and digoxin (16%). They were also more likely to have undergone cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or received implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) (18%).

Over these time periods, there was a slight increase in the number of patients on RASI or ARNI and beta-blockers across all groups. Notably, there was a more substantial increase in the use of MRA, with 46% of patients having a heart failure duration of less than 3 months on MRA between 2017 and 2021. Since ARNI became available for prescription in Sweden in 2016, its use has increased over time (from 0.7% to 11%) within 3 months of diagnosis. A simultaneous decline in RASI usage was observed, with a similar degree of change across all heart failure duration groups. The use of CRT or ICD also increased over time.

### Ventolinhfa [^115v5V7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

- **Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents**: Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as Ventolin HFA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Non–potassium-sparing diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Ventolin HFA with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.

- **Digoxin**: Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical relevance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving inhalers remains to be fully understood.

### Emergency medicine updates: Cardiac arrest medications [^1171dQCu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a serious condition frequently managed in the emergency department (ED). Medications are a component of cardiac arrest management. This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning medications used for patients in cardiac arrest.

Several medications have been evaluated for use in cardiac arrest. Routes of administration may include intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO). IV administration is recommended; however, if an attempt at IV access is unsuccessful, IO access can be utilized. Epinephrine is a core component of guidelines, which recommend 1 mg in those with shockable rhythms if initial CPR and defibrillation are unsuccessful. In nonshockable rhythms, guidelines recommend that epinephrine 1 mg be administered as soon as feasible. While epinephrine may improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), it is not associated with improved survival with a favorable neurologic outcome.

Evidence suggests the combination of vasopressin, steroids, and epinephrine may improve ROSC among those with in-hospital cardiac arrest, but there is no improvement in survival to discharge and survival with a favorable neurologic outcome. Antiarrhythmics, such as amiodarone, lidocaine, and procainamide, likely do not improve short-term or long-term survival or neurologic outcomes, though guidelines state that amiodarone may be used in those with cardiac arrest and refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Calcium and sodium bicarbonate should not be routinely administered in those with cardiac arrest.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^114Vfgfd]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically concerning hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors. These are advised not only for their modest blood pressure-lowering properties but also to improve outcomes in patients with hypertension and symptomatic HFpEF.

### The ABCs of the 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease [^1173Lz3K]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Angina**: In the management of patients with CCD and stable angina, three primary goals should be at the forefront of any therapeutic strategy: the relief of angina symptoms, the prevention of nonfatal occurrences like MI, and improving long-term survival rates.

The contemporary strategies for managing CCD include revascularization, pharmacological treatment, or a synergistic approach that integrates both modalities. A systematic review has identified key survival predictors in CCD, including the anatomical and functional severity of the condition, LV function, and comorbidities such as diabetes and renal impairment. Management strategies should be customized to each patient's unique clinical profile. Some individuals may benefit from an integrated approach that combines multiple therapeutic interventions, while for others, a single treatment modality may be more advantageous. For example, in patients with CCD with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) or significant left main stenosis, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to offer a survival advantage compared with medical therapy alone.

Revascularization approaches, including PCI or CABG, as well as pharmacologic approaches, reduce symptoms of angina-related CCD, although medical optimization is always recommended as the first-line intervention before procedural interventions. This was previously emphasized by the results of three major RCTs: COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation), ISCHEMIA (The International Study of Comparative Effectiveness).

### Clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 genotypes and beta-blocker therapy [^115op15J]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). High credibility.

Beta-blockers, also known as beta adrenoreceptor antagonists, are a class of drugs used for both cardiac (e.g. angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure) and non-cardiac indications (e.g. anxiety, essential tremor, glaucoma, migraine prophylaxis). Metoprolol was the sixth most prescribed drug overall in the United States, with 65.5 million prescriptions in 2021. Four other beta-blockers (carvedilol, atenolol, propranolol, and timolol) were also among the top 200 drugs prescribed in the United States in 2021.

Beta-blockers are classified as beta-1 selective, or "cardioselective", if they predominantly antagonize beta-1 receptors (primarily located in cardiac tissue) at clinically used doses. They are classified as "non-selective" if they antagonize both the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, which are primarily located in smooth muscle tissue and also expressed in the heart. Examples of "non-selective" beta-blockers include carvedilol, labetalol, and propranolol. "Beta-1 selective" agents include atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. Notable adverse effects caused by beta-adrenoreceptor blockade include bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, depression, erectile dysfunction, and acute bronchospasm.

The guideline writing committee conducted a systematic evaluation of the data linking genetic variation with beta-blocker exposure and response.

### Hypertension Canada guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in adults in primary care [^116wAucT]. Canadian Pharmacists Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically regarding the choice of antihypertensives, the HC 2025 guidelines recommend initiating low-dose combination therapy. Ideally, this should be in the form of a single-pill combination as the initial treatment for adult patients with hypertension requiring pharmacotherapy. This includes drugs from two of the following three complementary classes of medications: ACE inhibitors or ARBs, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### Thirty-five years of the European Society of Hypertension: From past to future [^114a4kHy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977, when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised a few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the 20th century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies.

The first guideline document prepared by European societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH, together with the European Society of Cardiology, jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013, and 2018, the latter being, as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering elements of novelty. These include:

- **Emergent therapies**: Introduction of new pharmacological treatments and updated recommendations on existing therapies.
- **Holistic approaches**: Emphasis on the integration of lifestyle modifications with medical treatment.
- **Technological advancements**: Utilization of telemedicine and home-based monitoring systems in patient care.

This continuous evolution of guidelines highlights the European Society of Hypertension's commitment to enhancing clinical practice and improving patient outcomes.

### Prazosin hydrochloride [^114KCQLN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prazosin hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

### For debate: The 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines - cause for concern [^116v3Bxa]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

When beta-blockers became available around 1965, they were considered a significant breakthrough as they were much more tolerable than the drugs then in use, such as adrenergic neuron blockers like bethanidine or methyldopa. However, it has become apparent that beta-blockers are associated with an insidious onset of lethargy and reduced exercise tolerance. Patients also reported sleep disturbances. There was also more sexual dysfunction observed in the beta-blocker arms of various trials. A notable excess of new diabetes cases in patients receiving beta-blockers for hypertension control is a significant concern. This may explain their clinical inferiority to calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Although newer generations of beta-blockers may be safer, evidence from clinical trials supporting their use as first-line agents for hypertension, including those with physiologically higher heart rates, is lacking. Recommending them based on pathophysiological considerations and limited observational studies may put patients at risk.

The 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines argue in favor of beta-blockers, suggesting that their clinical inferiority was merely due to lesser blood pressure (BP) reduction achieved in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) rather than a class effect. BP values were lower throughout the ASCOT-BPLA trial in the amlodipine-based group, with an average difference of 2.7/1.9 mmHg. In the LIFE study, BP fell by 30.2/16.6 mmHg in the losartan group and by 29.1/16.8 mmHg in the atenolol group (P = 0.017 for systolic blood pressure, not significant for diastolic blood pressure). Even if the lesser BP-lowering effects of beta-blockers played a role, this would still be another disadvantage. Every 5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure…

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^115Jjf5N]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

One of the major novelties in the recently published 2023 guidelines on hypertension by the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) is the upgrading of β-blockers (BBs) for use in the general hypertensive population. BBs are now positioned at the same level as other major antihypertensive drug classes, such as thiazides or thiazide-like (chlortalidone and indapamide) diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). This contrasts with the recommendations of several other hypertension guidelines, which placed BBs in the second, third, and even fourth treatment steps.

However, it should not be dismissed that BBs have always been regarded as important drugs for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment in previous ESH guidelines, issued jointly with the European Society of Cardiology since 2003. For example, in the 2018 guidelines, it was mentioned that, like other antihypertensive drugs, BBs have demonstrated the ability to effectively reduce blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials and can thus be indicated as one of the main antihypertensive drugs alongside the other four drug classes.

In the 2018 guidelines, however, BBs were not included in the frontline of the main antihypertensive treatment algorithm. Their recommended use was primarily restricted to special conditions such as associated cardiac diseases, including heart failure (HF), angina, and post-myocardial infarction.

### G protein-coupled receptors: A century of research and discovery [^116Hmaw3]. Circulation Research (2024). High credibility.

Beta-blockers are among the most widely used therapeutics for numerous diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Initially, the use of beta-blockers for heart failure was considered a contraindication. It took nearly 30 years from the discovery of beta-blockers to the first clinical trials for use in heart failure. In the 1990s, some of the earliest beta-blocker clinical trials of metoprolol were associated with lower mortality rates. This finding reinvigorated interest in beta-blockers, leading to the development of a third-generation beta-blocker, carvedilol, which was shown to reduce cardiovascular-related hospitalization and death.

Carvedilol is an FDA-approved beta-blocker, but the complexities of its pharmacology are still being uncovered. At the β2 adrenergic receptor (AR), carvedilol acts as a β-arrestin-biased agonist with inverse agonism for G⍺s signaling. At the β1 AR, carvedilol displays β-arrestin-biased signaling dependent on G⍺i, regulates microRNA processing, activates ERK signaling, and provides cardioprotection in response to ischemia-reperfusion. β1 AR-mediated β-arrestin transactivation of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) requires β-arrestin and GRK5 and/or 6. Activation of this transactivation pathway is cardioprotective against catecholamine toxicity.

Though it has been reported that carvedilol can activate G⍺s, such findings have not been observed in most physiologically relevant systems and run counter to numerous clinical studies showing that beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are associated with adverse outcomes.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^112EBvTr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac failure: Sympathetic stimulation is necessary to support circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility, which can precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and their response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be withdrawn.

- **Renal and hepatic disease and electrolyte disturbances**: Since atenolol is excreted via the kidneys, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. As cumulative effects may develop in the presence of impaired renal function, if progressive renal impairment becomes evident, atenolol and chlorthalidone should be discontinued. In patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, minor alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Atenolol and chlorthalidone should be used with caution in these patients.

- **Ischemic heart disease**: Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease, exacerbations of angina can occur.

### Beta blockers as primary and secondary prevention for aortic dissections in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension [^111Vj4ht]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

- **Discussion**:
	- **Substudy 1: Beta blockers as primary prevention**:
		For decades, guidelines have recommended beta blockers as first-choice preventive therapy to reduce aortic root dilation and progression to AD based on smaller randomized controlled trials on syndromic populations, although their findings have been contradictory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based and nationwide study evaluating the effect of long-term beta blocker exposure in relation to the risk of AD, and not in a selected cohort of syndromic patients.

		In the presented study, long-term use of beta blockers was associated with a significant increased risk for TAAD and TBAD by 1.7-fold and 3.7-fold compared with matched patients with hypertension never treated with beta blockers, respectively. Due to the comparative design, this finding suggests that other antihypertensive agents than beta blockers are more likely to be effective as primary prevention for AD in hypertensives.

		Beta blockers are likely to cause a smaller decrease in central (aortic) systolic blood pressure compared with other antihypertensives. Additionally, experimental studies suggest chronic beta blocker exposure causes matrix changes stiffening the thoracic aortic wall. Because aortic wall stiffening predicts aortic aneurysm failure, the increased occurrence of dissections observed in long-term beta blocker users may be due to such stiffening.

	- **Substudy 2: Beta blockers as secondary prevention**:
		This study found treatment with beta blockers in survivors of AD with hypertension to be associated with increased all-cause mortality.

### Edarbi [^117SKrKM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Edarbi is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which this drug principally belongs. However, there are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction specifically with Edarbi.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management. This includes, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: Analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^1137KQLo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Among 15 health care institutions across the United States, we evaluated trends of antihypertensive prescriptions using electronic health records and found an increasing trend of monotherapy, which was 35% higher (95% CI, 32%–38%) in 2019 compared with 2010. We also observed decreasing trends of polytherapy and fixed-dose combinations (FDC). A higher probability of uncontrolled blood pressure and receipt of polytherapy and FDC was observed among Black patients compared with White patients. Consistent with recommendations by the JNC 8, the use of beta blockers decreased after 2014, and the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) among Black patients increased after 2014. In contrast to the recommended guideline, the use of thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients. Despite the recommendations by the American Society of Hypertension and ACC/AHA, the use of FDC and dual therapy among patients with elevated blood pressure declined after 2017.

### Clinical efficacy of beta-1 selective beta-blockers versus propranolol in patients with thyroid storm: A retrospective cohort study [^111A37Kd]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is the most severe manifestation of thyrotoxicosis. Beta-blockers are among the standard treatment regimens for this condition, with propranolol being the historically preferred option. However, the 2016 guidelines issued by the Japan Thyroid Association and the Japan Endocrine Society recommend the use of beta-1 selective beta-blockers over nonselective beta-blockers, such as propranolol. Nevertheless, evidence supporting this recommendation is limited. This study aimed to investigate the in-hospital mortality of patients with thyroid storm based on the choice of beta-blockers.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: The Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a national inpatient database in Japan.
- **Patients**: Patients hospitalized with thyroid storm between April 2010 and March 2022.
- **Interventions**: Propensity-score overlap weighting was performed to compare in-hospital mortality between patients who received beta-1 selective beta-blockers and those who received propranolol. Subgroup analysis was also conducted, considering the presence or absence of acute heart failure.
- **Measurements and main results**: Among the 2462 eligible patients, 1452 received beta-1 selective beta-blockers and 1010 received propranolol. The crude in-hospital mortality rates were 9.3% for the beta-1 selective beta-blocker group and 6.2% for the propranolol group. After adjusting for baseline variables, the use of beta-1 selective beta-blockers was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality (6.3% vs. 7.4%; odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.57–1.26).

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^117JASUL]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly concerning patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and acute treatment, indications, and blood pressure (BP) targets, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of early BP lowering with BP-lowering therapy within the first 24 hours in patients with AIS as follows:

- **Reperfusion therapy eligibility**: Lower BP carefully and maintain it at < 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours after treatment in patients eligible for reperfusion therapy with intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy.

- **Patients not receiving reperfusion treatment**: Lower BP carefully by approximately 15% during the first 24 hours after stroke onset in patients not receiving reperfusion treatment and with a BP of ≥ 220/110 mmHg.

### Beta blockers as primary and secondary prevention for aortic dissections in nonsyndromic patients with hypertension [^116MPFJa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when a tear in the aortic intima allows blood to flow in a dissection plane between the aortic wall layers. The Stanford classification distinguishes between AD type A (TAAD) involving the ascending aorta and AD type B (TBAD), which enters distally to the left subclavian artery without ascending aortic involvement.

In the newly released guidelines on aortic diseases, the recommendations for secondary medical treatment after AD remain unchanged from earlier guidelines. In AD survivors, long‐term beta blocker treatment (unless contraindicated) is recommended as first‐choice therapy to control heart rate and blood pressure to reduce late aortic‐related adverse events. This recommendation relies mainly on expert opinion, historical observational studies, and smaller interventional studies performed in animal models and syndromic patients.

Moreover, the updated guidelines underscore the importance of timely identification of patients at increased risk of AD, for example, through screening of first‐degree relatives of patients diagnosed with large aortic aneurysms. Several genes are involved in nonsyndromic hereditary thoracic aortic diseases. Hence, primary prophylactic long‐term treatment with beta blockers in nonsyndromic patients is anticipated to increase, though evidence‐based recommendations for antihypertensive preferences for this specific patient population remain to be established.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between long‐term use of beta blockers and AD in a source population of Danish citizens.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116Uiyap]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, particularly concerning the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend intensifying treatment to a three-drug combination. This typically includes a renin-angiotensin system blocker, a dihydropyridine CCB, and a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic, preferably in a single-pill combination, if blood pressure is not controlled with a two-drug combination.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^115mfr53]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

The multiple important data in favor of β-blockers (BBs) that have been discussed in this article justify their inclusion among the major drugs to be used for the treatment of hypertension, at the same level as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). This inclusion also has the advantage of increasing the number of options available to physicians for effectively lowering elevated blood pressure through mono or combination therapy, thereby achieving cardiovascular protection in a greater number of patients.

While the inconveniences of BBs, such as treatment discontinuation, lesser protection against subclinical organ damage, and dysmetabolic effects, should be appropriately considered, they should not be used as exclusion criteria. This approach avoids a double standard of judgment that has never regarded the same inconveniences as a problem for the use of diuretics. Similarly, the lesser protective effect of BBs against stroke should not overshadow their effective overall cardiovascular protection, nor should it ignore the fact that different protective effects against cause-specific events characterize all major drugs.

### Xopenex HFA [^1173oBUo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with Xopenex HFA. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, such as Xopenex HFA, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop and thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.

- **Digoxin**: Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers.

### Clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 genotypes and beta-blocker therapy [^114A6uAS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). High credibility.

In ADRB1, p. Ser49Gly and p. Gly389Arg are among the most studied variants, with the "Gly" allele at both locations leading to decreased cAMP production after beta-1 receptor stimulation in vitro — somewhat endogenously mimicking the effect of beta-blockers. Thus, patients with the p. Ser49 or p. Arg389 alleles would be expected to exhibit a greater pharmacologic response to beta-blockers. Nevertheless, the evidence does not consistently support that these variants affect either beta-blocker dosage requirements or response as indicated by heart rate, blood pressure, or echocardiographic measures in patients. The data related to ADRB1 and the clinical outcomes of beta-blocker treated patients are more conflicting, particularly in heart failure, the patient population most studied.

The writing committee noted a trend in the clinical outcomes evidence, depending on whether the studies evaluated beta-blocker response by dose level vs. as a binary variable (i.e. receiving beta-blocker treatment or not). Of the studies that reported significant associations between p. Gly389Arg and cardiovascular outcomes, nearly all of them analyzed beta-blocker response by dose level in their analyses. When treated with low-dose beta-blockers, patients with the p.389Arg/Arg genotype experienced significantly worse outcomes than those with other genotypes; no similar associations were observed at higher doses. On the other hand, almost no studies that analyzed beta-blocker use as a binary variable (yes/no) reported p. Gly389Arg associations with clinical outcomes. Thus, it is possible that…

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^1172LuL6]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

- **Bb and cause-specific outcomes in randomized comparison trials**: The 2023 ESH guidelines note that meta-analyses of trials comparing β-blockers (BBs) with other antihypertensive drugs consistently show that BBs reduce the risk of stroke less effectively than other antihypertensive agents, indicating a relative increase in BB-related risk. However, this is just one of many between-drug differences in the ability of major antihypertensive agents to protect against cause-specific outcomes that have emerged in the meta-analysis era. For instance, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) have been found to be significantly less protective against the risk of stroke but more protective against the risk of coronary disease. BBs have been shown to be less protective, while blockers of the renin-angiotensin system are more protective against the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure.

	- Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been associated with greater protection against stroke but lower protection against heart failure (HF) compared to other drugs, while diuretics have shown a greater reduction in the risk of HF compared to all other drugs combined, especially when compared with CCBs. In one of the largest available meta-analyses, BBs were reported to provide significantly greater protection against coronary disease than all other drugs in patients with a history of a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, in the same meta-analysis, the increased risk of stroke observed when BBs were compared with other major antihypertensive drugs became non-significant when CCBs were excluded, and BBs were compared with pooled data of other drugs.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^1175obfR]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

For specific cases of hypertension, particularly concerning patients with myocardial infarction, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating β-blockers and renin-angiotensin system blockers. These should be included as part of the treatment regimen for patients with a history of myocardial infarction who require blood pressure-lowering treatment.

---

### Arbli [^111GwhEb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Arbli is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a diverse range of pharmacologic classes, including losartan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from various pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, rather than any other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for these benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been consistently observed.

### Exelon [^112wRsyN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant use with metoclopramide, beta-blockers, or cholinomimetics and anticholinergic medications is not recommended [see section 7.1, 7.2, 7.3].

- **Metoclopramide**: Due to the risk of additive extra-pyramidal adverse reactions, the concomitant use of metoclopramide and Exelon patch is not recommended.

- **Cholinomimetic and anticholinergic medications**: Exelon patch may increase the cholinergic effects of other cholinomimetic medications and may also interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine). Concomitant use of Exelon patch with medications having these pharmacologic effects is not recommended unless deemed clinically necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Beta-blockers**: Additive bradycardic effects resulting in syncope may occur when Exelon is used concomitantly with beta-blockers, especially cardioselective beta-blockers (including atenolol). Concomitant use is not recommended when signs of bradycardia, including syncope, are present.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines [^116YVk6z]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

The ability to reduce BP

β-blockers (BBs) reduce office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs. As can be found in the references quoted by the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines, evidence is available that their BP-lowering effectiveness extends to out-of-office (ambulatory and home) BP values and use in combination treatments. This is an issue of paramount importance for antihypertensive treatment recommendations because the protective effect of BP-lowering interventions in patients with a BP elevation largely depends on BP reduction per se, regardless of how it is obtained. This can be inferred from the observation that, despite major differences in the antihypertensive drugs used, the BP reduction documented by meta-analyses of antihypertensive treatment trials exhibits a linear relationship with the reduction of hypertension-related cardiovascular outcomes.

### Inderalla [^117DA4Kq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Propranolol is contraindicated in the following conditions:

- **Cardiogenic shock**: Propranolol should not be used as it can exacerbate the condition.
- **Sinus bradycardia and greater than first-degree block**: Patients with these conditions should avoid propranolol due to the potential for serious heart complications.
- **Bronchial asthma**: Propranolol can induce severe bronchospasms, making it unsuitable for patients with this condition.
- **Known hypersensitivity to propranolol hydrochloride**: Patients with such hypersensitivity should not take propranolol due to the risk of allergic reactions.

### For debate: The 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines - cause for concern [^111W8yEP]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Sadly, all the guideline committees from the United States, the UK, and Europe largely comprise hospital-based specialists. In contrast, most patients with hypertension are managed exclusively in primary care settings because they are less likely to have cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Hospital-based hypertension specialists are more likely to encounter more complex cases, many of whom may have suffered the vascular complications of hypertension. The re-endorsement of beta-blockers for uncomplicated hypertension might not have happened if more primary care physicians had had greater input into the preparation of the guidelines.

To some extent, arguments about first-line drugs are of only limited use as, in most patients, double or triple therapy is necessary to bring blood pressure under control. However, beta-blockers are only required if there is concomitant heart disease. In primary healthcare, such patients are in the minority. Hence, the return of beta-blockers as a first-line option for the management of uncomplicated hypertension by the European Society of Hypertension is a cause for concern and should be reconsidered.

### Minoxidil [^116yq7K1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant therapy: diuretic and beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant.

- **Diuretics**: Minoxidil must be used in conjunction with a diuretic in patients relying on renal function for maintaining salt and water balance. Diuretics have been used at the following dosages when starting therapy with minoxidil: hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg, b.i.d.) or other thiazides at equi-effective dosage; chlorthalidone (50 mg to 100 mg, once daily); furosemide (40 mg, b.i.d.). If excessive salt and water retention results in a weight gain of more than 5 pounds, diuretic therapy should be changed to furosemide; if the patient is already taking furosemide, dosage should be increased in accordance with the patient's requirements.

- **Beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressants**: When therapy with minoxidil is begun, the dosage of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug should be the equivalent of 80 mg to 160 mg of propranolol per day in divided doses. If beta-blockers are contraindicated, methyldopa (250 mg to 750 mg, b.i.d.) may be used instead. Methyldopa must be given for at least 24 hours before starting therapy with minoxidil because of the delay in the onset of methyldopa's action. Limited clinical experience indicates that clonidine may also be used to prevent tachycardia induced by minoxidil; the usual dosage is 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg twice daily. Sympathetic nervous system suppressants may not completely prevent an increase in heart rate due to minoxidil but usually do prevent tachycardia.

### Istalol [^114dtk4a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Potentiated systemic beta-blockade, such as decreased heart rate, has been reported during combined treatment with quinidine and timolol.

- **Beta-adrenergic blocking agents**: Patients receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Istalol should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended.

- **Calcium antagonists**: Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as Istalol, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided.

- **Catecholamine-depleting drugs**: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia.

### For debate: The 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines - cause for concern [^113ioh1e]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Originally, beta-blockers were equally ranked alongside other antihypertensive drug classes. This changed when two major long-term randomized controlled trials, ASCOT-BPLA and LIFE, showed that patients receiving beta-blocker-based regimes suffered 25–30% more strokes than those receiving calcium channel blocker-based or angiotensin receptor blocker-based regimes. The inferiority of beta-blockers in stroke prevention was not due to differences in blood pressure control during the follow-up period in both trials.

The 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines still argue in favor of beta-blockers, suggesting that their clinical inferiority is due to lesser blood pressure reduction rather than a class effect. The analysis argues that the return of beta-blockers as a first-line option for the management of uncomplicated hypertension by the ESH is a cause for concern and should be reconsidered.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: Analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^117AuR32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, there is no study that evaluated the change in antihypertensive prescribing trends after ACC/AHA, and only two studies examined the effect of the JNC 8 report on prescribing trends in the United States, both of which used Medicare claims data from hypertensive patients aged 66 years and older. Despite having much older study populations compared with our study, both studies identified ACE inhibitor/ARB as the most prevalent monotherapy, followed by beta blockers, which was comparable with our findings.

Anderson et al. used time-series analysis from 2008 to 2017 and observed an increasing trend of ACE inhibitor, ARB, or CCB as initial monotherapy, which predates the JNC 8 report, and an even more rapid upward trend of CCB and decreasing trends of beta blockers, thiazide diuretics, and combination therapy post JNC 8. Colvin et al. applied a serial cross-sectional analysis from 2011 to 2021 and found a decreasing trend for beta blockers and an increasing trend for CCBs.

In our study, we had some consistent results with these prior studies. We found that CCB monotherapy prescriptions increased among Black patients after guideline recommendations. However, the use of beta blockers as monotherapy remained high and showed only a modest decrease. Additionally, the use of thiazide diuretics among Black patients did not increase as recommended by guidelines.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^112zmAMa]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

- **Other therapeutic advantages and inconveniences of β-blockers**: Like all therapeutically effective drugs, β-blockers (BBs) are not immune from clinical inconveniences. Firstly, BBs are less effective than other major antihypertensive drugs on the regression of subclinical organ damage. Secondly, BBs have a less favorable tolerability profile compared with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), leading to reduced exercise ability, fatigue, cold extremities, etc. in both younger and older patients. This results in a greater risk of treatment discontinuation, as it is closely associated with the incidence of side effects. Thirdly, BBs favor the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in predisposed patients, such as those with metabolic syndrome.

	- Finally, due to a possible reduction of peripheral blood flow and the size of the bronchial tree, BBs have long been contraindicated in conditions such as peripheral artery disease or obstructive lung disease. The 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines regard these effects as therapeutic disadvantages that may reduce or avoid the use of BBs in specific conditions or some patients. However, they do not consider these issues a reason to exclude BBs from the main antihypertensive treatment algorithm. In this context, relevant arguments include that some side effects of BBs have been overestimated and that it is now widely accepted that BBs can be used with no substantial safety problems for respiratory function or lower limb perfusion in obstructive lung disease and peripheral artery disease, where they may provide better protection against coronary disease, which is common in these patients.

### Clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 genotypes and beta-blocker therapy [^111RUqJJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are widely used medications for various indications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Genetic variability in pharmacokinetic (e.g. CYP2D6) and pharmacodynamic (e.g. ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, GRK5) genes has been studied in relation to beta-blocker exposure and response. We searched and summarized the strength of the evidence linking beta-blocker exposure and response with the six genes listed above.

The level of evidence was high for associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and both metoprolol exposure and heart rate response. Evidence indicates that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers experience clinically significant greater exposure and lower heart rate in response to metoprolol compared with those who are not poor metabolizers. Therefore, we provide therapeutic recommendations regarding genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer status and metoprolol therapy. However, there was insufficient evidence to make therapeutic recommendations for CYP2D6 and other beta-blockers or for any beta-blocker and the other five genes evaluated.

### Rationale for the inclusion of β-blockers among major antihypertensive drugs in the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^114Lawb4]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

This paper addresses the reasons why, unlike other guidelines, the 2023 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension regard β-blockers (BBs) as major drugs for the treatment of hypertension, placing them at the same level as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system.

We argue that BBs (1) reduce blood pressure (the main factor responsible for treatment-related protection) to a similar extent as other drugs, (2) reduce pooled cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in placebo-controlled trials, which also show a significant reduction of all major cause-specific cardiovascular outcomes, (3) have been associated with a lower global cardiovascular protection in two but not in several other comparison trials, where the protective effect of BBs versus other major drugs has been similar or even greater, with a slightly smaller or no difference in global benefit in large trial meta-analyses, and a similar protective effect when comparisons extend to BBs in combination versus other drug combinations.

We mention the large number of cardiac and other comorbidities for which BBs are elective drugs. We express criticism against the exclusion of BBs due to their lower protective effect against stroke in comparison trials, as differences in protection against cause-specific events (stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease) have been reported for other major drugs for still uncertain reasons. These partial data cannot replace global benefits as the main deciding factor for drug choice, particularly in the general hypertensive population.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^117ADaty]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically in the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of eplerenone instead of spironolactone. If blood pressure is not controlled with a three-drug combination and spironolactone is not effective or tolerated, the addition of a β-blocker is suggested if not already indicated. Subsequently, a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an α-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be considered.
