## Question

Patient is allergic to amoxicillin unknown reaction the next best step

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next best step is for a patient who reports an amoxicillin allergy when the reaction is unknown, including when to use a direct oral challenge versus penicillin skin testing and what to do next based on risk stratification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and baseline risk. Then, I should verify the key historical features that drive risk categorization. Next, I will compare evidence-based pathways for low-risk versus high-risk histories. After that, I need to outline the challenge or testing protocols and post-test actions. I should also consider special populations, documentation and delabeling, and the issue of resensitization before giving a concise, risk-based recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. Most penicillin allergy labels are inaccurate; about 8–15% of patients report a penicillin allergy, but roughly 90–95% are not truly allergic on evaluation, and drug challenges show that about 94% tolerate penicillins without adverse reactions, which supports an initial low pretest probability in many "unknown reaction" cases [^1147NCUb] [^1162mEkJ].

> I need to check the critical elements of history for risk stratification because a vague label requires methodical probing. Timing since the index event, the presence or absence of anaphylaxis features, the morphology and timing of cutaneous symptoms, medical interventions required, age at reaction, and any subsequent uneventful β-lactam exposures are the anchors that will determine whether a direct amoxicillin challenge or penicillin skin testing is the safer next step, and I should confirm that severe cutaneous adverse reactions are not in the history before proceeding down any challenge pathway [^1135ZxjZ] [^1116Wzeq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the evidence-based thresholds that define low versus high risk. Low-risk histories typically include distant, benign cutaneous-only reactions or unknown but non-severe features, with adults often using a " > 10 years" threshold in some trials and pediatric pathways using " > 1 year", whereas AAAAI 2022 permits direct amoxicillin challenge for adults when the history is distant (> 5 years) and benign cutaneous, which is slightly less conservative than the RCT that used > 10 years for adults; initially I thought > 10 years was always required, but the current practice parameters accept > 5 years for benign cutaneous histories in adults, and children with benign cutaneous histories generally proceed without prior skin testing, which aligns the guidance with a more permissive, risk-based approach [^111CydWg] [^115HSywW] [^115ygF4x] [^1135ZxjZ].

> Given a low-risk "unknown reaction" scenario without features of anaphylaxis or SCARs, I should confirm that a direct oral amoxicillin challenge is supported as the next best step. Randomized and prospective data show high safety and efficiency for direct graded challenges in low-risk patients, with immediate allergic reactions occurring in about 2.6–4.8% and typically mild, and with time savings versus a skin test first approach; the AAAAI 2022 practice parameter explicitly endorses direct amoxicillin challenge for distant benign cutaneous histories in adults and for many pediatric benign cutaneous histories without prior skin testing, which is consistent with stewardship and patient-centered efficiency [^111CydWg] [^111R8efY] [^115HSywW] [^115ygF4x].

> Wait, let me verify the practical protocol for a direct graded challenge to ensure it is both safe and standardized. A common approach is a two-step graded oral amoxicillin challenge with approximately one-tenth of the therapeutic dose followed by the full dose if no reaction occurs, with monitored observation after each step and immediate access to epinephrine and antihistamines; observation windows of 30–60 minutes per step are typical in published protocols and trials, and this aligns with the outpatient RCT methodology for predefined low-risk patients [^111CydWg] [^111R8efY].

> If the history is high-risk or uncertain for IgE-mediated reactions, I should confirm that penicillin skin testing is the appropriate next step before any challenge. Testing should include the major determinant (PPL) plus minor determinants (e.g., penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate) and amoxicillin to optimize sensitivity; the negative predictive value of comprehensive skin testing is about 97–99%, and the procedure has a low rate of systemic adverse events, which supports its role as a gatekeeper in higher-risk histories [^111WoAJA] [^112VGsGT] [^1169e4sL].

> Next, I should review actions after skin testing. If skin testing is negative, a supervised graded oral amoxicillin challenge is indicated to confirm tolerance; if skin testing is positive and the β-lactam is essential, desensitization is recommended, whereas if it is not essential, a non–cross-reactive alternative such as aztreonam can be used, and cephalosporin selection should be guided by side-chain dissimilarity to minimize cross-reactivity risks, with modern data indicating negligible cross-allergy with many second- and third-generation cephalosporins and a side-chain–based approach improving safety [^1143HUu8] [^114cHE93] [^1172WSHK] [^116JM5WG].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. For children, especially under five, direct oral challenge without prior skin testing is reasonable in low-risk histories and has shown excellent safety in prospective cohorts, while pregnant patients benefit substantially from delabeling to allow penicillin or cefazolin for GBS prophylaxis rather than suboptimal alternatives; by contrast, patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis should not undergo direct challenge initially and should start with penicillin skin testing, with hospital-based challenge only if testing is negative and the clinical need is compelling [^111CydWg] [^113uQLaw] [^1135ZxjZ].

> I should confirm the importance of documentation and delabeling because it changes future care. When a challenge is negative, the penicillin allergy label should be removed in the EMR, and the patient should receive written confirmation and counseling about safe future β-lactam use, which improves antibiotic selection, reduces costs, and enhances outcomes; proactive delabeling is an explicit stewardship recommendation in current guidelines and is supported by pharmaco-economic analyses [^111CJUvU] [^112MusQz].

> But wait, what about resensitization after a negative evaluation; do we need routine retesting. The best available evidence indicates that resensitization can occur but is uncommon overall and more likely after severe immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis; consensus statements suggest considering retesting in patients with strong IgE-mediated histories or severe reactions, especially if repeat β-lactam courses are anticipated, while routine retesting is not required for low-risk patients after a tolerated challenge, although some algorithms advise retesting 2–8 weeks after severe immediate reactions with initially negative tests [^113WjnNd] [^111d6NHZ] [^1116Wzeq].

> Stepping back, I should double-check that the final recommendation aligns with both the evidence base and guideline direction. For adults with an unknown, likely benign remote history and no features of anaphylaxis or SCARs, a direct graded oral amoxicillin challenge is the most efficient, guideline-concordant next step; for recent reactions, any anaphylaxis features, or worrisome histories, proceed with comprehensive penicillin skin testing first, then challenge if negative, and if positive, either desensitize when penicillin is essential or use a non–cross-reactive alternative, with cephalosporin selection informed by side-chain structure when needed [^111CydWg] [^115HSywW] [^1135ZxjZ] [^1172WSHK].

---

For a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy with an unknown reaction, the next best step is to **obtain a detailed allergy history** [^1135ZxjZ] to characterize the reaction [^113D4Zbx] and guide risk stratification [^116d4RpN]. If the history suggests a low-risk reaction [^115HSywW] (e.g. benign rash, remote reaction), proceed with a **direct oral amoxicillin challenge** [^111CydWg] in a monitored setting [^111R8efY]. If it suggests a high-risk reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous reaction), perform penicillin skin testing with major and minor determinants [^1169e4sL], followed by a graded challenge if negative. Avoid amoxicillin and use alternative antibiotics only if the allergy is confirmed or testing is unavailable.

---

## Step 1: obtain a detailed allergy history

The first and most critical step is to **obtain a detailed allergy history** [^1135ZxjZ] to characterize the reported reaction. Key elements to document include [^115Y2pUS]:

- **Type of reaction**: Immediate (within 1 hour), delayed (after 1 hour), or unknown timing.

- **Clinical features**: Rash, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anaphylaxis, or other systemic symptoms.

- **Severity**: Mild (benign rash), moderate (urticaria, angioedema), severe (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).

- **Timing**: Time elapsed since the reaction occurred.

- **Previous tolerance**: Any subsequent exposures to amoxicillin or other beta-lactams without reaction.

A structured allergy history allows for **risk stratification** [^113D4Zbx] and guides subsequent management steps [^116d4RpN].

---

## Step 2: risk stratification

Based on the detailed allergy history, patients can be stratified into **low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk categories**:

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended next step** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | - Benign rash <br/> - Remote reaction (> 10 years ago) <br/> - Unknown reaction without severe features | Direct oral amoxicillin challenge [^111CydWg] [^115HSywW] [^111R8efY] |
| Moderate-risk | - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Non-anaphylactic reactions | Penicillin skin testing followed by graded challenge if negative [^1135ZxjZ] [^114t3m1G] |
| High-risk | - Anaphylaxis <br/> - Severe cutaneous reactions (SJS, TEN) <br/> - Organ involvement | - Avoid amoxicillin <br/> - Consider alternative antibiotics or desensitization if necessary [^1135ZxjZ] [^1143HUu8] |

## Step 3: diagnostic testing

### Penicillin skin testing

Penicillin skin testing is the **gold standard** for evaluating suspected IgE-mediated penicillin allergies [^111WoAJA]. It involves testing with major and minor determinants (penicilloyl-polylysine and minor determinant mixture) and amoxicillin [^115qWBSe] [^112VGsGT]. A negative skin test has a high negative predictive value (97–99%) for immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^111WoAJA] [^117KDGzJ].

---

### Direct oral amoxicillin challenge

For patients with low-risk histories, a **direct oral amoxicillin challenge** without prior skin testing is safe and effective [^111CydWg]. It consists of administering a graded dose of amoxicillin [^111R8efY] under medical supervision with observation for reactions [^115ygF4x].

---

## Step 4: management based on test results

Based on test results, a **negative skin test or oral challenge** indicates amoxicillin can be safely administered [^111WoAJA], whereas a **positive skin test or oral challenge** confirms allergy [^1135ZxjZ]; avoid amoxicillin and consider alternative antibiotics (e.g. cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains, carbapenems, aztreonam) [^116QU3xv] [^113xhrcn] [^114cHE93].

---

## Step 5: documentation and patient education

Regardless of the outcome, it is essential to **document the results** of the allergy evaluation clearly in the patient's medical record [^111CJUvU]. Provide the patient with written information about the results and implications for future antibiotic use.

---

## Summary of recommended approach

1. **Obtain a detailed allergy history** to characterize the reaction [^1135ZxjZ].

2. **Risk stratify** the patient based on clinical features and timing [^113D4Zbx].

3. **Perform penicillin skin testing** for moderate-risk or high-risk patients [^114t3m1G].

4. **Conduct a direct oral amoxicillin challenge** for low-risk patients [^111CydWg].

5. **Document results clearly** and educate the patient [^111CJUvU].

---

The next best step for a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy with an unknown reaction is to **obtain a detailed allergy history**, **risk-stratify** [^115Y2pUS], and perform appropriate diagnostic testing (skin testing or direct oral challenge) to confirm or exclude true allergy [^1135ZxjZ].

Direct challenge (DC) may be a safe and effective alternative to penicillin skin testing (PST) in low-risk patients.

- **Objective**: To complete a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing PST followed by a challenge to amoxicillin versus a 2-step DC to amoxicillin without preceding skin testing in a predefined low-risk patient population.

- **Methods**: Penicillin allergy histories were reviewed in patients presenting to an outpatient allergy/immunology practice from April 2018 to August 2018. Patients 5 years or older with a cutaneous-only or unknown reaction (more than 1 year ago for those aged 5–17 years, more than 10 years ago for those 18 years or older) were randomized 1:1 to PST or 2-step DC. All children younger than 5 years underwent DC, and patients with extracutaneous reaction histories underwent PST. All groups were monitored for 30 minutes after administration of amoxicillin.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy was reported in 363 of 2465 (14.7%) patients, of which 185 consented to further evaluation. Thirteen patients younger than 5 years underwent DC; all were negative. Thirteen patients with angioedema and/or extracutaneous symptoms underwent PST; 2 of 13 patients had a positive PST result. A total of 159 patients were randomized to DC (49.7%) or PST (50.3%). The PST result was negative in 70 of 80 (87.5%) patients. All 70 patients had a negative amoxicillin challenge. DC was negative in 76 of 79 (96.2%) patients; positive DC reactions were minor. The average time for patients undergoing PST was 72.7 ± 5.3 minutes and for patients undergoing DC was 66.7 ± 4.8 minutes.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation: A prospective, multicenter, open-label evaluation of a comprehensive penicillin skin test kit [^112VGsGT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Ten percent of the population claims an allergy to penicillin, but 90% of these individuals are not actually allergic. Patients labeled as penicillin-allergic often experience higher medical costs, longer hospital stays, and are more likely to be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to the development of drug-resistant bacterial infections. Most penicillin skin test reagents are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or readily available for evaluating patients labeled as penicillin-allergic.

- **Objective**: To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of the Penicillin Skin Test Kit containing the major allergenic determinant (penicilloyl polylysine), a minor determinant mixture (penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate), and amoxicillin, produced according to Food and Drug Administration standards.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label investigation of penicillin skin testing using the Penicillin Skin Test Kit. Skin test-negative subjects were challenged with 250 mg of amoxicillin, whereas skin test-positive patients were not challenged. The primary endpoint was the NPV of the Penicillin Skin Test Kit, defined as the percentage of subjects with negative skin test results who did not experience an IgE-dependent reaction within 72 hours of the amoxicillin challenge.

- **Results**: In total, 455 patients with a history of penicillin allergy underwent skin testing, and 63 (13.8%) had one or more positive test results. Of these, 65% were positive for the minor determinant mixture and/or amoxicillin alone. In the per protocol group of 373 skin test-negative subjects, eight developed potent responses.

### Relationship of reaction history to positive penicillin skin tests [^113D4Zbx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Previous data suggest that up to one-third of patients classified as allergic based on positive penicillin skin tests have a vague reaction history. Direct oral challenge (DOC) has been recommended for patients with a low-risk reaction history. A variety of published models stratify reaction risk to guide the use of DOC.

- **Objective**: To reassess the proportion of penicillin skin test-positive patients with vague or low-risk reaction histories and evaluate the relationship between the reaction risk history and the likelihood of positive skin test results.

- **Methods**: We identified patients who underwent penicillin allergy evaluation over a 5-year period. We recorded drug reaction history, demographic variables, skin testing, and challenge results. Matched controls whose skin tests were negative were identified for skin test-positive patients. Drug reaction histories were assigned a risk category based on two previously published risk stratification models. We used logistic regression to investigate whether reaction history risk was associated with positive skin test results.

- **Results**: Penicillin skin testing was performed in 3,382 patients; 207 (6.1%) were positive. Positive skin tests were more frequent in outpatients (P < .001), younger patients (P < .001), and female patients (P < .001). Percentages of each risk category in each model were similar in cases versus matched controls. The likelihood for positive skin tests increased with a high-risk reaction history in one stratification model.

- **Conclusion**: Our data confirm that a substantial proportion of patients who show positive penicillin skin tests have a reaction history classified as high-risk in one stratification model.

### Safety and outcomes of oral graded challenges to amoxicillin without prior skin testing [^111R8efY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Unconfirmed penicillin allergy poses substantial public health consequences. The most widely accepted protocol to evaluate penicillin allergy is skin testing followed by an amoxicillin challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of direct oral graded challenges to amoxicillin.

A prospective single-blind clinical trial with historical controls was conducted on patients aged 7 years and older with historical non-life-threatening reactions to penicillin. Patients received a placebo followed by a 2-step graded challenge to amoxicillin. The allergic reaction rate was compared with the rate observed in a previous study that included skin testing and the currently reported penicillin allergy prevalence in the US population.

Of the 155 participants who completed an amoxicillin challenge, 120 patients (77.4%) experienced no reaction, whereas 31 patients (20%) experienced nonallergic reactions to either placebo (n = 16) or amoxicillin (n = 15). Four patients (2.6%) developed mild allergic reactions. Significantly (P = 0.03) fewer patients (4 of 155, 2.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0%, 6.5%) were determined to be allergic compared with 14 of 170 subjects (8.2%, 95% CI: 5.0%, 13.4%) in the previous study where patients were determined to be allergic based on either positive skin tests (n = 11) or allergic challenge reactions after negative skin tests (n = 3). This 2.6% reaction rate was also significantly less than the 10% reported US prevalence of penicillin allergy (P = 0.003).

In conclusion, placebo-controlled oral graded challenges to amoxicillin demonstrate a lower incidence of allergic reactions compared to those involving skin testing results and reported prevalence, suggesting a potentially safer approach in evaluating penicillin allergies.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1143HUu8]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for drug allergy, specifically in the context of drug desensitization for beta-lactams, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend considering desensitization if there is an absolute requirement for a specific β-lactam and the presence of positive skin or challenge tests.

---

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: A review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: β-lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

- **Observations**: Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^11315yHF]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, the data obtained in this study contribute to the improvement of knowledge about the accuracy and predictive value of penicillin allergy diagnostic workup. Although currently there is no consensus on whether resensitization should be routinely ruled out, considering the results obtained in this study, it is advisable to retest patients with a strong suspicion of allergic reactions to penicillins and negative allergological tests before considering the patient as non-allergic. This is especially important in severe reactions, as patients may be wrongly labeled as non-allergic even following a tolerated drug provocation test (DPT) with the culprit. The inclusion of a retest in these cases is important to avoid potentially severe reactions after subsequent prescriptions of penicillins.

### Penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy [^111WoAJA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the role of penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy mediated by IgE.

Data sources included a PubMed and OVID search of English-language articles regarding penicillin allergy, penicillin allergy testing, and management of penicillin allergy.

Articles pertinent to the subject matter were selected and reviewed. The results indicated that the major determinant (benzylpenicillin polylysine) detects the greatest number of penicillin-allergic patients during skin testing. Additionally, the minor determinants of penicillin increase the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing. Penicillin skin testing to the major and minor determinants was found to have a negative predictive value of 97% to 99%. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions to penicillin skin testing is less than 1%.

The conclusion drawn is that a detailed history of the prior reaction to penicillin is an integral part of the evaluation. However, it is not accurate in predicting a positive penicillin skin test result. A patient with a negative penicillin skin test result to the major and minor determinants is at a low risk of an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin. Patients with a positive skin test result should undergo desensitization to penicillin, or an alternative antibiotic should be considered.

### Elective penicillin skin testing in a pediatric outpatient setting [^117KDGzJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions associated with penicillin-type antibiotics are common in pediatric practice, leading to the subsequent unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy represents only a fraction of these adverse reactions.

- **Objectives**: To examine (1) the trend of penicillin skin test reactivity during a recent 10-year interval, (2) the relative distribution of specific reagents related to a positive skin test result, and (3) skin test reactivity as a function of reaction history.

- **Methods**: Penicillin testing using three reagents — benzylpenicilloyl polylysine, penicillin G, and sodium penicilloate (penicillin A) — was conducted in a prospective study of 359 consecutive patients referred to an outpatient pediatric allergy clinic between January 1, 1993, and May 31, 2003. A retrospective review of penicillin skin test results for 562 children previously tested between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1992, was also conducted.

- **Results**: Between 1993 and 2003, the prevalence of penicillin skin test sensitivity markedly declined. Of all the positive skin test results between 1979 and 2002, either penicillin G, sodium penicilloate, or both identified 34%, with sodium penicilloate alone responsible for 8.5%. The rate of positive skin test reactions was not significantly different between patients with versus without a history of suggestive IgE-mediated reactions.

- **Conclusions**: A marked decline in penicillin skin test sensitivity in the pediatric age group is identified. The minor determinant reagents penicillin G and sodium penicilloate are both necessary for accurate testing.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^115qWBSe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). High credibility.

The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing is a topic of renewed interest. This research highlights the importance of revisiting both major and minor determinants in the context of penicillin allergy testing.

- **Background**: Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, affecting many individuals worldwide. The accurate identification of true allergic reactions is critical for effective patient management.

- **Major and minor determinants**: Understanding the role of both major and minor determinants in allergy testing can enhance diagnostic accuracy. Incorporating these elements into skin testing protocols could potentially reduce the prevalence of penicillin allergy misdiagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: Re-evaluating testing protocols with an emphasis on major and minor determinants could significantly impact clinical practices and patient outcomes. The findings underscore the need for further research and updated guidelines in allergy testing.

The authors declare that they have no relevant conflicts of interest.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^113iuWnT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

Skin testing is an important step in the evaluation of penicillin allergic reactions. It includes testing for amoxicillin, benzyl penicillin, and products generated in vivo after penicillin administration, including the major determinant hapten penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and the minor determinant mixture (MDM). Although PPL and MDM are available as a commercial kit, their supply and cost remain problematic.

- **Objective**: We aimed to evaluate the performance and utility of PPL and MDM in penicillin allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit over a 5-year period was undertaken for those with penicillin testing in a tertiary immunology unit.

- **Results**: In all, 214 patients were identified. Of those patients, 151 (70.6%) were female, and the average age was 58 years. Unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug (n = 127 [59.3%]), followed by amoxicillin (n = 53 [24.8%]) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 21 [9.7%]). The result of skin testing was positive in 23 patients (10.7%); skin prick testing was positive in 10 patients (4.7%), and intradermal testing (IDT) was positive in 13 patients (6.1%), the majority of whom had identified amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the index drug (n = 22 [95.7%]). The result of testing to PPL and/or MDM was positive with IDT only (n = 5 [23.8%]). PPL and MDM positivity coexisted with a positive reaction to amoxicillin IDT in 2 patients, 1 of whom passed an amoxicillin challenge. Additionally, 2 positive tests for PPL were present with a negative result for MDM. Of these 2 positive results, 1 was positive to amoxicillin.

### Understanding penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity, and antibiotic selection in the preoperative setting [^115uPo2Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022).

Penicillin allergies are reported by 8% to 15% of the US population, but up to 95% of these allergies do not correspond to a true allergy when tested. Recent studies have demonstrated that having a penicillin allergy label (PAL) results in a 50% increased odds of surgical site infection among patients reporting a penicillin allergy, entirely attributable to the use of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic, primarily clindamycin or vancomycin. This study provides a review of the prevalence of PAL, the cross-reactivity with cefazolin, immunogenic components of cefazolin and penicillin, and guidelines for preoperative antibiotic selection in patients with PALs. Upon understanding these principles, a new set of guidelines and a risk stratification tool are proposed for assessing allergies and determining appropriate antibiotic choice, dosage, and timing in the orthopaedic preoperative setting.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^117RcH4t]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend not obtaining any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy, such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea. Consider obtaining a one-step amoxicillin challenge in patients who are anxious or requesting additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label.

### Clinical and genetic risk factors of self-reported penicillin allergy [^112XKbmL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with self-reported penicillin allergy are frequently denied beta-lactam antibiotics. The objective of this study was to identify and correlate clinical and genetic risk factors of self-reported penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a case-control study of adults recruited from allergists' offices. Cases had a history of urticaria, angioedema, wheeze, hypotension, vomiting, or anaphylaxis following a dose of penicillin. DNA from buccal swabs was genotyped for variants associated with candidate genes linked to immediate hypersensitivity (IL4, IL4R, and IL10) and penicillin metabolism (LACTB). Logistic regression was used to calculate the association between penicillin allergy and clinical and genetic factors.

- **Results**: Seventeen allergists identified 76 adults. Complete data were available for 23 cases and 39 controls. Penicillin allergy was associated with a history of penicillin allergy in first-degree relatives (P = 0.002), a history of other adverse drug reactions (P = 0.008), and atopy (P = 0.039). However, in the multivariable analysis, only the family history of penicillin allergy remained significant. IL4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11740584 (P = 0.012), rs10062446 (P = 0.021), and rs2070874 (P = 0.035) were associated, and LACTB SNP rs2729835 (P = 0.058) was marginally associated with penicillin allergy. Adding rs11740584 or rs10062446 individually improved the clinical multivariable model (R² increased from 0.23 to 0.33). Haplotype analysis did not provide additional information beyond the SNP analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Self-reported penicillin allergy may be influenced by genetic factors alongside family history and other clinical factors.

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: A meta-analysis [^1172WSHK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

- **Method**: Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

- **Results**: A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), and cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first-generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin-allergic patients; no increase was observed with second-generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI = 0.6 to 2.1) or third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

- **Conclusion**: First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.

### Evaluation of the PEN-FAST clinical decision rule in non-beta-lactam antibiotic allergy assessment [^112Gz48M]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

False antibiotic allergy labels lead to the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum agents, contributing to antimicrobial resistance and poorer clinical outcomes. Penicillin allergy delabeling initiatives have been supported by validated clinical decision rules such as PEN-FAST. However, there are currently no available standardized approaches for non-beta-lactam allergies, for which standardized and validated skin tests are also lacking.

- **Objective**: We first aimed to validate the safety and negative predictive value (NPV) of PEN-FAST for penicillin allergies. Next, we evaluated whether the performance of PEN-FAST could be replicated for non-beta-lactam antibiotic allergy labels.

- **Methods**: This retrospective single-center comparative cohort study analyzed adult patients with penicillin or non-beta-lactam allergy labels referred to our allergy division at the Department of Dermatology, Heidelberg, Germany. Allergy assessment included skin tests and subsequent drug challenge. The performance of the previously published PEN-FAST criteria was evaluated for both cohorts.

- **Results**: 102 penicillin allergy and 191 non-beta-lactam labels were analyzed. Confirmed allergies were more prevalent among non-beta-lactams (50.3% vs. 37.3%). PEN-FAST demonstrated high sensitivity for both penicillin (97.4%) and non-beta-lactams (94.8%), with an NPV of 95.8% and 82.8%, respectively. Misclassifications were limited to mild cutaneous reactions. Excluding clindamycin labels increased the NPV for non-beta-lactams to 95%.

- **Conclusion**: Despite lower NPV for non-beta-lactam labels and varying

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1157buWX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and paediatric allergy, as well as other clinicians practicing allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence-based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached a consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a web-based process, and all comments were carefully considered.

Included in the guideline are topics like the epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, their molecular structure, formulations available in the UK, and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants.

- **Value and limitations**: The document discusses the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing, and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins.

- **Cross-reactivity**: Details on cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins are examined in depth.

- **Procedures**: Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures are included.

Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is provided in a separate section. An algorithm to assist clinicians in diagnosing patients with a history of penicillin allergy is also part of the guideline.

### The use of direct oral challenge to confirm allergies to penicillin class antibiotics in Danish children [^112FX8NY]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

This study presents a retrospective medical record review without any prospective interventional component, thus not requiring formal ethics approval according to The Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics. The subjects were children who received outpatient care in clinics at three hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. These children were reported to have an allergy to a penicillin class antibiotic between December 2007 and October 2011. A total of 141 children, comprising 69 boys and 72 girls with an average age of 4.2 years (range 0.33–15.3), were included in the study.

The local guideline employed a graded two-step direct oral challenge/drug challenge (DC) with a two-hour observation period to confirm antibiotic allergy or tolerance. This process included the completion of a standardized European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA) drug allergy questionnaire. There was variable use of skin prick testing (SPT), which was conducted only in a subgroup of 52 children. Additionally, all participants underwent in vitro anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin specific IgE testing (n = 141), with 104 individuals also having their total IgE levels measured.

The testing setup, including SPT, DC, and in vitro measurements of specific IgE to anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin, adhered to ENDA guidelines. Specific IgE tests targeted penicillin G and V, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefamandole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and the penicillin minor determinant across all patients, using ImmunoCAP Specific IgE 0–100 (Phadia APS, Allerød, Denmark), where a value greater than 0.35 kUA/L was deemed positive. Total IgE levels were simultaneously assessed in 104 of the patients.

### Prospective assessment of diagnostic tests for pediatric penicillin allergy: From clinical history to challenge tests [^113AFvLR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic guidelines for penicillin allergy in children recommend cumbersome protocols, partly based on data from adults, which may be suboptimal for pediatric use. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of tools for diagnosing penicillin allergy in children.

A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in children with reported adverse events related to penicillin, excluding severe reactions. All patients underwent a uniform diagnostic protocol that consisted of clinical history, skin tests, serum specific IgE (sIgE), and, regardless of these results, drug provocation tests (DPTs).

A total of 732 children (mean age, 5.5 years; 51.2% males) completed the allergy workup, including DPTs. Amoxicillin triggered 96.9% of all reactions. None of the patients with an immediate index reaction (IR) developed a reaction on DPT. Penicillin allergy was confirmed in 35 children (4.8%): 6 immediate reactions (17%) and 29 nonimmediate reactions (83%) on the DPT. No severe reactions were recorded. The allergist diagnosis based on the clinical history was not associated with the DPT final outcome. In 30 of 33 allergic patients (91%), the results of all skin tests and sIgE tests were negative.

A logistic regression model identified the following factors to be associated with penicillin allergy: a family history of drug allergy (odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–6.89; p = 0.008), an IR lasting more than 3 days vs 24 hours or less (OR, 8.96; 95% CI, 2.01–39.86; p = 0.004), and an IR treated with corticosteroids (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.30–5.54).

### Diagnostic evaluation of a large group of patients with immediate allergy to penicillins: The role of skin testing [^115HnUwC]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Penicillin is no longer the most commonly prescribed beta-lactam, and the pattern of reactions has changed. We studied the diagnostic value of skin testing in penicillin-allergic subjects from a population where benzylpenicillin is not now the most frequently used beta-lactam.

- **Methods**: Patients with a history of immediate allergic reactions to penicillins were studied using skin tests with major and minor determinants of benzylpenicillin (BPO/MDM), amoxicillin, and ampicillin; in vitro determination of specific IgE; and controlled administration for those with a positive history but negative skin and in vitro tests. A reaction was considered immediate if symptoms appeared within a maximum of 1 hour after drug intake.

- **Results**: After testing, 290 patients (71% having anaphylaxis and 29% having urticaria) proved to be allergic. Amoxicillin was involved in 64.8% and benzylpenicillin in 2.8% of the patients. Skin test positivity to at least one determinant appeared in 70% of cases, with amoxicillin being the most frequent. The overall sensitivity decreased markedly when only BPO and MDM were considered. In 13.1% of patients, the diagnosis was established by in vitro test, and in 16.9% by controlled administration. Of the 290 patients, 42.1% were positive to determinants generated from benzylpenicillin, and 57.9% were selective responders.

- **Conclusions**: Sensitivity of skin tests to BPO was lower than reported, being partly replaced by minor determinants, mostly amoxicillin. The incorporation of additional reagents and the development of new tests are required.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113P9GHM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

The practice parameter on cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins suggests stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus non-anaphylactic histories and determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite this simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent of its incorporation into allergy practice remains unclear. We surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real case examples.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^113WjnNd]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is not known, and figures range widely among different studies, from 0% to 27.9%. The variable resensitization rate reported in different studies can be attributed to disagreement in methodology, relatively small sample sizes in most studies, and failure to perform skin tests (STs) to confirm resensitization in some of the patients who had a suspected adverse reaction after initial negative STs. Therefore, according to this evidence, there is no consensus about whether resensitization should be routinely ruled out. While several studies support that the resensitization phenomenon is rare, others support the need for skin retesting after drug provocation tests (DPT) to rule out resensitization. It is necessary to assess the need for skin retesting in patients who have a suspected allergy to penicillins and negative allergy tests and to agree on its inclusion after completing the routine diagnostic workup.

The aim of our study was to determine the rate of resensitization in a group of patients with suggestive reported allergic reactions to penicillins by repeating STs after an initial evaluation (IE). We also aimed to analyze the potential factors associated with the resensitization phenomenon.

### Is a reported penicillin allergy sufficient grounds to forgo the multidimensional antimicrobial benefits of β-lactam antibiotics [^116nTYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with a reported penicillin allergy are not allergic when tested or challenged. Penicillin allergy testing has been shown to significantly reduce annual healthcare expenditures. Data have emerged showing β-lactams have multidimensional antibacterial effects in vivo, far beyond what is appreciated in standard bacteriological susceptibility testing media, including enhancing bacterial killing by the innate immune system. Supporting the clinical relevance of these secondary, underappreciated effects are recent clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses that show worse outcomes in patients with reported penicillin allergies who receive non-β-lactam antibiotics when compared to their non-penicillin-allergic counterparts. This is particularly relevant in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This article reviews the tremendous advantages offered by β-lactam therapy and makes a strong case that debunking false penicillin allergies through a detailed allergy history and penicillin allergy testing should be a vital component of antimicrobial stewardship practices.

### The cost of self-reported penicillin allergy: A systematic review [^112MusQz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). High credibility.

Patients who report a penicillin (PCN) allergy receive suboptimal antibiotic therapy compared with patients not reporting an allergy. However, a majority of these patients are not truly allergic on confirmatory testing. Ruling out PCN allergy by testing may improve clinical and economic outcomes for patients with reported allergies requiring antibiotic therapy.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical and economic outcomes associated with PCN allergy and provide recommendations for future cost-effectiveness analyses for PCN allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed, including all articles published through April 25, 2017 (PROSPERO Registration number 42017064112). A total of 1,518 abstracts were found during the initial search, with 96 duplicates removed, resulting in 1,422 articles for screening. Thirty articles were included for qualitative synthesis and full data extraction.

- **Results**: The majority of the studies included had an observational design focusing on inpatient admissions. The most frequently measured outcome in the context of PCN allergy was optimizing antibiotic therapy. Patients with PCN allergy were found to have direct drug costs during inpatient admission ranging from no difference to an additional $609 per patient compared with patients without PCN allergy. Outpatient prescription costs were estimated to be $14 to $193 higher per patient for those with PCN allergy. Total inpatient costs were less for patients without a PCN allergy, with average savings starting at $1,145.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Low credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts choose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommend a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shows that it has two side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin, which suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of nonconfirmed penicillin allergies also had the label of cefazolin allergy.

### Single-step direct drug provocation testing is safe for delabelling selected non-low-risk penicillin allergy labels [^116UjTY6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy labels are prevalent, and the removal of incorrect labels improves patient outcomes and health economics. Labels may be classified as "low-risk" or "non-low-risk", the latter of which chiefly suggests an immunoglobulin E-mediated etiology. Traditionally, "non-low-risk" allergy labels are evaluated by penicillin skin testing followed by graded multistep penicillin drug provocation testing (DPT).

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of assessing "non-low-risk" labels with single-step direct DPT.

- **Methods**: We consecutively enrolled inpatients and outpatients of a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, with penicillin allergy labels requiring penicillin for first-line treatment. Patients were classified as "low-risk" or "non-low-risk" based on the allergy labels. All patients proceeded directly to amoxicillin DPT, unless there was a history of anaphylaxis within 10 years of assessment to a beta-lactam (except for cefazolin) or Gell and Coombs type 2, type 3, or severe type 4 reaction. This was followed by a course of amoxicillin.

- **Results**: A total of 149 patients (41 inpatients, 108 outpatients) were enrolled. No patient was excluded from the study. No patient experienced life-threatening reactions to the protocol. There were 85 patients who reported "non-low-risk" allergy labels. One patient developed generalized pruritus and rash that resolved with standard-dose antihistamines, two developed delayed benign maculopapular exanthem, and three experienced diarrhea during the course of amoxicillin.

- **Conclusion**: In our cohort, direct single-step DPT was shown to be a safe method for assessing "non-low-risk" penicillin allergy labels.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^111ZfDBJ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly concerning the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing using a cephalosporin with a different side chain. If the skin test is negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude an allergy to the specific cephalosporin. This approach is recommended for patients with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests who require a cephalosporin.

### A systematic review: can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins [^113RYC9R]? Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta-lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

- **Results**: Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval, 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, .06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%), which included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

- **Conclusions**: The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions remains uncertain due to incomplete data.

### A proactive approach to penicillin allergy testing in hospitalized patients [^117GAq2B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy testing is underutilized in inpatients despite its potential to immediately impact antibiotic treatment. Although most tested patients are able to tolerate penicillin, limited availability and awareness of this tool leads to the use of costly and harmful substitutes.

- **Objective**: We established an inpatient service at a large academic hospital to identify and test patients with a history of penicillin allergy. The goals were to remove inaccurate diagnoses, reduce the use of beta-lactam alternatives, and educate patients and clinicians about the procedure.

- **Methods**: Eligible inpatients were flagged daily through the electronic medical record and prioritized via a specialized algorithm. A trained clinical pharmacist performed penicillin skin tests and challenges preemptively or by provider request. Clinical characteristics and antibiotic use were analyzed in tested patients.

- **Results**: A total of 1,203 applicable charts were detected by our system, leading to 252 direct evaluations over 18 months. Overall, 228 subjects (90.5%) had their penicillin allergy removed. Of these, 223 were cleared via testing and 5 by discovery of prior penicillin tolerance. Among patients testing negative, 85 (38%) subsequently received beta-lactams, preventing 504 inpatient days and 648 outpatient days on alternative agents.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin allergy testing using a physician-pharmacist team model effectively removes reported allergies in hospitalized patients. The electronic medical record is a valuable asset for locating and stratifying individuals who benefit from such testing.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^111d6NHZ]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The diagnosis of allergic reactions to penicillins (AR-PEN) is very complex due to a loss of sensitization over time, leading to negative skin tests (STs) and specific IgE in serum, and even tolerance to the involved drug. However, STs may become positive upon re-exposure to the culprit drug, a phenomenon known as resensitization, which carries the risk of severe reactions. The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is not well-defined, ranging from 0% to 27.9% according to published studies.

The objective of this study was to analyze the rate of resensitization in patients with suggestive AR-PEN by repeating STs (retest) after an initial evaluation (IE). Patients with suspected AR-PEN were prospectively evaluated between 2017 and 2020. They underwent STs, and a randomized group was additionally subjected to a drug provocation test (DPT) with the culprit drug. Only patients with negative STs and/or DPT were included. All included cases underwent retesting by STs within 2–8 weeks.

A total of 545 patients were included: 296 reported immediate reactions (IRs) and 249 non-immediate reactions (NIRs). Eighty cases (14.7%) had positive results in retesting (RT+): 63 (21.3%) were IRs and 17 (6.8%) were NIRs (p < 0.0001). The rate of RT+ was significantly higher in patients with anaphylaxis compared to those with other reactions (45.8% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.0001). The risk of RT+ increased from the fifth week after IE (OR: 4.64, CI: 2.1–11.6; p < 0.001) and with the patient's age (OR: 1.02; CI: 1.01–1.04; p = 0.009).

Due to the high rate of resensitization, inclusion of a retest in diagnostic algorithms is recommended.

### Antibiotic allergy [^116d4RpN]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the commonest cause of life-threatening immune-mediated drug reactions considered off-target, including anaphylaxis and organ-specific and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were unknown or not remembered by the patient, related to cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, drug-infection interactions, or drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health.

Antibiotic allergy labels result in the displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-β-lactam antibiotics, which results in increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labeled as allergic to penicillins are not allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged. Given the public health importance of penicillin allergy, this review provides a global update on antibiotic allergy epidemiology, classification, mechanisms, and management.

### Practical management of antibiotic allergy in adults [^116FeznF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines the primary issues surrounding immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity pertains to β-lactam antibiotics, primarily due to the widespread use of this drug class. Cross-reactivity concerns are a common worry for clinicians, particularly in emergency situations. Reasonable data now exist regarding β-lactam antibiotics and their derivatives, facilitating appropriate risk management. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Documented penicillin allergies on antibiotic selection at pediatric emergency department visits [^115XQx9g]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Penicillin or amoxicillin are the recommended treatments for the most common pediatric bacterial illnesses. Allergies to penicillin are commonly reported among children but are rarely true. We evaluated the impact of reported penicillin allergies on broad-spectrum antibiotic use overall and for the treatment of common respiratory infections among treat-and-release pediatric emergency department (ED) visits.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients receiving antibiotics during a treat-and-release visit at a large, pediatric ED in the northeast from 2014 to 2016. Study exposure was a reported allergy to penicillin in the electronic medical record. Study outcomes were the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics and alternative (second-line) antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. We used unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models to analyze the impact of reported penicillin allergies on the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to determine the probability of children with a documented penicillin allergy receiving alternative antibiotic treatments for AOM and GAS.

- **Results**: Among 12,987 pediatric patients, 810 (6.2%) had a documented penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergies increased the odds of children receiving a broad spectrum versus narrow spectrum antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34–16.18). In our adjusted logistic regression model, the probability of children with documented penicillin allergies receiving alternative antibiotic treatments significantly increased.

### Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions and approaches to desensitization [^116LBeSN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Before initiating antibiotic therapy, drug hypersensitivity is an important consideration. A common strategy is to avoid giving patients medications when there is a high likelihood of severe reactions. With an increase in antibiotic resistance and a decrease in novel antibiotics, there is greater pressure to consider antibiotics in patients with a history of adverse reactions. The major concerns include IgE-mediated, or type I, reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Some antibiotics with similar characteristics, such as cephalosporins and penicillins, may be given safely to patients with a certain allergy profile. However, there is still greater concern when considering antibiotics for patients with a reported allergy. Desensitization is a strategy to safely induce drug tolerance to a specific drug to limit the possibility of a type I reaction.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians frequently face the challenge of selecting antibiotics for patients who report an allergy to these medications. For patients with suspected penicillin allergies, penicillin skin testing is highly effective in predicting serious allergic reactions. This test is also useful for excluding sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring in other beta-lactam antibiotics. However, for other antibiotics, a detailed patient history remains the most reliable method for assessing the likelihood of a serious allergic reaction upon further exposure to the drug.

The potential for cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (with the exception of cefamandole) is likely no greater than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. In cases where a patient is suspected of having an immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy may be considered, especially if the effectiveness of alternative antibiotics is questionable. Notably, for the treatment of severe infections, it is often possible to safely administer the preferred antibiotic despite a history indicating a possible allergy.

The diagnosis of allergic reactions to penicillins (AR-PEN) is very complex, as there is a loss of sensitization over time. This leads to negative skin tests (STs) and specific IgE in serum, and even to tolerance to the drug involved. However, STs may become positive after subsequent exposure to the culprit drug (resensitization), with the risk of inducing potentially severe reactions. The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is unknown, ranging from 0% to 27.9% in published studies.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the rate of resensitization in patients with suggestive AR-PEN by repeating STs (retest) after an initial evaluation (IE).

- **Material and methods**: Patients with suspected AR-PEN were prospectively evaluated between 2017 and 2020. They underwent STs, and a randomized group also underwent a drug provocation test (DPT) with the culprit drug. Only patients with negative STs and/or DPT were included. All included cases were retested by STs at 2–8 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 545 patients were included. Of those, 296 reported immediate reactions (IRs) and 249 non-immediate reactions (NIRs). Eighty (14.7%) cases had positive results in retest (RT+): 63 (21.3%) IRs and 17 (6.8%) NIRs, with a significant difference (p < 0.0001). The rate of RT+ was higher in anaphylaxis compared with all other reactions (45.8% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.0001). The risk of RT+ was higher from the fifth week after IE (OR: 4.64, CI: 2.1–11.6; p < 0.001) and increased with the patient's age (OR: 1.02; CI: 1.01–1.04; p = 0.009).

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^116QU3xv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a structurally dissimilar R1 side chain cephalosporin without testing or additional precautions in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^116yiWYZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin, as well as a skin test-based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin, for patients with an anaphylactic history to a penicillin. Our survey results indicated that 23% of respondents elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test, focusing only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with the practice parameters' recommendations.

In scenario D, for a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest a cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose responses that aligned with this approach.

For scenario E, evaluating patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, 57% of participants opted for a cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation method.

Following scenario E, we asked about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when skin test results are positive for cefazolin. Most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, whereas 9 experts (20.9%) recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without proceeding to an oral challenge.

We attempted a post hoc analysis to explore a correlation between the experts' duration in practice and their adherence to guidelines, but found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey's final section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice guidelines.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1122ipg2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically concerning the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing for penicillins and the required cephalosporin. This helps establish whether the sensitization is to the β-lactam core or side chain if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous reaction. Subsequent challenge testing should be obtained to exclude allergy or to perform desensitization if the patient is allergic.

### Low frequency of allergy referral for penicillin allergy evaluation in an urban Boston primary care setting [^1147NCUb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis, further perpetuating racial and ethnic health disparities. People reporting penicillin allergy are at increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections, mortality, and increased health care costs. Once a patient is labeled in the electronic medical record (EMR) as having a penicillin allergy, many clinicians avoid prescribing β-lactam antibiotics due to concerns regarding cross-reactivity, even though this concern is largely unwarranted. Removing an inaccurate penicillin allergy label from a patient's EMR can improve clinical outcomes.

Although 10% of people report having a penicillin allergy, up to 95% of people who report a penicillin allergy do not have a true IgE-mediated reaction and are able to tolerate penicillin. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and international allergy organizations recommend penicillin allergy delabeling, which is the removal of inaccurate penicillin allergy labels.

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims - **To perform a pharmaco-economic analysis**: Analyze the prescribing of alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and evaluate whether information gathered from a structured history and communication with the family physician could reduce costs.

Methods - **Prospective interview**: A pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physicians was conducted to assess the validity of the 'penicillin allergy' diagnosis. A cost analysis of alternative antibiotic prescriptions was performed and compared with first-line agents.

Results - **Patient assessment and cost analysis**: Of the 102 patients assessed, only 40% (n = 41) had a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity. 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients labeled with penicillin allergy was 1.82–2.58 times higher than for first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions - **Structured history benefits**: Obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician can accurately identify the penicillin allergy status. The total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^1169e4sL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). High credibility.

Skin testing is an important step in the evaluation of penicillin allergic reactions. It includes testing for amoxicillin, benzyl penicillin, and products generated *in vivo* after penicillin administration, including the major determinant hapten penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and the minor determinant mixture (MDM). Although PPL and MDM are available as a commercial kit, their supply and cost remain problematic.

- **Objective**: We aimed to evaluate the performance and utility of PPL and MDM in penicillin allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit over a 5-year period was undertaken for those undergoing penicillin testing in a tertiary immunology unit.

- **Results**: A total of 214 patients were identified. Of these patients, 151 (70.6%) were female with an average age of 58 years. Unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug (n = 127 [59.3%]), followed by amoxicillin (n = 53 [24.8%]) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 21 [9.7%]). The result of skin testing was positive in 23 patients (10.7%); skin prick testing was positive in 10 patients (4.7%), and intradermal testing (IDT) was positive in 13 patients (6.1%), the majority of whom identified amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the index drug (n = 22 [95.7%]). The result of testing to PPL and/or MDM was positive with IDT only (n = 5 [23.8%]). PPL and MDM positivity coexisted with a positive reaction to amoxicillin IDT in 2 patients, 1 of whom passed an amoxicillin challenge. Additionally, 2 positive tests to PPL were present with a negative result for MDM; of these 2 positive results, 1 was positive to amoxicillin.

### Penicillin skin testing in hospitalized patients with β-lactam allergies: Effect on antibiotic selection and cost [^1156ftC2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

A history of a penicillin allergy generally leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that may increase complications and cost.

- **Objective**: To determine the cost-effectiveness of performing penicillin skin testing (PST).

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on adult inpatients with a β-lactam allergy who underwent PST and oral challenge performed by an allergist. The primary outcome was overall antibiotic cost savings for patients switched to a β-lactam antibiotic (BLA). Secondary outcomes included subsequent admissions that required antibiotics and total number of days a BLA was prescribed.

- **Results**: Fifty patients had PST performed (mean age, 62 years). The most common β-lactam allergy reported was penicillin (92%). Cutaneous reactions were reported in 54% of patients, and 56% had a reaction more than 20 years ago. Fifty percent of patients had aztreonam prescribed before PST. The results of PST were negative in all patients, and 1 patient had anaphylactic symptoms during the oral amoxicillin challenge (98% skin test or oral challenge negative). Thirty-seven patients (75.5%) were changed to a BLA. Overall cost savings were $11,005 ($297 per patient switched to a BLA). There were 31 subsequent admissions that required antibiotics for patients who tested negative on skin test and oral challenge. A BLA was prescribed in 22 of 31 readmissions, totaling 147 days of BLA therapy.

- **Conclusion**: After the implementation of a PST protocol, we observed a decrease in non-BLA use in patients with previously documented β-lactam allergy. PST is a safe and cost-effective measure.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^114t3m1G]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically concerning the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing with penicillins. If the skin tests are negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude an allergy to penicillin, especially if penicillin is required in a patient with a clinical history of cephalosporin allergy.

### Treatment of patients with a history of penicillin allergy in a large tertiary-care academic hospital [^112qkMJs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics to patients with a history of penicillin allergy is common in clinical practice. Opting for non-beta-lactam antibiotics has its inconveniences and is often unnecessary because most of these patients are, in fact, not allergic.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine how physicians in a large Canadian tertiary-care academic hospital without allergists on staff treat patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted during a 1-year period among all patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, coronary care unit, and internal medicine wards. Files of patients with a record of penicillin allergy were reviewed to assess the need for antibiotics during their hospitalization and the decision-making process underlying the choice of antibiotic. The additional costs of alternative antibiotics were calculated.

- **Results**: The files of 1738 patients admitted over a 1-year period were hand reviewed. A history of penicillin allergy was found in 172 patients (9.9%). The allergic reaction was described in only 30% of cases and left unmentioned in 20.7%. Beta-lactam antibiotics were used on 56 occasions despite a history of penicillin allergy. The use of alternative antibiotics in place of the beta-lactam standard of care carried an additional cost of $15,672 Canadian.

- **Conclusion**: Alleged penicillin allergy is common among hospitalized patients and leads to substantial additional costs. Poor documentation of penicillin allergy likely reflects a lack of knowledge on this issue in the medical community, which results in unnecessary healthcare expenditures.

### New avenues for antimicrobial stewardship: The case for penicillin skin testing by pharmacists [^111qstRn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

It is well appreciated that patients with documented penicillin allergies often receive broader-spectrum antibiotics. This practice is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and cost. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to spread awareness of the implications of self-reported penicillin allergies. Major organizations have strongly recommended the use of penicillin skin testing to evaluate true allergies for decades. However, testing remains underutilized. Literature suggests various models of incorporating penicillin allergy screening and testing by different healthcare practitioners (i.e. physicians, allergists, nurses, pharmacists). We advocate for a broader adoption of pharmacists' roles in providing penicillin skin testing. This approach would help expand the service and maximize the potential benefits of penicillin skin testing.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended as first-line agents, patient-reported penicillin allergies have led to the routine use of alternative but potentially less effective agents. The use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus, or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy, may affect these women during labor and birth.

Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin. The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking, to determine the nature of drug allergies, and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as in the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Oxacillin [^117DSjW5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Oxacillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. The use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

Prescribing oxacillin for injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Laboratory tests**: Bacteriologic studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to oxacillin should be performed (see clinical pharmacology-microbiology). In the treatment of suspected staphylococcal infections, therapy should be changed to another active agent if culture tests fail to demonstrate the presence of staphylococci.

Periodic assessment of organ system function including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic should be made during prolonged therapy with oxacillin. Blood cultures, white blood cell counts, and differential cell counts should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy and at least weekly during therapy with oxacillin. Periodic urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine determination should also be conducted.

### The use of penicillin skin testing to assess the prevalence of penicillin allergy in an emergency department setting [^1124Fedn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are often unreliable and can result in unnecessary changes in antibiotic therapy. Although penicillin allergy skin testing is commonly performed in allergy clinics, it has not been used in emergency departments (EDs) to verify self-reported allergies. We hypothesize that ED-based testing is possible and that the false-positive rate of patients with self-reported penicillin allergy is greater than 90%.

Methods: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy. Patients were enrolled by one of two emergency physicians who performed skin prick and intracutaneous tests with penicillin major and minor determinants. The total testing time was 30 minutes. The proportion of false-positive self-reported allergies was computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the score method.

Results: A total of 150 patients (mean age 42 years; SD 16 years; 46% men; 47% black) were enrolled. The false-positive rate for self-reported penicillin allergy was 137 of 150 (91.3%; 95% CI 85.3% to 95.1%). There were no adverse reactions associated with penicillin skin testing. Compared with patients with a false-positive penicillin allergy result (confirmed by negative penicillin skin testing result), patients reporting a true penicillin allergy confirmed by positive penicillin skin test results tended to be more frequently men (61.5% versus 44.5%; Delta 17.0%; 95% CI -13.5% to 42%), black (69.2% versus 44.5%; Delta 24.7%; 95% CI -6.9% to 46.8%), and have no family history.

### Antibiotic choice for group B streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws, a deviation from routine clinical care, compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with a documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines.

There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS-positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019, notably after our study data was collected, the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is a deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates.

### A closer look at penicillin allergy history: Systematic review and meta-analysis of tolerance to drug challenge [^1162mEkJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

True allergy to penicillin is rare, despite the high frequency with which it is reported. While most patients reporting penicillin allergy are not prone to anaphylaxis, it is not currently known what percentage of these patients will tolerate dose challenges of penicillin-based antibiotics. This review aims to determine the rate of tolerance in patients reporting penicillin allergy when challenged with penicillin-based antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We searched MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Library for publications with English language translations between the years 2000 and 2017. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies of participants reporting penicillin allergy who received at least one systemic dose of a penicillin in the form of a drug challenge. At least two independent reviewers extracted data from included studies and assessed the quality of each included study. To generate primary outcome data, we calculated a summary estimate rate of penicillin tolerance from a pooled proportion of participants receiving penicillin with no adverse effects.

- **Results**: Initial literature search yielded 2,945 studies, of which 23 studies were ultimately included in our review; 5,056 study participants with reported history of penicillin allergy were challenged with a penicillin. After weighting for study sample size, a pooled average of 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.7%-95%) of participants tolerated the dose challenge without any adverse reaction.

- **Conclusion**: Misrepresented penicillin allergy drives unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics.
