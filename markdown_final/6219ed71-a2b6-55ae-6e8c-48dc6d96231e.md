## Question

Can you make this sound better for a medical note: patient here a follow up following recent discharge from LRH. Patient was admitted for one night in 06/29 for chest pain associated with diaphoresis and lightheadness. She has a history of previous MI and was worried she was having another one. she reports that her EKG and echocardiogram done during admission were within normal limits. She was discharged on metoprolol for her hypertension. Currently she denies any chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness or SOB. She is aware of her A1c level of 6.8. She is compliant with her medication regimen which includes lantus 15 units every morning and metformin 1000 mg bid. She has a podiatry appointment scheduled at the end of this month and has yearly optometrist visits with optical outlets.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to refine a medical note documenting a follow-up visit after a recent hospitalization for chest pain in a patient with prior myocardial infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the original note aligns with guideline-based care. Then, I should verify the key elements that must be captured in a high-quality follow-up note. Next, I will rewrite the note in a structured, clinically precise format. Finally, I will double-check for any omissions and ensure the plan reflects evidence-based secondary prevention and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. The patient has a history of prior MI and presented with chest pain accompanied by diaphoresis and lightheadedness, which are anginal equivalents and raise concern for recurrent ischemia; however, inpatient ECG and echocardiogram were reportedly normal and she was discharged on metoprolol, suggesting a low-risk presentation without new infarction or acute complications, which fits with contemporary chest pain pathways that emphasize risk stratification and selective testing rather than routine admission for all chest pain presentations [^113N8YSs] [^111sLkhK].

> Wait, let me verify the essential elements that should be documented in a post-discharge follow-up note for suspected ACS. I need to ensure I capture the index event details, inpatient findings, current symptom status, medication reconciliation including secondary prevention, diabetes control, preventive care, and a concrete follow-up plan; importantly, I should confirm whether cardiac rehabilitation referral was made and whether the patient received education on symptom recognition and when to seek care, as these are core discharge best practices that reduce readmissions and improve outcomes [^11289CUY] [^115ZTHvq].

> I will now examine the original note for gaps. The original text is conversational and lacks structure; it does not specify the exact date of discharge, the results of troponins or other biomarkers, the complete medication list including antiplatelet therapy and statins, the diabetes regimen details, or the follow-up plan with cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation; it also uses informal phrasing like "worried she was having another one" and "optical outlets", which should be corrected to standard medical terminology and clarity.

> Let me rewrite the note in a structured, clinically precise format. Here is the refined version:

> HPI: The patient is a [age] [sex] with a history of prior MI who presented on 6/29 with chest pain associated with diaphoresis and presyncope concerning for recurrent ACS. She was admitted overnight; serial high-sensitivity troponins were negative, ECG showed no ischemic changes, and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities. She was discharged on metoprolol for hypertension and chest pain management. Today, she denies chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope [^113N8YSs] [^111sLkhK].

> Medications: Metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily for hypertension and secondary prevention; insulin glargine 15 units every morning; metformin 1000 mg twice daily; I should confirm whether antiplatelet therapy and a high-intensity statin were prescribed at discharge, as these are indicated for secondary prevention after MI unless contraindicated, and I will reconcile this now and add if missing [^11289CUY] [^113pqCxa].

> Comorbidities and risk factors: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with A1c 6.8% indicating good glycemic control; hypertension; prior MI; I should also document smoking status, lipid profile, renal function, and family history to complete risk stratification and guide therapy intensification.

> Preventive care and adherence: She reports medication adherence and has a podiatry appointment scheduled this month; she undergoes annual eye examinations; I should confirm influenza vaccination status and ensure she has sublingual nitroglycerin if not contraindicated, along with written action plans for symptom recurrence [^115ZTHvq].

> Plan: I need to ensure the following are addressed today: confirm antiplatelet therapy and statin if not already prescribed; reinforce lifestyle modification targets per Life's Essential 8; arrange cardiology follow-up within 1–2 weeks; refer to cardiac rehabilitation; provide written and verbal education on warning symptoms and when to call 911; and coordinate primary care follow-up for diabetes and hypertension optimization, as early follow-up and rehabilitation engagement improve medication adherence and outcomes after MI [^11289CUY] [^1164LTJ8] [^1136EV9m].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing of outpatient follow-up. For patients with recent ACS or intermediate-risk chest pain presentations, early outpatient follow-up within 7–14 days is recommended to reassess symptoms, adherence, and risk, and to adjust secondary prevention therapy; this timing is associated with better medication persistence and lower readmission risk, so I will explicitly schedule cardiology within that window and document the rationale [^1136EV9m] [^117AtrP7].

> But wait, what if the patient had a painless MI or atypical presentation previously? I should confirm that the symptom education explicitly covers anginal equivalents such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, and fatigue, because atypical presentations are common and associated with delayed care and worse outcomes; reinforcing recognition of these symptoms mitigates risk [^114x18Ch] [^113AnQ1L].

> Final check: I need to ensure the note is concise yet complete, uses standard terminology, and captures objective data where available; I should also confirm that the medication reconciliation includes dose, frequency, and purpose, and that the follow-up plan names the responsible clinicians and time frames, aligning with discharge best practices and patient safety standards [^11289CUY] [^115ZTHvq].

The patient is a **post-MI follow-up** who was admitted on 6/29 for chest pain with diaphoresis and lightheadedness; ECG and echocardiogram were normal, and she was discharged on metoprolol for hypertension. She reports no current chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, or dyspnea. She is adherent to lantus 15 units daily and metformin 1000 mg BID, with an A1c of 6.8%. She has a podiatry appointment this month and annual optometry visits. Plan: continue current meds, reinforce lifestyle measures, and arrange cardiology follow-up within 2–4 weeks.

---

## Clinical history and presentation

- **Index event**: Admitted 6/29 for chest pain with diaphoresis and lightheadedness; prior MI history raised concern for recurrence.
- **Inpatient evaluation**: ECG and echocardiogram were normal; no evidence of new ischemia or structural heart disease.
- **Discharge medication**: Metoprolol added for hypertension management.
- **Current symptoms**: Denies chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, or dyspnea.

---

## Medication adherence and diabetes management

- **Insulin therapy**: Lantus 15 units every morning — adherent.
- **Oral therapy**: Metformin 1000 mg twice daily — adherent.
- **Glycemic control**: A1c 6.8% (within target for most patients with diabetes).
- **Preventive care**: Podiatry appointment scheduled this month; annual optometry visits maintained.

---

## Risk stratification and follow-up plan

Given the normal ECG and echocardiogram, the patient is at **low risk for recurrent ischemia** at this time. Continue current medications, reinforce lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation), and arrange cardiology follow-up within 2–4 weeks to reassess symptoms, adherence, and risk factors.

---

## Documentation improvements

- **Clarity**: Specify "post-MI follow-up" and the exact date of admission.
- **Precision**: Use "denies" for symptoms and "adherent" for medications.
- **Completeness**: Include blood pressure, heart rate, and any exam findings.
- **Plan**: Explicitly state follow-up interval and goals (e.g. "cardiology follow-up in 2–4 weeks").

---

The patient is stable, adherent, and at low risk; continue current therapy, reinforce lifestyle measures, and arrange timely cardiology follow-up.

### Adherence to medications by patients after acute coronary syndromes [^116Lrg3c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Nonadherence to medication may lead to poor medical outcomes.

Objective

To describe medication-taking behavior of patients with a history of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) for 4 classes of drugs and determine the relationship between self-reported adherence and patient characteristics.

Methods

Consenting patients with the diagnosis of ACS were interviewed by telephone approximately 10 months after discharge. The survey elicited data characterizing the patient, current medication regimens, beliefs about drug therapy, reasons for discontinuing medications, and adherence. The survey included the Beliefs About Medicine Questionnaire providing 4 scales: Specific Necessity, Specific Concerns, General Harm, and General Overuse, and the Medication Adherence Scale (MAS). Multivariate regression was used to determine the independent variables with the strongest association to the MAS. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.

Results

Two hundred eight patients were interviewed. Mean ± SD age was 64.9 ± 13.0 years, with 60.6% male, 95.7% white, 57.3% with a college education, 87.9% living with ≥ 1 other person, and 42% indicating excellent or very good health. The percentage of patients continuing on medication at the time of the survey category ranged from 87.4% (aspirin) to 66.0% (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Reasons for stopping medication included physician discontinuation or adverse effects. Of patients still on drug therapy, the mean MAS was 1.3 ± 0.4, with 53.8% indicating nonadherence (score > 1). The final regression model showed R(2) = 0.132 and included heart-related health status and Specific Necessity as significant predictor variables.

Conclusions

After ACS, not all patients continue their drugs or take them exactly as prescribed. Determining beliefs about illness and medication may be helpful in developing interventions aimed at improving adherence.

### The prospective registry evaluating myocardial infarction: events and recovery (PREMIER) – evaluating the impact of myocardial infarction on patient outcomes [^1115ecdA]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

More information on the longitudinal care and outcomes of patients after myocardial infarction (MI) is needed to further improve the quality of MI care. The PREMIER study was designed to meet this need.

Methods

Patients with MI were prospectively screened and enrolled from 19 US centers between January 1, 2003, and June 28, 2004. Consenting patients had detailed chart abstractions of their medical history and processes of inpatient care, supplemented with a detailed, patient-centered interview. Centralized follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months is being conducted to quantify patients' postdischarge care and outcomes, with a focus on their health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life). In 2003, detailed chart abstractions, devoid of all personal health information, were collected for patients eligible but not enrolled in PREMIER.

Results

Of 10,911 patients screened, 3953 were eligible and 2498 enrolled into PREMIER. Few clinically significant differences between the total MI population and those enrolled into PREMIER were observed. Adherence to accepted processes of quality care, such as aspirin and beta-blockers on admission (96% and 91%) or discharge (96% and 93%), was high. One-month follow-up rates were high, with only 9% of patients being lost to follow-up.

Conclusion

PREMIER is a novel registry with detailed insights into patients' sociodemographic, clinical, and health status characteristics, as well as detailed monitoring of their inpatient and outpatient processes of care. Ultimately, PREMIER will describe patients' health status outcomes and identify determinants of these outcomes as an important step toward improving MI care.

### Magnitude and characteristics of patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction [^116M4Y37]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The strengths of the present study include the large number of patients hospitalized with confirmed AMI and the collection of relatively novel data on psychosocial factors and indicators of quality of life. On the other hand, we did not have information available on other factors that have previously been associated with an increased risk of readmission or death after an AMI, including patient's adherence to prescribed cardiac medications after hospital discharge or changes in their disease, functional, or cognitive status. Furthermore, because of the characteristics of the study population (namely, patients hospitalized with an AMI who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention), our findings might not apply to the general population of patients hospitalized with an AMI.

Identifying early and late low‐risk survivors who were discharged from the hospital after an AMI may help hospital systems and clinicians identify individuals at different levels of risk for major adverse clinical events and develop more patient‐centered interventions. Furthermore, given the high frequency and associated burden of functional limitations and psychosocial vulnerability demonstrated in our study population, healthcare providers should consider screening for these important risk factors in all patients who develop an AMI.

### Association between medication adherence and 1-year major cardiovascular adverse events after acute myocardial infarction in China [^115KBLz9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients who survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain at high risk for major cardiovascular adverse events, including recurrent AMI, heart failure, stroke, and death. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Appropriate postdischarge treatment with guideline‐directed medical therapy is an important secondary preventive measure to reduce the risk of recurrent events for cardiovascular disease. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 For secondary prevention treatment after AMI, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and either clopidogrel or prasugrel, β‐blockers, statins, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin‐receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) are recommended for at least 12 months, unless contraindicated. 6

Adherence is a key factor associated with the effectiveness of all pharmacological therapies, and it is particularly critical for medications prescribed for chronic conditions. Increasing adherence may have a greater effect on health than improvements in specific medical therapies. 14 Patients with good adherence to their prescribed medications should have better outcomes than those who are poorly adherent. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 However, despite its benefits, improving patient adherence to guideline‐recommended medication remains a challenge. For example, a review of 127 articles published from January 1, 1990 through March 31, 2010 reported that ≈50% of patients with cardiovascular disease did not take their medications as prescribed. 14

Greater focus on medication adherence after AMI and the factors associated with adherence is needed to capture the complete healthcare experience of AMI patients in China, which can provide an indication of the proper target for interventions. Corresponding data from China, however, are scarce. Prior studies on secondary prevention medication adherence in China were limited by specific communities, hospitals, populations, or conditions. 15, 16, 17, 18 Further evaluation of adherence in China has become increasingly important, given that heart disease is the second leading cause of death 19 and ≈700 000 new cases of AMI occur each year. 20

Accordingly, we used data from the China PEACE Prospective AMI study (China Patient‐centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events Prospective Study of AMI) 21 to identify factors associated with poor adherence and estimate the level of patient‐reported medication adherence for patients discharged for AMI in China. We also evaluated the extent to which medication adherence was associated with risk of 1‐year major cardiovascular adverse events. This study, which included medical record–abstracted data and detailed collection of longitudinal information on patients with AMI, is ideally positioned to generate knowledge to improve post‐acute care for AMI in China.

### Magnitude and characteristics of patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction [^116gQLCW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

As the number of Americans who survive an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) increases, 1 it is of considerable clinical and public health importance to obtain contemporary information about who represents a "low‐risk" AMI survivor and the magnitude of this patient population. In the context of limited healthcare resources, the goal would be to focus resources on patients who need more intensive treatment and surveillance efforts, including those who have survived a recent acute coronary event. Much of the current literature that has examined the characteristics of those who survived a recent AMI has focused on the impact of conventional risk and prognostic factors, such as cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and elevated blood pressure, on in‐hospital and postdischarge survival. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Few contemporary studies have, however, described the characteristics and role of other risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events, including depression, functional status, or quality of transitional care after hospital discharge for an AMI, in relation to postdischarge prognosis, overall or at varying time points. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Many psychosocial, cognitive, or functional status indicators are not reported in clinical trials or observational studies of patients with acute coronary disease. Inasmuch, their association with clinically relevant outcomes, such as death, recurrent AMI, stroke, an unplanned coronary revascularization, and/or readmission to the hospital because of chest pain/unstable angina, has seldom been explored. 12 The TRANSLATE‐ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome) study 13 is a large observational investigation of patients hospitalized with AMI who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention at > 200 medical centers throughout the United States. The study collected information on a broad array of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors in this patient population. In this article, we describe the likelihood and characteristics of patients in this study who did not experience any significant major adverse cardiovascular event within the first 6 weeks (early period) and during the first year (late period) after hospital discharge for an AMI.

### Difference in medication adherence between patients prescribed a 30-day versus 90-day supply after acute myocardial infarction [^111qz6Lp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Proportion of Patients Filling a 90‐Day Fill by Evidence‐Based Medication Class *

Table 2 compares the demographic and clinical characteristics between patients who filled exclusively 30‐day versus exclusively 90‐day supplies in their first fill of all EBM classes. Patients who filled 90‐day supplies were older, more likely White, and less likely to have commercial insurance than those patients who filled only 30‐day supplies (all P < 0.01). Patients who filled a 90‐day supply were also more likely to have a past medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and a history of a prior MI or prior revascularization (all P < 0.01). The median hospital length of stay was 3 days (25th, 75th percentiles = 2, 4) for both groups. Patients who filled a 90‐day supply were more likely to have presented with a NSTEMI and were slightly more likely to be treated with drug‐eluting stents compared with patients who filled only 30‐day supplies (all P < 0.01).

Table 2
Characteristics of Patients Initially Filling a 30‐Day Versus 90‐Day Supply of Medications *

Among the 348 012 (98.5%) patients who survived to 12 months after discharge for whom 1‐year medication adherence was analyzed, 90‐day fill rates were similarly low, ranging from 9.7% for P2Y 12 inhibitors to 14.6% for ACEi/ARBs (Table S2). At 12 months, medication adherence rates were significantly higher for patients with initial 90‐day than those with 30‐day fills, regardless of medication class (P < 0.01 for all classes; Figure 1). The risk ratios in Table 3 demonstrate that patients who filled a 90‐day prescription were more likely to achieve 12‐month EBM adherence than patients who filled a 30‐day prescription initially both before and after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. As patients who initially filled a 90‐day prescription were not at risk for nonadherence until after day 90, a sensitivity analysis censoring the first 90 days was performed and showed similar results (Table 3). In addition, a sensitivity analysis censoring the first 90 days was performed to examine medication adherence rates at 12 months. Similar to Figure 1, medication adherence rates were significantly higher across all EBM classes for patients with initial 90‐day fills compared with patients with 30‐day fills (Figure S1).

Clinical implementation — scope and use state that "the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests" and that "Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment". Implementation notes that "Management, in accordance with guideline recommendations, is effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients", and that "Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities".

### The effect of follow-up reexamination on the long-term prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary angiography [^114Vzrar]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Reexamination

According to the risk assessment results, a detailed and clear post-discharge follow-up plan and reexamination guidance were formulated before discharge. The recommended reexamination times were 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months after discharge, following our center's standardized procedures (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Laboratory tests including lipid profile, glycaemic status, renal function, liver function, a complete blood count, and possibly biomarkers, were conducted. A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be part of every visit to detect changes suggestive of silent ischaemia/infarction. The choice of reexamination approach was left to the patient's discretion. When patients could not visit the hospital in person, a remote physician consultation system based on a mobile application (WeChat) was provided. The cardiologist assessed the patient's overall clinical status, medication compliance, and risk profile (reflected by risk scores) to optimize the medication plan on time and improve their medication adherence by further educating. Once the patient experienced chest pain, chest tightness, or an abnormal electrocardiogram, hospitalization or coronary angiography was recommended to evaluate the coronary stenoses when non-invasive testing was inconclusive. The specific assessment process is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3
Post-discharge reexamination guidance of ACS patients. ACS patients are recommended to undergo laboratory tests (a lipid profile: glycaemic status: renal function: liver function: a complete blood count: and possibly biomarkers) and a 12-lead ECG at 1: 3: 6: 12: 24: and 36 months after discharge. When patients experience chest pain: chest tightness: or have an abnormal electrocardiogram: hospitalization or coronary angiography is recommended to detect lesions early. ACS: acute coronary syndrome

Clinical follow-up and outcome definitions

The patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months sequentially after discharge via telephone, remote consultation system, or outpatient visits, according to our center's standardized procedures (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The median follow-up duration was 3 years. The primary outcome was cardiac death during the follow-up. Other secondary outcomes were all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), unplanned revascularization, and re-hospitalization for cardiac causes. The detailed definitions of each adverse event are summarized in the Additional file 1.

### Timing of first postdischarge follow-up and medication adherence after acute myocardial infarction [^1136EV9m]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The use of evidence-based medication therapy in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) improves long-term prognosis, yet the current rates of adherence are poor.

Objective

To determine whether earlier outpatient follow-up after AMI is associated with higher rates of medication adherence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective analysis was conducted of 20 976 Medicare patients older than 65 years discharged alive after an AMI between January 2, 2007, and October 1, 2010, from 461 Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines hospitals in the United States. Patients were grouped based on the timing of first follow-up clinic visit within 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 6 weeks, or more than 6 weeks after hospital discharge. Data analysis was conducted from September 26, 2014, to April 22, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Medication adherence was defined as the proportion of days with more than 80% coverage using Medicare Part D prescription fill records and was examined at 90 days and 1 year after discharge for β-blockers, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

Results

Among 20 976 Medicare-insured patients discharged alive after acute MI, 10 381 (49.5%) were men; mean (SD) age was 75.8 (7.5) years. The median time to the first outpatient follow-up visit after hospital discharge was 14 days (interquartile range, 7–28 days). Overall, the first follow-up clinic visit occurred 1 week or less after discharge in 5542 (26.4%) patients, 1 to 2 weeks in 5246 (25.0%), 2 to 6 weeks in 6830 (32.6%), and more than 6 weeks in 3358 (16.0%) individuals. Rates of medication adherence for secondary prevention therapies ranged from 63.4% to 68.7% at 90 days and 54.4% to 63.5% at 1 year. Compared with patients with follow-up visits within 1 week, those with follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks and 2 to 6 weeks had no significant difference in medication adherence; however, patients with follow-up more than 6 weeks after discharge had lower adherence at both 90 days (56.8%-61.3% vs 64.7%-69.3%; P < .001) and 1 year (49.5%-57.7% vs 55.4%-64.1%; P < .001). Patients with delayed follow-up more than 6 weeks were more likely to reside in communities with lower household incomes and educational levels (both P < .001); however, their clinical characteristics were similar to those of patients with earlier follow-up. After adjusting for these differences, delayed follow-up of more than 6 weeks remained associated with lower medication adherence at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.70–0.78]) and 1 year (OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.73–0.85]) compared with follow-up of 6 weeks or less.

Conclusions and Relevance

Delayed outpatient follow-up beyond the first 6 weeks after AMI is associated with worse short-term and long-term patient medication adherence. These data support the concept that medication adherence is modifiable via improved care transitions.

### Adherence to evidence-based therapies after discharge for acute coronary syndromes: an ongoing prospective, observational study [^1144Gcf7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the rates of patient adherence to key evidence-based therapies at 6 months after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome.

Methods

In this nonrandomized, prospective, multinational, multicenter study, adherence to aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 6 months after discharge for myocardial infarction or unstable angina was assessed in 21,408 patients aged 18 years or older. Patients were enrolled at 104 tertiary and community hospitals representing a broad range of care facilities and practice settings (e.g., teaching vs. nonteaching).

Results

Of 13,830 patients, discontinuation of therapy was observed at 6-month follow-up in 8% of those taking aspirin on discharge, 12% of those taking beta-blockers, 20% of those taking ACE inhibitors, and 13% of those taking statins. In a multivariate analysis, adherence to beta-blocker therapy was higher in patients with a myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.47), hypertension (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.61), or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.45). Aspirin adherence was higher among patients cared for by cardiologists (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.75; P < 0.001) than among those cared for by nonspecialists. Male sex and prior heart failure were associated with improved adherence to ACE inhibitor therapy. Hypertension was associated with poorer adherence to statin therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Among patients prescribed key evidence-based medications at discharge, 8% to 20% were no longer taking their medication after 6 months. The reasons for noncompliance are complex, and may be elucidated by future studies of medical and social determinants.

### Association between intensive care unit usage and long-term medication adherence, mortality, and readmission among initially stable patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^11755Dog]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials used in this article will not be made available to other researchers.

Patient Population

The NCDR CPMI (Chest Pain Myocardial Infarction) Registry captures consecutive patients admitted to participating hospitals with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction and NSTEMI. 12, 13 Trained data abstractors at each hospital collect detailed information on medical history, clinical presentation, and in‐hospital treatment via retrospective chart review. Real‐time data quality feedback and annual audits ensure data accuracy. Patients aged ≥ 65 years in this registry have previously been linked to their Medicare claims data using 5 indirect identifiers (date of birth, sex, hospital identifier, date of admission, and date of discharge). 14, 15, 16 We used this linked data source to determine ICU usage, medication adherence, and post‐discharge outcomes.

Between April 2011 and December 2014, 106 801 patients aged ≥ 65 years with MI were admitted with NSTEMI to 689 hospitals and included in the linked database. We excluded patients who were transferred into (n = 29 425) or out of (n = 3947) a CPMI hospital, since patient experience and post‐discharge outcomes in these cases cannot be ascribed only to the NCDR hospital. Patients who had cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock on first medical contact as identified on the registry's case report form (n = 2384) were also excluded, since these patients have a compelling indication for ICU care other than NSTEMI. To avoid double counting of patients with multiple MI admissions during the study period, we started follow‐up after the first admission (3939 subsequent NCDR records for MI readmission were excluded). Because analyses were conducted on the hospital level, we excluded hospitals admitting < 25 patients during the study period (169 hospitals treating 1850 patients). 4 Our final study population included 65 256 initially hemodynamically stable NSTEMI patients treated at 520 hospitals (Figure 1). For analyses of post‐discharge outcomes, we further excluded 3004 patients who died while hospitalized. For analyses of medication non‐adherence, we included only patients with Part D Medicare prescription coverage (n = 28 185).

### Early medication nonadherence after acute myocardial infarction: insights into actionable opportunities from the TReatment with ADP receptor iNhibitorS: longitudinal assessment of treatment patterns and events after acute coronary syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) study [^1122vjMc]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nonadherence to prescribed evidence-based medications after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can contribute to worse outcomes and higher costs. We sought to better understand the modifiable factors contributing to early nonadherence of evidence-based medications after acute MI.

Methods and Results

We assessed 7425 acute MI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention at 216 US hospitals participating in TReatment with ADP receptor iNhibitorS: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) between April 2010 and May 2012. Using the validated Morisky instrument to assess cardiovascular medication adherence at 6 weeks post MI, we stratified patients into self-reported high (score, 8), moderate (score, 6–7), and low (score, < 6) adherence groups. Moderate and low adherence was reported in 25% and 4% of patients, respectively. One third of low adherence patients described missing doses of antiplatelet therapy at least twice a week after percutaneous coronary intervention. Signs of depression and patient-reported financial hardship because of medication expenses were independently associated with a higher likelihood of medication nonadherence. Patients were more likely to be adherent at 6 weeks if they had follow-up appointments made before discharge and had a provider explain potential side effects of their medications. Lower medication adherence may be associated with a higher risk of 3-month death/readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.87) although this did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions

Even early after MI, a substantial proportion of patients report suboptimal adherence to prescribed medications. Tailored patient education and pre discharge planning may represent actionable opportunities to optimize patient adherence and clinical outcomes.

### Association between medication adherence and 1-year major cardiovascular adverse events after acute myocardial infarction in China [^115Lr415]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Sample

The China PEACE Prospective AMI study consecutively enrolled 5901 AMI patients aged ≥ 18 years across 53 acute‐care hospitals between January 1, 2013 and July 17, 2014. 22 Patient information was collected at baseline (ie, the index AMI hospitalization) and postdischarge at 1, 6, and 12 months. Baseline data included medical chart–abstracted information and in‐hospital patient interviews. All postdischarge interviews were conducted either in‐person or via telephone when an in‐person interview was not feasible. Patients were classified as nonresponders after 5 telephone interview attempts with no response. The overall response rate was 97.8%. Real Data Medical Research, Inc. in Ningbo, China, abstracted all medical records, with an agreement rate between repeat abstractions of 98% for key data elements. During the 1‐year follow‐up period, trained staff interviewed patients and systematically sought information on all clinical events, including recurrent AMI, angina, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack, repeated angiography procedures, revascularization, bleeding, and rehospitalizations. For patients who died during follow‐up, death information was obtained from the family or physician. For patients who were unable to attend an onsite interview, information was obtained by telephone through direct correspondence with the patient, patient's family members, or patient's physician. It is our goal to share the China PEACE Prospective AMI study data; however, at this time, we are unable to do so.

We excluded patients who did not agree to participate in the follow‐up interviews (n = 1206), were transferred to another acute‐care hospital (n = 113), who died before discharge (n = 287), or were lost to follow‐up immediately after discharge (n = 68). We further excluded those patients whose postdischarge interviews were conducted via telephone with a proxy answering on the patient's behalf (n = 226) because the interview responses may not have accurately reflected that patient's adherence. Overall, these excluded patients were older (age ≥ 65 years, 54.8% versus 38.0%), more female (31.9% versus 22.7%), and more had no job at baseline (94.9% versus 59.2%) than those analyzed. The Human Investigation Committee of China's National Clinical Research Center of Cardiovascular Diseases approved this study. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Absence of chest pain and long-term mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^114pma7h]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Registers and sample procedure

We obtained information from the national quality of care register SWEDEHEART. The register includes all patients who are treated for acute coronary syndrome in coronary care units or other specialised facilities in Sweden. The register started in 1995 with 19 participating hospitals, increasing gradually to 72 hospitals, and currently includes all Swedish hospitals treating acute cardiac diseases. The register includes information on clinical characteristics, type of infarction, symptoms, diagnosis, medication, and procedures on admission, during hospitalisation and at discharge. The register is monitored on a regular basis with a 95%–96% agreement between the registry and health records. On admission, all patients who are registered in SWEDEHEART receive written information about the registry, their voluntary participation and about the possibility to decline participation.

### Difference in medication adherence between patients prescribed a 30-day versus 90-day supply after acute myocardial infarction [^1157SiSq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although our study uses a national cardiovascular registry data with in‐depth clinical records of patients following a PCI and acute MI linked with longitudinal pharmacy claims data, there are several important limitations. As this is a retrospective, observational study, residual confounding cannot be excluded. The prescription fill database used for this analysis cannot account for drug samples or hospital‐sponsored drugs distributed to patients at both the time of discharge or during outpatient follow‐up visits. In addition, any restrictions from drug coverage plans on patient receipt of 90‐day supplies is unknown and could not be accounted for in this analysis. Finally, as direct observation of medication ingestion was not possible, this analysis may have overestimated rates of medication adherence.

### Treatment, outcomes, and adherence to medication regimens among dual Medicare-medicaid-eligible adults with myocardial infarction [^114BYKuN]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patients with dual Medicare-Medicaid eligibility have a higher burden of chronic disease conditions and increased health care utilization compared with patients with Medicare coverage alone, but the treatment patterns and outcomes of dual-eligible patients with myocardial infarction (MI) are unknown.

Objective

To examine the association of dual-eligible status with clinical outcomes and adherence to medication regimens (hereinafter "medication adherence") among older adults after MI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective study conducted from February 2015 to April 2016, we linked patients 65 years or older enrolled in a national myocardial infarction registry (the Acute Coronary Treatment Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines [ACTION Registry-GWTG]) from July 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, to Medicare claims data to obtain 1-year follow-up and medication adherence data. The ACTION Registry-GWTG is the largest quality-improvement registry of patients with MI in the United States. Included patients were all 65 years or older; had Medicare Parts A, B, and D; presented with MI; and survived to hospital discharge.

Exposures

Dual Medicare and Medicaid eligibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Death, readmission, major adverse cardiovascular events (death, recurrent MI, stroke), and medication adherence at 1 year.

Results

Of 17 419 Medicare patients discharged alive after MI, 4674 (27%) were dual eligible. Dual-eligible patients were more likely to be female (64% vs 49%) and nonwhite (29% vs 6%), with a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions and more frequent presentation with non-ST elevation MI (non-STEMI) (75% vs 69%). Dual-eligible patients were less likely to receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI (77% vs 81%), revascularization for non-STEMI (58% vs 65%), and prescription of secondary prevention medications at discharge. After multivariable adjustment, dual eligibility status was associated with a higher risk of readmission at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.26), death at 1 year (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14–1.36), and major adverse cardiac events at 1 year (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12–1.31). Dual-eligible patients had higher 1-year adherence to medications prescribed at discharge (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.39–1.74) than Medicare-only patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with Medicare-only patients, older adults with dual Medicare-Medicaid eligibility presenting with MI have superior rates of medication adherence but higher rates of postdischarge readmission and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### Does family history have any relevance to clinical practice in cardiology? [^117VZgKC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Years ago it was common to include all aspects of the history in the presentation, including the family history. In more recent times when there are multiple admissions of patients with cardiac symptoms (e.g., chest pain), the details of the present illness and any past cardiovascular illnesses are generally presented in detail, but there is a tendency to pay little attention to the family history and it is often neglected.

Postdischarge follow-up and systems of care in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — transition from hospital to home is described as high risk because approximately 1 in 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge; hospital-initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year as well as a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and multicomponent integrated care with ≥ 2 quality improvement strategies has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause hospitalization. Populations particularly at risk for readmission include women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services, and transition care interventions and programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative or the AMI Toolkit provide resources to decrease readmission rates and improve medication and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) adherence through increased provider communication and care coordination.

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

### Life-saving medications: the urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^117YFaDH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately 60% of patients in the PALM registry who were not on a statin reported that they did not recall being offered one by their healthcare provider. Of course, this high percentage is subject to recall bias. Strikingly, multivariate modeling showed that black adults, women, and those without insurance were the least likely to report having been offered a statin. Multiple studies have shown disparities in quality health care. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Specifically, fewer women and black adults, especially black women, are offered guideline‐directed interventions, including risk factor assessment, statins for primary and secondary prevention, revascularization procedures and reperfusion time targets, and evidence‐based treatment upon discharge from hospital postmyocardial infarction. Unfortunately, this is true both within and outside the United States, and translates into poorer outcomes resulting from sex/gender and racial/ethnic disparities in care. Our challenge as clinicians and scientists is to engage in several strategies to reverse these trends: provider education and public awareness; integration of sex‐ and race/ethnic‐specific recommendations in clinical practice guidelines; expansion of the proportion of women and nonwhite individuals in research; interventions to address social determinants of health; leveraging electronic health records to identify disparities in care; and partnering with advocacy groups and policy‐makers for equitable care. 7

### Long-term medication adherence after myocardial infarction: experience of a community [^1121s8Ra]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Adherence to evidence-based medications after myocardial infarction is associated with improved outcomes. However, long-term data on factors affecting medication adherence after myocardial infarction are lacking.

Methods

Olmsted County residents hospitalized with myocardial infarction from 1997–2006 were identified. Adherence to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers, were examined. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine the factors associated with medication adherence over time.

Results

Among 292 subjects with incident myocardial infarction (63% men, mean age 65 years), patients were followed for an average of 52 ± 31 months. Adherence to guideline-recommended medications decreased over time, with 3-year medication continuation rates of 44%, 48%, and 43% for statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, respectively. Enrollment in a cardiac rehabilitation program was associated with an improved likelihood of continuing medications, with adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for discontinuation of statins and beta-blockers among cardiac rehabilitation participants of 0.66 (0.45–0.92) and 0.70 (0.49–0.98), respectively. Smoking at the time of myocardial infarction was associated with a decreased likelihood of continuing medications, although results did not reach statistical significance. There were no observed associations between demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of the myocardial infarction, and medication adherence.

Conclusions

After myocardial infarction, a large proportion of patients discontinue use of medications over time. Enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction is associated with improved medication adherence.

### Predictors of adherence to performance measures in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^116hybfU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There have been substantial improvements in the use of evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapies for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, some gaps, disparities, and variations in use remain. To understand how such gaps in recommended care may be narrowed further, it may be useful to determine those factors associated with lessened adherence to guideline-based care.

Methods

The Get with the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease registry measured adherence with 6 performance measures (aspirin within 24 hours, discharge on aspirin and beta-blockers, patients with low ejection fraction discharged on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, smoking cessation counseling, use of lipid-lowering medications) in 148,654 patients with acute myocardial infarction between 2002 and 2009. Logistic multivariable regression models using generalized estimating equations were utilized to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with adherence to each of 6 measures, and to a summary score of performance for all measures, in eligible patients.

Results

We identified 10 variables that were associated significantly with either greater adherence (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hospital with full interventional capabilities, calendar year) or worse adherence (age, female sex, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, chronic dialysis) in at least 4 of the 6 treatment adherence models, as well as the summary score adherence model. Age, sex, and calendar year were significant in all models.

Conclusions

Use of evidence-based acute myocardial infarction treatments remains less than ideal for certain high-risk populations. The close correlations among factors associated with underperformance highlights the potential for specifically targeting and tailoring quality improvement interventions.

Acute chest pain — risk-based disposition with the clinical decision pathway specifies that those "assigned to the abnormal/high-risk category" "should be further classified according to the Universal Definition of MI into type 1 or 2 MI or acute or chronic nonischemic cardiac injury", and "High-risk patients should usually be admitted to an inpatient setting for further evaluation and treatment". For intermediate risk, patients "should undergo additional observation with repeat hs-cTn measurements at 3 to 6 hours and risk assessment using either the modified History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) score or the ED Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS)", and "Noninvasive testing should be considered for the intermediate-risk group unless low-risk features are identified using risk scores or noninvasive testing has been performed recently with normal or low-risk findings".

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) discharge — best practices include patient-centered communication, comprehensive clinical and patient/caregiver assessments, confirmed referrals, and addressing social determinants. Communication is "Patient centered, verbally and in writing in patient/caregiver preferred language" with "Shared decision-making regarding assessment of goals and preferences should be discussed with patient/caregiver". Clinical assessment actions are to "Address comorbidities and risk factors for recurrent events", "Assess for presence of ongoing ischemic symptoms, using standardized instrument ideally embedded into EHR", "Assess risk for bleeding related to medications or procedural site", "Assess need for additional testing (eg, repeat echocardiogram, staged PCI)", "Assess whether vaccinations are current (eg, influenza)", and "Perform medication reconciliation, including a prescription for sublingual nitroglycerin, unless contraindicated". Patient/caregiver assessment should "Assess capacity for patient/caregiver for self-care (eg, secondary prevention, symptom monitoring, following plan of care, lifestyle changes, contact information for continuing care team)", "Provide verbal and written educational information related to self-care", "Use teach-back method to confirm understanding of self-care", and "Use teach-back method for patient/caregiver understanding of medication adherence and treatment regimen". Referrals include "Confirm referral to CR" and "Provide educational materials related to CR including contact information". Social determinants guidance is to "Assess and address barriers to obtaining and taking prescribed medications, to include referral to pharmacy assistance programs or social worker as appropriate" and "Assess and address barriers to attending CR, including viability of home-based or hybrid CR".

### Rationale and design of the GRACE (global registry of acute coronary events) project: a multinational registry of patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes [^111riZZt]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including the spectrum of conditions from unstable angina to ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. GRACE (the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) is a large, prospective, multinational observational study of patients hospitalized with ACS. The aim of GRACE is to improve the quality of care for patients with ACS by describing differences in, and relationships between, patient characteristics, treatment practices, and in-hospital and postdischarge outcomes at hospitals around the world. A goal of this study is to study approximately 10,000 patients with ACS on an annual basis.

Methods

A total of 18 cluster sites in 14 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are currently collaborating in GRACE. Clusters were chosen on the basis of local demographic characteristics and hospital facilities to ensure a representative sample of patients with ACS from each country. Patients are identified by use of either active or passive surveillance approaches. A standardized core case report form is completed for all patients. Information on patient demographics, medical history, acute symptoms, clinical characteristics, electrocardiographic findings, treatment approaches, and in-hospital outcomes is collected. Patients are followed up at 6 months after hospital discharge to identify recurrent coronary events, use of various medications, and mortality.

Conclusions

The information collected from the GRACE project will provide important and extensive insights into patient demographic and clinical characteristics, current practice patterns, and outcomes for patients with ACS from a number of countries throughout the world. Given the pressures of practicing evidence-based medicine, the results of GRACE should provide a multinational perspective into these important outcomes and identify practice variations that will allow new opportunities to improve patient care.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116mRtBn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

High-risk or abnormal classification by clinical decision pathway (CDP) — the majority of patients classified as abnormal or high risk by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)-based CDPs will require hospital admission and/or cardiology consultation before discharge; patients should be classified per the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction (MI) as type 1 or 2 MI or acute or chronic myocardial injury, with type 1 MI patients admitted and managed per ACC/AHA STEMI and NSTEMI-ACS guidelines and close outpatient cardiology follow-up and referral to cardiac rehabilitation recommended on discharge; patients with type 2 MI or acute myocardial injury should be admitted by the most appropriate hospital team for treatment of the underlying precipitant, with outpatient cardiology follow-up recommended; for chronic myocardial injury, disposition should be individualized, these patients do not routinely require admission or cardiology consultation unless another indication exists, and additional outpatient transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with subsequent cardiology follow-up is recommended if no recent TTE.

What is already known on this subject

In general practice, patients presenting with chest pain have a 5% chance of having a coronary event. Patients with acute coronary syndrome are at risk of mortality and as such should be recognized and referred to secondary care.

### The association of chest pain duration and other historical features with major adverse cardiac events [^113Qxymb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine if the duration of pain or other features of the history predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with chest pain in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients presenting to a single ED with chest pain. Consenting patients filled out a survey about their symptoms. After 6 weeks, we assessed patients for MACE via chart review and direct contact. We used this data to calculate the likelihood ratios (LRs) of a number of historical features for acute myocardial infarction (MI) (primary endpoint) and MACE within 6 weeks (secondary endpoint). We planned a priori to analyze patients who reported chest pain for ≤ 1 min or continuously for ≥ 24 h.

Results

We enrolled 1002 patients, and 83.6% had successful 6-week follow up. Regarding chest pain lasting for ≤ 1 min, the positive LR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.24 to 3.80) for acute MI and 0.67 (95% CI 0.17 to 2.72) for MACE within 6 weeks. The positive LRs of continuous pain lasting ≥ 24 h for acute MI and MACE within 6 weeks were 0.15 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.58) and 0.36 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.74), respectively. Amongst other historical features assessed, radiation to the right arm was the strongest positive predictor of acute MI.

Conclusion

Patients with continuous chest pain for ≥ 24 h are unlikely to have an acute MI. Chest pain lasting ≤ 1 min does not exclude acute MI.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Chest pain — U.S. epidemiology and care utilization — accounts for > 6.5 million emergency department (ED) visits, which is 4.7% of all ED visits, and also leads to nearly 4 million outpatient visits annually; coronary artery disease (CAD) affects > 18.2 million adults and remains the leading cause of death for men and women, accounting for > 365,000 deaths annually. The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is 20% to 40%, women experience this symptom more often than men, and among ED patients with chest pain only 5.1% will have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with more than half ultimately found to have a noncardiac cause.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113bYSBc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Early discharge after myocardial infarction — among low-risk ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality; the Zwolle score has been recommended as a clinical tool to help identify low-risk patients (score ≤ 3) who can potentially be discharged earlier (48 to 72 hours). Small retrospective studies suggest safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative, and patients considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support; hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Cardiovascular medication use and long-term outcomes of first nations and non-first nations patients following diagnostic angiography: a retrospective cohort study [^1152ra3w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of this study should be considered. Measuring medication use in terms of dispensations and MPRs does not indicate that patients actually took the medications as prescribed; therefore, it is only a proxy for medication adherence. 43 Furthermore, although the dispensation of study medications would have required a prescription, the lack of dispensation is not evidence that a prescription was not written. It is not clear whether improved prescribing or better supports to allow filling of prescriptions would increase MPRs. In addition, administrative data do not contain information on potential adverse reactions, allergies, or intolerance, which may have influenced whether a medication was prescribed or discontinued. The mortality and hospitalization outcomes were observed once the 1‐year medication use assessment concluded. It is possible that patient adherence beyond the assessment period (and up to the 5‐year end point) may have changed, which could affect the outcomes. However, these medications are often prescribed indefinitely, and the pattern of use has been shown to be relatively stable beyond 1 year of initiating therapy. 44 Medication use before angiography was not measured but may also have influenced the outcomes because some patients may have already begun to accrue benefits from their longer term use. The primary and secondary prevention efforts before angiography require further research. The inability to track over‐the‐counter medications such as aspirin and the absence of other key clinical variables such as left ventricular function, disease severity, blood pressure, and lipid profiles limited the comprehensiveness of risk adjustment in the analysis. Finally, for patients who were referred for reasons other than IHD (ie, heart failure, valve disease, atypical chest pain) and whose study medication might not be indicated, we excluded patients who did not have a recent myocardial infarction or who were not revascularized. Consequently, some patients with obstructive IHD on angiography who may have undergone only medical therapy would also have been excluded. However, we believe that this group would be only a relatively small number of angiography patients with obstructive IHD.

### Decade-long changes in the use of combination evidence-based medical therapy at discharge for patients surviving acute myocardial infarction [^112fHxXu]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines suggest routine use of several effective cardiac medications in hospital survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The objectives of our population-based study were to describe decade-long trends (1990–2001) in the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents, and combinations thereof, in patients discharged from all metropolitan Worcester (Mass) hospitals after AMI.

Methods

The study sample consisted of 5965 adult men and women of all ages discharged after AMI from all greater Worcester hospitals in 7 annual periods between 1990 and 2001.

Results

Although consistent increases in the use of each of the effective cardiac medications examined were observed over time, particularly marked relative increases in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (168% relative increase) and lipid-lowering agents (1086% relative increase) were noted. Use of combinations of effective cardiac medications also increased substantially over time. Between 1990 and 2001, the percentage of hospital survivors treated with ≥ 3 cardiac medications increased from 12.9% to 74.0%. Advancing age, female sex, history of angina, hypertension, or heart failure during hospitalization, presence of an initial non-Q wave MI, and development of atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization were independently associated with underuse of combination medical therapy.

Conclusions

The present results suggest considerable improvements over the last decade in the medical management of patients hospitalized with AMI. Educational efforts, however, aimed at clinicians and designed to improve use of these therapies, as well as efforts to simplify medication regimens and enhance rates of adherence, remain warranted.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation patient referral from an outpatient setting after revascularization — clinical recommendations state that in patients who have undergone revascularization, a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program (home based or center based) should be prescribed either before hospital discharge or during the first outpatient visit to reduce deaths and hospital readmissions and improve quality of life (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are recommended for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). All eligible patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or whose status is immediately post coronary artery bypass surgery or post-PCI should be referred to a comprehensive outpatient cardiovascular rehabilitation program either prior to hospital discharge or during the first follow-up office visit (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Cardiac rehabilitation is recommended for all eligible patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Medically supervised exercise programs (cardiac rehabilitation) should be recommended to patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), particularly for patients at moderate to high risk, for whom supervised exercise training is warranted (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). For women, a comprehensive cardiovascular disease risk-reduction regimen such as cardiovascular or stroke rehabilitation or a physician-guided home- or community-based exercise training program should be recommended to women with a recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization, new-onset or chronic angina, recent cerebrovascular event, peripheral arterial disease (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A) or current/prior symptoms of heart failure and an LVEF ≤ 35% (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B).

American College of Cardiology emergency department chest pain pathway — applicability and exclusions are as follows: The content applies only to patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia undergoing evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and it does not apply to patients with stable angina or those evaluated in settings other than the ED. This pathway is not applicable to patients with hemodynamic instability, significant heart failure, or other conditions that would mandate hospital admission. The document is focused on the rapid evaluation and disposition of patients with possible ACS in the ED and does not address the evaluation and management of patients with definite ACS or serve as a guide for the diagnosis or management of myocardial infarction (MI).

### National evaluation of adherence to β-blocker therapy for 1 year after acute myocardial infarction in patients with commercial health insurance [^111nJY6r]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Quality measures of evidence-based medications post-myocardial infarction have focused on prescription at hospital discharge. Yet survival benefits of these medications are best realized with sustained therapy. We sought to examine long-term beta-blocker adherence over the first year after myocardial infarction in patients with commercial health insurance and prescription drug benefits.

Methods

This multicenter analysis examined health plan records from members of 11 health plans who had myocardial infarction in 2001, survived at least 1 year, and maintained insurance coverage (N = 17,035). The primary outcome measure was adherence to beta-blockers (defined as prescription claims covering ≥ 75% of days) for 360 days post-discharge. We also examined associations with adherence — time from discharge, health plan product (commercial or Medicare + Choice [M + C]), age (35–64 or ≥ 65), sex, and region.

Results

For 360 days after discharge, only 45% of patients were adherent to beta-blockers, with the biggest drop in adherence between 30 and 90 days. In a multivariable model, statistically significant predictors of lower adherence were participation in M + C product, residence in the Southeast, and age (driven by young participants in M + C and young females in commercial products).

Conclusions

In a population of patients with health insurance and prescription drug coverage, adherence to beta-blocker therapy in the first year after myocardial infarction is poor, indicating that factors other than medication cost are important determinants of long-term adherence. Quality improvement initiatives focused on long-term adherence are needed to realize maximal benefit from medical therapy in post-myocardial infarction patients.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to management of pain and anxiety, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to assess the patient's need for treatment of chronic musculoskeletal discomfort before hospital discharge and use a stepped-care approach for the selection of treatments. Prescribe acetaminophen, nonacetylated salicylates, tramadol, or small doses of narcotics for pain management and consider offering NSAIDs if these medications are not adequate.

Patient Characteristics and Outcomes

Information was obtained by medical chart abstraction, and standardized in‐person interviews were performed by trained personnel during the index admission for the following variables. Self‐identified race was categorized as black, white, or other, and ethnicity as hispanic or non‐hispanic. Chest pain symptoms were defined as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest. For women, reproductive and menstrual history was obtained. Information on cardiac risk factors and cardiac procedures as listed in Table 1, hypercoaguable syndromes (as charted by the treatment team), clinical severity of AMI (peak troponin level, ejection fraction < 40%), in‐hospital therapies received (revascularization, automatic implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator insertion), discharge medications, length of stay, disposition and final adjudicated ECG diagnosis (ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] versus non‐STEMI) were also collected. Validated standardized instruments were used to assess psychosocial and health status. These included (1) depression using the 9‐item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9), with higher scores indicating increasing severity (range 0–27) 19, 20, 21, 22; (2) perceived stress using the 14‐item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), with higher scores indicating higher stress levels (range 0–40) 23, 24; and (3) health status outcomes (patients' physical limitations, angina frequency, and quality of life related to angina) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ; scores ranging from 0 to 100), with higher scores indicating better health status. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 In addition, detailed review of medical charts was conducted to better characterize the AMI phenotypes.

### A 2-hour diagnostic protocol for possible cardiac chest pain in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^113iB8Lf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patients with chest pain represent a high health care burden, but it may be possible to identify a patient group with a low short-term risk of adverse cardiac events who are suitable for early discharge.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of a rapid diagnostic pathway with a standard-care diagnostic pathway for the assessment of patients with possible cardiac chest pain in a usual clinical practice setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-center, randomized parallel-group trial with blinded outcome assessments was conducted in an academic general and tertiary hospital. Participants included adults with acute chest pain consistent with acute coronary syndrome for whom the attending physician planned further observation and troponin testing. Patient recruitment occurred from October 11, 2010, to July 4, 2012, with a 30-day follow-up.

Interventions

An experimental pathway using an accelerated diagnostic protocol (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score, 0; electrocardiography; and 0- and 2-hour troponin tests) or a standard-care pathway (troponin test on arrival at hospital, prolonged observation, and a second troponin test 6–12 hours after onset of pain) serving as the control.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Discharge from the hospital within 6 hours without a major adverse cardiac event occurring within 30 days.

Results

Fifty-two of 270 patients in the experimental group were successfully discharged within 6 hours compared with 30 of 272 patients in the control group (19.3% vs 11.0%; odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.18–3.13; P = 0.008). It required 20 hours to discharge the same proportion of patients from the control group as achieved in the experimental group within 6 hours. In the experimental group, 35 additional patients (12.9%) were classified as low risk but admitted to an inpatient ward for cardiac investigation. None of the 35 patients received a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome after inpatient evaluation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Using the accelerated diagnostic protocol in the experimental pathway almost doubled the proportion of patients with chest pain discharged early. Clinicians could discharge approximately 1 of 5 patients with chest pain to outpatient follow-up monitoring in less than 6 hours. This diagnostic strategy could be easily replicated in other centers because no extra resources are required.

Disposition after rule-out by hs-cTn CDP — patients ruled out using an hs-cTn CDP are eligible for discharge from the emergency department (ED) without further noninvasive cardiac testing due to their low likelihood of 30-day death and MI. Following discharge, low-risk patients ruled out for MI by one of the CDPs should be referred for outpatient follow-up within 30 days and, if feasible, within 14 days, and whenever possible should be instructed to follow up with their established clinician; the patient's PCP and/or cardiologist should be notified at discharge to facilitate outpatient follow-up.

### Acute coronary syndromes without chest pain, an underdiagnosed and undertreated high-risk group: insights from the global registry of acute coronary events [^114x18Ch]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) vary, and patients present frequently with symptoms other than chest pain. In this analysis, a large contemporary database has been accessed to define the frequency, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients presenting without chest pain across different diagnostic categories of ACS.

Design and Setting

The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events is a multinational, prospective, observational study involving 14 countries.

Patients

Patients presenting to the hospital with a suspected ACS were stratified according to whether their predominant presenting symptoms included chest pain (ie, typical) or did not (ie, atypical). Demographics, medical history, hospital management, and outcomes were compared.

Measurements and Results

Of the 20,881 patients in this analysis, 1,763 (8.4%) presented without chest pain, 23.8% of whom were not initially recognized as having an ACS. They were less likely to receive effective cardiac medications, and experienced greater hospital morbidity and mortality (13% vs 4.3%, respectively; p < 0.0001) than did patients with typical symptoms. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, increased hospital mortality rates were noted in patients with dominant presenting symptoms of presyncope/syncope (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 2.9), nausea or vomiting (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.4), and dyspnea (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9), and in those with painless presentations of unstable angina (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.5) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2).

Conclusion

Patients with ACSs who present without chest pain are frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated. With the exception of diaphoresis, each dominant presenting symptom independently identifies a population that is at increased risk of dying. These patients experience greater morbidity and a higher mortality across the spectrum of ACSs.

### Time to move on: redefining chest pain outcomes [^1164MZqp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Consider the following case scenarios:

A 65‐year‐old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease presents to his cardiologist with 2 weeks of intermittent, exertional chest pressure and dyspnea. An ECG shows nonspecific findings. His HEART score is 6. The patient is scheduled for a cardiac catheterization the following week. Significant atherosclerotic disease is identified, and revascularization is performed. Most would agree that his evaluation and management were patient centered, expedient, and successful.

Now consider the same patient presentation, only this time in the ED. He has the same history, the same ECG, normal vital signs, and negative serial troponin assays. His HEART score is still 6, placing him at moderate‐risk for a MACE in the next 4–6 weeks. In our current healthcare environment, the patient would likely be admitted to the hospital or placed in an observation unit. But does this make him safer? In both scenarios, he undergoes revascularization, but in the latter, had he been discharged from the ED, his revascularization would have been deemed a missed MACE. This is a contributing factor to patients being exposed to the risks and costs inherent to hospitalization. Does the setting in which care is provided justify these additional risks and healthcare costs?

In ACS, early invasive treatment (within 24–48 hours), with cardiac catheterization and appropriate revascularization, remains the preferred treatment for patients with unstable angina or non–ST‐segment–elevation MI when prohibitive comorbidities are absent. 11 Percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina, even with modest amounts of ischemia, has not been shown to reduce death, nonfatal MI, unplanned revascularization, or angina. 11 Without evidence‐based support for urgent revascularization in the absence of objective findings of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or unstable angina, the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the following 4–6 weeks should not be included in the ED disposition decision. However, non–ST‐segment–elevation MI identified in follow‐up and leading to revascularization could be included in the outcome measure.

### Clinical outcomes according to symptom presentation in patients with acute myocardial infarction: results from the FAST-MI 2010 registry [^116JjpqB]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atypical clinical presentation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is not uncommon; most studies suggest that it is associated with unfavorable prognosis.

Hypothesis

Long-term clinical impact differs according to predominant symptom presentation (typical chest pain, atypical chest pain, syncope, cardiac arrest, or dyspnea) in AMI patients.

Methods

FAST-MI 2010, a nationwide French registry, included 4169 patients with AMI in 213 centers at the end of 2010 (76% of active centers). Demographics, medical history, hospital management, and outcomes were compared according to predominant symptom presentation.

Results

Typical chest pain with no other symptom was reported in 3020 patients (68% in STEMI patients, 76% in NSTEMI patients). Atypical chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, and cardiac arrest were reported in 11%, 11%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Patients with atypical clinical presentation had a higher cardiovascular risk profile and received fewer medications and a less invasive strategy. Using Cox multivariate analysis, atypical chest pain was not associated with higher death rate at 3 years (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.69–1.33, P = 0.78), whereas cardiac arrest (HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.00–5.97, P = 0.05), syncope (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.18–2.46, P = 0.005), and dyspnea (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31–2.10, P < 0.001) were associated with higher long-term mortality compared with patients with typical isolated chest pain. Similar trends were observed in STEMI and NSTEMI populations.

Conclusions

Atypical clinical presentation is observed in about 20% of AMI patients. Cardiac arrest, dyspnea, and syncope represent independent predictors of long-term mortality in STEMI and NSTEMI populations.

### Recurrent myocardial infarction and emergency department visits: a retrospective study on the stockholm area chest pain cohort [^113ABApT]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is generally considered the second most common reason for emergency department (ED) visits. Over 8% of all ED visits between 2012 and 2016 in the Stockholm region were due to chest pain and the USA recorded over 7 million chest pain ED visits in 2018. AMI is ruled out in most patients presenting to the ED with chest pain — AMI is confirmed in 10%–23% of patients for whom chest pain is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in about 5% of the overall population visiting the ED for chest pain. However, existing population-based data on patients returning to the ED for chest pain following AMI discharge are sparse. Most published reports provide the number of ED visits for chest pain rather than the number of patients visiting the ED for chest pain. Furthermore, the association between ED visits for chest pain and recurrent AMI is currently unknown.

The risk of cardiovascular events after ACS is high, with one in four patients experiencing recurrent events, including AMI, stroke or cardiovascular death within 5 years of discharge. Specifically, rates of recurrent AMI among patients with ACS vary from 3% to 25%, depending on the follow-up period and study population. Despite declining recurrent AMI rates in recent years, the absolute number of patients experiencing recurrent AMI has increased and remains a serious complication among AMI survivors. One-year recurrent AMI rates range from 2.5% to 10%, depending on the study period and study population. However, no population-based study has reported patient-level incidence rates for subsequent second and third recurrent AMI in the year following index AMI discharge.

Contemporary, patient-level data on recurrent AMI and its association with return ED visits for chest pain are needed to measure the incidence of recurrent AMI among AMI survivors as well as the in-hospital and 1-year mortality among AMI survivors and recurrent AMI survivors. Furthermore, these data can inform key components of clinical trials investigating new therapies in patients at risk of recurrent AMI. In this Swedish study, we retrospectively followed a real-world cohort of patients who presented to the ED with a principal complaint of chest pain, who were admitted to the hospital with AMI and were discharged alive. We measured the rate and timing of first, second and third recurrent AMI, return ED visits for chest pain and all-cause mortality in the year after AMI discharge.

Intermediate-risk patients — using ESC 0/1-hour or ESC 0/2-hour algorithms, approximately 25% of patients will be classified as at intermediate risk and may require additional observation and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) measurement 3 to 6 hours later. Many will undergo predischarge noninvasive testing, a subset may be sufficiently low risk to consider discharge without inpatient testing, and close follow-up is recommended, preferably within 7 days.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — epidemiology and clinical burden in the United States — includes high utilization and substantial disease overlap: In emergency department (ED) care, chest pain accounts for > 6.5 million visits, which is 4.7% of all ED visits, and it also leads to nearly 4 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Although often noncardiac, coronary artery disease (CAD) affects > 18.2 million adults in the United States and is the leading cause of death for men and women, accounting for > 365 000 deaths annually. The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is 20% to 40%, and of all ED patients with chest pain, only 5.1% will have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with more than half ultimately found to have a noncardiac cause; nonetheless, chest pain is the most common symptom of CAD in both men and women.

### Characteristics of young women presenting with acute myocardial infarction: the prospective, multicenter, observational young women presenting acute myocardial infarction in France study [^112hEUph]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The percentage of women < 50years of age hospitalized with myocardial infarction is increasing. We describe the clinical, morphological, and biological characteristics, as well as the clinical outcomes of this population.

Methods and Results

This prospective, observational study included consecutive women < 50years of age admitted for myocardial infarction at 30 centers in France (May 2017-June 2019). The primary outcome was the composite of net adverse clinical events: all-cause death, cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, any stroke, or major bleeding occurring during hospitalization with a 12-month follow up. Three hundred fourteen women were included. The mean age was 43.0 (± 5.7) years, 60.8% presented with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, 75.5% were current smokers, 31.2% had a history of complicated pregnancy, and 55.1% reported recent emotional stress. Most (91.6%) women presented with typical chest pain. Of patients on an estrogen-containing contraceptive, 86.0% had at least 1 contraindication. Of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, 17.8% had myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries and 14.6% had spontaneous coronary artery dissection, whereas 29.3% presented with multivessel vessel disease. During hospitalization, 11 net adverse clinical events occurred in 9 (2.8%) women, but no deaths or stent thromboses occurred. By 12months, 14 net adverse clinical events occurred in 10 (3.2%) women; 2 (0.6%) died (from progressive cancer) and 25 (7.9%) had an ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous coronary intervention.

Conclusions

Most young women with myocardial infarction reported typical chest pain and had modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. History of adverse pregnancy outcomes and prescription of combined oral contraceptive despite a contraindication were prevalent, emphasizing the need for comprehensive cardiological and gynecological evaluation and follow-up.

### Does hospital admission / observation for chest pain improve patient outcomes after emergency department evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome? [^111pwD3h]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest pain is the top reason for hospitalization/observation in the USA, but it is unclear if this strategy improves patient outcomes.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare 30-day outcomes for patients admitted versus discharged after a negative emergency department (ED) evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Design

A retrospective, multi-site, cohort study of adult encounters with chest pain presenting to one of 13 Kaiser Permanente Southern California EDs between January 1, 2015, and December 1, 2017. Instrumental variable analysis was used to mitigate potential confounding by unobserved factors.

Patients

All adult patients presenting to an ED with chest pain, in whom an acute myocardial infarction was not diagnosed in the ED, were included.

Main Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day acute myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included 30-day revascularization and major adverse cardiac events.

Key Results

In total, 77,652 patient encounters were included in the study (n = 11,026 admitted, 14.2%). Three hundred twenty-two (0.4%) had an acute myocardial infarction (n = 193, 0.2%) or death (n = 137, 0.2%) within 30 days of ED visit (1.5% hospitalized versus 0.2% discharged). Very few (0.3%) patients underwent coronary revascularization within 30 days (0.7% hospitalized versus 0.2% discharged). Instrumental variable analysis found no adjusted differences in 30-day patient outcomes between the hospitalized cohort and those discharged (risk reduction 0.002, 95% CI -0.002 to 0.007). Similarly, there were no differences in coronary revascularization (risk reduction 0.003, 95% CI -0.002 to 0.007).

Conclusion

Among ED patients with chest pain not diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction, risk of major adverse cardiac events is quite low, and there does not appear to be any benefit in 30-day outcomes for those admitted or observed in the hospital compared to those discharged with outpatient follow-up.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113ytXbE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Intermediate-risk acute chest pain — Disposition from the observation setting is reasonable in selected patients: for patients with no or minimal additional cTn change from the prior measurement and 1) recent normal noninvasive testing (i.e., invasive or CT coronary angiogram < 2 years or stress test < 1 year), or 2) chronic elevations in hs-cTn that are unchanged compared with levels measured previously, and 3) a modified HEART score of ≤ 3 or EDACS < 16, discharge without further testing is reasonable, provided access to rapid follow-up is available; for those not meeting these criteria, noninvasive diagnostic testing should be considered for additional risk stratification, generally before discharge; for those with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) (≥ 50% stenosis) on CT coronary angiography or moderate to severe ischemia on functional testing, invasive coronary angiography is recommended in those with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

### Magnitude and characteristics of patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction [^116Q1A27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this large, multisite, observational study provide insights into the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital after an AMI who could be considered to be at low risk for subsequent adverse events at 2 important time points after hospital discharge. Insights into the sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical characteristics of those remaining free from the clinically relevant adverse events we examined are also provided. Our results may help hospital systems and clinicians identify individuals at low short‐ and long‐term risk for major adverse clinical events.

A significant proportion of patients were classified as being either an early (92%) or late (81%) low‐risk survivor in the present study of > 12 000 patients hospitalized with AMI at 233 US medical centers. Few studies have examined the magnitude of low‐risk survivors after hospital discharge for an AMI, and these studies used different working definitions of what constituted a low‐risk postdischarge survivor and their respective follow‐up periods. 16, 17 In a nationwide study of relatively young (aged < 50 years) patients hospitalized with AMI at all hospitals in Denmark between 1980 and 2009, early low‐risk survivors were defined as patients who survived at least 30 days after discharge, whereas long‐term low‐risk survivors were defined as patients who survived at least 1 month to 1 year after the patient's index admission. 16 The proportion of low‐risk survivors of an AMI increased from 88% to 97% within 30 days, and from 95% to 98% between 31 and 365 days after being discharged from the hospital during the years under study. On the other hand, in a study of 144 patients hospitalized with AMI at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) between 1992 and 2000, 56% of patients who survived the 2‐year follow‐up period were classified as late low‐risk survivors. 17 Irrespective of differences in the frequency of low‐risk survivors in these different investigations, which are likely because of the varying follow‐up periods, and in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the study populations (most notably, age and years under study), further investigation of this important subgroup of patients is warranted. A considerable proportion of patients are considered to be at low risk for major adverse clinical events, during either the short‐ or longer‐term. 18 Less aggressive follow‐up plans and clinical care may be needed. Although we believe that all patients should receive high‐quality transitional care after hospital discharge for an acute manifestation of a chronic underlying condition, certain interventions that have been shown to be successful are resource intensive and costly. 18 One way to make the best use of these limited resources, in the current healthcare environment, may be to reserve them for patients most likely to benefit from these resources. For example, we suggest a more aggressive follow‐up, with more frequent follow‐up calls or non–physician providers' visits, to elderly patients with several comorbidities during the high‐risk transition period after being released from the hospital after an AMI.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^111vqZ2d]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) discharge and length of stay — If PCI is performed, discharge can proceed once a patient meets the milestones outlined previously, whether that occurs the day of or following the PCI procedure, while patients who present with or develop complications including (but not limited to) recurrent ischemia, heart failure, AKI, or ventricular dysrhythmias may require additional evaluation and longer length of stay (LOS). Patients undergoing primary PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represent a higher risk group depending on presenting clinical characteristics, and randomized and observational studies generally support a 48- to 72-hour hospitalization in patients who undergo successful primary PCI and are clinically stable after the procedure. The milestones of recovery, education, and follow-up should be met before the patient is ready for discharge, and ultimately, the duration of observation following PCI for an individual patient must be a professional medical decision based on individual procedural and patient factors.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to patients with vasospastic angina, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain coronary angiography (invasive or noninvasive) in patients with episodic chest pain accompanied by transient ST-elevation to rule out severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Evaluation of chest pain in the ED: factors affecting triage decisions [^112WYT5p]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The emergency physician's (EP) fast and correct diagnosis of patients with chest pain is crucial for preventing inappropriate discharge and dire consequences. To determine which factors affect admission decisions in the ED, we studied epidemiologic characteristics of both discharged and admitted patients, and the percentage of discharged patients who returned to the ED with acute myocardial infarction. The study included 185 patients seen in the ED because of chest pain between July 1 and 31, 1997 (every third day not included). Ninety patients were admitted: 36.7% were admitted for "observation of chest pain" and 63.3% met the criteria for active coronary heart disease. A form was used to collect personal data, medical history, risk factors, clinical examination, electrocardiogram interpretation, laboratory data, and admittance decision. EPs' diagnosis of cardiac chest pain demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.4%, a specificity of 73.4%, and a positive predictive value of 63.3%. Sensitivity for diagnosing acute myocardial infarct was 100%, with no erroneous discharges. The EP's ability to integrate the medical history information, including risk factors and pain characteristics, had a marked influence on the admittance decision. Efforts to reduce missed diagnoses are warranted.

Methods

Inpatient Data

The data, analytical methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. The American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) program is a quality improvement initiative that strives to improve the in‐hospital care of patients with heart disease through increased adherence to guidelines. 7 Details regarding the GWTG program for coronary artery disease, stroke, and HF have been previously described. 7, 8 GWTG‐HF is a HF disease‐specific registry that started in 2005 and consists of clinical data abstracted from hospitalized patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF. Participating hospitals submit data on eligible patients in compliance with the Joint Commission and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service standards through the use of an internet‐based patient management tool (Quintiles Real‐World & Late Research, Cambridge, MA). 8, 9 Variables collected include demographic information, clinical characteristics, medical history, medications, in‐hospital treatments, in‐hospital outcomes, and discharge information including medications prescribed at discharge. 10, 11

As part of the GWTG‐HF program, all participating institutions were required to comply with local regulatory and privacy guidelines and, if required, to obtain institutional review board approval. Since data were used primarily at the local site for quality improvement, sites were granted a waiver of informed consent under the common rule. Quintiles (Cambridge, MA) served as the data collection coordination center for the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association's GWTG program. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC) served as the data analysis center. The Duke University Medical Center institutional review board approved this study.

### Relations of sex to diagnosis and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome [^113AnQ1L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Consistent with data of the literature, women in our pooled analysis were older than men on presentation. 1, 3 In contrast to earlier, mostly registry‐based data, we did not observe a higher proportion of cardiovascular risk factors in women with suspected ACS or a final diagnosis of ACS. Elevated body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking and a history of coronary artery disease were more prevalent in men. These results are similar to more recent data of cohorts with patients suggestive of ACS. 24, 25

Previous studies suggested that women with ACS more often present with "atypical" symptoms, in particular with absence of typical chest pain. 3, 4, 26 In our analyses, the majority of both sexes had some kind of chest pain. In line with prior examinations, other "atypical" symptoms were more often observed in women (dyspnea, nausea and vomiting). It is known that women are more likely to report multiple symptoms in the case of myocardial ischemia. 27 In the overall cohort, women reported more symptoms than men. Thus, atypical symptoms appear to be concurrent to typical presentation with chest pain. In patients with a final diagnosis of ACS, reported symptoms were not significantly different.

A history of coronary artery disease and ST‐segment‐elevation on the first ECG were significantly associated with sex and ACS. Both variables were more frequent in men, which is consistent with the literature. Women more often present with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction or non‐occlusive coronary disease when diagnosed with ACS. 28 However, if present, prior coronary artery disease or ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction were much more strongly associated with ACS in women and may clearly help in the early differential diagnosis.

Furthermore, there was no significant sex‐specific difference in time from onset of symptoms to admission at the emergency department in our cohort. Former studies consistently showed longer time from onset of symptoms to presentation to emergency department for women, 29, 30, 31 whereas in more recent data, the time delay until hospital admission for women with ACS has diminished and may indicate beneficial trends in ACS management in women. 24

The decision to discharge a patient where ACS cannot be excluded may result in a life‐threatening outcome, while on the other hand, admission in case of atypical chest pain can lead to unnecessary medical treatment and costs. Risk score models may help the physician in making a timely decision in the emergency setting. Patients with an assumed high probability of an ACS should receive their ECG as fast as possible.

### Short-term risk after initial observation for chest pain [^116kSt5u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Few studies have evaluated the necessity of immediate stress testing after observation for chest pain. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of outpatient stress testing after discharge from a chest pain unit. We hypothesized that discharge from a chest pain unit before stress testing is associated with a low rate of short-term adverse outcomes. This was a retrospective chart review of managed care patients discharged from the chest pain unit before the performance of stress testing. Records were reviewed for the occurrence of adverse cardiac outcomes before an outpatient stress test up to 60 days post-discharge. Primary outcomes were defined as death or myocardial infarction, and secondary outcomes as readmission for chest pain evaluation, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure. Three hundred forty-four patients were identified. One hundred sixty-six patients had either a recent prior stress test (17) or an outpatient test (149) performed within 60 days of discharge. During that time, 2 patients (0.6%) had a fatal out-of-hospital cardiac event, and there were 27 subsequent chest pain visits to the Emergency Department by 24 patients (7.0%). Nine patients (2.6%) were admitted to the hospital and 10 (2.9%) were readmitted to the observation unit for chest pain. We conclude that patients who have negative serial electrocardiograms and enzyme testing in a chest pain unit are at low risk for short-term cardiac events. Appropriately selected patients may be discharged for subsequent outpatient testing.

Data Collection and Selection of Candidate Predictors

We initially selected a comprehensive list of 65 candidate variables based on our prior work and from existing AMI readmission risk models (Table S1). Information was collected from medical record abstraction and standardized in‐person interviews administered by trained personnel at baseline and before discharge. Variables were classified into categories of sociodemographic factors, cardiac risk factors and medical history, presentation characteristics, in‐hospital complications, and psychosocial factors.

Variables on sociodemographics collected included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, less than high school education), household primary earner status, low income (defined as personal income ≤ 30 000 USD), employment status, and current presence of health insurance. Baseline cardiac risk factors and medical history included diabetes mellitus, obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2), hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease, physical inactivity, prior MI, renal disease, alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, stroke, heart failure, recreational drug use, and peripheral artery disease.

Presentation characteristics included first health service used, transfer from another institution, late presentation (> 6 hours from symptom onset), aspirin at arrival, ejection fraction < 40%, peak troponin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, first white blood cell count, first hematocrit, chest pain as primary symptom, Killip class, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, type of AMI, GRACE score, conservative treatment (patient did not receive percutaneous coronary intervention, thrombolysis or other standard of care procedural interventions in addition to medical therapy [e.g. aspirin, statins, beta blockers]), total length of stay (LOS) in days, discharge to other institutions, and admission to the cardiac or medical intensive care unit. In hospital complications included bleeding, re‐infarction, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Discharge instructions included counselling for specific concerns (cardiac, diet, smoking), medication, and exercise. Medications at discharge included clopidogrel/thienopyridines, aspirin, statins, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers.

High-STEACS early rule-out clinical decision pathway for chest pain with nonischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) specifies that symptom onset ≥ 3 hours and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) < 5 ng/L or high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) < 6 ng/L leads to rule out low risk with discharge home and outpatient follow-up, while baseline hs-cTnI 5 ng/L–99th percentile or hs-cTnT 6 ng/L–99th percentile prompts retesting at 3 hours to assess 0–3-hour Δ < 3 ng/L versus 0–3-hour Δ ≥ 3 ng/L (the latter indicating additional evaluation and testing); hs-cTnI or hs-cTnT > 99th percentile is labeled abnormal higher risk and also indicates additional evaluation and testing, and although trials used ≥ 2 hours from symptom onset, the pathway recommends requiring a ≥ 3-hour period between chest pain onset and the first troponin measurement to qualify for rule out at time 0, with additional evaluation including consideration of hospital observation or admission and noninvasive anatomic or functional testing.

### Short-and long-term mortality after myocardial infarction in patients with and without diabetes: changes from 1985 to 2008 [^114epbju]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We included all consecutive patients > 18 years of age admitted for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non–ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) to the Intensive Coronary Care Unit (ICCU) of the Thoraxcenter between June 1985 and December 2008.

The primary discharge diagnosis of MI was made in the presence of the following characteristics: chest pain or equivalent symptoms in combination with dynamic electrocardiogram changes consistent with MI and a typical serial rise (to at least three times the upper normal value) and fall in serum biochemical markers of cardiac necrosis such as creatine kinase-muscle brain type or troponin-T (as of 2002). Patients were diagnosed as STEMI in the presence of ST-segment elevation > 0.1 mV in at least two contiguous peripheral leads on the electrocardiogram, or > 0.2 mV in at least two contiguous precordial leads on the electrocardiogram, and as NSTEMI otherwise. For patients admitted more than once, only the first hospitalization was taken into account.

Data collection

Diabetes was defined as previously diagnosed by a physician or as receiving medication to lower glucose levels. Trained physicians and nurses accustomed to the use of standardized case report forms collected the data. Demographic characteristics (age and sex), cardiac history (previous MI, PCI, or coronary artery bypass surgery [CABG]), risk factors (hypertension, family history, and smoking status), anemia (hemoglobin level < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in women), renal dysfunction (creatinine > 150 μmol/L), and pharmacological and invasive treatment modalities (thrombolysis and PCI) were collected. Hypertension was defined as previously diagnosed by a physician or receiving medication to lower blood pressure. Family history was defined as one or more relatives (parent or sibling) with an MI diagnosed before the age of 60 years.

Follow-up and end points

The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Survival status and date were assessed through municipal civil registries in 2010 and were available for 99% of all patients.

Ethics

This project was carried out in accordance with current rules of ethics and legislature. No additional actions involving the study participants were undertaken because of this registry. Register-based studies are approved by the ethical committee of the Erasmus Medical Center and do not require informed consent according to Dutch laws (Medical Research Including Human Species Act).

### Myocardial infarction in young adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^112fUZSz]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To define the clinical profile of young adults with optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels who present with acute myocardial infarctions (MIs); to compare and contrast differences in the clinical profiles of young adults admitted to the hospital with MIs who have LDL cholesterol levels ≤ 100 mg/dL and those with LDL cholesterol values ≥ 160 mg/dL; and to evaluate the clinical outcomes for the two groups at 1 year.

Design

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all young men (55 years) and women (65 years) admitted to the hospital for MIs within a 2-year period (n = 232). A history of cardiovascular risk factors and 1-year outcomes were obtained.

Setting

Rural community medical center serving a tri-state area in the midwestern United States.

Patients

Patients were included in this analysis if (1) a lipid profile was drawn within 24 h of hospital admission and (2) the patient was not receiving a statin medication on hospital admission.

Measurements and Results

Of the 183 patients who met the inclusion criteria, as many as 68% (124 patients) had LDL cholesterol levels of ≤ 130 mg/dL, 29% (53 patients) had LDL cholesterol level of ≤ 100 mg/dL, and only 14% (26 patients) had LDL cholesterol levels of ≥ 160 mg/dL. Patients were categorized into group 1 if their LDL cholesterol level was ≤ 100 mg/dL and were categorized into group 2 if their LDL cholesterol level was ≥ 160 mg/dL. In group 2, 92% of patients were placed on a statin medication. By 1 year, the mean LDL cholesterol level had decreased from 188 to 106 mg/dL. The rate of coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures was similar between groups. Hospital readmission rates (43.4% vs 50%, respectively) and 1-year mortality rates (9% vs 8%, respectively) were not different between groups group 1 and 2.

Conclusions

Young adults experiencing acute MIs typically have acceptable cholesterol levels (ie, ≤ 130 mg/dL) or optimal values (ie, ≤ 100 mg/dL). In those patients with abnormal cholesterol levels, a combined strategy of aggressive intervention and adherence to secondary prevention protocols including lipid control is successful in improving outcomes.

### Cost of strategies after myocardial infarction (COSTAMI): a multicentre, international, randomized trial for cost-effective discharge after uncomplicated myocardial infarction [^112dz8Wi]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Risk stratification after uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction is mostly applied by either symptom-limited post discharge exercise electrocardiography or pre-discharge submaximal exercise test. Aim of the present study was to determine if early pharmacological stress echocardiography and discharge within 24 hours of the test in cases without induced myocardial ischemia leads to lower costs and similar clinical outcome during 1 year follow up when compared to clinical evaluation and exercise electrocardiography after discharge.

Methods and Results

Four-hundred fifty-eight patients from 10 participating centers with a recent uncomplicated myocardial infarction were randomized to pharmacological stress echocardiography on day 3–5 followed by early discharge in the case of negative test result (early discharge strategy) (n = 233) or clinical evaluation with hospital discharge on day 7–9 and symptom-limited post-discharge exercise electrocardiography at 2–4 weeks after myocardial infarction (usual care strategy) (n = 225). At 1 year follow up there were 63 events (4 deaths, 9 non fatal reinfarctions, 50 chest pains requiring hospitalization) in patients randomized to early discharge, and 69 events (6 deaths, 13 reinfarctions, 50 chest pains requiring hospitalization) in usual care (p = ns). Total median individual costs calculated on the basis of hospitalizations, investigations and interventions during 1 year follow up were 3561 for early discharge strategy vs 3850 for usual care strategy (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Early pharmacological stress echocardiography followed by early discharge in case of negative test result gives similar clinical outcome and lower costs after uncomplicated myocardial infarction than clinical evaluation and delayed post-discharge symptom-limited exercise electrocardiography.

### Outcome of chest pain patients discharged from a French emergency department: a 60-day prospective study [^112NoAbs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chest pain (CP) is a common complaint among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Previous studies suggest that between 2% and 5% of ED patients who present with CP and are sent home develop an acute coronary syndrome within 30 days. In France, no prospective data are available concerning the outcome of CP patients discharged from the ED.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine the rate of adverse cardiac events (ACE) within a period of 60 days after discharge from the ED.

Methods

From October 2007 to February 2008, consecutive patients aged 25 years or more who presented to the ED with CP were prospectively included. Patients discharged from the ED were contacted by phone at 60 days to determine their clinical course and the occurrence of an ACE.

Results

There were 322 CP patients enrolled, representing 3.9% of all medical admissions to the ED; 40.4% of these patients were hospitalized and 59.6% were discharged. Three patients (1.6%) could not be contacted for follow-up, leaving 189 patients eligible for the study. The rate of ACE was 3.7%: one ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and six non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions. Follow-up revealed that 39.1% of patients saw a cardiologist and that 14.2% were readmitted for CP.

Conclusion

We found that CP is a frequent complaint in patients who present to our ED, and that a small proportion (3.7%) is mistakenly discharged and presents with an ACE during the 60-day follow-up period.

Acute chest pain — CTA-guided disposition in intermediate-risk suspected ACS states that "Patients who undergo CTA who have no or nonobstructive (< 50%) CAD may be safely discharged from the ED", whereas "Patients with obstructive coronary disease (≥ 50%) on CTA should generally be admitted, treated with therapies for ACS, and undergo invasive coronary angiography unless the location of stenosis or other clinical factors result in the shared decision for guideline-directed medical therapy alone", and "Protocols should be in place for a consistent process for follow-up of patients with nonobstructive CAD who require additional preventive treatments and lifestyle modifications, as well any incidental findings noted on coronary CTA".

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^113KkfZL]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent, low-risk chest pain — hospitalization versus discharge for 30-day outcomes: For the question on admission, ED observation, or outpatient follow up for 30-day acute coronary syndrome outcomes, "No articles were available, and no indirect evidence was found". Accordingly, "there is insufficient evidence to recommend hospitalization (either standard inpatient admission or observation stay) versus discharge as a strategy to mitigate major adverse cardiac events within 30 days". The page highlights context for decision-making, noting "The acceptable miss rate of ACS outcomes in patients who are deemed low risk is largely agreed to be < 1%" and that ED evaluation costs are significant, with "The cost of admission for the evaluation of chest pain… greater than that of evaluation provided in an observation unit with the most significant cost benefit associated with discharge from the ED".

### It's not too late to improve statin adherence: association between changes in statin adherence from before to after acute myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality [^114uwc6z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors cannot make the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) research data used for this study available to other researchers per the terms of the data use agreement. However, investigators can request access to Medicare administrative claims data through application with CMS.

Data Sources and Study Cohort

US Medicare 2007–2011 data including enrollment summaries, medical service claims (inpatient, outpatient, carrier, and skilled‐nursing facility), and prescription Part D claims from the CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse were used to create a cohort of patients hospitalized for an AMI between 2008 and 2010. This cohort has previously been described, 5 but this study additionally required patients to survive at least 180 days after hospital discharge. The eligibility criteria were (1) index AMI hospitalization between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010; (2) ≥ 66 years old; (3) continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A, B, and D for ≥ 360 days prehospital admission, through the AMI hospitalization, and ≥ 180 days posthospital discharge; (4) discharged to home/self‐care and survived > 180 days prehospital admission discharge; (5) filled ≥ 1 statin prescription between 360 and 14 days prehospital admission; and (6) no pre‐AMI end‐stage renal disease. Details on patient selection and attrition can be seen in Figure 1. AMI hospitalizations were identified using an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) code of 410.x1 in the primary or secondary discharge field. If a patient had multiple AMIs during the index year, their index event was defined as their first observed AMI.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^113pqCxa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction — performance measure defines the measure as the percentage of patients 18–75 y of age with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were offered moderate- to high-intensity statin at hospital discharge. The numerator includes patients who at hospital discharge have been offered high-intensity statin or have been offered moderate-intensity statin with documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing high-intensity statin, with "offered" meaning it is prescribed or a patient reason exception is documented. The denominator is all patients 18–75 y of age discharged following a hospitalization for AMI, where AMI refers to discharges with an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM Principal Diagnosis Code for AMI. Denominator exclusions are patients who died, left against medical advice, were discharged to hospice or had a comfort only–measures order documented, or were transferred to another hospital for inpatient care. Denominator exceptions are documentation of medical reason(s) for not prescribing a statin such as allergy or intolerance to statins.

### Downstream cascades of care following High-sensitivity troponin test Implementation [^112tRPKk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chest pain are often evaluated for acute myocardial infarction through troponin testing, which may prompt downstream services (cascades) of uncertain value.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the association of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assay implementation with cascade events.

Methods

Using electronic health record and billing data, this study examined patient-visits to 5 emergency departments from April 1, 2017, to April 1, 2019. Difference-in-differences analysis compared patient-visits for chest pain (n = 7,564) to patient-visits for other symptoms (n = 100,415) (irrespective of troponin testing) before and after hs-cTn assay implementation. Outcomes included presence of any cascade event potentially associated with an initial hs-cTn test (primary), individual cascade events, length of stay, and spending on cardiac services.

Results

Following hs-cTn implementation, patients with chest pain had a 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72% to 4.9%) net increase in experiencing any cascade event. They were more likely to have multiple troponin tests (10.5%; 95% CI: 9.0% to 12.0%) and electrocardiograms (7.1 per 100 patient-visits; 95% CI: 1.8 to 12.4). However, they received net fewer computed tomography scans (-1.5 per 100 patient-visits; 95% CI: -1.8 to -1.1), stress tests (-5.9 per 100 patient-visits; 95% CI: -6.5 to -5.3), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (-0.65 per 100 patient-visits; 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.30) and were less likely to receive cardiac medications, undergo cardiology evaluation (-3.5%; 95% CI: -4.5% to 2.6%), or be hospitalized (-5.8%; 95% CI: -7.7% to -3.8%). Patients with chest pain had lower net mean length of stay (-0.24 days; 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.16) but no net change in spending.

Conclusions

Hs-cTn assay implementation was associated with more net upfront tests yet fewer net stress tests, PCI, cardiology evaluations, and hospital admissions in patients with chest pain relative to patients with other symptoms.

### ASNC imaging guidelines for nuclear cardiology procedures: standardized reporting of nuclear cardiology procedures [^116dyA3z]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

ASNC standardized reporting — patient demographics and study referral states that this section provides the clinical indications for the study, information regarding the referring and interpreting provider, and necessary demographic information; indications to be considered include diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), extent and severity of known CAD, risk stratification including peri-operative risk, determination of viability, assessment of acute chest pain syndromes, evaluation of structural heart disease, and heart failure; the specific purpose for which the test is being performed must be clearly identified to provide the required documentation for the medical necessity of the study, and the structured reports must contain sufficient information to ensure correct identification of the patient, must convey the specific indications and pertinent portions of the clinical history, and this would include the patient's current symptoms or other indication, current medications, cardiac history with pertinent risk factors including risk factor scoring, and prior testing, and therapeutic procedures.

### A novel diagnostic protocol to identify patients suitable for discharge after a single high-sensitivity troponin [^112cnWFJ]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Consecutive patients attending the ED with suspected ACS were prospectively screened from July 2012 to August 2013. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years of age and had at least 5 min of chest pain suggestive of ACS, and for whom the attending physician determined inpatient evaluation was required. Possible cardiac symptoms included acute chest, epigastric, neck, jaw or arm pain, or discomfort or pressure without an apparent non-cardiac source, in accordance with the American Heart Association case definitions. Patients were excluded if any of the following were present: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or left bundle branch block not known to be old, ECG changes diagnostic of ischaemia (ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm or T-wave inversion consistent with the presence of ischaemia), arrhythmias (new-onset atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sustained supraventricular tachycardia, second-degree or complete heart block, or sustained or recurrent ventricular arrhythmias), hs-cTnT not suitable for analysis (eg, haemolysis), age ≥ 80 years, atypical symptoms in the absence of chest discomfort, a clear non-ACS cause for chest pain was found at presentation (eg, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, aortic dissection), another medical condition requiring hospital admission, refusal or inability to give informed consent, non-English speaking, pregnancy, renal failure requiring dialysis or inability to be contacted after discharge.

Data were collected prospectively using a published data dictionary. Attending ED clinicians completed the m-Goldman risk score on a predesigned clinical report form. Follow-up was undertaken by independent review of hospital electronic patient records, summary of health records from the patient's general practitioner (GP) obtained at least 6 months after attendance and a national clinical records search (which identifies death). The ethics committee did not grant permission for direct patient contact as they felt that comprehensive follow-up data relating to adverse events could be obtained accurately through GP records. This is because in the UK, GPs hold comprehensive records for individuals relating to primary, secondary and tertiary care. GP records have been demonstrated to be more accurate at reporting hospital admissions, including those for cardiac related events, than patients.GPs were therefore requested to provide all information regarding presentation to other institutions with chest pain, cardiology outpatient review and cardiac testing, including angiography with or without intervention. Where a participant had not attended hospital follow-up and/or a GP had failed to provide a health record/not GP-registered, the patient was regarded as lost to follow-up.
