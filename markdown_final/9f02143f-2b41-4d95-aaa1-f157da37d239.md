## Question

How do you test for adrenal insufficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test for adrenal insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect adrenal insufficiency and how pre-test probability shapes testing. Then, I should verify the recommended initial screening test and assay-specific interpretation. Next, I will review dynamic testing options, their protocols, and common pitfalls, and I need to ensure I distinguish primary from central adrenal insufficiency. After that, I should determine the etiologic workup once adrenal insufficiency is confirmed. I will then examine special populations, including the critically ill, those with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal suppression, and pediatric patients. Finally, I must cover emergency management of adrenal crisis and outline follow-up and recovery monitoring, cross-checking thresholds and recommendations against high-credibility guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that warrant testing. Adrenal insufficiency is rare but clinically important, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in patients with nonspecific fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, hypotension, hyperpigmentation in primary disease, abdominal pain, or hypoglycemia in children, especially when alternative explanations are lacking or the patient has risk factors such as autoimmune disease, pituitary pathology, exogenous glucocorticoid exposure, or critical illness; this is precisely where missed or delayed diagnosis commonly occurs, so I should not wait for "classic" features before initiating evaluation [^1156W7Cv] [^112uCFEs] [^111cmN7E].

> Next, I should review the first-line biochemical screen. Wait, let me verify the timing and interference issues before interpreting any numbers. An early morning (approximately 8–9 AM) serum cortisol is the recommended starting test, ideally obtained after holding exogenous glucocorticoids for at least 24 hours when feasible, noting that dexamethasone does not interfere with cortisol immunoassays; oral estrogens increase cortisol-binding globulin and can artifactually elevate total cortisol, and critical illness or liver disease may lower binding proteins and confound thresholds, so assay method and clinical context matter for cutoffs [^1152153f] [^117JUADt]. I should double-check the cutoffs: values above roughly 500 nmol/L (about 18 μg/dL) generally exclude clinically significant adrenal insufficiency, while values below about 150–200 nmol/L (about 5.5–7 μg/dL) are strongly suggestive; with LC-MS/MS, exclusion and confirmation thresholds may be near 327 nmol/L (11.8 μg/dL) and 152 nmol/L (5.5 μg/dL), respectively, but these are assay dependent, so I need to confirm locally and avoid over-reliance on a single cutoff in isolation [^112zENbA] [^1152153f]. Let me consider adjuncts that can reduce unnecessary dynamic testing: a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely and may obviate further testing, and home waking salivary cortisone is an increasingly practical, patient-preferred screen with real-world data supporting its ability to exclude adrenal suppression when normal, especially when binding protein abnormalities are a concern [^1135iuNx] [^116TuntV].

> Now, if morning cortisol falls in the indeterminate range or suspicion remains high, I need to proceed with dynamic testing. The standard next step is the cosyntropin (ACTH 1–24) stimulation test, and I initially thought of it as the gold standard for all forms of adrenal insufficiency; hold on, I should verify that nuance because for central adrenal insufficiency many consider the insulin tolerance test (ITT) the historical gold standard, but due to safety concerns and practicality, guidelines favor the standard 250 μg ACTH test in routine practice and accept either standard- or low-dose ACTH with similar diagnostic accuracy across studies despite assay variability [^1152153f] [^1138iNPT] [^112LBu1Z]. I need to ensure proper protocol: administer 250 μg IV over 1–2 minutes (or IM), with pediatric dosing adjustments for infants and young children, and measure serum cortisol at 0, 30, and 60 minutes; a peak cortisol below about 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) at either 30 or 60 minutes indicates adrenal insufficiency, and I should include the 60-minute sample because more than half of patients may peak at 60 minutes, which reduces false positives if only 30 minutes are used [^1152153f] [^1125j4vm]. But wait, what if secondary adrenal insufficiency is suspected early after pituitary or hypothalamic injury? The low-dose 1 μg ACTH test may be more sensitive for subtle central defects, though meta-analytic data suggest broadly similar accuracy to the high-dose test, and overall both are better for ruling in than ruling out central adrenal insufficiency; the overnight metyrapone test and the ITT assess the entire axis but are less available or carry risk and should be reserved for specific indications in experienced centers [^1138iNPT] [^113AsZ6c] [^1115iPa1].

> After confirming cortisol deficiency, I will now examine how to distinguish primary from central disease. Let me first confirm that plasma ACTH is measured at baseline before treatment if possible: in primary adrenal insufficiency, ACTH is typically elevated above two times the upper limit of normal due to loss of feedback, whereas in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency ACTH is low or inappropriately normal, which helps triage subsequent testing and replacement planning, especially for mineralocorticoids [^1178vPcg]. Hold on, I should verify mineralocorticoid status because it changes management: in suspected primary adrenal insufficiency, simultaneous renin and aldosterone clarify aldosterone deficiency, typically showing high renin with low aldosterone, guiding fludrocortisone replacement [^115TXjkC]. I should also reconsider whether DHEA-S or salivary measures add value here: low DHEA-S supports adrenal insufficiency, while a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely, and waking salivary cortisone can offer a binding-protein–independent adjunct when serum testing is equivocal or logistically difficult [^1135iuNx] [^117TyPBt].

> Next, I should determine etiology because it informs counseling and long-term care. Let me verify the recommended sequence: in adults with primary adrenal insufficiency, test for 21-hydroxylase antibodies, which are present in over 90% of new autoimmune cases; in antibody-negative males, measure very long-chain fatty acids to evaluate for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; obtain an adrenal CT when the etiology remains unclear to detect infiltrative disease, hemorrhage, or metastases, and pursue pituitary MRI if a central cause is suspected; in children and selected adults, evaluate for congenital causes such as CAH or adrenal hypoplasia with appropriate biochemical and genetic testing [^11469Efd] [^114tgcBr]. I need to ensure the workup is tailored and staged so that treatment is not delayed while essential etiologic testing proceeds in parallel when clinical status is unstable [^112ik7E1].

> Special settings demand careful interpretation, so I will now review critical illness. Hmm, wait a minute, a single ACTH test can be misleading in septic shock because results are poorly reproducible, and dynamic testing may not reflect tissue glucocorticoid action; therefore, I should prioritize clinical judgment for "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" in vasopressor-refractory shock and not overinterpret total cortisol in the face of altered binding proteins and stress physiology [^1167D2a9] [^112m9DDh]. I should double-check consensus pathways: expert statements advise suspecting CIRCI in hypotensive patients not responding to fluids and vasopressors and support empiric hydrocortisone in refractory septic shock rather than relying on a single cosyntropin test, acknowledging the ongoing controversy and the lack of a universally accepted diagnostic gold standard in this context [^1177twrz] [^1112hXHb] [^114WCf4X].

> I will now examine glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, where timing and thresholds are assay dependent and the prevalence of biochemical suppression exceeds that of clinically meaningful insufficiency. Let me first confirm the testing approach: do not routinely perform dynamic testing during taper; instead, once the dose is reduced to physiologic ranges, obtain an 8–9 AM serum cortisol after at least 24 hours off the prior glucocorticoid (dexamethasone excepted), recognizing that higher morning cortisol values indicate greater likelihood of recovery, and consider dynamic testing only if results remain indeterminate and the clinical scenario warrants it [^1174L1xv] [^117JUADt]. Hold on, I should verify cutoffs and predictive value: data suggest that depending on assay, morning cortisol above approximately 310–350 nmol/L reliably predicts a normal ACTH test and values below about 124–152 nmol/L strongly predict failure, but cutoffs vary and were derived with different immunoassays and LC-MS/MS methods, so I must interpret within the local laboratory framework and clinical context [^1162vUxs] [^112zENbA]. I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring is aligned with recovery biology: recovery can take months to years, sometimes up to 2–4 years, and higher early cortisol increments on ACTH testing and higher interim morning cortisol values predict faster recovery; throughout, patient education on stress dosing is essential given the low but real risk of clinical adrenal crisis during taper or after cessation, and selected patients may merit temporary stress-dose coverage during intercurrent illness even without biochemical confirmation of recovery [^1149kve6] [^113Guy57] [^113RVW44] [^113uLZzA] [^1142FRtj] [^111aTiH4] [^112pzZu6].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances so I do not overlook age-specific dosing and etiologies. I should confirm that ACTH stimulation dosing differs by age, with 250 μg for children 2 years and older, 125 μg for those under 2 years, and 15 μg/kg for infants, and I need to check that CAH screening with 17-hydroxyprogesterone is performed in newborns and selected older children when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected, with close growth monitoring during replacement to avoid over- or undertreatment [^1152153f]. Hold on, I should verify that central adrenal insufficiency is a recognized late effect of cranial radiation; while low-dose ACTH testing is often used in survivors, protocols and cutoffs vary and should be individualized within pediatric endocrinology follow-up programs [^11462qvu] [^1125j4vm].

> I need to ensure emergency management is immediately actionable because adrenal crisis is a time-critical, clinical diagnosis. If crisis is suspected, I should not delay therapy for testing: give hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or IM promptly, initiate rapid isotonic saline resuscitation, correct hypoglycemia, and continue hydrocortisone at 200 mg per 24 hours by continuous infusion or 50 mg every 6 hours until stabilized, while addressing precipitants; drawing a random cortisol before the first dose is reasonable if it does not delay care, but subsequent ACTH testing will be uninterpretable for 24–48 hours [^117EArrH] [^116CBZ8p] [^111Ncj1V]. I should double-check practical barriers to prehospital and early self-treatment: many patients cannot self-inject during crisis, so clinicians must provide hands-on education and plan for assistance to reduce delays and adverse outcomes [^115N17RS].

> Next, I should review follow-up and long-term management so that biochemical data are integrated with clinical outcomes. After diagnosis, monitor symptoms and blood pressure, assess morning cortisol, ACTH, renin and aldosterone in primary adrenal insufficiency, and consider DHEA-S to support adequacy of replacement and to reassess recovery in glucocorticoid-induced cases; provide structured education on sick-day rules and ensure access to emergency hydrocortisone with medical alert identification [^115huAMA] [^113RVW44]. Let me verify replacement targets: initial glucocorticoid replacement typically uses hydrocortisone 15–25 mg daily in divided doses, adjusted clinically, with mineralocorticoid added in primary adrenal insufficiency based on renin and clinical status; over time, reassess the HPA axis in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency until recovery or, if persistent beyond a year to several years, maintain standard replacement and evaluate for other causes of central adrenal insufficiency as appropriate [^115DHpmT] [^113Guy57].

> To synthesize the diagnostic flow, let me reconsider the steps to ensure internal consistency and practical clarity. Begin with clinical suspicion and risk assessment, obtain an 8–9 AM serum cortisol with attention to assay and binding effects, and use assay-appropriate thresholds to exclude or strongly suggest adrenal insufficiency; if indeterminate or suspicion persists, perform cosyntropin stimulation with both 30- and 60-minute samples, recognizing that ITT or metyrapone may be reserved for selected central cases under expert supervision; once cortisol deficiency is confirmed, measure ACTH to categorize primary versus central disease, evaluate renin and aldosterone in primary cases, and pursue etiologic testing including 21-hydroxylase antibodies, VLCFA in males, and targeted imaging; in critical illness, prioritize clinical judgment and hemodynamic response over single dynamic tests; in glucocorticoid-induced suppression, favor morning cortisol testing after taper to physiologic doses, educate on stress dosing, and retest over time to document recovery; treat adrenal crisis immediately without waiting for labs, then return to etiologic and longitudinal evaluation once stabilized [^1152153f] [^1174L1xv] [^1177twrz] [^116CBZ8p].

---

Adrenal insufficiency evaluation begins with **8 am cortisol and ACTH** to screen for primary versus secondary disease, followed by the **250 mcg ACTH stimulation test** to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish primary from secondary/tertiary causes [^1152153f] [^1178vPcg]. In critically ill patients, interpret random cortisol or delta cortisol with caution because ACTH testing is less reliable [^1112hXHb]. For glucocorticoid-induced AI, morning cortisol is the first step; dynamic testing is reserved for indeterminate cases [^1174L1xv]. Always interpret results in clinical context and **treat suspected adrenal crisis immediately** without waiting for tests [^117EArrH].

---

## Indications for testing

Testing is indicated in patients with clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, including:

- **Fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms** [^112uCFEs].

- **Acutely ill patients with unexplained hypotension, volume depletion, or electrolyte disturbances** [^112uCFEs].

- **Patients with a history of chronic glucocorticoid use or recent withdrawal** [^112pzZu6].

## Initial screening tests

### Morning serum cortisol and ACTH

Morning serum cortisol **< 140 nmol/L (5 mcg/dL)** strongly suggests adrenal insufficiency, whereas > 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) generally excludes it. Plasma ACTH > 2 times the upper limit of normal in the setting of low cortisol indicates primary adrenal insufficiency; low or inappropriately normal ACTH suggests secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency [^1178vPcg].

---

## Confirmatory dynamic tests

| **Attribute** | **Standard-dose ACTH stimulation test** | **Low-dose ACTH stimulation test** | **Insulin tolerance test (ITT)** | **Metyrapone test** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Procedure | Administer 250 mcg synthetic ACTH intravenously or intramuscularly; measure serum cortisol at baseline, 30, and 60 minutes [^1152153f] | Administer 1 mcg ACTH intravenously; measure cortisol at baseline, 30, and 60 minutes | Administer insulin to induce hypoglycemia (< 2.2 mmol/L); measure cortisol response | Administer metyrapone to inhibit cortisol synthesis; measure 11-deoxycortisol accumulation |
| Interpretation | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicates adrenal insufficiency [^1152153f] | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) indicates adrenal insufficiency | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) indicates adrenal insufficiency | Inadequate rise in 11-deoxycortisol indicates adrenal insufficiency |
| Utility | Highly sensitive and specific for primary adrenal insufficiency; less sensitive for recent-onset secondary adrenal insufficiency | More sensitive for secondary adrenal insufficiency but less standardized and more technically demanding | Gold standard for secondary adrenal insufficiency but contraindicated in patients with seizures, cardiovascular disease, or elderly patients | Useful when ACTH tests are inconclusive or unavailable; requires close monitoring |

---

## Special considerations

### Critically ill patients

Random cortisol **< 10 mcg/dL** suggests adrenal insufficiency, whereas > 34 mcg/dL generally excludes it [^1112hXHb]. A delta cortisol < 9 mcg/dL after ACTH stimulation also suggests adrenal insufficiency [^1112hXHb]. ACTH stimulation tests may be less reliable due to altered cortisol metabolism and binding proteins in critical illness.

---

### Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency

Morning cortisol is the **initial test**; levels < 5 mcg/dL suggest adrenal insufficiency, while > 10 mcg/dL generally exclude it. Dynamic testing is reserved for indeterminate cases with cortisol 5–10 mcg/dL [^1174L1xv].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

- **Plasma renin and aldosterone**: Assess mineralocorticoid deficiency in primary adrenal insufficiency [^115TXjkC].

- **21-hydroxylase antibodies**: Identify autoimmune adrenalitis [^11469Efd].

- **Plasma VLCFAs**: Screen for adrenoleukodystrophy in males [^11469Efd].

- **Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone**: Evaluate congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^11469Efd].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging includes an **adrenal CT scan** to assess for infiltrative processes, metastases, or hemorrhage [^11469Efd]. Pituitary MRI is used to evaluate pituitary or hypothalamic lesions in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency.

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

- **Assay variability**: Different cortisol assays may yield varying results; interpret within clinical context.

- **Critical illness**: Altered cortisol metabolism and binding proteins may affect test accuracy.

- **Glucocorticoid use**: Recent or ongoing glucocorticoid therapy can suppress the HPA axis, leading to false-positive results.

---

## Clinical management implications

In suspected adrenal crisis, **initiate stress-dose intravenous hydrocortisone** and fluid resuscitation without delay [^117EArrH]. Patients should be educated on stress dosing and emergency management to prevent adrenal crises [^1174L1xv].

---

Adrenal insufficiency testing involves a **stepwise approach**, starting with morning cortisol and ACTH, followed by dynamic tests such as the ACTH stimulation test, ITT, or metyrapone test. Interpretation must consider clinical context, assay variability, and patient-specific factors, and suspected adrenal crisis requires immediate treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1152153f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning the corticotropin stimulation test, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of the standard dose test over other existing tests. The suggested dosages are 250 mcg for adults and children aged 2 years and older, 15 mcg/kg for infants, and 125 mcg for other children under 2 years of age. Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in severe sepsis and septic shock [^1112hXHb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients has traditionally relied on random or cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels, without confirmation by a more accurate diagnostic standard. This study used the overnight metyrapone stimulation test to assess the diagnostic value of the standard cosyntropin stimulation test and to determine the prevalence of sepsis-associated adrenal insufficiency.

This was an inception cohort study involving two consecutive septic cohorts (n = 61 and n = 40), 44 patients without sepsis, and 32 healthy volunteers. Measurements included:

- **Serum cortisol**: Assessed before and after cosyntropin stimulation.
- **Additional markers**: Albumin and corticosteroid-binding globulin levels.
- **Adrenal function markers**: Serum corticotropin, cortisol, and 11beta-deoxycortisol levels before and after an overnight metyrapone stimulation.

Adrenal insufficiency was defined by postmetyrapone serum 11beta-deoxycortisol levels below 7 microg/dl. In the original sepsis cohort, 59% (31/61) and in the validation cohort, 60% (24/40) met the criteria for adrenal insufficiency. This was significantly more than the 7% (3/44) in patients without sepsis (p < 0.001 for both comparisons).

Key predictive measures were identified as follows:

- Baseline cortisol levels of less than 10 microg/dl
- Delta cortisol levels of less than 9 microg/dl
- Free cortisol levels of less than 2 microg/dl

These measures had a positive likelihood ratio of infinity, 8.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.19–60.25), and 9.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.05–9.54), respectively. The best predictor of adrenal insufficiency, as defined by metyrapone testing, was a baseline cortisol level of 10 microg/dl or less, or a Delta cortisol level of less than 9 microg/dl.

The 2016 guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend the immediate initiation of stress-dose intravenous hydrocortisone therapy in patients exhibiting symptoms of severe adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis, even before the results of diagnostic tests are available.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy.

- **Rationale**: Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior.

	- Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less results that are reliable in patients on a shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, and specifically plasma ACTH, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining measurement of plasma ACTH to establish PAI. In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH greater than two times the ULN is consistent with PAI.

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and the experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence nor good clinical practice are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

- **General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and patient education**:
	- R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist.
	- R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (Good clinical practice).
	- R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (Good clinical practice).

- **Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**:

### The approach to the adult with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency [^1151VFKR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management, including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, whereas hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, maintaining awareness of other differential diagnostic possibilities.

Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids, requires careful monitoring. Replacement strategies still require optimization, as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will need to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects for patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### ACTH stimulation tests for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138iNPT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is clinically challenging and often requires ACTH stimulation tests. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the high- (250 mcg) and low- (1 mcg) dose ACTH stimulation tests in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

The methods involved searching six databases through February 2014. Pairs of independent reviewers selected studies and appraised the risk of bias. Diagnostic association measures were pooled across studies using a bivariate model.

- **Data synthesis**: For secondary adrenal insufficiency, the study included 30 studies enrolling 1,209 adults and 228 children. High- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy in adults and children using different peak serum cortisol cutoffs. In general, both tests had low sensitivity and high specificity, resulting in reasonable likelihood ratios for a positive test (adults: high dose, 9.1; low dose, 5.9; children: high dose, 43.5; low dose, 7.7), but a fairly suboptimal likelihood ratio for a negative test (adults: high dose, 0.39; low dose, 0.19; children: high dose, 0.65; low dose, 0.34). For primary adrenal insufficiency, five studies enrolling 100 patients were included. Data were only available to estimate the sensitivity of the high-dose ACTH stimulation test (92%; 95% confidence interval, 81–97%).

In conclusion, both high- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy. Both tests are adequate to rule in, but not rule out, secondary adrenal insufficiency. Our confidence in these estimates is low to moderate because of the likely risk of bias.

### "Relative" adrenal insufficiency in critical illness [^112Dwsum]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To present a recommended approach to the problem of "relative" adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the intensive care unit (ICU), we examine historical data that support the traditional concepts of adrenal insufficiency. The idea that the increase in cortisol secretion during stress is needed to survive the stress is emphasized. The controversial use of treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) in patients with sepsis and septic shock in the ICU, and the potential survival benefit, is also briefly discussed.

During the past decade, the concept of RAI as the failure of cortisol secretion to increase in response to stress — to sustain the patient through that stress — has gained strength. In some studies, it has been suggested that as many as 75% of patients in an ICU setting have RAI. Experimental support for the concept is not possible because there is no clinically useful laboratory measure of GC action. Therefore, diagnosis is generally based on interpretation of the cosyntropin stimulation test.

The best clinical judgment should always guide the interpretation of any test results, and sharp categorization of patients based on a single cutoff criterion should be avoided. Overall, the concept of RAI has no clinical utility. In these cases, the administration of GCs adds cost without benefit and with increased risk.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcome.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency [^112LBu1Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The cosyntropin stimulation test is the initial endocrine evaluation for suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Purpose**: To critically review the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test for evaluating adrenal insufficiency.

- **Data sources**: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to 2002 for all English-language papers related to the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Study selection**: Studies with fewer than five persons with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or with fewer than ten persons as normal controls were excluded. For secondary adrenal insufficiency, only studies that stratified participants by integrated tests of adrenal function were included.

- **Data extraction**: Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from all studies that provided sensitivity and specificity data for 250-microgram and 1-microgram cosyntropin tests; these curves were then compared using area under the curve (AUC) methods. All estimated values are given with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Data synthesis**: At a specificity of 95%, sensitivities were 97%, 57%, and 61% for summary ROC curves in tests for primary adrenal insufficiency (250-microgram cosyntropin test), secondary adrenal insufficiency (250-microgram cosyntropin test), and secondary adrenal insufficiency (1-microgram cosyntropin test), respectively. The area under the curve for primary adrenal insufficiency was significantly greater than the AUC for secondary adrenal insufficiency for the high-dose cosyntropin test (P < 0.001); however, AUCs for the 250-microgram and 1-microgram cosyntropin tests did not differ significantly.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^1156W7Cv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is easy to diagnose and treat when the suspicion of the disease is raised. However, a previous study showed that less than 30% of women and 50% of men are diagnosed within the first six months of symptoms, and 20% were symptomatic for more than five years before the correct diagnosis was made. More than two-thirds consulted at least three physicians, and two out of three were primarily given the wrong diagnosis, most often a psychiatric or gastrointestinal disorder. These examples illustrate that the main difficulty lies in considering PAI as a differential diagnosis because most physicians rarely encounter more than a few patients during their careers due to the rarity of the disease.

Prevalence numbers vary across populations, with the highest figures reported from Scandinavia, notably 15 to 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Incidence has been reported at about five per million per year. Numbers from other European countries are around 10 per 100,000. There are very few reports from countries outside of Europe, but a national survey from Korea reported a much lower number at 0.4 per 100,000. Reports from developing countries are missing.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.

A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C), based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.

The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113AsZ6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use.

- **Causes of central hypoadrenalism**: Interrogation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example, a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in diagnosing an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as in pituitary apoplexy. In other situations, a low morning cortisol level in an at-risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed.

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones, with GH being the most commonly affected, followed by gonadotrophins, and culminating in the loss of ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH, however, can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations, such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism are important, as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117VUNJE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The methods used for establishing the guideline have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions (see below), followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded.

- **Considerations for the recommendations**: The quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences (patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, feasibility of implementation) were considered. The recommendations are worded as "recommend" (strong recommendation) or "suggest" (weak recommendation). The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policymakers, and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation. For a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not.

Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints" section). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience were not formally graded.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111eLqtG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

At least 1% of the population uses chronic glucocorticoid therapy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Virtually every discipline of medicine applies glucocorticoids via multiple modes of administration, including oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intravenous, and frequently for prolonged durations. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an inevitable effect of chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly among individuals. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency necessitates careful education and management, and in rare cases of adrenal crisis, prompt diagnosis and therapy is crucial.

Considering the widespread use of glucocorticoids and the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, this clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid endocrinology specialists, as well as general practitioners and other specialists involved in the care of these patients.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is the deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being the most serious and potentially life-threatening. It may occur in isolation or, more commonly, as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstrating a subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24), or in the setting of acute illness. The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized based on the patient and clinical scenario.

A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate for diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus- and assay-dependent, and normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used.

### Adrenal function testing in pediatric cancer survivors [^11462qvu]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency is observed after cranial radiation therapy for cancer. Screening at-risk patients is recommended, but the best screening strategy is unknown.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of pediatric cancer survivors who underwent hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis testing was conducted. Data included cancer diagnosis, radiotherapy dose, other endocrinopathies, and adrenal function testing. Adrenal testing included sequential low-dose corticotropin test (LDCT) and standard-dose corticotropin test (SDCT). 8 a.m. serum cortisol levels were compared to LDCT results. LDCT results were compared by radiotherapy dose and according to the presence of endocrine comorbidities.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight subjects (56% male, mean age at diagnosis 6.5 years) underwent testing. 67.9% had been treated with radiotherapy to the hypothalamus/pituitary. Mean time to diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was 6.8 years after cancer diagnosis. Adequate adrenal function was found in 65% of patients by LDCT and 89% by SDCT. Only 21% of patients had basal serum cortisols collected at 8 a.m. Agreement between 8 a.m. baseline cortisol and LDCT was fair. Agreement between random baseline cortisol and LDCT was poor. Prevalence of central adrenal insufficiency diagnosed by LDCT increased with radiotherapy dose (8% for 10–19.9 Gy; 83% for ≥ 40 Gy) and the number of endocrine comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: In pediatric cancer survivors, central adrenal insufficiency was common even in patients receiving < 40 Gy to the hypothalamus/pituitary. We recommend the use of LDCT, not 8 a.m. serum cortisol levels.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^116teUgf]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is the clinical manifestation of deficient production or action of glucocorticoids, with or without a deficiency in mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. It is a life-threatening disorder that can result from primary adrenal failure or secondary adrenal disease due to impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Prompt diagnosis and management are essential.

The clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency result from deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, but they can also include signs of other concurrent autoimmune conditions. In secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency, the clinical picture results from glucocorticoid deficiency only, although manifestations of the primary pathological disorder can also be present. The diagnostic investigation, although well established, can be challenging, especially in patients with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. We summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology, causal mechanisms, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of this disorder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115DHpmT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning corticosteroid replacement, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/day PO), divided into two or three doses daily, or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg PO), divided into two or three doses daily, as initial therapy. The highest dose should be administered in the morning upon awakening, with the next dose either in the early afternoon (two hours after lunch for a two-dose regimen) or at lunch and again in the afternoon (for a three-dose regimen).

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1149kve6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Studies assessing recovery of HPA axis function through measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test were not formally included in the systematic review (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints"), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at re-testing already following a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

- **Clinical sub-question Ia**: Which clinical/biochemical parameters predict recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

	- Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1–24)-test than patients without recovery (219 vs 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.02–2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values between retesting with ACTH (1–24)-test than patients not recovering (286 vs 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95%CI 1.01–1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

### People with adrenal insufficiency who are in adrenal crisis are frequently unable to self-administer rescue injections [^115N17RS]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Individuals with adrenal insufficiency (AI) are at risk of acute adrenal crisis and death, particularly during illness or trauma, and may require rapid treatment with parenteral glucocorticoid, such as hydrocortisone, to manage a crisis. Guidelines recommend timely self-injection in an evolving crisis. Little is known about the patient experience with emergency injections. To address this, we surveyed people with AI regarding their success with emergency injections.

In 2022, a survey was conducted through the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation website targeting individuals with AI or their caregivers about their experiences managing an adrenal crisis. They reported on adrenal crisis events that required an emergency cortisol injection, detailing the success or failure of the injection, the context of the event, and the reasons for failure.

Nearly half (41%) of adrenal insufficient patients were unable to self-administer an emergency glucocorticoid injection, citing the effects of their crisis-associated illness and confusion as major barriers. Failed injections led to adverse outcomes, such as greater illness severity, a need for hospitalization, or death, in 36% of cases.

To conclude, effective and timely management of an impending adrenal crisis can prevent progression to hospitalization, multisystem failure requiring intensive care, and death. Sole reliance on patient self-injection may lead to worse outcomes. Treating physicians should prioritize patient education about injections, providing specific practical instruction in the technique, as well as preparing for the potential need for assistance during a crisis.

### The utility of the corticotropin test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency in critical illness: an update [^112m9DDh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

One of the most common dynamic testing procedures for the assessment of adrenocortical function is the standard corticotropin or cosyntropin test. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence base underlying the corticotropin test in the management of critically ill patients.

- **Data synthesis**: The principle behind the corticotropin test is the demonstration of an inappropriately low cortisol production in response to exogenous ACTH, a situation analogous to physiological stress. The corticotropin test was originally described in non-stressed subjects, and its applicability and interpretation in the setting of critical illness continues to generate controversy. Determining the prevalence of an abnormal corticotropin test in critical illness is complicated by the use of different end-points and populations. Moreover, the test result is influenced by the assay used for the measurement of plasma cortisol. Trials assessing the relationship between corticotropin response and the severity of stress and organ dysfunction have produced divergent results, which may reflect differences in methodology and the association being measured. Additionally, controversy exists regarding the methodology and interpretation concerning the following variables: dose of corticotropin, end-points for assessment of total or free cortisol, effect of plasma cortisol variability, adrenal blood flow, and its equivalence with other tests of adrenocortical function.

- **Conclusions**: The corticotropin test is widely used in the evaluation of adrenocortical function.

- **High-dose usage and duration**: Use of high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids, or use of inhaled or topical corticosteroids for more than 1 year.

- **Specific administration methods**: Patients who have received intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the previous 2 months.

- **Drug interactions**: Receiving treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116CBZ8p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Adrenal crisis is a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected in patients with recent use of any glucocorticoid formulation presenting with hypotension, collapse, or acute abdominal symptoms. Hyponatremia may also be associated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is paramount, as patients may not have been tested for suspected glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency prior to the acute event, and adrenal crisis may be the first manifestation of the disease. Treatment must not be delayed by laboratory or imaging investigations. If an established or impending adrenal crisis is suspected, the patient should immediately receive an injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously or intramuscularly, followed by rapid volume resuscitation with intravenous administration of 0.9% saline solution (or equivalent).

Patients with confirmed adrenal crisis should be maintained on hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per 24 hours (preferably by continuous intravenous infusion, alternatively by intravenous or intramuscular injection of 50 mg every 6 hours) until clinical recovery and further guidance by an endocrinology specialist. In patients with very high body weight, higher doses might be considered. Some centers use equivalent parenteral doses of other glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone; however, head-to-head comparison data of different treatment strategies for adrenal crisis are lacking. Any identifiable potential triggers should be managed promptly.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zENbA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

For serum cortisol measured by LC-MS/MS, a value > 327 nmol/L (> 11.8 μg/dL) resulted in a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 99% for excluding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and a value < 152 nmol/L (< 5.5 μg/dL) resulted in a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 99% for confirming glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

The quality of evidence was moderate due to applicability concerns, and the numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions on the value of morning cortisol as a stand-alone test to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Importantly, test results of both serum cortisol and the 250 µg ACTH(1–24)-test were not related to clinical endpoints such as adrenal crisis.

### Serum morning cortisol as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency [^1118bDVN]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of morning serum cortisol (MSC) compared to a 10 mg adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency (AI). A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of ACTH stimulation tests was conducted. From a total of 312 potentially eligible ACTH stimulation tests, 306 met the inclusion criteria. The population was randomized into two groups: test (n = 159) and validation (n = 147). In the test group, the receiver operating characteristics curve test evaluated the diagnostic performance of MSC.

A subnormal cortisol response to ACTH was found in 25.8% of the test group. The area under the curve values of MSC to predict AI at +30 minutes, +60 minutes, or at maximal cortisol response were 0.874, 0.897, and 0.925 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.92, 0.83 to 0.93, and 0.87 to 0.96]. The Youden index was 234.2 mmol/L with a sensitivity of 83.3% [95% CI 65.2 to 94.3%], and a specificity of 89.1% [95% CI 82.4 to 93.9%]. Positive and negative predictive values were 64.1% [95% CI 47.1 to 78.8%] and 95.8% [95% CI 90.5 to 98.6%].

There was no difference in age, gender, AI prevalence, or mean serum cortisol at +30 or +60 minutes in the validation group; however, a lower mean MSC value was found. Lower sensitivity and specificity values (88.3% and 60%, respectively) were found for the 234.2 mmol/L cutoff value. This study supports the role of MSC as a first-step diagnostic test in patients with clinically suspected AI. The short stimulation test could be omitted in almost half of the cases.

This study suggests that MSC could effectively streamline the diagnostic process for adrenal insufficiency.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Due to the ease and convenience of testing, experience, and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding the glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine the recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (e.g. prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose).

Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited. Importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes. Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone).

It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults [^114tgcBr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

All patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) should have an etiological diagnosis because it profoundly affects treatment and follow-up. The causes of PAI can be divided into several main groups. The most common is destructive PAI, followed by impaired steroidogenesis, adrenal dysgenesis, and ACTH resistance.

In developed countries, particularly in Europe and North America, autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is the main cause, accounting for about 90% of PAI in young and middle-aged adults. Thus, in most cases, the diagnosis is easily secured by finding 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies, which are present in more than 90% of newly diagnosed cases. Autoimmune PAI is most prevalent in age groups between 20 and 50 years of age but can also occur in childhood and old age. This test is recommended in all patients if the cause is not evident.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113RVW44]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

As discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2, patients need to be educated on stress dosing of glucocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae (Figure 3). Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in patients who have not undergone biochemical testing to confirm the recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis, mortality increases particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and are under minor stress (e.g. fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability — and with no evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (vomiting, diarrhea) — or are undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia will require coverage with stress doses of oral glucocorticoids. As a general guide, see Table 8. The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiologies. Patients should receive double the physiological replacement dose, specifically hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split into three doses: 20 mg on rising, 10 mg at midday, and 10 mg at 5 PM. In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested. This regimen needs careful supervision and adherence.

### Utility of salivary cortisol and cortisone in the diagnostics of adrenal insufficiency [^117TyPBt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The standard cosyntropin stimulation test is the most commonly used dynamic test for adrenal function, whether primary, secondary, or tertiary. The principle of the cosyntropin test is the stimulation of the adrenal cortex by injection of a synthetic analogue of ACTH (ACTH 1–24) called cosyntropin. The test should be performed in the supine position, and the cortisol response is measured 30 and 60 minutes after the IV injection.

When analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a normal response is considered to be serum cortisol (s-cortisol) above 412 nmol/L after 30 minutes, and 485 nmol/L after 60 minutes. Patients on oral estrogens are at risk of obtaining false-positive test results because of increased cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels. Basal morning s-cortisol levels and home waking saliva (sa)-cortisone sampling are good alternatives to the cosyntropin test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency.

Salivary cortisol (sa-cortisol) measurements are commonly used in the diagnostics of Cushing syndrome, but their role in the diagnostics of adrenal insufficiency (AI) remains to be established. The correlation between s-cortisol and sa-cortisol is very high, extending to dynamic diagnostic tests such as the dexamethasone suppression test and the cosyntropin stimulation test. Indeed, the correlation between s-cortisol and sa-cortisone is even more pronounced, likely due to the extensive expression of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD type 2) in the salivary glands. This enzyme catalyzes the rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: the added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^1135iuNx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To review biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we reviewed the relevant literature, including our own data on various biochemical tests used to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are helpful only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated. Baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are helpful only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level of this steroid is not sufficient by itself for establishing the diagnosis. A normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level, however, practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measurements of baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. In addition to these, determination of plasma levels of aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. With a random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both), the diagnosis is influenced significantly.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning indications for testing, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in acutely ill patients. This is particularly relevant when there are otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI, such as volume depletion, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, or, especially in children, hypoglycemia.

### Real world evidence supports waking salivary cortisone as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency [^116TuntV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Worldwide, adults and children are at risk of adrenal insufficiency largely due to infectious diseases and adrenal suppression from the use of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids. Home waking salivary cortisone is an accurate screening test for adrenal insufficiency; it has the potential to reduce costs, and patients prefer it to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (Synacthen) stimulation test. We carried out a service evaluation of home waking salivary cortisone in clinical care to identify implementation barriers.

- **Design, patients, and measurements**: Service evaluation in a centre where 212 patients referred for adrenal insufficiency had a waking salivary cortisone test. Problems encountered during testing were recorded, and patient feedback was collected via focus groups.

- **Results**: Of all patients providing a waking salivary cortisone test, 55% had a normal result, 23% showed adrenal suppression, and 22% received an equivocal result requiring a clinical centre ACTH stimulation test. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) for the time of the saliva sample was 07:40 (07:00–08:40). The median (IQR) days between collection and (i) delivery to the local laboratory was 1 (0.25–2) day; (ii) reporting by the local laboratory was 13 (11–18) days. Patients considered the test "easy to do" and preferred it to the inpatient ACTH stimulation test. The principal challenge to clinical implementation was result reporting to clinicians due to delays at the local laboratory.

- **Conclusions**: This service evaluation provides real-world evidence that home waking salivary cortisone is an effective and practical screening test for adrenal insufficiency.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111sbwED]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The CRF test has been proposed for the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency and for distinguishing between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency. CRF (100 mcg) is injected intravenously, and ACTH and cortisol are measured every 15 minutes for 90 minutes. Patients with secondary adrenal failure have low ACTH levels that fail to respond to CRF, while patients with tertiary (hypothalamic) failure show a prolonged and exaggerated rise in ACTH levels following CRF. The CRF test is not widely used to assess the HPA axis due to its unacceptably low sensitivity.

- **Overnight metyrapone test**: The overnight metyrapone test assesses negative feedback rather than stress-related cortisol responses by utilizing the capacity of metyrapone to inhibit 11β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, thereby stimulating ACTH production and consequently increasing 11-deoxycortisol levels. While some studies have reported the metyrapone test to be reliable, other authors have raised concerns about its sensitivity and specificity when using the traditional post-metyrapone 11-deoxycortisol level of > 200 nmol/L to define normality. The diagnostic accuracy of the metyrapone test can be improved by integrating cortisol and ACTH levels with 11-deoxycortisol measurements. Nevertheless, the assay for 11-deoxycortisol is a manual assay and is not available in most laboratories, which limits the use of this test, particularly as a first-line assessment of the HPA axis.

### Keytruda [^115o1UQo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Immune-mediated endocrinopathies**: Keytruda can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold Keytruda depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

	- Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving Keytruda, including Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of Keytruda in < 0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of Keytruda in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated Keytruda after symptom improvement.

- **Hypophysitis**: Keytruda can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects.

### Predicting iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency in neonates exposed to prolonged steroid courses: Do cortisol levels help [^112a64zk]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether random cortisol levels obtained in neonates to assess for secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) after prolonged steroid exposure are predictive of central AI.

- **Study design**: Data were collected on neonates born from 2017 to 2022 who received ten or more consecutive days of systemic steroids and subsequently had cortisol levels measured. Data were then collected on whether those neonates developed signs of AI or had a failed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.

- **Results**: Of the 71 cortisol levels (in 67 neonates) that were analyzed, there was no difference in cortisol levels between neonates who developed AI, with a median cortisol level of 6.5 mcg/dl, and those who did not, with a median of 9.2 mcg/dl. Similarly, no difference was observed between those who failed their ACTH stimulation test and those who passed it, as determined using Wilcoxon ranked sum tests.

- **Conclusion**: These findings demonstrate that cortisol levels may not be helpful in identifying AI in neonates exposed to prolonged steroids.

### Utility of salivary cortisol measurements in Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency [^114w2RAM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

The measurement of cortisol in saliva is a simple, reproducible, and reliable test to evaluate the normal and disordered control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. There are a variety of simple methods to obtain saliva samples without stress, making this a robust test applicable to many different experimental and clinical situations.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid Medline and PubMed from 1950 to present were searched using specific strategies. The bibliographies of all relevant citations were evaluated for any additional appropriate citations.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Measurement of an elevated late-night (2300 to 2400 h) salivary cortisol has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Late-night salivary cortisol measurements are also useful to monitor patients for remission and/or recurrence after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Because it is a surrogate for plasma free cortisol, the measurement of salivary cortisol may be useful during an ACTH stimulation test in patients with increased plasma binding protein concentrations due to increased estrogen, or decreased plasma binding protein concentrations during critical illness. Most reference laboratories now offer salivary cortisol testing.

- **Conclusions**: It is expected that the use of the measurement of salivary cortisol will continue to be an important tool in clinical settings.

Clinical question III: What is the diagnostic accuracy of a morning cortisol value vs 250 μg ACTH (1–24)-test in diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test.

Of note, in the studies of Sagar et al. and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay.

In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed the ACTH (1–24)-test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1–24)-testing in included studies).

The results of the study by Sbardella et al. showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24)-test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported.

Debono et al. found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11469Efd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning the evaluation for underlying etiology, ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in adult patients with PAI:

- **Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level**: To test for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in infants, as well as selected children and adults.

- **21-hydroxylase antibodies**: To test for autoimmune adrenalitis.

- **Plasma VLCFAs**: To test for adrenoleukodystrophy in males with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies.

- **CT scan of the adrenals**: To eliminate adrenal infiltrative processes or metastases in all patients with an unknown etiology of adrenal insufficiency after laboratory testing.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, specifically with respect to confirmation of recovery, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. It is important to recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol is a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

### Presentation of primary adrenal insufficiency in childhood [^113TvWc1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Context**: Primary adrenal insufficiency is usually diagnosed in infancy or adulthood, and cases presenting in childhood have not been systematically reviewed.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to determine the etiologies, signs, and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency presenting in childhood.

- **Design and setting**: We conducted a retrospective chart review at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital.

- **Patients**: Patients were children with corticoadrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid deficiency, or mineralocorticoid deficiency.

- **Results**: Seventy-seven cases were identified from 1999 to 2010. Thirty-five had congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and were not reviewed further. Forty-two patients (20 diagnosed at our institution) had primary adrenal insufficiency. These had etiologies as follows: autoimmune (18), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (an additional five), ACTH resistance (four), adrenoleukodystrophy (three), adrenal hypoplasia congenita (two), adrenal hemorrhage (two), IMAGe syndrome (one), and idiopathic (two). Of 20 patients diagnosed at our institution, two were being monitored when adrenal insufficiency developed and were not included in the analysis of presenting signs and symptoms. Thirteen of 18 patients were hypotensive; 12 of 18 had documented hyperpigmentation. Hyponatremia (5.0 mEq/liter) was noted in only nine. Hypoglycemia and ketosis were documented in four of 15 and four of six patients in whom it was sought, respectively. Fifteen patients underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing with median baseline and s

### Rethinking the management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adrenal insufficiency in cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112XXRaW]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Proposed algorithm for endocrine screening and monitoring**: In immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline and/or post-ICI therapy ACTH stimulation test may be considered in cases of equivocal 8 AM serum cortisol levels. Caution must be used in interpreting the results of post-ICI therapy ACTH stimulation test, as it may be falsely normal in the setting of acute ACTH and cortisol deficiencies.

- **Clinician's discretion**: Additional screening may be performed at the clinician's discretion, depending on whether the patient reports symptoms of excessive thirst, polydipsia, and hypotonic polyuria.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including co-morbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency, or by the medical context, such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**: Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations.

### A single adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test does not reveal adrenal insufficiency in septic shock [^1167D2a9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency in critically ill patients is complex. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is a widely accepted method for assessing the adequacy of adrenal function in intensive care units. However, responses to the test may vary widely over a short period of time. In this prospective study, we investigated the reproducibility of the ACTH stimulation test in 20 patients with sepsis, 20 patients with septic shock, and 20 critically ill patients without sepsis. Two consecutive ACTH stimulation tests were performed within 24 hours after intensive care unit admission or at the onset of sepsis.

- **Sentence case**: In patients without sepsis, there was good correlation between ACTH responses on days 1 and 2 (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.689; P = 0.001).
- **Sentence case**: In contrast, in patients with septic shock, no correlation was observed between the two ACTH responses (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.401; P = 0.080).

We conclude that the results of the ACTH stimulation tests are poorly reproducible in septic shock, and a single ACTH stimulation test may not be the best method to diagnose adrenal insufficiency in these patients.

### Evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients: Disease state review [^114WCf4X]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The definition of normal adrenal function in critically ill patients remains controversial, despite a large body of literature. We review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients and discuss the authors' personal approach to patient management.

- **Methods**: Extensive literature review, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience were utilized.

- **Results**: A decrease in cortisol breakdown rather than an increase in cortisol production has been suggested as the main contributor to elevated cortisol levels in critically ill patients. The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency has multiple pathophysiologic flaws and is not supported by evidence. Patients with septic shock who are pressor dependent or refractory to fluid resuscitation may receive a short course of hydrocortisone, regardless of their serum cortisol levels or their response to a cosyntropin stimulation test (CST). Patients without septic shock who are suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should have their random cortisol levels measured. In patients with low and near-normal cortisol-binding proteins, a serum cortisol of 1.8 μg/dL is notable, although further studies are needed to define a normal range in critically ill patients based on both severity and duration of illness.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis in the emergency department [^111Ncj1V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Due to the range of symptoms, variable clinical courses, and etiologies, it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and manage. This narrative review discusses the evaluation of an adult patient at risk for a new diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the management of a patient with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.

- **Discussion**: A new presentation of adrenal insufficiency can range from nonspecific, minor symptoms, including fatigue, to a life-threatening adrenal crisis with hemodynamic instability. Due to the variety of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed. Those with known adrenal insufficiency are at risk for adrenal crisis, which may occur due to a variety of triggers. Initial evaluation includes assessment for the underlying etiology or concomitant condition, laboratory analysis, and imaging, when clinically indicated. Although not necessary for evaluation in the emergency department setting, the diagnosis is confirmed by specific testing, such as the cosyntropin stimulation test. The mainstay of treatment in adrenal crisis is hydrocortisone, intravenous fluid, glucose repletion, and treatment of the underlying acute trigger.

Emergency clinicians must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage those with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117KL5Q6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest that in patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose. Patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation (good clinical practice).

- **Management guidance**: Management of patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.

- **Suggested regimens**: Suggested glucocorticoid regimens in patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress.

- **Rationale**: Adrenal crisis, also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis, can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids if drug availability suddenly decreases (e.g. missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery. The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by insufficient cortisol production in response to stress.

Evidence for the majority of the above recommendations regarding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is low or very low. Therefore, future epidemiological research needs to define the true risk of clinical adrenal crisis and adrenal insufficiency. Additional data regarding the morbidity and mortality of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is required to understand the associated health risk, which will ultimately define the approach to care for patients tapering long-term glucocorticoid therapy.

There is a need for further definition of risk factors contributing to the development and susceptibility of adrenal insufficiency, such as genetic predisposition, environmental influences, concurrent medication, and underlying diseases for which glucocorticoid therapy is initiated. Biomedical and psychosocial research into the understanding of glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted, ideally providing clinical scoring systems or biomarkers, in order to better differentiate glucocorticoid withdrawal from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Established dynamic tests for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency identify a relatively large proportion of patients with biochemical HPA axis insufficiency following glucocorticoid therapy. Yet, there is only a very low reported number of patients who develop clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency, and only an exceedingly low number of patients develop adrenal crisis. Therefore, more specific and predictive tests and follow-up parameters, including salivary cortisol and potentially continuous monitoring, are needed.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Guy57]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prior studies have shown that adrenal insufficiency may last up to 2–4 years after glucocorticoid cessation, owing to the slow recovery of adrenal cortisol production. Persistent impairment of cortisol secretion beyond four years suggests that recovery of adrenal function is likely improbable, and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued. Additional regular testing beyond four years may not be helpful but can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

- **Patient evaluation**: The panel suggests that patients with persistent adrenal insufficiency while on a physiologic daily dose equivalent of glucocorticoids for longer than one year should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist to assess for underlying causes of adrenal insufficiency other than glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (e.g. pituitary causes). The panel recommends that patients who experience an adrenal crisis while on glucocorticoids should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist.

- **Treatment recommendations**: Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone. Furthermore, it is necessary to provide education to these patients regarding the adjustment of glucocorticoid substitution therapy doses during stressful situations to prevent adrenal crises or to manage them.

- **Recommendation 2.12**: We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

Secretion of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone is largely regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and potassium levels.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration are likely to experience more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

A slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess.

This scoring may also be applied to patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with a slower taper in patients with a high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in those with a lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower taper, temporarily increasing the glucocorticoid dose may be necessary to alleviate symptoms.

### The low-dose ACTH stimulation test: Is 30 minutes long enough [^1125j4vm]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Controversy persists regarding the use of the low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (LDST) for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) and optimal test result interpretation. However, many centers are now using the LDST to assess cortisol secretion adequacy, and some only use a 30-minute cortisol level to determine adrenal sufficiency or AI. This study examined both 30- and 60-minute cortisol levels to assess whether the interpretation of the test was affected when both cortisol levels were taken into consideration.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained by retrospective chart review from a single pediatric endocrinology unit over a 7-year period. We identified 82 patients who completed the LDST. Their mean age was 11.7 years, and 37% were female. Cortisol levels were evaluated at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. A cutoff value ≥ 18 μg/dL was used to define adrenal sufficiency.

- **Results**: We found that 54% of patients reached peak cortisol levels at 60 minutes, and 11 patients who did not pass the test at 30 minutes did so at 60 minutes. The only predictive characteristic was weight status; overweight and obese individuals tended to peak at 30 minutes, and normal and underweight individuals tended to peak at 60 minutes.

- **Conclusion**: Although further studies are necessary to confirm our findings, it appears that measuring cortisol both 30 and 60 minutes following synthetic ACTH administration may be necessary to avoid overdiagnosing AI.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Participants**: The Task Force comprised a chair, designated by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Participating members from co-sponsoring associations, such as the European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, were also included. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration for this review.

- **Evidence**: Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, this evidence-based guideline evaluates the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: Recommendations were formulated from evidence derived from two commissioned systematic reviews and other published reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline underwent sequential reviews and approvals by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. Changes based on written comments were incorporated at every stage.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnostic tests for excluding primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposition.

Summary and interpretation of evidence from the systematic reviews:

- **Clinical question i**: What is the incidence of recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency? Broersen et al. performed a meta-analysis on eleven out of seventeen studies, re-testing patients for biochemical adrenal insufficiency. Results categorized the studies into short-term (defined as less than 4 weeks) high-dose glucocorticoid therapy with re-testing after 4 weeks (six studies) and long-term (> 1 year) medium-dose glucocorticoid therapy with re-testing after 6 months (five studies).

Included articles had to use a cutoff value for serum cortisol of ≤ 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) or higher, such as ≤ 550 nmol/L or 19.8 μg/dL, or 11-deoxycortisol of ≤ 200 nmol/L (7.2 μg/dL) after the metyrapone test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Pooled analysis of studies in the first group (141 patients) demonstrated a decrease in adrenal insufficiency from 38.7% after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy to 14.9% after 4 weeks. Pooled analysis of studies in the second group (174 patients) indicated a decrease in adrenal insufficiency from 56.4% at baseline to 25.3% after 6 months.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: A review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid-induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

- **Observations**: Primary adrenal insufficiency involves a deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones and is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (e.g. high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (e.g. tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (e.g. hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency results from the administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 a.m.) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency.
