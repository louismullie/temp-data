## Question

Léa bought one book for $16, three binders for $2 and six notebooks for $1. Calculate the total cost of her purchases.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to calculate the total cost of Léa's purchases, which include one book for $16, three binders for $2 each, and six notebooks for $1 each. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cost of each item category. Then, I should verify the arithmetic for each category. Next, I will sum the subtotals to get the total cost. Finally, I will double-check the final figure to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the cost of the book. One book at $16 means the book subtotal is $16, and I don't need to multiply here because the quantity is 1, so that stays $16.

> Now, I need to check the binders. Three binders at $2 each equals 3 times 2, which is $6. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 3 × 2 = 6, so the binder subtotal is indeed $6.

> Next, I should review the notebooks. Six notebooks at $1 each equals 6 times 1, which is $6. Hold on, I should verify: 6 × 1 = 6, so the notebook subtotal is $6.

> I will now examine the total by adding the subtotals together. $16 for the book plus $6 for the binders plus $6 for the notebooks equals $28. Let me double-check the addition: 16 + 6 = 22, and 22 + 6 = 28, so the total cost is $28.

---

The total cost is **$28**. Here's the breakdown: the book costs $16, the three binders cost $6 (3 × $2), and the six notebooks cost $6 (6 × $1), so the total is $16 + $6 + $6 = **$28**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Item** | **Quantity** | **Unit price** | **Total cost** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Book | 1 | $16 | $16 |
| Binders | 3 | $2 | $6 |
| Notebooks | 6 | $1 | $6 |
| **Total** | ∅ | ∅ | **$28** |

---

Therefore, Léa spent a total of **$28** on her purchases.

Results

The 200 participants ranged widely in age (M = 34.2, SD = 12.1, Range = 21 to 75) and income (M = $56,800, median = $26,900, Range = $0 to $400,000). Most participants were well-educated (85% had bachelor's degree or higher) and somewhat liberal-leaning (M = 34.6, SD = 18.6, on a scale from 0 = "left" to 100 = "right"); in the baseline survey, 106 participants identified their gender as women, 93 as men and one as non-binary. On average, each participant made 16 purchases (SD = 13, range 1–94) during the study, with an average cost of $565 per purchase (median = $200, SD = $1067). Table 1 presents the average number and cost of purchases participants made in each category.

Spending types and happiness

Participants reported how happy each purchase made them on five-point scales, and we analyzed their happiness ratings using random intercept multilevel models, with purchases (level 1) nested within individuals (level 2). We entered all of the dichotomous spending categories simultaneously as predictors of happiness, controlling for the cost of each purchase (because more expensive purchases provided more happiness). Our primary goal was to examine whether each type of purchase (e.g. experiences) made an individual happier compared to all of the purchases they made in other categories. By focusing on these within-person effects, we are effectively eliminating between-person differences, which would otherwise cloud interpretation of our findings. For example, wealthier individuals might be more likely to buy experiences, while poorer individuals might be more likely to pay off debt. If we observed higher happiness ratings for experiences than for debt, this difference might reflect the fact that the individuals who are buying experiences are wealthier (and therefore happier) overall than those who are paying off debt. In order to remove between-person differences, we used person-mean centering, for all level 1 predictor variables; using this centering approach enabled us to examine purely within-person effects in our multilevel model (for details of the model, see Supplementary Table S6). To address possible multicollinearity among categories, we also tested each spending type in isolation in individual models. However, as these results were similar to those from the model including all spending types, we only present the latter. All analyses were performed in R. The variables were not strictly normally distributed, but generally linear models can tolerate such minor violations.

### It's a long shot, but it just might work! perspectives on the future of medicine [^114K6ek4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What was the last product you searched for online? Every aspect of the information presented to you, from its position on the screen to whether the text was underlined, was shaped by thousands of online randomized controlled experiments and scads of data being processed in real-time from millions of other customers like you. Contrast this experience with the last time you received a healthcare intervention. If a treatment existed for your problem, then the (very expensive) evidence for it was generated long ago from a tiny and highly unusual group of volunteers who were followed up for a relatively short time period, with all the data gathered by the company with most to gain from a positive result, approved in a binary one-time process, and with a price shrouded in secrecy. Since then, nearly all the outcome data on the success or failure of the treatment for every other person like you was either scrawled on paper in filing cabinets or, most likely, was never written down in the first place. If the outcome data was stored electronically, that was probably only for routine management or reimbursement purposes and extracting meaning from the "data shadow" is challenging. Consequently, neither you nor your doctor know with confidence if the treatment they prescribed is really working for you, the manufacturer does not have much feedback as to what they could do better, and whoever paid for it does not know if they got value for money. This worries me greatly, as it seems like Amazon is leveraging every drop of data on the planet to feed my daughter the best suggestion for which episode of Peppa Pig to watch next, but that the health system has given me a paper booklet on which to record her health data.

Subjective well-being

Subjective well-being (SWB) is defined as including three components: high life satisfaction, high positive affect, and low negative affect. On each survey, participants completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, rating their agreement with statements such as "I am satisfied with my life" on a scale from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" (7). Participants also completed the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience, reporting how frequently in the last month they experienced six positive feelings (e.g. "Happy") and six negative feelings (e.g. "Sad") on a scale from "very rarely or never" (1) to "very often or always" (5). The three components were standardized and combined to form a score for subjective well-being.

Spending categories

At the end of each of the three months, participants completed a spending diary, providing detailed descriptions of all purchases they made with the Mystery Experiment money. For every purchase, participants were told to "describe in detail what you spent the money on (please include details like what, where, when, and why)". By asking participants for free descriptions, we were able to avoid revealing our interest in specific spending categories we examined. Two independent coders then placed their open-ended responses into 26 spending categories (see Supplementary Methods for full coding details). We began with a set of basic spending categories created by a bank, such as utilities, housing, transportation, and education. We then created additional categories to capture key constructs based on the scholarly literature, including time-saving purchases and experiences. Coders evaluated whether each purchase did belong (1) or did not belong (0) to each of the 26 categories, and the two coders' evaluations were highly consistent in both higher and lower-income countries (kappa 0.83–0.98, Supplementary Table S1). For example, the purchase of "Hamilton" tickets for the family was categorized as a gift and also as an experience. A third coder evaluated any disagreements between the initial coders and recoded any systematic errors. Of the 26 categories, 9 categories were rarely used (i.e. contained fewer than 50 purchases in the category). Leading scholars have argued that 50 is a minimun cell size to ensure statistical power. Therefore we excluded these categories from analysis, leaving 17 spending categories (see Supplementary Table S2 for descriptive statistics of the eliminated categories).

### Using health primes to reduce unhealthy snack purchases among overweight consumers in a grocery store [^113yTGBM]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Among normal-weight participants, the goal prime had no effect, as they bought equal numbers of snacks in the health prime as in the control condition, F (1, 94) = 0.53, P = 0.47. Thus, the health goal prime reduced the purchases of unhealthy energy-dense snacks, but only among overweight/obese participants.

Not surprisingly, this analysis also revealed a main effect of number of people, such that participants bought more unhealthy snacks if they purchased groceries for more people, F (1, 94) = 8.55, P = 0.004, and η² = 0.08.

To corroborate these findings, we conducted the same analysis with the cost of unhealthy snacks purchased as the dependent variable. This revealed the same critical interaction of condition and weight status, F (1, 90) = 4.70, P = 0.03 and η² = 0.05. In the control condition, overweight participants spent somewhat more money on unhealthy snacks than normal-weight participants, F (1, 90) = 3.05, P = 0.08 and η² = 0.03. Importantly, overweight individuals spent less on unhealthy snacks in the health prime condition (M = €1.05, s.e. = 0.80) than in the control condition (M = €3.65, s.e. = 0.72), F (1, 90) = 5.87, P = 0.02 and η² = 0.06. Again, among normal-weight participants, the goal prime had no effect, F < 1. There was a main effect of number of people participants did groceries for on the cost of unhealthy snacks purchased, F (1, 90) = 3.91, P = 0.05 and η² = 0.04. The total value of the groceries participants bought (M = €29.62, s.e. = 2.31) was not affected by weight status and condition, all P > 0.17.

### When the price is right: beyond the medical risks and benefits of costly therapies [^111Qo9c6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "The first wealth is health". Unfortunately, if Emerson had experienced our current health care system, he might have instead said, "Health can be maintained only with wealth". Someday, we may live in a world where health can be maintained without wealth. But until then, a better understanding of both the financial and medical consequences of medical interventions is essential to provide the best care to patients. Rao and colleagues should be congratulated for having the creativity and courage to tackle this difficult issue and providing a pivotal first step toward integrating cost into patient‐centered decision‐making.

### Meaningful use a call to arms [^1152fqNE]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The benefits of an interactive online world have affected the way we purchase products and plan our vacations. It is only a matter of time before consumers start demanding health care with the same convenience that comes with booking an airline flight or managing a bank account. The health care industry itself requires periodic and mandatory data analysis for outcome analysis, clinical benchmarking, quality improvement, forming guidelines, and making decisions. The federal government and health care community have been working together to come up with more robust and cost-effective health care informatics solutions. Meaningful use (MU) intends to establish a new standard for health care informatics in the United States. The term "meaningful use" implies that health care information and technology systems not just exist, but also serve as an integral part of physician and hospital workflow; leading to cost savings as well as improved outcomes. Under this concept, the federal government is offering maximum incentive payments of up to $44,000 per physician (including radiologists) if they can meet all the requirements as laid down in the MU measures. Unfortunately, penalties will kick in if physicians are not compliant with MU by 2015. This will be done in at least three stages, with Stage 1 already in effect (as of January 3, 2011). This will be the first in a series of articles outlining MU and what is in store for radiology. We will go in depth about who is eligible, and how the payment schedule is set up. We will break down the core and menu set measures to suggest what can be excluded by most radiologists. We will also go through some case studies and examine what lies in store for radiology.

### Socioeconomic inequalities in the healthiness of food choices: exploring the contributions of food expenditures [^115PSmyG]. Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

2.2 Measures

2.2.1 Socioeconomic status

Head-of-household occupation using the UK Registrar General's social class classification was categorized into three groups: Higher Managerial and Professional ('Higher': n = 5332); White Collar and Skilled Manual ('Middle': n = 13,621); and Semi-skilled and Unskilled Manual ('Lower': n = 5926).

2.2.2 Food expenditure

Expenditure was calculated from the households' total spend (£) on take-home food and beverages over the 52 week period, divided by the total number of calories those purchases for the same period, multiplied by 2000 to give an energy-adjusted food expenditure variable (£ per 2000 kcal).

2.2.3 Supermarket choice

We defined supermarket choice as in: firstly, supermarkets were categorized as high-, medium- or low-cost based on market definitions. Households were then classified according whether or not they ever patronized high- or low-cost supermarkets (in addition to medium-cost supermarkets, which were almost universally patronized), giving four groups: Used low-cost supermarkets exclusively or low- and medium-cost supermarkets ('Low-cost'); Used medium-cost supermarkets only ('Medium-cost'); Used high-cost supermarkets exclusively or medium- and high-cost supermarkets ('High-cost'); Used all three tiers of supermarkets ('All-types').

2.2.4 Healthiness of food and beverage choices

Two outcome variables assessed healthiness of food and beverage choices, comprising less-healthy and healthier indices:
1 Percentage of food energy purchased from less-healthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages, as classified by FSA Nutrient Profile scores for individual products (Scores are calculated from the energy, saturated fat, sugar, sodium, fiber, protein, and fruit, vegetable and nut content, per 100 g; foods scoring 4 or more, and beverages 1 or more, are categorized as less-healthy).
2 Percentage of food energy purchased from fruit and vegetables — this included fresh, canned, frozen and dried fruit, vegetables and legumes, but excluded juice, potatoes, and fruit and vegetables present in processed products.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^115jz9to]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Finally, to compare costs across countries, we converted local currency prices to 2011 international dollars using purchasing power parity exchange rates for household consumption, which measure the amount of local currency units needed to purchase the same bundle of goods and services in each country. Purchasing power parity conversions are based on the same price data used to compute diet costs but are an average of all food and non-food items in proportion to their importance for the country's total spending.

Income and affordability by country

To measure affordability, we used survey-based estimates of countries' mean daily per capita household income from the World Bank's PovcalNet system, which covers 141 countries accounting for 92% of the world's population (appendix). The PovcalNet data are based on household consumption for most low-income and middle-income countries and on household income for all high-income countries (appendix). Using surveys to ask people about their earnings is typically more feasible in higher-income countries. In low-income and middle-income countries, asking about total consumption is often preferable in part because many households obtain food in kind from their own farms. For convenience, we used the term income to mean both earnings and consumption. We also reported affordability relative to the country's gross national income, which is calculated from national accounts and includes the cost of public services as well as household income. Because survey-based estimates are the more relevant benchmark for affordability of each diet, results using gross national income for 156 countries are provided in the appendix. Focusing on the survey data also allowed us to calculate the number of people in each country for whom the lowest-cost way to meet the EAT– Lancet reference diet exceeded the total value of all household income per capita (appendix).

Costs of unintentional fatal falls, United States, 2005 — in 2005 dollars, average medical costs were $22,187 (total $436,101,000) and average work loss costs were $215,862 (total $4,242,975,000); deaths: 19,656. Medical costs are those attributable to a fatal injury event, work loss costs are those attributable to lost wages, fringe benefits, and missed household work due to death, and a combined cost can be calculated by adding the medical costs to the work loss costs.

Health care abroad — insurance and payment considerations advises that travelers "should research their policy thoroughly and identify potential healthcare professionals and facilities at their destination that are 'in-network' for their insurance coverage", and notes that "The US embassy or consulate website for each city that has a US diplomatic post has a list of local hospitals and doctors that can also be used for identifying potential healthcare professionals and facilities abroad". It cautions that "Nationalized healthcare services at a given destination do not necessarily cover healthcare costs of nonresidents", and that "Even with a supplemental travel health insurance policy, receiving medical care abroad usually requires a cash or credit card payment at the point of service, which can result in expenditures of thousands of dollars". US citizens paying for care abroad "should obtain copies of all charges and receipts and, if necessary, contact a US consular officer, who can assist the traveler with transferring funds from the United States".

### Price transparency in the online age [^111LrvjQ]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plastic surgeons are sometimes hesitant to provide their pricing information online, due to several concerns. However, if implemented right, price transparency can be used as a lead generation tool that provides consumers with the pricing information they want and gives the physician the consumer's contact information for follow-up. This study took place during the author's first year in private practice in a new city. An interactive price transparency platform (ie, cost estimator) was integrated into his website, allowing consumers to submit a "wishlist" of procedures to check pricing on these procedures of interest. However, the consumer must submit their contact information to receive the desired breakdown of costs that are tailored based on the author's medical fees. During that first year, without any advertising expenditure, the author's website received 412 wishlists from 208 unique consumers. Consumers (17.8%) that submitted a wishlist came in for a consultation and 62% of those booked a procedure. The average value of a booked procedure was over US $4000 and cumulatively, all of the leads from this one lead source in that first year generated over US $92,000 in revenue. When compared with non-price-aware patients, price-aware patients were 41% more likely to book a procedure. Price transparency led to greater efficiency and reduced consultations that ended in "sticker shock". When prudently integrated into a medical practice, price transparency can be a great lead generation source for patients that are (1) paying out of pocket for medically necessary services due to a high-deductible health plan or (2) paying for services not typically covered by insurance, such as cosmetic services.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^114h8sGF]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disorders — lower extremity amputation (LEA) epidemiology and costs show sex and ethnic disparities, poor post-amputation survival, and substantial economic burden; in 2002, the age-adjusted LEA rate among men was 7.0 per 1,000 persons with diabetes compared with 3.3 per 1000 among women, and Mexican (Hispanic) Americans, Native Americans, and African Americans each have at least a 1.5- to 2-fold greater risk for diabetes-related amputation than age-matched diabetic Caucasians. Survival after amputation is poor, with 3- and 5-year survival rates about 50% and 40%, an earlier study from Sweden reporting a 5-year mortality rate of 86%, and researchers noting a 50% incidence of serious contralateral foot lesion and a 50% incidence of contralateral amputation within 2 to 5 years of an LEA. Costs are high: the estimated cost for foot ulcer care in the US ranges from $4,595 per ulcer episode to nearly $28,000 for the 2 years after diagnosis, one report estimates 800,000 prevalent ulcer cases with costs averaging $5,457 per year per patient or total national annual costs of $5 billion, and among patients with foot ulcers about 7% will subsequently require an LEA. Direct and indirect costs of LEA range from $20,000 to $40,000 per event; applying the lower figure to 82,000 amputations performed in 2002 suggests total LEA costs might exceed $1.6 billion annually, and when outpatient ulcer care costs are added, the estimated total costs in the US for diabetic foot disease can easily approach or exceed $6 billion annually.

### Socioeconomic status, energy cost, and nutrient content of supermarket food purchases [^114jc8Ja]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The relative affordability of energy-dense versus nutrient-rich foods may promote socioeconomic disparities in dietary quality and obesity. Although supermarkets are the largest food source in the American diet, the associations between SES and the cost and nutrient content of freely chosen food purchases have not been described.

Purpose

To investigate relationships of SES with the energy cost ($/1000 kcal) and nutrient content of freely chosen supermarket purchases.

Methods

Supermarket shoppers (n = 69) were recruited at a Phoenix AZ supermarket in 2009. The energy cost and nutrient content of participants' purchases were calculated from photographs of food packaging and nutrition labels using dietary analysis software. Data were analyzed in 2010–2011.

Results

Two SES indicators, education and household income as a percentage of the federal poverty guideline (FPG), were associated with the energy cost of purchased foods. Adjusting for covariates, the amount spent on 1000 kcal of food was $0.26 greater for every multiple of the FPG, and those with a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree spent an additional $1.05 for every 1000 kcal of food compared to those with no college education. Lower energy cost was associated with higher total fat and less protein, dietary fiber, and vegetables per 1000 kcal purchased.

Conclusions

Low-SES supermarket shoppers purchase calories in inexpensive forms that are higher in fat and less nutrient-rich.

League tables and CEA evidence sources — A league table approach lists all possible interventions in increasing order of ICERs so the health system invests first in the most cost-effective options until the budget is exhausted. The CEA registry maintained by Tufts Medical Center is a database of more than 10000 CEAs that enables comparison of ICERs across interventions and serves as a generic league table. Although proposed for fixed-budget systems, this approach is impractical for the fragmented US health system, though individual payers or programs may operationalize a limited form to optimize resource allocation.

### Tobacco litter costs and public policy: a framework and methodology for considering the use of fees to offset abatement costs [^1169gwUM]. Tobacco Control (2011). Low credibility.

Total TPL costs to the City were calculated by multiplying the TPL share of 22.5% by the total annual litter abatement cost of US$25 million in 2009, resulting in a base TPL abatement cost estimate of US$5.6 million. To this amount, the City elected to add costs associated with administering the fee and the costs of a public anti-littering campaign, which together raised the annual total costs to approximately US$7 million.

The calculation of per-pack fees involved several steps. First, data on cigarette packs sold per capita in California were obtained from a variety of sources. The CDC reported a 'packs per capita' value of 31.8 for California. To verify, the 2007 California Health Interview Survey data were used to estimate smoking prevalence and the number of cigarettes typically smoked per day in San Francisco. These data show remarkably similar results, suggesting that 31.8 packs per capita was an appropriate estimate for the state and for San Francisco. Second, in order to convert the packs-per-capita data into a measure of packs purchased in San Francisco per annum, data were adjusted for the influx of daytime commuters and daytime and nighttime visitors and tourists. An assumption was made that commuter and tourist visitors to San Francisco purchase 50% of their cigarettes outside of San Francisco. The result was a net estimate of 30.6 million cigarette packs purchased in San Francisco in 2008 (in terms of cigarettes purchased in San Francisco, 30.6 million packs converts to 612 220 520 individual cigarettes). The commuter and visitor adjustment resulted in an 11% reduction in litter abatement costs.

The calculation of the GHG emissions cost for the EU ETS. Following the inclusion of the maritime transport sector in the EU ETS according to Regulation 2015/757 and Directive 2023/959, vessels are required to acquire EUAs to offset a portion of their GHG emissions. Specifically, ships must purchase EUAs to cover 50% of their emissions for voyages to and from ports within the EEA, as well as for all emissions generated while navigating and berthing within the EEA. To phase in this requirement, only 40% of emissions were subject to the EU ETS in 2024, with the coverage increasing to 70% in 2025. From 2026 onwards, 100% of emissions will be included, with CH₄ and N₂O also becoming part of the scheme.

### Association of a sweetened beverage tax with purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods at independent stores in Philadelphia [^114Sfnyq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Outcome Variables

For price analyses, the primary outcome was the change in mean beverage price, in cents per fluid ounce, of audited taxed and nontaxed beverages between baseline and 24 months posttax. Energy drinks were excluded from price analyses due to their much higher mean price per fluid ounce (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). For customer purchase analyses, the primary outcomes were the change in purchased fluid ounces of taxed and nontaxed beverages per person (ie, the sum of all taxed or nontaxed beverages purchased per customer purchase assessment) and change in total calories from beverages and high-sugar food purchases (calculated using the recorded size per item and nutrient information; to convert fluid ounces to mL, multiply by 30). Secondary outcomes were the change in beverage price and total purchased beverage ounces by sweetener type (for taxed beverages only), container size, store income level, and customer education level. Lower education was defined as having a high school degree, General Educational Development diploma, or less, while higher education included some college or more. We also examined changes in grams of sugar purchased and total amount spent (including food/beverages and other items).

### Local cost of living, financial literacy, and housing hardship at older ages [^111csrcy]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures

The dependent variable is housing hardship. Respondents were asked to recall if they had trouble paying rent or mortgage in the 12 months prior to the survey. Housing hardship was coded binary: yes = 1, no = 0.

The independent variable is localized income security, operationalized as the ratio of household income to cost of living in the county of residence, as captured by the Elder Index. Household income was calibrated for household size using "equivalence scales" to account for economies of scale in consumer expenditures. To understand the added explanatory power of the county-level cost of living, a measure of income that was not adjusted for cost of living was included for comparison. The Elder Index for people living alone was used to standardize the cost of living at the individual level. To mitigate the risk of multicollinearity, which would undermine tests for interactions, indicators of income were measured as deviations from sample means in the model with the interaction term.

Financial literacy is the moderating variable. Respondents were asked two questions assessing financial literacy: (1) "Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow: more than $102, exactly $102, less than $102?" (Hereafter referred to as interest rate); (2) "Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than, exactly the same as, or less than today with the money in this account?" (Hereafter referred to as inflation). These theoretically supported and empirically validated questions of interest rate and inflation are most pertinent to housing hardship as they capture an individual's understanding of fundamental concepts of personal finance. An indicator "financial literacy" was created and coded 1 if both were answered correctly and coded 0 if otherwise (1 = high, 0 = low).

### Estimation of potential savings through therapeutic substitution [^117B5QvM]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Therapeutic substitution offers potential to decrease pharmaceutical expenditures and potentially improve the efficiency of the health care system.

Objective

To estimate potential savings through therapeutic substitution in terms of both overall and out-of-pocket expenditures of branded drugs when a generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Repeated cross-sectional study using the 107 132 individuals included in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010–2012) along with their reported prescribed medicine use. The Orange Book, company financial statements, US Food and Drug Administration records, and published research were used for adjunctive information.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated excess expenditure due to branded drug overuse when a lower-cost generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

Results

The study included 107 132 individuals between 2010 and 2012, of whom 62.1% (95% CI, 61.4%-62.8%) reported use of any prescribed medicine. A total of 31.5% (95% CI, 30.7%-32.2%) used a medication from an included drug class, whereas 16.6% (95% CI, 16.0%-17.1%) of the population used a branded drug from the included classes compared with 24.0% (95% CI, 23.4%-24.7%) who used a generic and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.4%) who used both. In the included drug classes, the majority of the drugs were generics, with a total of 93.5 billion standardized doses compared with 47.4 billion standardized doses of branded drugs. Total expenditure of the branded drugs accounted for $147 (95% CI, $137-$156) billion compared with $62.7 (95% CI, $58.9-$66.5) billion for the generics. Between 2010 and 2012, an estimated $73.0 (95% CI, $67.6-$78.5) billion in total excess expenditure and $24.6 (95% CI, $22.6-$26.5) billion in out-of-pocket excess expenditure was attributable to branded drug overuse. The excess was present across numerous drug classes throughout many aspects of medicine and equates to 9.6% of total and 14.1% of out-of-pocket prescribed medicine expenses. The drug classes with the highest excess expenditure included statins ($10.9 [SE, $0.41] billion), atypical antipsychotics ($9.99 [SE, $1.03] billion), proton pump inhibitors ($6.12 [SE, $0.38] billion), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ($6.08 [SE, $0.49] billion), and angiotensin receptor blockers ($5.53 [SE, $0.35] billion).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although therapeutic substitution is controversial, it offers a potential mechanism to significantly decrease drug costs if it can be implemented in a way that does not negatively affect quality of care.

### Search engine ads for suicide prevention: analysis of engagement from Indonesia relative to Australia, the USA, and the medical industry standards [^115oTNJd]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Outcomes

Engagement with the landing page was recorded if the individual presented with an ad clicked through and called a hotline, or in the case of the Indonesian and Australian studies, engaged with one of the resources (e.g. watched a video, completed an activity, or downloaded a file). Engagements are otherwise referred to as conversions in the advertising industry.

Data on impressions (how many times the ad was displayed), clicks (how many times an ad was clicked), click rate (clicks/impressions), engagements, engagement rate (engagements/click), total engagement rate (engagements/impressions) and cost per engagement (total USD$ incurred per engagement) were extracted from the Google Ads platform. Given that the purchasing power of each currency is different, the cost per engagement was adjusted by purchasing power parities and exchange rates published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Due to the differing time periods of the studies, these costs were then converted to 2023 prices using published inflation data for each country, to generate the effective cost per engagement (in 2023 USD).

The primary outcome measure was the total engagement rate, and the effective cost per engagement was reported as a secondary outcome. These measures allow a comparison of the overall campaign performance and relative expense per engagement (from a local payer's perspective) across the three countries.

Further, in analysing the total engagement rate, we included the health and medical industry standard metrics as a method of assessing general campaign performance. Given that the health and medical industry raw impression and conversion volumes were not available, we could calculate the raw Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) but could not conduct statistical tests comparing the health and medical industry standard metrics and country metrics. Thus, we only report the manually calculated IRR. Further, given that the cost per engagement was accumulated across different campaigns and countries, adjustment for a single country's purchasing power could not be made and thus was excluded from the analysis of the secondary outcome using effective cost per engagement.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^117QcsZb]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Results

The median daily cost in international dollars of an EAT– Lancet reference diet was estimated to be $2.84 (IQR 2.41–3.16) in 2011. The cost was larger in high-income countries ($2.66, 2.39–3.02) than in low-income countries ($2.42, 2.07–2.72), and among geographical regions, the median cost was highest in the Latin America and Caribbean region ($3.42, 3.03–3.87) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa ($2.45, 2.17–2.84), with considerable variation within regions and income groups (figure 1).

Figure 1
Cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet in 2011 international dollars, by country income levels and major regions

We used price data from the International Comparison Program to estimate the cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet in 159 countries. Cost estimates are reported in 2011 international dollars, adjusting for inflation using purchasing power parity price levels for household consumption. The size of the box indicates the IQR. The bottom and top rule marks the bottom 5th and top 5th percentiles, respectively. The vertical bar rule inside the box shows the median value for the income group or geographical region.

The food group whose quantities and prices accounted for the largest share of total cost (31.2%) was fruits and vegetables (table 2). In high-income countries, this share was on average 35.1%, in upper-middle-income countries 30.3%, in lower-middle-income countries 29.7%, and in low-income countries 26.7%. Globally the next largest cost is from legumes and nuts (18.7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15.2%), and dairy (13.2%). Adding together all animal sourced food groups (dairy, plus meat, eggs, and fish), their share of total cost was largest in low-income countries (32.8%) and smallest in upper middle-income countries (26.2%).

### Availability of cost-effectiveness studies for drugs with high Medicare part D expenditures [^116HiXQ8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

From the FDA Orange Book and the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File, we captured multiple drug characteristics. These included the year of initial FDA approval of the main ingredient, the type of application, exclusivity status and whether a broad or exact generic equivalent existed in 2016, the number of Medicare Part D 30-day standardized fills, the aggregate cost paid for Medicare Part D claims, and out-of-pocket spending by Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

The Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry includes multiple study characteristics. These include whether the study was industry sponsored; whether a time horizon was stated and, if so, its magnitude; the analytic perspective (eg, societal, health care payer, or other) as reported by the authors and assessed by the reviewers; whether costs and QALYs were discounted and at what rate(s); what cost-effectiveness thresholds were used, including upper and lower bounds; the type of sensitivity analyses tested (bounded, probabilistic, univariate, or multivariate); whether a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was included; and an overall quality rating for the study. To collect these data, each article was independently reviewed by 2 readers with training in decision analysis and CEA; after their review, the 2 readers convened for a consensus audit to resolve any potential discrepancies, and a third reader resolved disputed items.

The First and Second Panels on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine have made specific recommendations regarding how analyses should approach each of these study characteristics. On the basis of these recommendations, we considered studies to have the recommended time horizons if the time horizon was either lifetime or at least 30 years; the recommended perspectives if they took either a societal or health care payer perspective; and the recommended discounting if both costs and QALYs were discounted and at the same rate. Although there is no single recommended cost-effectiveness threshold, we considered studies to have a recommended cost-effectiveness threshold if the widely used threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained was used. In a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated whether each study used a threshold of either $50 000 or $100 000 per QALY gained. All parameters were taken directly from the registry.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^113ZarK4]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### Do dual purchasers behave differently? An analysis of purchasing data for households that buy both alcohol and tobacco in the United Kingdom [^112WThu3]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Dual purchasers of alcohol and tobacco are at increased health risk from the interacting health impacts of alcohol and tobacco use. They are also at financial risk from exposure to the dual financial cost of policies that increase alcohol and tobacco prices. Understanding whose alcohol and tobacco use exposes them to these health and financial risks is important for understanding the inequality impacts of control policies. This study explores the extent to which household spending on alcohol and tobacco combined varies between socio-economic groups and compares this with results for households which purchase only one of the commodities.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of household-level alcohol and tobacco purchasing data.

Setting

United Kingdom, 2012–17.

Participants/Cases

A total of 26021 households.

Measurements

We analysed transaction-level data from individual 14-day spending diaries in the Living Cost and Food Survey (LCFS). We used this to calculate expenditure, volumes of alcohol and tobacco purchased, and the price paid per unit of alcohol (1 unit = 8 g) and per stick of tobacco. This was compared with equivalized total expenditure and quintiles of equivalized household income. Prices were calibrated and pack sizes were imputed using empirical sales data from Nielsen/CGA to correct for reporting bias.

Findings

Dual purchasing households spent [95% confidence interval] more on alcohol and more on tobacco than their single-purchasing counterparts. In general, lower-income households spent less on both alcohol and tobacco than higher-income households. Furthermore, dual purchasing households in the lowest income group were most exposed to potential increases in price than were other income groups, with (CI = 12.41–13.15%) of their total household budget spent on alcohol and tobacco.

Conclusions

Dual purchasers of alcohol and tobacco in the United Kingdom appear to be concentrated evenly among income groups. However, dual purchasers may experience particularly large effects from pricing policies, as they spend a substantially higher proportion of their overall household expenditure on alcohol and tobacco than do households that purchase only one of the commodities.

### The costs of improving health emergency preparedness: a systematic review and analysis of multi-country studies [^116szGMN]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

We collected data using a standard form in Microsoft Excel. Its design drew on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement and a previous review of the costs and benefits of interventions aimed at major infectious disease threats. We extracted data for all costed activities; outcomes of interest included the scope and type of costed preparedness activities, the costing methods, estimated costs, and cost drivers. LC and EP independently extracted data for studies and then cross-validated the data extraction. See appendix for further information.

Data analysis

We collated information about included studies' characteristics and methods for narrative summary and adapted cost estimates for comparison and analysis. To estimate annual costs when unreported, we divided the total costs estimated in a study, including both capital and recurrent costs, by the number of years costed. In this context, capital costs are fixed/one-time expenditures such as constructing buildings, purchasing equipment, or initial training of staff. Recurrent costs include those following the initial set up of an activity, such as workers' wages or items used when conducting activities (e.g. diagnostic tests).

To estimate annual per capita costs, we divided annual costs by the total population of countries assessed by the study. If a study did not report this figure, we used estimates of the populations of included countries, at the time of study publication, from the World Bank. If a study only reported per capita costs, we estimated total costs by multiplying per capita costs by the total population of countries examined by the study.

### A brief introduction to health economics [^111J7RER]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The reality of savings needs to be considered. A new version of an operation may take 10 min less operating time, but unless that means that more operations can be done in a theatre session, or that staff hours can be reduced, there will be no real savings. Similarly, if the new procedure reduces length of hospital stay, there will be no savings unless staffing levels are reduced. Indeed, there may be an increase in costs if the capacity saved is used for additional cases. This may be good for patients, but a problem for the hospital finance directors.

Unlike drugs, devices or procedures evolve over time, and the only long-term results may be from superseded versions. The base–case analysis could assume that newer versions are as good, but then, we can explore various sensitivity analyses, assuming that the latest version is 10% better or 20% better, to see what that does to the cost per QALY.

### Cost evaluation of minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) implementation in low-and middle-income countries [^113kUtVC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

COST MODEL

We developed an Excel-based cost model to aggregate each sites' activity-specific resource cost estimates and categorized them into 1-time, initial costs (start-up and capital costs) required to be in place for a MITS program to begin and recurring per-case and annual costs to conduct MITS at each site. Costs provided in local currencies were converted to US dollars. We provide a financial accounting of these costs — that is, we did not adjust for depreciation and presented the purchase cost for these items that had been purchased recently or through the MITS Surveillance Alliance grant. We excluded costs to perform additional research activities.

The majority of cost categories required simple aggregation. Staff compensation varied by site, including with regular salaries or hourly wages, fixed incentive payments per-case, and per-diem payments for specific activities. We calculated activity-specific labor costs by activity, based on each site's reported compensation schedule. Where staff were paid hourly wages, we multiplied their wage by the number of hours they spent on an activity, whereas for salaried staff we estimated an hourly wage where appropriate. Start-up costs included some nonconsumable expenditures like equipment purchases and facility renovations that were not used exclusively for MITS. In these cases, we adjusted these costs by the utilization rate of the MITS program. Site-specific estimates were reviewed with respondents before finalizing results.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^117XXw5V]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

### Surgeon-driven variation in the cost of hip arthroscopic surgery for labral tears: a time-driven activity-based costing analysis [^115hyLGT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing

TDABC was performed as described previously, informed by guidelines established by Kaplan and Andersonand other experts. Fundamentally, the TDABC methodology calculates costs by measuring the duration of each step of the care pathway, multiplying these durations by the per-unit cost of the associated activity, and summing these labor costs with supply costs to determine the total cost. Thus, the first step in conducting this analysis is constructing process maps that capture relevant steps of the care pathway. Given our goal of exploring variation in costs between surgeons, we focused our analysis on intraoperative costs (see Appendix Table A2, available online), as they represent a significant proportion of total procedure costs (ie, ≥ 91%) and are directly influenced by surgeon decision-making and technique.

Process maps were informed by interviews with relevant clinical and administrative personnel, consultations with experts in the field of health technology assessment at Avant-garde Health, and direct observation of a representative sample of surgical cases by the study team (M.C.D. and N.J.C.). Next, the duration of each step of the process map was calculated using case-specific time stamps and subsequently multiplied by capacity cost rates to generate personnel-specific labor costs on a case-specific basis. These individual labor costs were then summed to generate total labor costs. Similarly, the quantity and purchase prices of consumables (eg, implants, sutures, dressings) were aggregated to calculate total supply costs. Labor and supply costs were combined to calculate total costs on a patient-specific basis. Cases with total costs in the upper (≥ 95th) and lower (≤ 5th) percentiles were manually reviewed for anomalies in time stamps and supply costs; cases demonstrating unreconcilable discrepancies were excluded.

Borrowing from previous literature, we focused our analysis on direct personnel labor and supply costs, as assigning indirect (eg, human resources, billing) and hospital structural (eg, rent, utilities, equipment) costs with the same degree of granularity would entail extensive modeling and introduce a significant number of confounders. Moreover, differences in indirect and structural costs are unlikely to vary between surgeons, and any measured variation would likely be driven by randomness rather than surgeon preference and technique; thus, we elected to omit these indirect costs from our analysis.

Methods for such analyses are well established, but the results need to be interpreted carefully and are subject to bias. Making decisions based on results of cost-effectiveness analyses can involve setting thresholds, but for individual patients, there needs to be disaggregation of benefits and harms included in a quality adjusted life year to ensure appropriate consideration of benefits and harms as well as personal preferences and circumstances.

### Understanding cost data collection tools to improve economic evaluations of health interventions [^113yFwNJ]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Activity logs can be a well-balanced option to collect detailed, prospective data with a reasonable level of research burden, but potential limitations remain. While not as high cost as direct observation, activity logs still come with the additional research burden as staff must complete the logs during their work day, where they may already be working at capacity, and could require training for the logs' use. And because the logs rely on multiple staff to input reliable data, results depend on individuals' agreement to participate in the data collection and their level of buy-in and effort, which can lead to missing data.

The research burden for prospective methods can be mitigated by using sample time periods for data collection rather than prospectively collecting data throughout the study period, as mentioned above. Data collection could occur during a one-time sample period (eg, every day for two consecutive weeks) or during a sample of multiple time points across the study period (eg, 1 week during the first half of the study period and 1 week in the second half, random sample of days across the study period). Careful consideration should be made when choosing a study period that will be representative of the intervention as a whole. For instance, if there is a learning curve in the uptake of new protocols, choosing a period at the beginning of the intervention might overestimate time costs. Similarly, an intervention could have varying levels of production across time that should be considered when selecting a sampling period.

### Effects of demand-side incentives in improving the utilisation of delivery services in oyam district in Northern Uganda: a quasi-experimental study [^116QSwDZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Study outcomes and cost metrics

The study outcomes included the service coverage of institutional deliveries, four ANC visits, a minimum of one PNC visit, and the proportion of women 'bypassing' local health facilities. Institutional delivery was defined as childbirth in a health facility. ANC was defined as the receipt of pregnancy care from skilled providers, while PNC was defined as care at a health facility after childbirth regardless of the place of delivery. Data on these outcomes were extracted from the ANC, delivery, and PNC registers using a standard form designed specifically for this study's data collection procedures. The form captured monthly summary data on the numbers of ANC visits, institutional deliveries, PNC visits, and referrals all disaggregated by health facility catchment areas. Baseline and endline data were collected throughout 2013 and 2014, respectively. Data on the number of outpatient visits at each participating health facility during these reference periods were also collected.

We calculated costs from the perspective of CUAMM, as the funder of and partner with the district in implementing the interventions. Thus, we did not consider the costs incurred by the users. Data on costs were obtained from the project's accounting and administrative records for the period January to December 2014. The costs included the values of direct inputs for both intervention arms. This consisted of the cost of each of the items in a baby kit, multiplied by the number of kits distributed, and the total cost of the transport vouchers distributed. Additionally, the costs included labour costs, training costs, sensitisation costs, and administrative support services, notably, the cost of transport for distributing the items and the printing services needed for transport vouchers and receipt books for baby kits. We calculated labour costs by multiplying the number of days in a week spent by drivers and social workers involved in handling vouchers and baby kits by their respective daily net salaries and then annualised the resulting amount. We conducted one joint project start-up training for two staffs from each intervention health facility. Consequently, we allocated training costs in proportion to the number of staff trained for each intervention. We also shared administrative support services costs between the two intervention arms based on the ratio of the institutional deliveries in 2014. Research costs were not included. The costs were handled in Ugandan Shillings (UGX), but for this analysis, we expressed them in US dollars (1 US$ = 2598 UGX as of June 2014). Details about the cost items are shown in Additional file 1.

### Cancer hospital stockpiles: strategizing for an efficient and sufficient inventory list of essential items [^112otqYx]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Costing

The ADU of essential items was multiplied by the lead time (days required for procurement) to calculate the quantity of the item needed for the stockpile. For laboratory investigations, the quantities of each of the primary reagents (test kits, controls, and calibrators) required to carry out the test were determined, assuming that control and calibrator liquids were changed once a day.

All costs were calculated in Pakistani Rupees (PKR) and converted to US Dollars (USD) for this manuscript. At the time of analysis, 1 USD was equivalent to 163 PKR. For costing analyses, the tender prices for the year 2020–2021, which are fixed for a year, were used. Where an item had not been tendered, the average procurement cost from March 15 to May 30, 2020, was used.

For determining the cost difference of procuring essential items as needed (emergency buying) and purchasing prepandemic (tendered), we used prices provided by the hospital's Materials Management Department. For emergency buying, the average cost of items from March 15 to May 30, 2020, was used, and for the prepandemic purchase model, the tendered price of items was used. For items that were procured for the first time during the pandemic, the actual purchase price was used in both. If there was a difference of at least 5% between the cost of sourcing materials prepandemic and emergency buying, then an additional analysis of the cost of maintaining, rotating, and storing the stockpiles was carried out to calculate the overall cost of the prepandemic model.

The hospital has a total oxygen storage capacity of 6,630.33 m³ and pays for the actual volume of oxygen consumed. A costing analysis was performed to calculate the cost of increasing the oxygen storage capacity so as to ensure supply for 15 days of COVID-19 level consumption.

Final Decision

The proposed plan was presented to the hospital's management, which decided the essential items that the hospital would consider stockpiling.

### Interpretive versus noninterpretive content in top-selling radiology textbooks: what are we teaching medical students? [^1166nyAS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

There are little data as to whether appropriate, cost effective, and safe ordering of imaging examinations are adequately taught in US medical school curricula. We sought to determine the proportion of noninterpretive content (such as appropriate ordering) versus interpretive content (such as reading a chest x-ray) in the top-selling medical student radiology textbooks.

Materials and Methods

We performed an online search to identify a ranked list of the six top-selling general radiology textbooks for medical students. Each textbook was reviewed including content in the text, tables, images, figures, appendices, practice questions, question explanations, and glossaries. Individual pages of text and individual images were semiquantitatively scored on a six-level scale as to the percentage of material that was interpretive versus noninterpretive. The predominant imaging modality addressed in each was also recorded. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.

Results

All six books had more interpretive content. On average, 1.4 pages of text focused on interpretation for every one page focused on noninterpretive content. Seventeen images/figures were dedicated to interpretive skills for every one focused on noninterpretive skills. In all books, the largest proportion of text and image content was dedicated to plain films (51.2%), with computed tomography (CT) a distant second (16%). The content on radiographs (3.1:1) and CT (1.6:1) was more interpretive than not.

Conclusions

The current six top-selling medical student radiology textbooks contain a preponderance of material teaching image interpretation compared to material teaching noninterpretive skills, such as appropriate imaging examination selection, rational utilization, and patient safety.

Travelers unlikely to visit an at-risk destination after 3 years require no further titers or boosters unless they have a subsequent risk of exposure. Immunocompromised persons should have a titer drawn 1–2 weeks after completion of the 2-dose series to ensure that the titer is ≥ 0.5 IU/mL.

### Is It cost effective to add an intraoral scanner to an oral and maxillofacial surgery practice? [^114Ak81X]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intraoral scanners (IOSs), which create digital "impressions" of dental arches, have become popular for prosthetic and orthodontic applications. Adoption in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) practices has been slower, likely because of high implementation costs and low-volume use. The purpose of this study was to evaluate costs for introduction of an IOS into an OMS practice. The authors hypothesized that digital impressions would be more efficient in time and cost compared with conventional impressions and that implementation costs would be offset within 1 year.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective study that included patients who had digital impressions during the first year after introduction of an IOS to the practice. Conventional alginate impressions obtained at the same visit were included for comparison. Variables included time for each step in each impression process, IOS experience of the operator obtaining the impression, and associated costs. Per-arch costs for each technique were calculated using time-driven activity-based costing methodology.

Results

Sixty-three digital impressions and 31 conventional impressions were included. Mean total times for digital and conventional impressions were 14.1 ± 1.3 and 19.4 ± 4.0 minutes per arch, respectively. On a per-patient basis (2 arches for digital impressions and 4 arches for conventional impressions because of the inability to create duplicate stone models from each alginate impression), total impression times were 24.8 ± 2.7 minutes for digital and 67.2 ± 14.8 minutes for conventional impressions. Total calculated costs for digital and conventional impressions were $21.42 and $29.40 per arch and $37.66 and $102.10 per patient, respectively. In a practice with 2 patients for impressions per working day (500 per year), it would take 1.04 years to offset the purchase of the IOS; with 5 sets of impressions per day (1,250 per year), it would take 5 months.

Conclusion

Digital impressions are more efficient and cost effective than standard impressions, and implementation costs can be offset within the first year.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^113Djxag]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic cost assessment within stewardship programs should be tracked based on use rather than purchasing data and should include program and system-level costs. We recommend measuring antibiotic costs based on prescriptions or administrations instead of purchasing data (good practice recommendation). ASPs result in cost savings for facilities. Antibiotic costs should be measured based on prescriptions or administrations instead of purchasing data and normalized to account for patient census (eg, antibiotic cost per patient-day). Program costs (eg, salary for stewardship personnel) and adjustment for inflation or standardizing costs across years should be considered. Analyses that measure the effects of an intervention over time should compare actual costs after the initiation of the intervention vs projected costs in the absence of the intervention, as direct cost reductions tend to plateau. More robust analyses include expenditures beyond drug acquisition such as those for drug administration, therapeutic drug monitoring, and toxicities, and if resources are available, programs should analyze broader effects on budgets, such as total hospitalization costs.

### Economic evaluation of cost and time required for a platform trial vs conventional trials [^111ydA9x]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

When the cost and time were broken down to the initial interventions (interventions 1–5) that were available at the beginning vs subsequent interventions (interventions 6–10) that could be added to the platform or be evaluated independently, we still observed higher cost and duration in conventional trial scenarios. For the evaluation of the initial interventions, scenario 2 had a smaller magnitude of relative differences against the platform trial in both cost and time than scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial cost for the scenario 2 was 28.0% (5.5%-50.1%) and 158.4% (136.9%-184.1%) for scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial duration was also smaller for scenario 2 (36.1% [30.8%-41.5%]) than scenario 3 (526.3% [429.4%-657.9%])

For the subsequent interventions, we assumed that they could either be added into the platform trial or be evaluated independently using 2-group trials in either of the 2 conventional trial scenarios (Figure 4). Compared with the platform trial, the median (IQR) increase in costs for conventional trials was 12.6% (2.1%-22.6%), and 226.7% (206.8%-246.7%) for trial duration. The magnitude of the relative differences in cost and time were smaller for the subsequent interventions than the initial interventions because the platform trial had fewer active groups after starting off as a 6-group trial.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Wz267]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 — cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives delineate cost components by perspective: Health care costs paid by third-party payers and costs paid out-of-pocket by patients are included across Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", and Full Societal; patient-time costs, unpaid caregiver-time costs, transportation costs, and productivity are included under "Modified Societal" and "Full Societal"; and cross-sector items such as social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental are included only under Full Societal. The footnote adds that analysts "should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective", that a "'modified' societal perspective includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy", and that "An Impact Inventory can aid in communicating and discussing these limitations".

### Microcosting study of genomic profiling for precision cancer medicine: application from the national infrastructure for precision diagnostics in Norway [^112DTraG]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). Medium credibility.

Total consumable and personnel costs per batch were calculated by multiplying the unit price or hourly wage per profession with the number of units or the working time in hours needed per batch, considering the batch size and whether resource use was variable or step fixed. Dividing the total costs per batch by the batch size resulted in the costs per sample. Equipment costs were calculated as annual capital costs considering the purchase price, an interest rate of 4% per year, the expected lifetime of the equipment, plus annual maintenance costs and divided by the yearly number of samples. Costs for the laboratory space were calculated on the basis of the square meter area multiplied with internal per square meter costs from hospital guidelines and divided by the yearly number of samples. A percentage weighting for cost allocation to other steps or use by other departments was incorporated. The software costs per sample were calculated as the weighted annual software license costs, again using a weight factor informed by internal experts for cost allocation, divided by the yearly number of samples. As part of software costs, costs for storage were calculated by multiplying the average data volume per patient sample with the storage costs per gigabyte on a server for sensitive data, assuming a storage time frame of 10 years.
