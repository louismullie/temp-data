## Question

Common symptoms for chiari malformation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of Chiari malformation type 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how CM1 is defined clinically and radiographically. Then, I should verify which symptoms are most prevalent and how they cluster. Next, I will examine symptom modifiers such as syringomyelia and age. After that, I should check diagnostic correlations and guideline-based recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, evidence-grounded summary while correcting any overstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the condition framework so I don't anchor on a single definition. CM1 is characterized by caudal descent of one or both cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum with resultant crowding that can impair CSF flow, compress the cervicomedullary junction, and associate with syringomyelia; although a ≥ 5 mm threshold is commonly cited, I should be careful because degree of descent alone does not predict symptomatology and there are "borderline" cases and anatomic subtypes with variable posterior fossa crowdedness, so a strict cutoff can be misleading if taken as absolute without clinical correlation [^115iKNVc] [^113XdbAX] [^1156fnGN].

> Now, about headaches being the most frequent symptom, I initially want to call the Valsalva-induced "cough headache" pathognomonic, but wait, let me verify before I overstate that claim; typical cough headache is strongly characteristic and prognostically informative, yet atypical phenotypes such as migraine-like and tension-type-like headaches are also common, and causality with CM1 is not always clear, so calling it pathognomonic is too strong and I should correct that to "characteristic" rather than definitive for diagnosis; pooled data suggest headaches in roughly three quarters of CM1 cohorts with a substantial atypical component, and cine CSF studies link occipital headache more often to obstructed flow than frontal/generalized patterns, which supports careful semiology and imaging correlation [^111oafQE] [^111ZP6p9] [^116o6p65].

> Next, I should review associated pain and vestibular-ocular manifestations because they often travel with headache. Neck or suboccipital pain is frequent, and vestibular symptoms such as dizziness, imbalance, gait disturbance, and nystagmus, including downbeat nystagmus, are described; auditory and otologic complaints like aural fullness, tinnitus, fluctuating hearing loss, and episodic vertigo are also reported and can mimic primary otologic disorders, so I need to keep a broad differential and avoid premature closure [^115iKNVc] [^111ZP6p9] [^111Tjo3B].

> I need to check sleep-related breathing issues because they can be early or overlooked. Central sleep apnea is a recognized manifestation and, while obstructive sleep apnea has been reported, it is less consistently linked; hold on, I should verify guideline posture on routine sleep studies — CNS guidance indicates insufficient evidence to obtain routine studies in patients without sleep symptoms, so targeted evaluation based on clinical cues is the prudent approach [^114aSZ5f] [^111c6TY6].

> Let me consider motor and sensory deficits, especially when a syrinx is present, because that shifts the phenotype. Syringomyelia can cause dissociated sensory loss with pain/temperature more affected than touch, hand intrinsic weakness and atrophy, and a cape-like distribution of deficits; neuropathic itch is a notable but rare symptom that may resolve after decompression; while I first thought lower-extremity focal deficits were typical, wait, I should correct that — focal foot drop is rare and usually reflects extensive syringomyelia, underscoring the need to image the entire neuraxis when the clinical picture doesn't fit a peripheral pattern [^113CbLR3] [^114LQVPA] [^112YXX1S] [^113CbLR3].

> I should confirm cranial nerve and autonomic features, particularly in pediatrics, without overgeneralizing. Dysphagia, lower cranial nerve dysfunction, urinary frequency, and respiratory irregularities have been reported, but their prevalence is variable and often tied to associated brainstem or syringobulbia involvement; in children, atypical presentations including swallowing difficulty, behavioral or academic changes, and abnormal movements with oropharyngeal dysfunction can occur, so I need to maintain diagnostic vigilance while excluding more common etiologies [^115iKNVc] [^111UJUE4] [^113TTVUN] [^1154mDMr].

> Next, I will examine how age and syringomyelia modify presentation and natural history. Adults more often describe classic Valsalva headache and neck pain, whereas children may present atypically and are frequently diagnosed incidentally; importantly, many incidentally detected or minimally symptomatic cases remain stable without intervention, which should temper aggressive management in the absence of clear indications while ensuring surveillance for those with syrinx or evolving deficits [^1148uoZd] [^112AiWJZ] [^115M1dpn].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic and risk-stratification guidance so I don't miss key predictors. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice, and CNS guidelines recommend considering measurements such as clivoaxial angle and pB-C2 to anticipate craniocervical instability; they also advise further brain and whole-spine imaging to identify hydrocephalus or spine syrinx when CM1 is diagnosed, while noting insufficient evidence for routine flexion-extension films, routine sleep studies, or routine swallowing studies in the absence of corresponding symptoms, which reinforces symptom-directed testing [^113XdbAX] [^1141fALQ] [^115QmjMm] [^111c6TY6] [^112Dgyt3].

> I need to ensure management pearls tied to symptoms are accurate. For symptomatic patients, particularly those with strain-related occipital or suboccipital headache and imaging correlates, foramen magnum decompression is guideline-supported and tends to improve typical cough headache reliably, whereas atypical headache phenotypes improve less and may reflect primary headache comorbidity; in the presence of a syrinx, tonsillar reduction at the time of decompression can be considered if syrinx or symptoms persist, and postoperative monitoring with a readiness for additional intervention at 6–12 months is appropriate when radiographic improvement is lacking [^116NxNE2] [^114E1MZL] [^115ucpUm] [^115nj5fJ].

> Before concluding, I should double-check counseling points to avoid unnecessary restrictions or screening. CNS recommendations advise against routine activity restrictions in asymptomatic CM1 without syrinx and against prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients, and they recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic siblings or relatives; as a result, individualized care hinges on symptom correlation, the presence of syringomyelia, and objective radiographic risk markers rather than the degree of tonsillar descent alone [^111W6wuh] [^113xCefD] [^113xtsu4].

> Putting this together, the common CM1 symptom profile centers on headaches, especially Valsalva-induced cough headache, neck pain, vestibular complaints such as dizziness and imbalance, visual and ocular motor disturbances including downbeat nystagmus, sleep-disordered breathing with central sleep apnea more firmly recognized than obstructive, and in syringomyelia, dissociated sensory loss and hand weakness with occasional neuropathic itch; rare focal deficits like unilateral foot drop do occur and should prompt full craniospinal imaging, and many individuals remain minimally symptomatic or stable, so clinical-radiographic concordance is essential to guide testing and intervention rather than relying on tonsillar descent thresholds alone [^111oafQE] [^111ZP6p9] [^114aSZ5f] [^113CbLR3] [^114LQVPA] [^115iKNVc].

---

The most common symptoms of Chiari malformation are **suboccipital headache** (often Valsalva-provoked) [^111ZP6p9], neck pain, dizziness/vertigo, and balance problems [^115iKNVc]. Patients may also have **sensory disturbances** (numbness, tingling) [^113CbLR3], limb weakness [^114yEXCb], and coordination difficulties, especially if syringomyelia is present [^112YXX1S]. Less frequent symptoms include visual changes [^115iKNVc], tinnitus, hearing loss [^111Tjo3B], dysphagia, and sleep-disordered breathing such as central sleep apnea [^114aSZ5f]. Symptom severity varies with the degree of tonsillar herniation [^111ZP6p9], CSF flow obstruction [^116o6p65], and associated conditions like syringomyelia or hydrocephalus [^1141fALQ].

---

## Headache and neck pain

**Suboccipital headache** [^111oafQE] is the hallmark symptom — typically sharp or pressure-like — and worsens with coughing [^11693naP], sneezing, laughing, or Valsalva maneuvers [^111ZP6p9]. **Neck pain** [^111ZP6p9] often accompanies the headache, is localized to the upper cervical region, and may radiate to the shoulders or upper back.

---

## Neurological symptoms

- **Sensory disturbances**: Numbness, tingling, or paresthesia, particularly in the upper extremities [^114yEXCb], often associated with syringomyelia [^113CbLR3] [^112YXX1S].

- **Motor weakness**: Limb weakness, clumsiness [^112YXX1S], or coordination difficulties, frequently linked to syringomyelia [^114yEXCb] or spinal cord compression [^114LQVPA].

- **Balance and coordination problems**: Ataxia, unsteady gait, and dizziness or vertigo [^1151up6R] due to cerebellar involvement [^115iKNVc].

---

## Cranial nerve involvement

- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision, double vision (diplopia) [^115iKNVc], or nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).

- **Auditory symptoms**: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, and aural fullness [^111Tjo3B].

- **Swallowing difficulties**: Dysphagia, choking, or aspiration due to lower cranial nerve compression [^115iKNVc].

---

## Autonomic and respiratory symptoms

**Sleep-disordered breathing** [^111c6TY6] commonly manifests as central sleep apnea [^114aSZ5f], snoring, and respiratory irregularities, particularly in pediatric patients [^111UJUE4]. **Autonomic dysfunction** may cause episodes of dizziness and fainting or syncope due to impaired autonomic regulation [^115iKNVc].

---

## Associated conditions and complications

- **Syringomyelia**: Fluid-filled cysts within the spinal cord [^114yEXCb], causing progressive neurological deficits, sensory loss, and motor weakness [^112YXX1S] [^113CbLR3].

- **Hydrocephalus**: Accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure, headaches, and visual disturbances [^1141fALQ].

- **Scoliosis**: Abnormal curvature of the spine, particularly in pediatric patients [^115iKNVc].

---

## Symptom variability and progression

Symptoms vary widely among patients and are influenced by the degree of tonsillar herniation [^111ZP6p9], cerebrospinal fluid flow obstruction, and associated conditions such as **syringomyelia** or **hydrocephalus** [^1141fALQ]. Some patients remain asymptomatic [^112AiWJZ], whereas others develop progressive neurological deterioration.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: a case report and review of literature [^114yEXCb]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Identification of the exact cause is the most important component of the management of foot drop. Causes are diverse and consist of a broad range of pathologies; however, lesions in the peripheral nervous system, including common peroneal neuropathy, L5 radiculopathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, hereditary neuropathies, mononeuritis multiplex, and anterior horn cell diseases, predominate. Rarely, central lesions, including brain tumors and tuberculomas, can cause foot drop. In this report, we have described an extremely rare presentation of a central lesion — Chiari malformation type 1 — presenting as unilateral foot drop.

Chiari malformations refer to a spectrum of congenital hindbrain abnormalities affecting structural relationships between the cerebellum, brainstem, the upper cervical cord, and the bony cranial base. Chiari malformation type 1 is the most common form, which usually presents with headache, neck pain, urinary frequency, and progressive lower-extremity spasticity during adolescence or adulthood. It is characterized by displacement of cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum, resulting in impaction of the foramen magnum, compression of the cervicomedullary junction by the herniating tonsils, and interruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the region. Disordered CSF flow may result in syringomyelia, which usually presents with "central cord symptoms" — numbness followed by the development of atrophy and weakness in the upper extremities.

### Sleep-disordered breathing in Chiari malformation type 1 [^114aSZ5f]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Type 1 Chiari malformation is defined as an elongation of the cerebellar tonsils more than 6 mm below the foramen magnum. Central sleep apnea is a well-recognized sign and can be an initial presentation of this malformation. Obstructive sleep apnea is not a widely recognized sign of Chiari type 1 malformation, though there have been a few case reports. We present a 13-year-old girl who presented at our respiratory clinic with excessive nighttime snoring. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a Chiari type 1 malformation requiring decompression. We emphasize the importance of including cervicomedullary junction disorders in the differential diagnosis of apnea and review the literature concerning mixed apneas and obstructive sleep apneas in Chiari type 1 malformation.

### Chiari malformation presenting as a focal motor deficit. Report of two cases [^112YXX1S]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations may present with a wide range of symptoms and signs. Nevertheless, focal foot weakness as a presentation of a Chiari malformation has not been described in the pediatric neurosurgical literature. Two children with Chiari malformations and holocord syringomyelia presented with manifestations of a supposed isolated lumbar radiculopathy. Neurological deficits completely resolved after decompressive suboccipital craniectomy and cervical laminectomy. These cases emphasize the importance of imaging the entire craniospinal axis and the avoidance of therapeutic intervention specifically aimed at a radiculopathic process when initial imaging fails to show a structural abnormality at the spinal level of deficit.

The possible pathophysiological origins for this unusual presentation are discussed. Based on the experience gained with these patients, recommendations are made regarding the diagnostic workup and management of this entity in children presenting with focal deficits that are not supported by imaging of the affected root levels. Chiari malformations may rarely masquerade as lower motor and sensory deficits, and appropriate treatment may result in excellent recovery of function.

### Otorhinolaryngologic manifestations in Chiari malformation [^1151up6R]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2002). Low credibility.

The Chiari malformation causes herniation of the cerebellar amygdalae through the foramen magnum, resulting in the descent of the brain stem and/or traction on the lower cranial pairs. It is important for otolaryngologists to recognize Chiari malformations as part of the differential diagnosis of balance disorders because patients may initially exhibit symptoms related to the vestibular system, including ataxia, nystagmus, or vertigo. We report two cases.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^111ZP6p9]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Chiari I malformation (CIM) is not made clinically but by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is defined by a downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils ≥ 5 mm through the foramen magnum. This type of cerebellar tonsillar descent occurs in approximately 0.1% of adults, predominantly affects women, and is often associated with syringomyelia and, in some cases, scoliosis.

Symptoms tend to begin in adulthood with the typical paroxysmal 'cough headache' — induced or exacerbated by laughing, coughing, or the Valsalva maneuver and lasting seconds to a few minutes. However, migrainous headache with classical accompanying symptoms, such as sensory phobia or nausea, and tension-type-like (TTH) headache, have also been described as being associated with CIM. In addition, not all patients with CIM present with headaches, and symptoms like vertigo, dizziness, and gait disturbances have also been described. Less frequently, patients have neurological signs or oculomotor disturbances such as downbeat nystagmus. Diagnostically, MRI of the craniocervical junction is the method of choice, showing a descent of one or both cerebellar tonsils from the McRae (basion-opisthion) line, with or without accompanying syringomyelia.

### Correlation of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics and headache in Chiari I malformation [^116o6p65]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The management of patients with a Chiari I malformation who present with headaches alone remains unclear. This study examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics of Chiari I malformation patients who presented with headaches alone, aiming to identify headache types associated with CSF flow obstruction versus those that may be unrelated to Chiari I malformations.

- **Methods**: Preoperative cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical junction was prospectively performed in 33 patients presenting with headaches alone and a Chiari I malformation (tonsillar ectopia > 5 mm below the foramen magnum). Headaches were classified as frontal, occipital, or generalized. CSF flow dynamics were then compared with the presenting symptomatology. A subgroup of 17 patients underwent surgical decompression of the Chiari I malformations.

- **Results**: Patients with frontal or generalized headaches were 10-fold less likely to demonstrate obstructed CSF flow (odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–0.52) and 8-fold less likely to have tonsillar descent greater than 7 mm (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.62) compared with patients with occipital headaches. Adjusting for degree of tonsillar herniation in multivariate analysis, frontal and generalized headaches remained independently associated with nonobstructed CSF flow pathological findings, whereas occipital headaches remained associated with obstructed CSF flow independent of tonsil location (odds ratio, 5.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–34.28). In the surgical group, all patients' results were incomplete.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: a case report and review of literature [^113FKq7D]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Foot drop is a disabling neurological condition which requires careful evaluation to identify the cause. The differential diagnosis for foot drop is broad; however, it mostly involves disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Here, we present an extremely rare central cause of foot drop in a child which, if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.

### The natural history of the Chiari Type I anomaly [^112AiWJZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Since the advent of MR imaging, an increasing number of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients have been diagnosed with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). The decision of whether or not to operate is more difficult in these patients than in those with clear symptoms because of the lack of information about the natural course of this disease.

- **Methods**: The authors report on their experience in a series of 22 patients with CM-I who were evaluated at the authors' institution, and for whom a conservative approach to treatment was adopted. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 16 years (mean 6.3 years) at diagnosis. Neuroradiological and complete clinical examinations were performed in all patients 6 months after the first observation and every year thereafter. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 19 years (mean 5.9 years).

- **Results**: Chiari malformation Type I was incidentally detected on MR images in 11 of the 22 patients. The remaining 11 patients had minimal clinical signs at presentation that were not regarded as necessitating immediate surgical treatment. Seventeen patients (77.3%) showed progressive improvement in their symptoms or remained asymptomatic at the last follow-up, whereas 5 patients (22.7%) experienced worsening, which was mild in 2 cases and required surgical correction in the remaining 3 cases. On MR imaging, a mild reduction in tonsillar herniation was appreciated in 4 patients (18.18%), with complete spontaneous resolution in 1 of these. In 16 patients, tonsillar herniation remained stable during follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: The authors' data confirm the c

### Chiari malformation in children [^114vdcTU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is often found incidentally. However, patients with symptoms or signs referable to CM1 or an associated syrinx will likely benefit from surgical intervention. Patients who are not symptomatic from CM1 at presentation are unlikely to become symptomatic at follow-up.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^1154mDMr]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Chiari type 1 malformation, which causes prolapse of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, is detected in 25–50% of children with XLH using cranial MRI or CT. Most cases are asymptomatic, but compression of the lower brainstem and upper cervical cord might cause symptoms and/or result in syringomyelia requiring surgical correction. Symptoms can include occipital or neck pain exacerbated by Valsalva manoeuvres, peripheral motor and/or sensory defects, clumsiness, hyporeflexia or hyperreflexia, respiratory irregularities, central apnoeas, and lower cranial nerve dysfunction.

### Isolated unilateral trismus as a presentation of Chiari malformation: Case report [^1157CfVM]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old boy presented with an inability to open his jaw for 6 weeks, leading to significant weight loss. Despite a comprehensive medical and radiological evaluation, the results were negative, except for the detection of Type I Chiari malformation, with cerebellar tonsils extending 12 mm below the level of the foramen magnum. The patient underwent Chiari decompression surgery, resulting in a significant improvement in his ability to open his mouth, allowing him to resume a regular diet. Postoperative MRI showed nearly complete resolution of the syringobulbia. According to the authors, this is the first reported case of isolated trismus resulting from Chiari malformation with syringobulbia.

### Chiari I malformation with or without syringomyelia and pregnancy: Case studies and review of the literature [^113JLopR]. American Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Women with Chiari I malformation, with or without syringomyelia, are of particular concern because of the potential risk of increased intracranial pressure during pregnancy and delivery. The following questions are most often asked in the clinical setting: Is it safe to have a planned pregnancy? Will the symptoms become worse or recur during pregnancy, and will the baby be normal?

Seven patients with Chiari I malformation, with and without syringomyelia, submitted checklists of self-reported symptoms experienced during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum. None of the patients reported a significant increase or recurrence of Chiari-related symptoms during delivery or postpartum. Four of the women had epidural anesthesia for delivery and reported no related symptoms. This series represents a small number of women with Chiari I malformation who had uncomplicated pregnancy, labor, and delivery.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^111nBLHB]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

**Clinical implications**: Migrainous and TTH-like headaches can be found in Chiari I malformation, but causality remains unclear. Occipital decompression is effective for headache relief, particularly in patients with typical cough headache. However, migrainous and TTH-like headaches respond less well to surgery.

### Brainstem hypertrophy, acquired Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus: Diagnostic dilemma [^111toYsn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

This 18-year-old woman presented with symptoms of right upper-extremity ataxia and imaging evidence of syringomyelia and an acquired Chiari malformation following a previous suboccipital decompression for cerebellar hemorrhage. The patient underwent posterior fossa reexploration to detether any adhesions and release scar tissue in the fourth ventricular outlet. Her symptoms of syringomyelia resolved, but she then developed symptoms of lethargy, confusion, and amnesia in addition to ataxia. Repeat neural axis imaging revealed resolution of the syrinx but prominent brainstem hypertrophy. Eventually, the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulted in the resolution of both symptoms and brainstem hypertrophy. In the present article, the authors elaborate on this first reported case of a reversible brainstem hypertrophy responsive to CSF shunting.

### Surgical treatment of Chiari I malformation: Indications and approaches [^112PpnEX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation is a well-described entity characterized by hindbrain herniation through the foramen magnum. Although the exact origin of congenital Chiari I malformation is unknown, it appears to be caused by a mismatch between the volume of the posterior fossa neural elements and the posterior fossa cranial content. Several theories have been proposed to describe the resultant pathophysiology of this mismatch. It is clear, however, that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow and velocity play a role in the symptoms and signs associated with this disorder. The authors will review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for patients with Chiari I malformation.

### Resolution of a focal pruritic rash following neurosurgical decompression in an adolescent with Chiari I and syringomyelia [^114LQVPA]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Chiari I malformation (Chiari I) is defined by the downward displacement of one or both cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum of the skull, with crowding altering cerebrospinal fluid flow. It can be associated with the development of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, known as syringomyelia. Neurological deficits or symptoms can occur at the level of anatomic involvement of syringomyelia.

- **Case presentation**: A young man presented to the dermatology clinic for the evaluation of a pruritic rash. Recognizing a unique left "cape-like" distribution of neuropathic itch leading to prurigo nodularis, he was referred for further evaluation by neurology in the local emergency department. After additional history and neurological examination, a magnetic resonance imaging confirmed Chiari I with an associated syringobulbia and a syrinx extending to T10/11 of the spinal cord. Anteriorly, the syrinx extended into the left parenchyma of his spinal cord involving the dorsal horn, a lesion explaining his neuropathic itch. The sensation of itch and rash resolved after posterior fossa craniectomy and C1 laminectomy with duraplasty.

- **Conclusion**: Neuropathic itch, in addition to pain, can be a symptom of Chiari I with syringomyelia. Focal pruritus without an obvious cutaneous trigger should prompt providers to consider a central neurological pathology. While many patients with Chiari I are asymptomatic, the presence of neurological deficits and syringomyelia are indications for neurosurgical evaluation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chiari malformation, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the CNS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of the clivoaxial angle, pB-C2, or C-C2 sagittal vertebral alignment. These measurements can predict future craniocervical instability and the need for surgical stabilization in patients with Chiari malformation type 1.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^111HGwh5]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: The main results of the present study showed that almost half of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) patients with headache did not present with the typical cough headache but rather with migrainous (29.3%) or tension-type headache (TTH) phenotypes. After foramen magnum decompression, headache improvement was most noticeable in patients with typical cough headache, with less improvement observed in those with migrainous and TTH-like headaches.

Patient characteristics aligned with those documented in previous studies, except for age, which was higher in our total population (43.9 years). Similar to Batzdorf's findings, vertigo and dizziness were the second-most prevalent symptoms, despite earlier studies identifying sensorimotor deficits as more common.

Typical cough headache was detected in 51.2% of our headache sample, compared to 63% in Berretta et al. and 87% in Curone et al. Curone et al. researched headache semiology in 201 patients with CIM, revealing 28.8% meeting migraine criteria. In our study, 29% of headache patients met migraine criteria. Interestingly, 61% of our patients with headache exhibited at least one possibly migraine-related symptom (such as sensory phobias, nausea, or vomiting), compared to 38% in Curone et al. However, other studies reported a lower frequency of migraine phenotype in CIM patients. For instance, Kaplan et al. found that 15.1% of 73 CIM patients had migraine headaches. Furthermore, TTH was observed in 19.5% of our headache population, similar to the 12.0% reported in a study by Pascual et al. With regard to medication overuse, 24% of the headache patients in our study met the criteria for medication overuse.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Symptoms [^113xCefD]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Chiari malformation, specifically with respect to asymptomatic patients, the 2023 CNS guidelines recommend against performing prophylactic surgery in patients with asymptomatic Chiari malformation type 1 without syrinx. It is important to recognize that there is a small percentage of patients who may develop new or worsening symptoms in the future.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^115h61xQ]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Typical cough-induced headache remains the mainstay of the clinical manifestation in CIM, but atypical headaches accounted for almost half of our CIM cohort. Incidental findings in imaging studies performed in primary headache patients might contribute to this. In cases with a typical cough headache, surgical decompression is effective for CIM-related headache treatment. Although migrainous and tension-type headaches (TTH) also improved after surgery, the effect was smaller and should be compared to the natural course of primary headache disorders in future studies. The present results may be useful for counseling patients with CIM regarding surgery according to their headache type and emphasize that careful history taking and, where appropriate, involvement of a neurologist, are important to determine the best therapy for a given patient with CIM.

### Two distinct populations of Chiari I malformation based on presence or absence of posterior fossa crowdedness on magnetic resonance imaging [^1156fnGN]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

A subset of patients with Chiari I malformation demonstrate patent subarachnoid spaces around the cerebellum, indicating that reduced posterior fossa volume alone does not account for tonsillar descent. The authors distinguish two subsets of Chiari I malformation patients based on the degree of "posterior fossa crowdedness" on MRI.

- **Methods**: Two of the coauthors independently reviewed the preoperative MR images of 49 patients with Chiari I malformation and categorized the posterior fossa as "spacious" or "crowded". Volumetric analysis of posterior fossa structures was then performed using open-source DICOM software. The preoperative clinical and imaging features of the two groups were compared.

- **Results**: The posterior fossae of 25 patients were classified as spacious and 20 as crowded by both readers; 4 were incongruent. The volumes of the posterior fossa compartment, posterior fossa tissue, and hindbrain (posterior fossa tissue including herniated tonsils) were statistically similar between the patients with spacious and crowded subtypes (p = 0.33, p = 0.17, p = 0.20, respectively). However, patients in the spacious and crowded subtypes demonstrated significant differences in the ratios of posterior fossa tissue to compartment volumes as well as hindbrain to compartment volumes (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0004, respectively). The average age at surgery was 29.2 ± 19.3 years (mean ± SD) and 21.9 ± 14.9 years for spacious and crowded subtypes, respectively (p = 0.08). Syringomyelia was more prevalent in the crowded subtype (50% vs 28%, p = 0.11).

- **Conclusions**: The authors' study highlights significant differences in the anatomical features of Chiari I malformation subtypes, indicating potential implications for clinical management and surgical decision-making based on MRI findings.

### Acute deterioration in occult Chiari malformation following missile spinal trauma. Case report [^113skWbJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with Chiari malformation (CM) Type I typically experience chronic, slowly progressive symptoms. Rarely, however, do they suffer acute neurological deterioration following an iatrogenic decrease in caudal cerebrospinal fluid pressure due to, for example, a lumbar puncture. To our knowledge, acute neurological deterioration following missile spinal injury in CM has not been previously described.

The authors report on a 16-year-old girl who was shot in the abdomen and lumbar spine. Although neurologically intact on initial workup, she developed precipitous quadriplegia and apnea in a delayed fashion. Tonsillar herniation with medullary compression and cerebellar infarction was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging. Suboccipital decompression resulted in significant neurological improvement. Well-formed tonsillar ectopia diagnosed at surgery suggested a preexisting CM. The authors conclude that missile spinal trauma can precipitate medullary compression and acute neurological decline, especially in patients with preexisting tonsillar ectopia. Immediate operative decompression to relieve impaction at the cervicomedullary junction can result in significant neurological recovery.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: Working group on craniosynostosis [^116CdKM9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

- **Chiari I malformation**:

- **Basic questions**:
	What is the prevalence of Chiari I malformation in the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis? What screening method (type and frequency) is indicated to timely detect Chiari I malformation? How to prevent or treat this associated pathology?

- **Introduction**:
	The risk of Chiari I malformation widely varies between the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis. The prevalence, causes, consequences, and need for preventive treatment are largely unclear — and even the definition is not unambiguous. Chiari I malformation is best demonstrated using MRI scanning. The optimal frequency of scanning for the different types of craniosynostosis, however, is not known, and it is not clear what treatment is indicated — and when.

### Chiari type I malformation: Presenting as chronic cough in older children [^116F7516]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

To highlight an unusual cause of chronic cough, we present two cases of chronic cough in older children referred to a pediatric otolaryngology outpatient clinic with persistent symptoms despite extensive previous workup and treatment. Cranial neuropathy was identified in each case. As a result, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, revealing Chiari type I malformation. In each case, surgical decompression provided symptom improvement. Chronic cough is a rare presenting symptom in children with Chiari type I malformation. We emphasize the significance of awareness for unusual cases of cough to aid in the correct identification and treatment in children.

### Shunt malfunction causing acute neurological deterioration in 2 patients with previously asymptomatic Chiari malformation type I. Report of two cases [^1154mBZx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). High credibility.

Patients with symptomatic Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) typically exhibit a chronic, slowly progressive disease course with the evolution of symptoms. However, some authors have reported acute neurological deterioration in the setting of CM-I and acquired Chiari malformations. Although brainstem dysfunction has been documented in patients with CM-II and hydrocephalus or shunt malfunction, to the authors' knowledge, only one report describes ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction causing neurological deterioration in a patient with CM-I exists.

The authors report on their experience with the treatment of previously asymptomatic CM-I in two children who experienced quite different manifestations of acute neurological deterioration secondary to VP shunt malfunction. Presumably, VP shunt malfunction created a positive rostral pressure gradient across a stenotic foramen magnum, resulting in tetraparesis from foramen magnum syndrome in one patient and acute ataxia and cranial nerve deficits from syringobulbia in the other. Although urgent shunt revisions yielded partial recovery of neurological function in both patients, marked improvement occurred only after posterior fossa decompression.

### Pediatric and adult Chiari malformation Type I surgical series 1965–2013: a review of demographics, operative treatment, and outcomes [^112GgjqN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a hindbrain disorder associated with elongation of the cerebellar tonsils, which descend below the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. It occurs in both children and adults. Clinical symptoms mainly develop from alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the foramen magnum and the common subsequent development of syringomyelia.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed English-language reports of pediatric, adult, and combined (adult and pediatric) surgical series of patients with CM-I published from 1965 through August 31, 2013, to investigate the following:
	- Geographical distribution of reports
	- Demographics of patients
	- Follow-up lengths
	- Study durations
	- Spectrum and frequency of surgical techniques
	- Outcomes for neurological status, syrinx, and headache
	- Frequency and scope of complications
	- Mortality rates
	- Differences between pediatric and adult populations

Research and inclusion criteria were defined, and all series that contained at least 4 cases and all publications with sufficient data for analysis were included.

- **Results**: The authors identified 145 operative series of patients with CM-I, primarily from the United States and Europe, and categorized patient ages into one of three categories: adult (> 18 years of age; 27% of the cases), pediatric (≤ 18 years of age; 30%), or unknown (43%). Most series (76%) were published in the previous 21 years. The median number of patients in the series was 31. The mean duration of the studies was 10 years, and the mean follow-up time was 43 months.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: A case report and review of literature [^115RVRZw]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Foot drop is a disabling clinical condition with multiple causes, requiring detailed evaluation to identify the exact etiology. Here, we report an extremely rare cause of foot drop in a child, which, if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.

- **Case presentation**: A 6-year-old girl presented with difficulty in walking and left-sided foot drop for a 1-month duration. On examination, she had reduced muscle power in dorsiflexors and plantar flexors, and diminished knee and absent ankle jerk on the left side. Sensory loss was noted in the L4 and L5 dermatomes on the left side. The superficial abdominal reflex was absent on the left side while preserved on the right. Nerve conduction and electromyography revealed a nerve root or spinal cord cause for the foot drop, prompting an MRI of the spine and brain, which revealed Chiari malformation type 1 with a holocord syrinx extending from the cervicomedullary junction to the conus medullaris.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis for foot drop and the value of a complete neurological examination, including superficial reflexes, in arriving at a diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis led to early neurosurgical referral and intervention, which is an important prognostic factor.

### Improvement in brainstem auditory evoked potentials after suboccipital decompression in patients with Chiari I malformations [^111SKQLv]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment for patients with symptoms related to Chiari I malformation remains controversial. Although a suboccipital decompression with duraplasty is most commonly performed, there may be a subset of patients who improve in response to bone decompression alone. In an initial attempt to identify such patients, we performed a continuous study of intraoperative brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in patients undergoing a standard decompression with duraplasty and compared conduction times at three different time points: 1) baseline while the patient is supine (before positioning); 2) immediately after opening of the bone and release of the atlantooccipital membrane (that is, the dural band); and 3) after opening of the dura mater.

- **Methods**: Eleven children and young adults (mean age 9.8 years) with symptoms related to Chiari I malformation underwent suboccipital decompression and duraplasty with intraoperative monitoring of BAEPs and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). Six patients (55%) had associated syringomyelia. At baseline, the I to V interpeak latency (IPL) for both sides (total 21 BAEPs) was 4.19 ± 0.22 msec (mean ± standard deviation). After complete bone decompression and before the dura mater was opened, the I to V IPL decreased to 4.03 ± 0.25 msec (p = 0.0005). When the dura was opened, however, no further decrease in the I to V IPL was detected (4.03 ± 0.25 msec; p = 0.6). The SSEPs remained stable throughout the procedure.

- **Conclusions**: In children and young adults undergoing suboccipital decompression with duraplasty for Chiari I malformations, intraoperative BAEP monitoring showed a decrease in I to V IPL after bone decompression, but no further change after dural opening. This suggests that bone decompression alone may be sufficient for improving certain electrophysiological parameters in this patient subset.

### Chiari type II malformation: Past, present, and future [^115qHEmU]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

The Chiari Type II malformation (CM II) is a unique hindbrain herniation found only in patients with myelomeningocele and is the leading cause of death in these individuals younger than 2 years of age. Several theories exist as to its embryological evolution, and recently, new theories are emerging regarding its treatment and possible prevention. A thorough understanding of the embryology, anatomy, symptomatology, and surgical treatment is necessary to care optimally for children with myelomeningocele and prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature was used to summarize the clinically pertinent features of the CM II, with particular attention to pitfalls in diagnosis and surgical treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Any child with CM II can present as a neurosurgical emergency. Expeditious and knowledgeable evaluation and prompt surgical decompression of the hindbrain can prevent serious morbidity and mortality in the patient with myelomeningocele, especially those younger than 2 years old. Symptomatic CM II in the older child often presents with more subtle findings but rarely in acute crisis. Understanding of CM II continues to change as innovative techniques are applied to this challenging patient population.

### Tonsillar herniation spectrum: More than just Chiari I. Update and controversies on classification and management [^1141Y9j9]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Low credibility.

Cerebellar tonsil herniation comprises a spectrum of disorders sharing a common neuroimaging finding, which consists of the downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum into the upper cervical spinal canal. This condition can result from a variety of congenital or acquired causes, and there is still confusion regarding its classification and pathogenesis. Terminology remains inconsistent, including variations in the use of the "Chiari 1" moniker.

In this paper, the hypothesized mechanisms of the development of tonsillar herniation are reviewed, and strategies for management are discussed, with particular attention to surgical options adapted to the underlying etiology. Special focus is placed on acquired causes of tonsillar herniation.

### Clinical phenotypes among patients with familial forms of Chiari malformation type 1 [^113HgWvz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common neurological disorder of the craniocervical junction. CM1 is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar herniation below the foramen magnum, causing CSF obstruction and neural compression. Patients with CM1 suffer from highly variable symptoms, progression, comorbidities, and outcomes, partly due to poor understanding of CM1 pathogenesis. In this paper, the authors present the only familial CM1 cohort study to statistically assess intrafamilial clinical phenotypes at the time of writing.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive medical, surgical, and family histories and neuroimaging were collected from families with multiple CM1-affected family members. Univariate analysis was performed for each symptom, comorbidity, or surgery to compare observed versus expected frequencies of affected patients with another CM1-affected family member with the same clinical characteristic.

- **Results**: Twenty-four new familial CM1 cases (totaling 57 patients with CM1) are presented. Intrafamilial similarities were identified for age of onset, symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.007) and neck pain (p = 0.018), neurological comorbidities such as syringomyelia (p = 0.003) and hydrocephalus (p = 0.0001), neurodevelopmental conditions such as dyslexia (p < 0.0001), and connective tissue disorders (CTDs) such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that CM1 and its associated clinical phenotypes, including age of onset, clinical symptoms, neurological comorbidities, neurodevelopmental conditions, and CTDs, are genetically influenced.

### An unusual cause of neck pain: Acquired Chiari malformation leading to brainstem herniation and death [^111C6hhB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations are structural defects in which portions of the cerebellum are located below the foramen magnum. Of the four types of Chiari malformation, emergency physicians are most likely to encounter Type I (Chiari I). Chiari I malformations may be congenital or acquired. Congenital Chiari I malformations are most frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting due to an exacerbation of subacute or chronic Chiari-related symptoms. However, acute Chiari-associated symptoms from an occult congenital or a secondary (acquired) Chiari malformation may occur.

To present a literature-guided approach to the identification and initial management of patients with Chiari I malformations in the ED setting, we discuss the following case:

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to the ED with isolated cervical region pain and subsequently died as a result of acute brainstem herniation from an acquired Chiari I malformation.

- **Conclusions**: Although rare, acute Chiari I malformation may present to the ED. The new finding of a Chiari I malformation should be presumed acquired until proved otherwise and should trigger an evaluation for central nervous system lesions or hydrocephalus. Brain imaging to exclude increased intracranial pressure and, in certain cases, specialty consultation, are important considerations.

### Chiari malformation and syringomyelia [^113CbLR3]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation was first described over a century ago. It consists of posterior fossa anomalies that generally share the feature of cerebellar tonsillar descent through the foramen magnum. Our understanding of this disorder was initially based on autopsy studies and has been greatly enhanced by the advent of MRI. The surgical management of Chiari anomalies has also evolved. Although the exact surgical technique varies among individual surgeons, the goals of surgery remain constant: relieving brainstem compression, cranial nerve distortion, restoring the normal flow of CSF across the foramen magnum, and reducing the size of any associated syrinx cavity.

Syrinx cavities are most commonly associated with Chiari anomalies. However, primary spinal syringomyelia (PSS) can be caused by traumatic, infectious, degenerative, and other etiologies that cause at least a partial CSF flow obstruction in the spinal subarachnoid space. As with syringomyelia associated with Chiari anomalies, the main goal of PSS surgery is to reestablish CSF flow across the area of obstruction. In addition to MRI, myelography with CT is very helpful in evaluating and managing these patients by identifying focal regions of CSF obstruction that may be amenable to surgical intervention.

Future directions for the treatment of Chiari anomalies and syringomyelia include the application of advanced imaging techniques, more widespread use of genetic evaluation, large-scale outcome studies, and the further refinement of surgical technique.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^114TvQeT]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Concerning surgical data, C1-laminectomy and tonsillar resection were typically performed in foramen magnum decompression at our center. Durotomy with resection of the arachnoidea following duraplasty was done in 85.7%, comparable to previous data. Postoperative complications were rare, and there were no persisting neurological deficits due to surgery, which is consistent with the findings of previous literature. However, careful inclusion of patients is a possible selection bias.

In our study, foramen magnum decompression significantly reduced headache frequency, intensity, and acute medication use. Subjective improvement was seen in most patients, which is similar to Grangeon et al, who reported headache relief in 57% of the patients. Other authors indicated a postoperative improvement in up to 81% of the patients, but did not clarify the exact semiology of the patients.

When headache outcomes of different headache semiologies were considered, cough headache showed the largest improvements. This is similar to Grangeon et al, where short attacks with duration < 5 min, strong intensity, occipital accentuation, and Valsalva maneuver-induced headache were prognostically favorable factors after decompression. In contrast, patients with other headache phenotypes improved less. It must be considered that primary headaches, such as migraine and tension-type headaches (TTH), have a high prevalence. Cranial imaging is sometimes performed in patients with a primary headache phenotype, e.g. in therapy-refractory cases, or in cases with features deemed atypical (e.g. prolonged aura). Therefore, in patients with…

### Social impairment and snoring: a unique presentation of pediatric Chiari I malformation [^111UJUE4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Symptomatic progression of Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) can be difficult to recognize in children due to the slow progressive nature of the disorder and highly varied neurological symptoms. We present a case of an obese 11-year-old girl seeking an evaluation of snoring. Progressive social impairment and academic difficulties were also endorsed. The past medical history was remarkable for absence seizures at an earlier age, with an incidental finding of CM-1 on brain imaging. No headaches, vision changes, or swallowing dysfunction were endorsed in the acute presentation. The patient underwent a polysomnogram, which revealed the unexpected finding of severe central sleep apnea. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed further herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and a cervical syrinx, which was not present on initial imaging. Posterior fossa decompression resulted in the successful resolution of symptoms. It was postulated that the social impairment and academic problems were manifestations of CM-1. There are no standard protocols for disease surveillance of pediatric CM-1. Annual polysomnograms may serve as a useful tool.

### Chiari type 1 malformation in a pseudotumour cerebri patient: Is it an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation [^112xasUq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is a developmental abnormality of the cerebellar tonsils. Patients with CM1 commonly present with headaches. Papilloedema is rarely seen in CM1. However, a 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a headache, and her ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema. Her cranial MRI was compatible with borderline CM1. Bilateral papilloedema and headache suggested idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the preliminary diagnosis. IIH is a rare case in CM1. This article argues about this association and discusses whether it is an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation.

### Characterizing the in utero phenome of the Chiari II malformation-a network medicine approach, using fetal MRI [^113HLHBD]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

- **What is already known about this topic**: Spinal defects, small posterior fossa, and vermis ectopia characterize the Chiari II malformation.

- **What does this study add**: Network medicine combined with biometric analysis facilitates the exploration of in-utero phenome development of the Chiari II malformation, utilizing fetal MRI data. This study validates prevailing theories on mechanical interactions between the spine, skull, and brain. The cerebral edema phenotype, while appearing transient, represents a more severe phenotype, exhibiting in this series a severer postnatal morbidity and disability.

### Endoscopic endonasal resection of cranio-cervical junction chordoma and ventral Chiari decompression: A case report [^1174fFn9]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformations secondary to other causes represent a small subset of symptomatic cases. Typically, the primary cause of the malformation is addressed first, resulting in the resolution of the malformation and symptoms. However, in some cases, a patient may present with both a primary Chiari I malformation and another unrelated neurosurgical lesion.

- **Objective**: To present a unique case in which resection of a ventral tumor allowed for spontaneous resolution of a simultaneously noted dorsal Chiari I malformation.

- **Methods**: Pertinent data, including presenting symptoms, hospital course, surgical notes, preoperative images, and postoperative images, were collected using the electronic medical record.

- **Results**: We present a case of a 46-year-old man with a Chiari I malformation in conjunction with a ventral cranio-cervical junction chordoma. Endoscopic endonasal resection of the chordoma and ventral foramen magnum decompression resulted in radiographic resolution of the Chiari malformation and resolution of his symptoms. This report represents a rare case of ventral foramen magnum decompression as a treatment for Chiari I malformation.

- **Conclusion**: It is felt that the chordoma mass effect was not the source of the Chiari I malformation. Thus, both ventral and dorsal decompressions of the posterior fossa may be considered for Chiari I decompression in select circumstances.

### A critical analysis of the Chiari 1.5 malformation [^1116vxYd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

The traditional nomenclature used to describe hindbrain hernias is useful, yet there are patients for whom these morphological entities do not strictly apply. One such group consists of patients with the more recently described Chiari 1.5 malformation, characterized by a Chiari I malformation combined with brainstem herniation through the foramen magnum. To further elucidate the best surgical strategy and refine the descriptive terminology, the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of all cases at their institutions where this form of hindbrain herniation was diagnosed.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the database for all patients diagnosed with Chiari 1.5 malformation. Each patient had undergone posterior fossa decompressive surgery. Magnetic resonance images were evaluated for the extent of caudal descent of the brainstem, amount of tonsillar ectopia, inclination of the odontoid process, and any brain or brainstem abnormalities. Clinical presentations and postoperative results were correlated to these radiological findings.

Twenty-two patients were identified. In all patients, the obex was a mean 14.4 mm inferior to the foramen magnum, and the medulla exhibited a flattened appearance in the midsagittal plane. Syringomyelia was documented in 50% of the cases. The cerebellar tonsils were found to lie at C-1 and C-2 in nine and 13 patients, respectively. The mean angulation of the odontoid process was 84.4 degrees. No abnormalities or caudal descent of the midbrain or pons were identified.

### Interventional spinal procedures in the presence of a Chiari malformation: A potential contraindication [^115Xzyv7]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Although Chiari malformations are much more prevalent than once believed, no study has described treatment with an interventional spinal procedure. The purpose of this report was to discuss the clinical course of a patient who was diagnosed with a Chiari malformation and treated with three cervical epidural injections.

In 2012, a 50-year-old woman presented to a neurology clinic with chronic suboccipital headaches, diplopia, and increasing numbness/tingling in her upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a type I Chiari malformation and a cervical syrinx. The patient was treated with three cervical epidural injections, after which her symptoms exacerbated. Consequently, a posterior fossa suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy and excision of extradural and intradural adhesions was performed. After surgical intervention, notable neurologic improvements were observed. Given the marked worsening of symptoms, the present report suggests that interventional spinal procedures may be a contraindication in the presence of a Chiari malformation with a syrinx.

### Definition of the adult Chiari malformation: A brief historical overview [^116CpVaa]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

With the widespread use of newer neuroimaging techniques and modalities, significant tonsillar herniation is being diagnosed in more than 0.5% of patients, some of whom are asymptomatic. This challenges the definition of the adult Chiari malformation. The author provides a historical review of the evolution of this definition in the neurosurgery, radiology, and pathology literature.

### Imaging diagnosis of upper motor neuron compromising in a patient with Chiari 1 malformation [^1119Gtt3]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of a typical MRI from a patient with bulbar-onset sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with Chiari type 1 malformation. Our report reinforces the conventional neuroimaging appearance associated with each condition and the associated abnormalities on a clinical and advanced imaging techniques basis. The MRI signal intensity was useful for detecting upper motor neuron degeneration based on corticospinal tract signal intensity, while diffusion tensor imaging parameters were limited in this purpose. Our description reinforces the relevance of the T1 magnetisation transfer sequence to demonstrate corticospinal tract degeneration and corroborate an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis in an individual participant, when there is a potential concurrent "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mimic syndrome". To our knowledge, this is the first description of the non-conventional MR techniques' applicability to distinguish the impact of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from Chiari 1 malformation.

### Above-the-hairline suboccipital transverse approach for the treatment of Chiari I malformation [^113YQF2A]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Chiari I malformation is a common pediatric neurosurgical disorder with an established treatment paradigm. Posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty (PFDD) are associated with symptom improvement, but they carry postoperative risks, particularly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and wound complications. Additionally, the cosmetic outcomes of PFDD have been overlooked in the literature.

- **Objective**: To describe a novel approach for PFDD in which the transverse surgical incision is completely hidden above the hairline and to report early outcomes in a prospective patient cohort.

- **Methods**: Clinical and cosmetic outcomes were recorded for 15 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent PFDD for Chiari I malformation via the above-the-hairline transverse suboccipital approach.

- **Results**: The median clinical follow-up time was 6 months (range 1–12 months), and the majority of patients experienced significant improvement in their preoperative symptoms. Three patients (20%) experienced complications associated with surgery, which included injury to the greater occipital nerve, CSF hypotension and subfascial pseudomeningocele, and superficial wound dehiscence that resolved spontaneously with oral antibiotics. Zero patients (0%) returned to the operating room for persistent CSF leak, deep wound infection, or revision decompression. An excellent cosmetic outcome was achieved in 12 patients (80%), with no patient experiencing a poor cosmetic outcome.

- **Conclusion**: The above-the-hairline transverse suboccipital approach for PFDD in patients with Chiari I malformation offers favorable cosmetic outcomes.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^11693naP]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The following theories on the pathophysiology of the typical CIM-related headache have emerged: Oldfield's theory describes a pulsatile pressure effect caudally with mechanical impact to the spinal cord, while William's theory implies that increasing abdominal pressure results in a higher craniocaudal pressure gradient that cannot be dissipated via the subarachnoid space. This would result in transient symptomatic intracranial pressure elevation with the consecutive affection of trigeminal afferents of the meninges, resulting in headache.

Foramen magnum decompression is the treatment of choice for patients with debilitating symptoms and/or pronounced syringomyelia. In cases of mild symptoms or incipient syringomyelia, a surgical approach may be discussed, whereas asymptomatic patients do not require further therapy. The standard surgical approach is foramen magnum decompression in combination with C1 laminectomy. In several trials, foramen magnum decompression had a favorable effect on symptom relief, especially on headache. However, previous studies have examined headache semiology alone without a precise description of the postoperative course or the outcome of headache without detailed headache semiology. Therefore, a detailed description of headache semiology and characteristics pre- and postoperatively, as well as the postoperative outcome of different headache types (including typical cough headache and other headache semiologies) in CIM, is still lacking.

The aim of our project was to provide such a description of headache characteristics and attempt a comprehensive understanding of the postoperative course.

### Prevalence and treatment of typical and atypical headaches in patients with Chiari I malformation: A meta-analysis and literature review [^111oafQE]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the incidence of typical and atypical headaches and outcomes following various treatments in patients with Chiari I malformation.

Headache is the most common symptom of Chiari malformation, which can be divided into typical and atypical subgroups to facilitate management. Much controversy surrounds the etiology, prevalence, and optimal therapeutic approach for both types of headaches.

We identified relevant studies published before 30 July 2022, with an electronic search of numerous literature databases. The results of this study were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.

A total of 1913 Chiari malformation type I (CIM) patients were identified, 78% of whom presented with headaches. Within this group, cephalgia was typical in 48% and atypical in 29% of patients, with migraine being the most common type of atypical headache. The ratio of typical/atypical headaches with the international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.53, and without the classification, it was 1.56.

The pooled improvement rates of typical headaches following conservative treatment, extradural decompression, and intradural decompression were 69%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The corresponding improvement rates for atypical headaches were 70%, 57.47%, and 69%, respectively. The complication rate in the extradural decompression group was significantly lower than in the intradural decompression group (RR, 0.31; 95%).

### Chiari in the family: Inheritance of the Chiari I malformation [^113EqNEc]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

This report presents three families with Chiari malformation type I that became symptomatic during childhood: a mother and son; a set of monozygotic twins; and two half-siblings and their two maternal cousins. These children presented with various symptoms, including headache, stiff neck, and swallowing difficulty. A review of the relevant literature is presented, with an emphasis on familial examples and proposed inheritance. Less common presentations of Chiari malformation type I are discussed, as well as the possible pathogenesis of Chiari malformation type I and associated syringomyelia.

### Chiari type I malformation in a pediatric population [^1148uoZd]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of Chiari I malformation in children remains unclear. A population-based retrospective cohort study was therefore conducted. Radiology reports from all head and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 5248) performed among 741,815 children under age 20 within Kaiser Northern California, 1997–1998, were searched for Chiari I. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed to determine clinical and radiographic predictors of significant neurologic symptoms, defined as moderate to severe headache, neck pain, vertigo, or ataxia. The 51 patients identified with Chiari I represented 1% of the children who had head or spine magnetic resonance imaging scans performed during the study period. Headache (55%) and neck pain (12%) were the most common symptoms. Syringomyelia was present in 6 patients (12%) at initial diagnosis; no new syrinxes developed during follow-up. Older age at time of diagnosis was associated with increased risk of headache (odds ratio OR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.1–1.5) and significant neurologic symptoms (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.04–1.4). Chiari I, an underrecognized cause of headaches in children, is also frequently discovered incidentally in children without symptoms. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment of pediatric Chiari I.

### An unusual presentation of Chiari I malformation [^111oXFYR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The most typical symptom of Chiari malformation type I in children is headache. The authors describe a 14-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of gait decline and no headache, which is very unusual. After surgery to correct the Chiari I malformation, the patient's gait improved; however, she went on to develop decreased hand use with joint deformities. She was diagnosed with a probable connective tissue disorder. Patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for developing Chiari I malformation. The authors discuss the possible reasons for the unusual presentation of the Chiari I malformation and possible mechanisms. The unusual presentation of Chiari I malformation delayed this young patient's diagnosis and treatment.

### Epidemiology of symptomatic Chiari malformation in Tatarstan: Regional and ethnic differences in prevalence [^112W5J5e]. Neurosurgery (2019). Low credibility.

Epidemiology can assess the effect of Chiari I malformation (CM1) on the neurological health of a population and evaluate factors influencing CM1 development.

- **Objective**: To analyze the regional and ethnic differences in the prevalence of CM1.

- **Methods**: The population of the Republic of Tatarstan (RT) in the Russian Federation was evaluated for patients with CM1 symptoms over an 11-year period. Typical symptoms of CM1 were found in 868 patients. Data from neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of posterior cranial fossa structures were analyzed.

- **Results**: MRI evidence of CM1, defined as cerebellar tonsils lying at least 5 mm inferior to the foramen magnum, was found in 67% of symptomatic patients. Another 33% of symptomatic patients had 2 to 4 mm of tonsillar ectopia, which we defined as "borderline Chiari malformation type 1 (bCM1)". The period prevalence in the entire RT for symptomatic CM1 was 20:100,000; for bCM1 was 10:100,000; and for CM1 and bCM1 together was 30:100,000. Prevalence of patients with CM1 symptoms was greater in the northern than southern districts of Tatarstan, due to a high prevalence (413:100,000) of CM1 in the Baltasy region in one of the northern districts.

- **Conclusion**: One-third of patients with typical symptoms of CM1 had less than 5 mm of tonsillar ectopia (bCM1). Assessments of the health impact of CM1-type symptoms on a patient population should include the bCM1 patient group. A regional disease cluster of patients with Chiari malformation was found in Baltasy district of RT and needs further study.

### Abnormal movements associated with oropharyngeal dysfunction in a child with Chiari I malformation [^113TTVUN]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old boy was evaluated for a two-month history of atypical movements presenting in the evening and lasting an hour after eating. These stereotypical movements involved the head and chest bending forward and to the left side, accompanied by a grimace, and were associated with a sensation of breath locking without cyanosis. Pain and dysphagia were absent, and the neurological examination was normal.

The possibility of Sandifer syndrome posturing occurring with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was considered, but neither pain nor back hyperextension was associated with the atypical movements. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) did not improve his symptoms. Various prokinetic agents including metoclopramide, motilium, cisapride, and erythromycin were also ineffective.

Upper endoscopy and esophageal biopsy did not reveal eosinophilic esophagitis or other abnormalities. An ENT exam was normal. A severe gastroparesis was demonstrated on a milkscan study. Two 24-hour esophageal pH probe studies indicated severe GER. High-resolution manometric evaluation of the esophagus revealed normal sphincter pressures and relaxations with no dysmotility of the esophageal body. Electroencephalography and polysomnography were normal.

Due to the unexplained dyspnea associated with this abnormal posture, a head MRI was performed and revealed a Chiari malformation type I: cerebellar tonsils extending to 12 mm, with syringomyelia (D4-D5) (Figure 1).

- **Figure 1: Cerebellar tonsils herniation on magnetic resonance imaging - Chiari malformation type I**.

For a long period, the child's abnormal movements were only considered to be tics.

### Patients with "benign" Chiari I malformations require surgical decompression at a low rate [^115M1dpn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

There are sparse published data on the natural history of "benign" Chiari I malformation (CM-I) — i.e. Chiari with minimal or no symptoms at presentation and no imaging evidence of syrinx, hydrocephalus, or spinal cord signal abnormality. The purpose of this study was to review a large cohort of children with benign CM-I and to determine whether these children become symptomatic and require surgical treatment.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to investigate the progression of benign CM-I in children and evaluate the necessity for surgical intervention.

- **Methods**: Patients were identified from institutional outpatient records using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis codes for CM-I from 1996 to 2016. After reviewing the medical records, patients were excluded if they: 1) did not have a diagnosis of CM-I, 2) were not evaluated by a neurosurgeon, 3) had previously undergone posterior fossa decompression, or 4) had imaging evidence of syringomyelia at their first appointment. To include only patients with benign Chiari (without syrinx or classic Chiari symptoms that could prompt immediate intervention), any patient who underwent decompression within 9 months of initial evaluation was excluded. After a detailed chart review, patients were excluded if they had classical Chiari malformation symptoms at presentation. The authors then determined what changes in the clinical picture prompted surgical treatment. Patients were excluded from the multivariate logistic regression analysis if they had missing data such as race and insurance; however, these patients were included in the overall survival analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 427 patients were included for analysis with a median follow-up period not specified in the provided excerpt.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^114E1MZL]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation typically presents with cough headache. However, migraine-like or tension-type-like headaches may also occur. There are limited publications on Chiari I malformation-associated headache semiologies and the effect of foramen magnum decompression on different headache types.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis complemented by structured phone interviews was performed on 65 patients with Chiari I malformation, treated at our hospital between 2010 and 2021. Headache semiology (according to ICHD-3), frequency, intensity, and radiological characteristics were evaluated pre- and postoperatively.

- **Results**: We included 65 patients; 38 were female, and 27 were male. The mean age was 43.9 ± 15.7 years. Headache was predominant in 41 patients (63.0%); 21 patients had cough headache, and 20 had atypical headache (12 migrainous, eight tension-type headache-like). Thirty-five patients with headache underwent surgery. Frequency, intensity, and analgesic use was significantly reduced in cough headache (p < 0.001). Atypical headaches improved less (p = 0.004 to 0.176). Exploratory analysis suggested that larger preoperative tonsillar descent correlated with larger postoperative headache intensity relief (p = 0.025).

- **Conclusion**: Decompression was effective in Chiari I malformation-related cough headache. Atypical headache responded less well, and the causal relation with Chiari I malformation remains uncertain. For atypical headache, decompression should only be considered after failed appropriate preventive therapy and within an interdisciplinary approach.

### Spontaneous resolution of Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia: case report and review of the literature [^113iN8nd]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Indications for surgery and the surgical technique of foramen magnum decompression for patients with Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia are controversial issues. This case report supports the view that observation may be adequate for patients without progressive symptoms or with mild clinical symptoms.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 37-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of burning dysesthesias and hypesthesia in her right arm. A neurological examination revealed hypesthesia in the right trigeminal distribution. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a Chiari I malformation with syringomyelia between C2 and T2. No hydrocephalus was observed.

- **Clinical course**: Because the patient's symptoms regressed spontaneously, surgery was not performed. Thirty-two months after her initial examination, the patient was asymptomatic. A second magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained, which demonstrated complete spontaneous resolution of the Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia.

- **Conclusion**: We attribute the regression of the patient's symptoms to spontaneous recanalization of cerebrospinal fluid pathways at the foramen magnum, which most likely was due to rupture of the arachnoid membranes that had obstructed cerebrospinal fluid flow.

### Evaluation and management of the Chiari malformation type 1 for the primary care pediatrician [^112ZBzKM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of Chiari malformation type 1 (CMI) are undergoing reexamination, which includes the redefinition of the anatomic Chiari malformation and the refinement of the clinical syndrome. Children with CMI may present with head pain, a neurologic deficit, or signs of spinal cord dysfunction due to syrinx. Some children may present without any clinical syndrome. The presence of an anatomic Chiari malformation or a compelling clinical Chiari syndrome should prompt evaluation by a neurologist or neurosurgeon experienced in these syndromes and their treatment.

Treatment options are varied but typically lead to the resolution of symptoms. However, when symptoms persist after surgery, management can be complex and not uniformly successful, even in the hands of experienced practitioners.

### Quality-of-life outcomes in adults and children with Chiari 1 malformation and in those managed without surgery: A prospective, multicenter, observational study [^116zMQhH]. Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is a common MRI finding and a frequent reason for neurosurgical consultation. Although many studies have investigated surgical outcomes for patients with CM1, outcomes for those treated without surgery have been less frequently reported. The UK Chiari 1 Study reports the quality of life of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery, 12 months after the first neurosurgical clinic visit.

- **Methods**: The UK Chiari 1 Study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (≥ 16 years) and children (< 16 years) with CM1. This was an observational study that did not alter the course of clinical care. Symptoms and quality-of-life data (using Short-Form 36 in adults and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ in children) were collected at baseline and 12 months after the first clinical review for all participants.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-two patients with CM1 (146 females; 148 adults) were studied at baseline, and 113 patients with CM1 treated without surgery were studied at a 12-month follow-up. Baseline quality-of-life scores in the study cohort were significantly lower in every domain compared with normative control data, in both adults and children. There were no decreases in quality-of-life subscores after 12 months in this cohort of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery. Social functioning (t = -40, P < .001) and bodily pain (t = -2.9; p = 0.03) Short-Form 36 scores showed improvements at 12 months in adult patients treated without surgery.

This study demonstrates the stability of quality-of-life outcomes in CM1 patients managed without surgery over 12 months.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^114Y7YoT]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Following foramen magnum decompression surgery, thirty-five out of 41 patients with headaches reported subjective relief. Among these patients, 30 (87.7%) experienced headache relief, while two (4.9%) saw no change, and three (7.3%) reported worsening.

- **Post-surgical outcomes**:
	- After the procedure, there was a significant reduction in maximum and minimum headache intensity, headache days per month, and acute medication days per month. This positive outcome was observed across both cough headache and atypical headache groups, though it was more pronounced in the cough headache group, achieving statistical significance across all four outcomes with large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 1.10 to 1.85).

	- In the atypical headache group, statistical significance was achieved for maximum intensity and monthly headache days with medium to large effects (Cohen's d of 0.42–0.82).

- **Further subgroup analysis**:
	- Within the atypical headache group, Supplementary Table 2 highlights a significant improvement in headache intensity for patients with CM semiology and a significant improvement in headache frequency for those with a CTTH phenotype. However, these subgroups were small, necessitating cautious interpretation.

For comparison, the analysis included six headache patients who did not undergo surgery (three with cough headache, one with ETTH-like headache, and two with CM-like headache).

### Clinical outcome of different surgical approaches for symptomatic Chiari malformation without syringomyelia: A 13-year retrospective study [^112PU2LE]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). High credibility.

Chiari malformation is a condition that disrupts cerebrospinal fluid circulation. While previous studies have extensively explored the symptoms, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes for patients with Chiari malformation accompanied by syringomyelia, there is limited research focused on those without syringomyelia. This study aims to evaluate the symptoms, treatments, intradural findings, and clinical outcomes in patients with Chiari malformation without syringomyelia.

This single-center, retrospective study analyzed 148 patients diagnosed with Chiari malformation without syringomyelia between January 2010 and September 2022. Patients underwent one of two surgical approaches: posterior fossa decompression (PFD) or posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD). Data on clinical symptoms, intradural findings, surgical outcomes, and postoperative complications were collected and analyzed. A total of 148 patients were included in the study, with 30 undergoing PFD and 118 receiving PFDD. Patients treated with PFDD showed significantly improved CCOS scores compared to those treated with PFD (12.8 ± 1.9 vs. 11.8 ± 2.5, P = 0.018). Symptom improvement rates were comparable between the two groups.

Among PFDD patients, over 80% exhibited intradural abnormalities, with 28.4% classified as severe. Severe intradural abnormalities were strongly associated with higher rates of Valsalva-provoked pain (59.5% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.001). PFDD significantly improves CCOS scores compared to PFD, highlighting its potential as a more effective surgical approach for Chiari malformation without syringomyelia.

### The Chiari I malformation [^115evbBp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

As with many pathologies, the course of our understanding of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) has developed extensively over time. The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia was listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role.

During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment.

The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery is also a key topic of discussion.

### Worsening or development of syringomyelia following Chiari I decompression: Case report [^111vMuyt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The effects of posterior fossa decompression on Chiari malformation Type I-induced syringomyelia have been well described. However, treatment of worsening syringomyelia after Chiari decompression remains enigmatic. This paper defines patient and clinical characteristics as well as treatment and postoperative radiological and clinical outcomes in patients experiencing this complication.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a retrospective review of patients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Children's of Alabama who developed worsening syringomyelia after Chiari decompression was performed.

- **Results**: Fourteen children (age range 8 months to 15 years), 7 of whom had preoperative syringomyelia, underwent posterior fossa decompression. Aseptic meningitis (n = 3) and bacterial meningitis (n = 2) complicated 5 cases (4 of these patients were originally treated at outside hospitals). Worsening syringomyelia presented a median of 1.4 years (range 0.2–10.3 years) after the primary decompression. Ten children presented with new, recurrent, or persistent symptoms, and 4 were asymptomatic. Secondary Chiari decompression was performed in 11 of the 14 children. The other 3 children were advised to undergo secondary decompression. A structural cause for each failed primary Chiari decompression (for example, extensive scarring, suture in the obex, arachnoid web, residual posterior arch of C-1, and no duraplasty) was identified at the secondary operation. After secondary decompression, symptoms completely resolved in 8 patients, 1 patient's condition stabilized, and 2 patients r.

### Otologic manifestations of Chiari I malformation [^111Tjo3B]. Otology & Neurotology (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence of otologic symptoms in patients undergoing surgical decompression for symptomatic Chiari I malformation, a cross-sectional, prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted at an urban tertiary referral center. Patients with Chiari I malformation were evaluated before surgical intervention.

Sixteen consecutive patients with Chiari I malformation completed a self-administered questionnaire. Eighty-one percent of patients reported episodic aural fullness, 81% reported tinnitus, 69% experienced vertigo, and 56% suffered from fluctuating hearing loss. Headaches occurred as frequently as aural fullness and tinnitus.

Most patients with Chiari I malformation exhibit symptoms that mimic primary otologic pathological changes, suggesting the existence of common pathophysiologic mechanisms.
