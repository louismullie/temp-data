## Question

What is the incidence of alcapa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of ALCAPA, the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how incidence is defined in the literature. Then, I should verify which sources provide the most authoritative estimates. Next, I will check whether estimates are consistent across different references. After that, I need to consider whether there are important subtypes or phenotypes that might affect incidence figures. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, meaningful conclusion and ensure the estimate aligns with guideline-level sources and contemporary reviews [^1158oc7g] [^1144vrwB].

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope of what we are estimating. Incidence here refers to how often ALCAPA occurs per live births, not prevalence or detection rates in symptomatic cohorts, and I should avoid conflating ALCAPA with broader categories of coronary anomalies that are more common but not the same entity, since ALCAPA is a specific malformation with unique pathophysiology and outcomes [^1144vrwB].

> Now, I should identify the highest-credibility sources that directly cite an incidence figure. The ACC/AHA 2008 adult congenital heart disease guideline explicitly states that ALCAPA occurs in approximately 1 in 300,000 live births, which is a key benchmark I should anchor to given its guideline authority and focus on adult congenital disease epidemiology [^1158oc7g]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should cross-check with a contemporary expert consensus focused on imaging and epidemiology of congenital coronary anomalies, which also reports ALCAPA in about 1 in 300,000 children, reinforcing the same order of magnitude from a pediatric perspective [^1144vrwB].

> Next, I should review corroborating secondary sources to ensure consistency. Multiple independent reviews and series consistently cite an incidence of roughly 1 in 300,000 live births, with some adding that ALCAPA comprises approximately 0.24% to 0.46% of all congenital heart disease cases, which aligns with the notion of extreme rarity in the CHD spectrum; this consistency across adult and pediatric-focused papers supports the robustness of the estimate [^114mixc2] [^114Zcckp] [^11391WNJ].

> Wait, let me verify potential confounders and subtypes that might alter perceived incidence. Some authors distinguish infantile-type versus adult-type physiology based on collateralization, but this is a phenotypic classification and does not imply a different congenital incidence; moreover, modern noninvasive imaging may increase detection in older cohorts, but that affects ascertainment and apparent prevalence rather than true birth incidence, so I should not conflate improved recognition with a change in underlying incidence [^116o7nY9] [^112MtxfJ]. I also need to ensure I'm not mixing ALCAPA with other coronary anomalies like ARCAPA, which is far rarer and epidemiologically distinct, so keeping the definition tight avoids overestimation or misattribution [^1144vrwB].

> Let me consider the broader coronary anomaly context briefly to sanity-check the magnitude. Congenital coronary artery anomalies overall occur in roughly 0.3% to 0.8% of the population, and ALCAPA is only a tiny fraction of that broader group, which makes the 1 in 300,000 figure biologically and epidemiologically plausible in that framework [^114mixc2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if ALCAPA might be closer to 1 in 250,000 based on some older reports, but on review those lower denominators appear in lower-credibility sources or are based on selective cohorts rather than population-level estimates, so I should privilege the guideline and consensus figures at 1 in 300,000 live births [^1158oc7g] [^1144vrwB].

> Synthesis and final answer: I should double-check that my conclusion matches the weight of evidence. The most consistent and authoritative estimate is that ALCAPA occurs in approximately 1 in 300,000 live births, with guideline and contemporary expert consensus both converging on this figure; secondary literature further contextualizes this as about 0.24% to 0.46% of congenital heart disease, which aligns with its status as an extremely rare anomaly [^1158oc7g] [^1144vrwB] [^114mixc2] [^114Zcckp] [^11391WNJ].

The incidence of ALCAPA is **approximately 1 in 300,000 live births** [^1158oc7g], accounting for about 0.24–0.46% of congenital heart disease [^114mixc2]. It is **extremely rare**, with most cases presenting in infancy; adult presentations are uncommon and usually reflect survival due to collateral circulation [^114sf4er] [^1158oc7g]. Early diagnosis and surgical correction are critical to prevent high infant mortality and reduce the risk of sudden death in older patients [^11686Tpt] [^111PET4v].

---

## Epidemiology and incidence

- **Incidence**: ALCAPA occurs in approximately 1 in 300,000 live births [^1158oc7g] [^1144vrwB].

- **Proportion of CHD**: ALCAPA accounts for roughly 0.24–0.46% of all congenital heart disease cases [^114mixc2].

- **Infantile presentation**: Most cases present in infancy, typically within the first few months of life, due to falling pulmonary vascular resistance and coronary steal [^1144vrwB] [^114sf4er].

- **Adult presentation**: Adult cases are rare and usually reflect survival via extensive collateral circulation from the right coronary artery [^116o7nY9] [^114sf4er].

---

## Clinical significance and outcomes

- **Infant mortality**: Without surgical correction, approximately 90% of infants die within the first year of life due to myocardial ischemia and heart failure [^114mixc2] [^1144vrwB].

- **Adult complications**: Adult survivors face a high risk of sudden cardiac death, arrhythmias, and heart failure due to chronic myocardial ischemia [^115vqD6J] [^113nPfr6].

- **Surgical outcomes**: Early surgical intervention to establish a dual coronary system significantly improves survival and reduces complications [^111PET4v] [^113BcRdi].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Echocardiography**: The primary screening tool, with characteristic findings including retrograde flow from the left coronary artery into the pulmonary artery and right coronary artery dilation [^1116MYAa] [^111HVNJW].

- **Advanced imaging**: Cardiac CT or MRI may be required when echocardiography is inconclusive or in older patients with limited acoustic windows [^1116MYAa] [^113tCMrm].

- **Cardiac catheterization**: Historically the gold standard, now reserved for complex cases or when noninvasive imaging is inconclusive [^1116MYAa] [^113tCMrm].

Discussion and conclusions

ALCAPA is an extremely rare congenital anomaly. ALCAPA patients usually show clinical signs of cardiac failure at approximately 3 months of age, when their pulmonary arterial pressure decreases, and without treatment, approximately 90% of infants die within the first year of life. Thus, diagnosis in living adults is extremely rare, and most of the information has been derived from case reports of individual patients who have been resuscitated and survived. Yau et al. reviewed 151 adult cases of ALCAPA, 12% of which were diagnosed at autopsy. The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis in those 151 cases was 41 years, and the oldest patient was 83 years old. There was a greater than 2:1 predominance of females. At presentation, 66% of the patients exhibited symptoms of angina, dyspnea, palpitations, or fatigue. Ventricular arrhythmia, syncope, or sudden death was exhibited in 17% of the cases as the initial manifestation, and 14% of the patients were asymptomatic; 62% of those who presented with a life-threatening event had no previous symptoms. The average age of the patients who presented with a life-threatening event was 33 years + 14 years.

ACC/AHA 2008 — ALCAPA epidemiology and adult course note that ALCAPA is relatively rare, occurring in 1 in 300 000 live births. Improved operative revascularization, ensuing myocardial remodeling, and improved medical management of heart failure have increased survival after ALCAPA repair, and most adults survive because of collaterals from the right coronary artery, but they may have myocardial ischemia, LV dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, or ventricular arrhythmia.

### Adult ALCAPA: from histological picture to clinical features [^114mixc2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital abnormalities of the coronary arteries are present in approximately 0.3–0.8% of the population.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is an extremely rare congenital cardiac anomaly. ALCAPA is widely referred to as Bland-White-Garland (BWG) syndrome, and it is estimated to occur in 1/300, 000 live births and comprise between 0.24 and 0.46% of all cases of congenital heart disease.

At birth, infants with ALCAPA are usually asymptomatic because of the presence of physiologic pulmonary hypertension and a patent ductus arteriosus. When pulmonary artery pressure drops a few weeks to months after birth, blood flow reverses from the left coronary artery (LCA) into the pulmonary artery and results in a steal phenomenon. The balance between the speed of closure of the ductus and the development of collateral circulation between the right and left coronary arteries is an important factor in determining the outcome. In the absence of treatment, approximately 90% of infants with ALCAPA die within the first year of life. Early autopsy studies have reported an average age of sudden death of 35 years old in untreated adult ALCAPA cases, and the authors of those studies have recommended that all diagnosed adult ALCAPA patients be treated surgically. However, little is known about the pathological changes and clinical course of ALCAPA in adults or the association between adult ALCAPA and sudden death.

We were involved in the assessment, treatment, and pathological evaluation of two adult cases of ALCAPA, and we aimed to extend our knowledge of the histological, angiographic, and clinical characteristics of ALCAPA in adults and to achieve a deeper understanding of this rare entity.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^114Zcckp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare but potentially fatal congenital coronary anomaly associated with early infant mortality and sudden adult death. Krause and Brooks reported the first incidences of ALCAPA syndrome in 1865 and 1885, respectively. In 1933, Garland, Bland, and White made the first clinical pathologic correlation, and they also proposed a review of congenital variations in the coronary vessels and a discussion of their embryological background. Garland and associates estimated that ALCAPA is present in 1 out of 300,000 live births or 0.5% of the children with congenital heart disease, and these data were widely cited during past years. With the development of diagnostic techniques, more asymptomatic patients have been diagnosed and treated surgically.

Conventionally, ALCAPA syndrome is classified into two types. There is little or no coronary collateral development in the infantile type of circulation; and after the closure of patent ductus arteriosus, it could lead to severe myocardial ischemia, left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, dilatation, and mitral regurgitation (MR) when the pressure of pulmonary artery (PA) falls. The infantile type patients die within weeks to months after birth without surgical correction. About 10 to 15% of the ALCAPA patients are adult-type, and their survival is due to a large dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with extensive inter-coronary collaterals, as well as a restrictive opening between the ALCAPA and the PA. With ongoing subclinical myocardial ischemia, these patients can be asymptomatic until adulthood. In adult-type ALCAPA patients, there is an estimated 80 to 90% incidence of sudden death at the mean age of 35 years.

The diagnosis of ALCAPA in adults is rare. Most ALCAPA patients were diagnosed after the presence of varied clinical presentation and American Heart Association for Adult Congenital Heart Disease treatment guidelines has suggested surgical repair in adult ALCAPA patients regardless of myocardial viability. However, considering the variety of clinical symptoms and cardiac function, it is hard to choose the rational treatment, especially when the patients are asymptomatic and without evident left ventricular dysfunction. We report 9 cases (aged between 5 and 16 years) of ALCAPA, where only one patient developed symptoms (apsychia), and others were asymptomatic, and there was no evident left ventricular dysfunction found in any of the cases.

### ALCAPA syndrome: not just a pediatric disease [^112MtxfJ]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) syndrome is a rare congenital coronary artery anomaly. There are two types of ALCAPA syndrome: the infant type and the adult type, each of which has different manifestations and outcomes. Infants experience myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and approximately 90% die within the 1st year of life. Rarely, ALCAPA syndrome manifests in adults; it may be an important cause of sudden cardiac death. Historically, ALCAPA syndrome was diagnosed at conventional angiography. However, the development of electrogardiographically gated multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enables accurate noninvasive imaging. At MR imaging and multidetector CT angiography, findings include direct visualization of the left coronary artery arising from the main pulmonary artery. Reversed flow from the left coronary artery into the main pulmonary artery may be seen at steady-state free-precession cine and fast cine phase-contrast MR imaging. Because of its ability to assess myocardial viability, which can be used as a prognostic factor to direct the need for surgical repair, MR imaging plays an important role in patient treatment. Restoration of a dual-coronary-artery system is the ideal surgical treatment for ALCAPA syndrome.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2008 — Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) recommendations specify that in patients with ALCAPA, reconstruction of a dual coronary artery supply should be performed, and the surgery should be performed by surgeons with training and expertise in CHD at centers with expertise in the management of anomalous coronary artery origins (Level of Evidence: C). For adult survivors of ALCAPA repair, clinical evaluation with echocardiography and noninvasive stress testing is indicated every 3 to 5 years (Level of Evidence: C).

### Adult ALCAPA: from histological picture to clinical features [^113JiQih]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Implantation of an ICD in adult ALCAPA patients remains controversial, but it is usually performed because of the presence of such sudden cardiac death risk factors after surgical repair as: (i) severe left ventricular dysfunction, (ii) fibrotic changes as a possible substrate for ventricular arrhythmias, (iii) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing or Holter monitoring, and (iv) a positive programmed ventricular stimulation test.

To date, there has been insufficient data to conclude that surgical repair reduces the risk of recurrent malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Three mechanisms for the development of ventricular tachycardia may be possible: i) acute local ischemia caused by coronary steal phenomena, ii) a reentry circuit in the border zone of myocardial infarction, and iii) electrical instability caused by endocardial fibrosis. We think that the indications for ICD implantation should be considered more cautiously, because acute ischemic events can be prevented by surgical correction and because there have been no reports of ICD activation after surgical correction, including in our Case 1, and the ICD lead may increase the risk of infection.

Over the past two decades, the number of ALCAPA cases reported in patients over 50 years of age has increased in tandem with the introduction of new noninvasive diagnostic modalities. Although the natural course of ALCAPA results in a high incidence of sudden death during childhood and early adulthood, the risk of sudden death appears to decline after 50 years of age despite the less common surgical correction in this population, and these older patients, in whom cardiac surgery is undesirable or unwarranted, continue to be diagnosed at an increasing rate. Special attention should be paid to preventing lethal events in this untreated population. Although no standard protocol of medical control has yet been established, medical control with a vasodilator and anti-arrhythmic agent may be mandatory.

In summary, we have confirmed the previously seldom reported i) electron-microscopic findings and ii) light-microscopic findings in adult cases of ALCAPA, and we have described new findings: iii) arteriolar wall thickening, iv) persistent altered ultrastructure even after surgical correction, and v) a slow flow phenomenon in the CAG in adult ALCAPA.

Because no randomized controlled trials that would make it possible to evaluate the long-term outcomes of methods of managing adult ALCAPA are yet available, compiling systematic descriptions of the data in each case would reveal the true nature of this rare entity and its optimal treatment.

### Aberrant left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery with patent ductus arteriosus-a case report and review of the literature [^113H6pPL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

ALCAPA, also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare coronary abnormality, constituting 0.3–0.5% of congenital heart defects. Left untreated, it can cause mortality in 90% of cases. Survival into adulthood is probably due to collateral development in the coronary circulation, with the risk of sudden death remaining high.

ALCAPA is, in most cases, an isolated defect, but in rare incidences, it has been described with other anomalies like tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal defects, and PDA.

ALCAPA is asymptomatic in the fetal period, as the pressures and oxygen saturations are similar in the great arteries. Following birth, the pressure in the pulmonary artery gradually decreases to a point where the coronary perfusion pressure, that is the difference between the pressure in the coronary artery and the LV wall pressure, is not adequate and ischemia ensues. This, in turn, causes dysfunction of the left ventricle, dilation of the left side of the heart, and mitral regurgitation, reflected as clinical heart failure and, in some cases, arrhythmias and sudden death.

We report a case of ALCAPA masked by a large PDA in an infant female. Informed consentwas acquired from the patient's guardian for this report.

### From asymptomatic adult patient to cardiopulmonary resuscitation-treatment of ALCAPA with total arterial myocardial revascularisation and mitral valve repair [^113nPfr6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery originating from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) was first described by Abbott in 1908. Further clinical description followed in 1933 by Bland, White, and Garland. Therefore, ALCAPA is also referred to as Bland-White-Garland syndrome. Without surgical correction, ALCAPA has a mortality rate of approximately 90% in the first year of life. Ten percent of patients survive due to the development of numerous intercoronary collaterals, ensuring myocardial perfusion. Of these patients, approximately 90% suffer sudden cardiac death at an average age of 35 years. Thus, most adults with ALCAPA die without having been diagnosed the condition. Therefore, adults with ALCAPA present quite rarely in clinical practice, with clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac arrest.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in adults: a comprehensive review of 151 adult cases and a new diagnosis in a 53-year-old woman [^116o7nY9]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary abnormality associated with early infant mortality and adult sudden death. As it predominantly presents in the first year of life, diagnosis in living adults is extremely rare. Current management is based on limited case series or extrapolated from pediatric cases. Modern advances in noninvasive cardiac imaging have substantially increased the number of diagnoses, uncovering a large adult population that has not been reviewed.

Hypothesis

The availability of newer diagnostic modalities correlates with an increasing incidence in an older cohort, and true association between sudden death and ALCAPA may be lower, especially among older patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed for all case reports of ALCAPA on MEDLINE and PubMed using the keywords ALCAPA, Bland-White-Garland, and coronary anomaly; and augmented by references from published case reports from 1908 to 2008. All adult cases, defined by age 18 years and older, were reviewed for this article.

Results

One hundred fifty-one adult cases of ALCAPA are described, in addition to the case of an asymptomatic 53-year-old woman. The average reported age was 41 years old with the oldest being 83. Sixty-six percent of the patients presented with symptoms of angina, dyspnea, palpitations, or fatigue; 17% presented with ventricular arrhythmia, syncope, or sudden death; and 14% were asymptomatic. Twelve percent were diagnosed at autopsy. The majority had some form of surgical correction during their clinical course.

Conclusions

ALCAPA is a rare and life-threatening condition in adults. The availability of newer, less invasive diagnostic modalities has resulted in more frequent identification of this condition in an older cohort.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^116yyXJH]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

ALCAPA is reported to occur in only 1 in 250–400 congenital heart malformations with an overall incidence of approximately 1 in 300,000 live births. The isolated LCx-ALCAPA variant is even less common and has only occasionally been reported in the literature, as either an isolated malformation or in association with other anomalies of the aortic and pulmonary trunk (including aortopulmonary window, subaortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta).

Scimitar syndrome is a rare anomaly with an incidence of approximately 1 to 3 per 100,000 live births; however, the true incidence may be higher as many patients are asymptomatic. ALCAPA in conjunction with scimitar syndrome has only been reported in the literature in three patients and isolated LCx-ALCAPA has been described at only one other center. The 5.5% incidence of LCx-ALCAPA in our cohort suggests the association may be underrecognized. Of note, the association of ALCAPA variants and scimitar syndrome has not been highlighted in previous comprehensive literature reviews on scimitar syndrome.

Chest radiography and echocardiography remain the first-line imaging investigations in these infants, but will rarely demonstrate direct evidence of the presence of an ALCAPA. Although diagnostic conventional angiography is still widely used in paediatric congenital heart disease, noninvasive assessment via cardiovascular CT is becoming an increasingly attractive preoperative imaging modality in complex congenital heart and lung disease assessment with consistently falling radiation dose and decreased need for general anaesthesia/sedation.

The features of combined scimitar syndrome-ALCAPA on both conventional angiography and cardiovascular CT are surprisingly consistent within our small series. When present and specifically sought, it should, therefore, be possible to confidently identify an ALCAPA in scimitar syndrome patients. Ischaemia, suggested by regional wall motion abnormalities at rest or ischaemic electrocardiogram changes on invasive angiography, should lead to increased suspicion of this dual diagnosis. It should be noted, however, that the absence of ischaemic signs and symptoms does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis because scimitar syndrome is often associated with pulmonary hypertension, and the raised pulmonary pressure may provide sufficient perfusion of the circumflex artery to prevent the development of ischaemia.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^11798ESJ]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Scimitar syndrome is a rare combination of cardiopulmonary abnormalities found in 1–3 per 1000 live births. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is only found in 1 in 250–400 congenital heart disease patients.

Objective

We aimed to investigate the incidence of left circumflex ALCAPA within our referral center's cohort of scimitar syndrome patients.

Materials and methods

A review of medical records, cardiac imaging and operative notes from all patients diagnosed with scimitar syndrome at our center between 1992 and 2016 was undertaken and all imaging reviewed.

Results

Fifty-four patients with scimitar syndrome and imaging were identified. Of these, 3 patients (1 male and 2 female) with ALCAPA were identified, representing an incidence of 5.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0–11.67%). In all three cases, the anomalous coronary arising from the pulmonary artery was the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and the point of origin was close to the pulmonary arterial bifurcation.

Conclusion

We hypothesize that the prevalence of LCx-ALCAPA, in the setting of scimitar syndrome, may be greater than previously thought. We suggest that any patient with scimitar syndrome, especially with evidence of ischaemia, should be investigated for ALCAPA. Given its noninvasive nature and simultaneous imaging of the lungs, we suggest that cardiovascular CT is the most appropriate first-line investigation for these patients.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^114jbJpV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare but potentially fatal congenital coronary anomaly associated with early infant mortality and sudden adult death. By the development or lack of coronary collateral, it can be classified as infantile or adult type. However, even with the compensatory mechanism in adult patients, there is an estimated 80 to 90% incidence of sudden death at the mean age of 35years.

Methods

We enrolled 9 patients with ALCAPA within the age group 5 to 16years.

Results

Only one patient developed symptoms (apsychia), whereas other patients were asymptomatic, and there was no evident left ventricular dysfunction found in any of the cases.

Conclusion

With the development of imaging techniques, asymptomatic adult-type ALCAPA patients could be identified and diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. As a potential cause of sudden death, ALCAPA should be surgically repaired soon after the diagnosis.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) — epidemiology and presentation indicate ALCAPA is a rare but well recognized anomaly occurring in 1 in 300,000 children, while ARCAPA incidence has been reported as 0.002%, or 0.12% of all CHD cases; the typical presentation of ALCAPA relates to the transitional fall in pulmonary artery pressures in the first weeks of life and subsequent collateral flow development, with infants who have inadequate collateralization developing myocardial ischemia with feeding intolerance, tachypnea, pallor, and failure to thrive that can lead to left ventricular dilation and dysfunction, papillary muscle fibrosis/scarring and mitral regurgitation with eventual dilated cardiomyopathy, worsening mitral regurgitation, and heart failure; if left unrecognized, overall mortality is 90% in infants who do not undergo surgical repair in the first year of life; children with well-developed collateral flow often have preserved left ventricular systolic function with delayed presentation into adolescence or adulthood and this cohort does not characteristically present with heart failure and, rarely, may present with sudden cardiac death as adults; ALCAPA is often associated with other congenital cardiac abnormalities, most commonly aorto-pulmonary window or tetralogy of Fallot.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA syndrome) is a rare congenital coronary abnormality carrying a poor prognosis. We present a clinical case series of ALCAPA-related anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse and discuss its mechanism as a key to suspicion of ALCAPA syndrome.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare congenital coronary anomaly affecting one of every 300,000 live births. The enlarged, tortuous right coronary artery (RCA) and its collaterals provide retrograde course to supply the left ventricle (LV) then preferentially direct into the lower pressure pulmonary artery system causing a coronary steal phenomenon. Patients without collateral vessels have the infant type, in which global myocardial ischemia is a major cause of death in early life. If the patient is left untreated, up to 90% die within the first year of life. Few patients who survive through adulthood without surgery must have abundant, well-formed inter-coronary collaterals with adequate perfusion of the LV. Symptomatic adult patients with ALCAPA syndrome may present with myocardial infarction, LV dysfunction or mitral regurgitation (MR).

We present the oldest reported patient with ALCAPA to undergo corrective surgery.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^1118Z27r]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Fifty-four patients with scimitar syndrome and imaging +/− operative notes were identified. Of these, 3 patients (1 male and 2 female) with ALCAPA were identified, representing an incidence of 5.5% (95% CI: 0–11.67%). In all three patients, the anomalous coronary arising from the pulmonary artery was the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and in all three patients, the point of origin was close to the pulmonary arterial bifurcation. The left anterior descending coronary artery arose from the left coronary sinus. The patients are discussed below and summarized in Table 1.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^112UhtEv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With the development of imaging techniques, more asymptomatic adult-type ALCAPA patients could be diagnosed early in childhood or adolescence. Suspicion of ALCAPA should be raised when the echocardiograph shows a large RCA or a retrograde flow in the LCA. Early surgery is also necessary for asymptomatic children or adolescents with ALCAPA.

### A rare case of anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery in an adult patient [^115s8Zfi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is an uncommon congenital anomaly affecting 1/300,000 live births. As pulmonary artery (PA) pressure lowers to a third that of systemic pressure during the neonatal period, left coronary flow will tend to reverse into the pulmonary artery (PA) resulting in coronary steal and a left to right shunt, with subsequent decreased myocardial perfusion and volume overload. The vast majority of patients present with heart failure secondary to myocardial ischemia or die during infancy. Because patients with symptoms should be operated, it is seldom identified in adults. Survivors have developed significant collateral flow from the right coronary artery (RCA) and secondary dilatation of the coronary arteries.

We present herein an unusual case of ALCAPA seen in one of the oldest patient ever reported.

### Reconstruction of anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery in an adult patient: a case report [^112Cw3nn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA; also called Bland–White–Garland syndrome) is a rare, congenital, cardiac anomaly caused by a coronary arterial malformation during the early stages of heart development. Unless this anomaly is properly treated during infancy, ALCAPA usually leads to death within the first year of life due to myocardial ischemia in the left coronary artery (LCA) region and acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. However, adults have been reported to survive without symptoms due to the development of a collateral circulation from the right coronary artery (RCA) to the LCA. However, even in such cases, surgery is essential to prevent heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In this study, we report the surgical correction of ALCAPA in a 62-year-old female.

### Midterm outcome after surgical correction of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^114PmZQD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare congenital abnormality that affects 1 of every 300,000 live births and accounts for 0.25%– 0.5% of all congenital heart defects. There are two types of ALCAPA: the infant type and the adult type, each of which has different manifestations and outcomes. If left untreated, about 90% of patients of infant type die within the 1st year of life. However, some adult type patients do not present with symptoms until later in life. These older patients often manifest their anomalies as mitral regurgitation (MR), ischemic cardiomyopathy, malignant dysrhythmias, or even sudden death. So a diagnosis of ALCAPA indicates immediate surgical intervention regardless of the age level except for the newborn.

Multiple techniques have been introduced to establish a 2-coronary artery system artery, including coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary baffling procedures, and direct reimplantation of the left coronary artery (LCA) to the aorta. Although early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention lead to excellent results, the possibility of postoperative complications such as persistent MR, late-onset congestive heart failure, and arterial stenosis necessitates long term follow-up. We herein present 16 patients with ALCAPA and discuss the midterm outcome in patients with ALCAPA undergoing a primary LCA reimplantation and Takeuchi repair.

### Asymptomatic ALCAPA with preserved myocardial function in a 3-year-old child [^114gYpvh]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital anomaly. Its clinical course is typically severe in infancy, leading to left ventricular ischemia, cardiogenic shock, and high mortality without surgical intervention. We describe a rare case of a 3-year-old girl diagnosed with ALCAPA, showing extensive right-to-left collaterals, preserved left ventricular function, and minimal myocardial injury.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, scimitar syndrome, and aortic coarctation [^1134qg6b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) represents one of the most common causes of myocardial ischemia in infants and if left untreated results in a high mortality rate. When ALCAPA coexists with other congenital malformations, particularly those associated with pulmonary hypertension, the initial presentation can be quite confusing and is often misinterpreted. We report an infant with ALCAPA associated with scimitar syndrome and aortic coarctation whose clinical course illustrates the complexities and difficulties of management with a successful outcome.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^114QfEPL]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Scimitar syndrome (also known as congenital pulmonary venolobar syndrome) is a rare but well-recognized constellation of cardiopulmonary abnormalities comprising partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung to the inferior vena cava, often associated with hypoplasia of the right lung and its branch pulmonary artery, dextrocardia and systemic arterial supply to the right lower lobe. Of patients with scimitar syndrome, 19–31% are reported to have further associated congenital cardiac malformations, the most common associated cardiac abnormalities being atrial septal defects, with a reported coincidence of 70%. Less commonly reported associations include tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defects, aortic coarctation, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, cor triatriatum, bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic stenosis. Coronary artery anomalies are reported to be a rare association.

Following the identification of anomalous origin of the left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (LCx-ALCAPA) (Fig. 1) in an infant being worked up for surgical correction of scimitar syndrome in our institution, we performed a Pubmed search that identified very few published case reports of ALCAPA found in association with scimitar syndrome. We therefore undertook a retrospective review of all scimitar syndrome cases investigated at our center to determine the frequency of ALCAPA in patients with scimitar syndrome and the clinical ramifications associated with this combination of congenital malformations.

### Reconstruction of anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery in an adult patient: a case report [^116nZ1g8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

ALCAPA is a rare congenital, coronary artery malformation with a reported incidence of 1/300,000 live births, accounting to 0.25–0.5% of all diagnosed cases of congenital heart diseases. In ALCAPA, the LCA that originates from the PA causes myocardial ischemia in the LCA region. The neonatal closure of the ductus arteriosus and physiological reduction in the pulmonary vascular resistance results in early occurring left-ventricular dysfunction and ischemic mitral regurgitation. As a result, over 90% of neonatal patients diagnosed with ALCAPA die within 1 year of birth. However, because of the development of a collateral circulation from the RCA, a small number of such patients survive until adulthood without suffering from myocardial ischemia. Nevertheless, even in such asymptomatic cases, sudden death may occur due to coronary steal; therefore, immediate surgical intervention is necessary after diagnosis. In the present case, exercise load electrocardiogram and adenosine-loading myocardial scintigraphy indicated the presence of myocardial ischemia.

In ALCAPA, it is necessary to revascularize the arterial blood to improve the perfusion of the LCA. The most physiologically compatible method of revascularization is to directly transplant the origin of the LCA to the aorta; however, in adults the mobility of the tissues surrounding the LCA are poor, making transplantation difficult. Several tunneling method had been reported and the Takeuchi repair has been proposed. In Takeuchi repair method, a tunnel in the wall of the main PA is constructed from the LCA to the ascending aorta. Although several adult patients have been treated using this procedure have been reported, stenosis within the tunnel or just above the pulmonary valve is reported as the long-term complications. Therefore, alternate procedures involving aortic or PA wall flaps to extend the LCA and those for performing coronary artery bypass surgery with LCA ligation have been reported. As the number of cases of adults with ALCAPA is less, no standard surgical approach has yet been defined. We selected our method for two main reasons.

### ALCAPA in children with complex congenital heart disease: a multicenter study [^112Yn68U]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

We sought to report characteristics and outcomes of children with complex anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and to compare the outcomes to children with isolated ALCAPA. We performed a retrospective data analysis of children with ALCAPA who underwent cardiac surgery between 1/2009 and 3/2018 at 21 centers. Characteristics and outcomes of patients with complex ALCAPA are provided using descriptive statistics. Outcomes were compared between complex ALCAPA and isolated ALCAPA using Fisher's exact test. We reviewed 258 patients who underwent surgical repair of ALCAPA at 21 centers. We identified 10 patients (3.9%) with complex ALCAPA. Median age at initial cardiac surgery was 49 days (range: 4 days, 12.8 years). Cardiac lesions associated with ALCAPA were HLHS (n = 3); scimitar syndrome (n = 2); VSD with aortic coarctation (n = 2); VSD with right pulmonary artery discontinuity (1); DORV with mitral atresia (n = 1); and ToF (n = 1). ALCAPA was diagnosed prior to surgical intervention in 1 patient; during the initial cardiac surgery in 4 patients; in the early postoperative period via cardiac catheterization in 3 patients; and later in childhood after initial surgical repair in 2 patients. Following ALCAPA repair, patients with complex ALCAPA, as compared to patients with isolated ALCAPA, were more likely to be placed on ECMO (50% vs 12%, p = 0.002), receive CPR (30% vs 6%, p = 0.017), or suffer operative mortality (50% vs 3%, p < 0.001). Complex ALCAPA is uncommon. All but one with complex ALCAPA was not diagnosed preoperatively and postoperative morbidity and mortality were significantly greater in these complex patients compared to patients with isolated ALCAPA.

### Past, present, and future of surgical treatment of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^117FYj7d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, with advancements in surgical techniques and the widespread utilization of extracorporeal cardiac assist devices such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the treatment outcomes for ALCAPA (Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery) have demonstrated significant improvements. However, the surgical indications and methods of ALCAPA, especially the surgical methods of ALCAPA with intramural coronary artery, and whether to treat MR at the same time are still controversial. The long-term prognosis remain discouraging simultaneously, with significant variations in outcomes across different centers. The present review specifically addresses these aforementioned concerns. This article reviews the pathophysiology and classification, diagnosis, indications, surgical strategy and prognosis of ALCAPA. We believe that this review will provide some reference for future researchers and provide new ideas for reducing the adverse prognosis of children with congenital heart disease in future.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) presenting with ventricular fibrillation in an adult: a case report [^116iNoSa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In approximately one percent of the general population a coronar artery anomaly (CAA) is found. A CAA may involve an abnormal number, origin and/or course, termination or structure of the coronary arteries. Most CAAs are discovered as incidental findings during coronary angiography and are clinically insignificant. However, some CAAs are associated with clincal manifestations such as sudden cardiac death, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia (fixed or episodic) or congestive heart failure.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital anomaly occurring in 1 of 300.000 births. Anomalous origin of a coronary artery was first described in1882 by Brooks. However, the first clinical description was not published until 1933 by Bland, White and Garland, and the condition is also known as Bland-White-Garland-syndrome.

In patients with ALCAPA the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure decrease shortly after birth, along with oxygen content of the pulmonary artery. This causes a drop in antegrade flow and oxygen content of the anomalous left coronary artery, leading to myocardial ischemia. This may progress to myocardial infarction during periods of increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Collateral circulation between the right and left coronary systems ensues and left coronary artery flow reverses and enters the pulmonary trunk due to the low pulmonary arterial pressure (coronary steal phenomena). Consequently, the myocardium remains inadequately perfused (fixed ischemia).

The typical clinical course is severe left sided heart failure and significant mitral valve insufficiency, presenting at the age of one to two months, where the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. Initial symptoms are feeding difficulties, irritability, diaphoresis, tachypnoea and tachycardia. Chest pain due to myocardial ischemia could be mistaken with infantile colic.

However, in some cases collateral blood supply from the right coronary artery may be sufficient and the patient could pass through childhood with relatively minor symptoms. In adult life symptoms may range from dyspnoea, chest pain and exercise intolerance to sudden cardiac death due to acute ischemia during exercise or malignant ventricular arrhythmias generated from myocardial scar tissue.

### Recommendations for multimodality assessment of congenital coronary anomalies: a guide from the American Society of Echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111rEPGY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) — diagnostic priorities and echocardiographic hallmarks are outlined as follows: ALCAPA is a rare but treatable cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in infants and children and should be ruled out at presentation; echocardiography is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice in ALCAPA, though other imaging may be needed when uncertain; characteristic transthoracic echocardiography findings include direct visualization of the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) from the pulmonary artery (PA) by 2D imaging, retrograde color flow Doppler from the LCA into the PA, and extensive right coronary artery (RCA) dilation and tortuosity on 2D imaging.

### Surgical angioplasty of stenotic left main coronary artery 15 years after ALCAPA repair [^113UErfm]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Studies regarding long-term results after repair of anomalous left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) have mainly focused on survival rates, left ventricular function, and mitral valve function. The development of left main coronary stenosis following repair has been infrequently reported and its incidence unknown. Optimal therapy is also not known. Here we report the use of surgical angioplasty to achieve revascularization of a stenotic left main coronary artery in a patient with ALCAPA who had undergone coronary transfer 15 years earlier.

### Anomalous left coronary artery connected to the pulmonary artery associated with other cardiac defects: a difficult joint diagnosis [^113FmtAQ]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Anomalous left coronary artery connected to the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) can be associated rarely with other congenital heart defects. The preoperative joint diagnosis is challenging. From 1987 to 2012, a retrospective bicentric assessment of 12 patients with ALCAPA related to other cardiac defects focused on the associated heart defect, the moment of complete diagnosis related to surgery, and outcome. Coarctation was the most frequently associated heart defect (n = 5) followed by tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia (n = 3). The study group comprised one case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, one right aortic arch, one congenital mitral malformation, and one infant with divided left atrium and anomalous pulmonary venous return. Only four patients had a complete diagnosis of both the cardiac defect and the coronary abnormality before surgery. In two cases, the coronary anomaly was discovered during surgery performed for another cardiac defect and treated at the same time. The diagnosis of the six remaining patients was determined after cardiac repair. Of the 12 patients, 7 (58%) died after surgery. Half of these patients died within the first 30 days after repair. At this writing, the remaining patients are in good health after a median follow-up period of 5.4 years (range, 2.1–8.5 years). This study confirmed that ALCAPA associated with other cardiac defects often is misdiagnosed before surgery, mostly due to specific hemodynamics masking myocardial ischemia preoperatively. Survival was compromised due to the unrecognized diagnosis of an associated coronary abnormality but also because of midterm complications related to the other cardiac defects.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^112kh2Rp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present data on 9 patients diagnosed in childhood or adolescence with ALCAPA syndrome whose ages were between 5 and 16 years. Only one patient developed symptoms (apsychia), whereas other patients were asymptomatic, and there was no evident left ventricular dysfunction found in all the cases. ALCAPA syndrome mostly presents at the very beginning of life. Asymptomatic ALCAPA patients diagnosed in childhood or adolescence are even rarer and there are only a few cases reported.

ALCAPA also can be accompanied by other congenital heart diseases, but it is mostly an isolated malformation. In these cases, one patient had a VSD and a dextropositioned aorta. Different imaging modalities were applied for the diagnosis of ALCAPA and they revealed the presence of collateral arteries. The main protective mechanism of ALCAPA patients is the development of collaterals which supply oxygenated blood from RCA to LCA. When coronary steal syndrome arose or the collateral vessels were stenosed, those who survived the infantile period may present with symptoms. ST changes and Q waves in the anterior and lateral leads are common ECG changes in ALCAPA patients. In our series, ECG changes were observed in 7 (77.8%) patients. Echocardiography made the early diagnosis of ALCAPA in most of our patients and would play a more important role in the early diagnosis of asymptomatic adult-type ALCAPA in childhood or adolescence. The poor image quality in patients with difficult echo windows is the main limitation of echocardiography. It is also difficult to visualize the anomalous origin of LCA in the echocardiography. CT and CMR can directly provide visualization of the coronary artery anatomy with 3D reconstruction. Moreover, CMR could assess the size and function of biventricular and estimate abnormalities and shunts of the valve. Coronary angiography could provide the detailed visualization of collaterals and quantify the left to right shunt.

### Midterm outcome after surgical correction of an anomaly of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^11391WNJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease in children, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 300,000 live births. Myocardial ischemia is the main pathological manifestation, often leading to left ventricular hypofunction and mitral regurgitation. Early establishment of dual coronary circulation is currently the main surgical approach. Approximately 90% of patients who are left untreated die within the first year of life. Proper evaluation and management, including diagnostic techniques and medical treatment, can result in satisfactory clinical outcomes.

Left ventricular function and mitral regurgitation were major factors associated with hospital mortality and reoperation. Because infants lack collateral vessels, left heart function and mitral regurgitation tend to be severe while operation. However, postoperative recovery is unclear compared with that in the non-infants. Many studies have explored the need for concomitant mitral valve (MV) repair to reduce the incidence of reoperation. However, few studies have compared left ventricular function and reoperation between different age groups.

The purpose of this study was to review the midterm surgical results of ALCAPA repair, evaluate the recovery of left ventricular function and rates of reoperation.

### Midterm outcome after surgical correction of an anomaly of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^114AMGs5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

ALCAPA is a serious condition, but its early and mid-term outcomes are excellent. Early reconstruction of the dual coronary system and restoration of coronary blood yield satisfactory results, with improvements in left ventricular function in survivors. Lower left ventricular dysfunction of pre-operation was the major risk of mortality in-hospital. Concomitant mitral valve repair did not increase perioperative risk, but mitral regurgitation needs to be observed during follow-up, although the incidence of reoperation is not high. The rate of freedom from reoperation did not differ significantly between the infant group and the noninfant group.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^112AYiDu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

We retrospectively studied nine consecutive patients who were diagnosed with ALCAPA in childhood or adolescence from the database of our institution between the years 2010 and 2016. We obtained their clinical and demographic information from patients' records. The diagnosis of these patients was not established in the infantile period except for who was diagnosed with congenital heart disease when he was hospitalized for "cough".

### Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in infants and toddlers misdiagnosed as myocarditis [^116mBNkm]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart defect. Children with this anomaly are usually asymptomatic at birth and develop symptoms later on in life, which may mimic myocarditis. We sought to delineate clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological aspects of this anomaly.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of children with ALCAPA evaluated in a tertiary medical center in southern Israel was performed. A computerized search for all patients with the diagnosis of ALCAPA between 2000 and 2011 was performed. The medical records were reviewed; demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted.

Results

A total of 9 patients were included. In 4 patients, acute deterioration required evaluation in the pediatric emergency medicine department; in all 4, the initial clinical suspicion was myocarditis. Failure to thrive was recorded in 7 (77.7%) of the 9 patients and asthma or wheezing were recorded in 5 (55.5%) of the 9 patients. Normal heart size was recorded in 4 (44.4%) of the 9 patients. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in all of the patients (100%). A total of 141,675 births were recorded during the study period, giving an incidence of at least 1 case (0.00635%) per 15,741 births.

Conclusions

Children evaluated in the emergency medicine department with suspected myocarditis should be evaluated specifically for ALCAPA. The clinical findings that should raise the suspicion of this anomaly are failure to thrive and either a diagnosis of asthma or recurrent wheezing.

### Echocardiographic diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcomes of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^111R4999]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare condition that can be difficult to diagnose by echocardiography alone. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and echocardiographic presentation of ALCAPA, create a set of critical echocardiographic diagnostic criteria, and report outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with isolated ALCAPA at two major cardiac centers between 1990 and 2015.

Results

Of the 37 patients identified, only 54% presented in infancy. The anomalous coronary artery (CA) origin was clearly imaged in only 54% of echocardiographic examinations. However, other consistently identified echocardiographic markers were found, including left CA flow reversal (91%), collateral CA flow (85%), right CA dilation (81%), abnormal pulmonary artery flow (79%), mitral regurgitation (74%), left ventricular dysfunction (66%) and endocardial fibroelastosis (57%). Presenting echocardiograms had five of seven markers in 85% of patients. Left ventricular dysfunction was the most common marker in infants (89% vs 38%, P = 0.005); older children were more likely to have collateral formation visualized by color Doppler (100% vs 75%, P = 0.04). Following surgery, there were no early surgical deaths. The median follow-up duration was 10.3 years. At last follow-up, 92% had normal left ventricular function, 3% had moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and 17% had required reintervention.

Conclusions

Echocardiographic markers can reliably identify ALCAPA; these markers vary with the age of presentation. Surgical outcomes are excellent, and most patients will recover left ventricular and mitral valve function.

Conclusion

The combination of ALCAPA and PDA carries a special risk. High awareness must be maintained, and any clues for the diagnosis have to be fully pursued prior to PDA repair. An unusual post-surgical course following PDA repair requires a high index of suspicion and immediate appropriate evaluation for ALCAPA, preferably with angiography.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) — surgical management: Surgical correction is performed to re-establish anterograde flow from the aorta to the left coronary artery, and surgical intervention is indicated in all patients whenever the lesion is identified, regardless of age. Direct reimplantation of the anomalous coronary artery into the aorta is the surgery of choice and often results in rapid recovery of myocardial function with excellent overall survival. Alternative approaches such as the Takeuchi procedure rely on creation of a tunnel from the pulmonary artery to the aorta for unfavorable anatomy but are associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications, including supravalvular pulmonary stenosis and baffle leaks; long-term remodeling after repair most commonly results in improved left ventricular geometry, increased left ventricular ejection fraction, and decreased mitral regurgitation, although diastolic dysfunction from previous myocardial ischemia and infarction frequently persists.

### Analysis of perioperative and long-term outcomes among presentations of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery diagnosed beyond infancy versus during infancy [^1121Nkjn]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA) typically presents in infancy; however, there are cases of patients who survive the infant period and present later in life. We aimed to characterize patients with late ALCAPA diagnoses and to assess perioperative and functional outcomes. A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent ALCAPA repair between 1996 and 2020 at Boston Children's Hospital was performed. This cohort was divided into early ALCAPA (< 1 year) and late ALCAPA (≥ 1 year) groups. Perioperative data were collected. Longitudinal functional assessments were made by echocardiography, exercise stress test, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The median age of the late ALCAPA group was 7.6 years with 25% (6/24) of patients over 18 years. The late ALCAPA group was more likely to present as an incidental finding (63%) and required less preoperative intervention compared to the early group. On preoperative echocardiogram, the late ALCAPA group had less moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (16.7% vs 62%, p < 0.001) or left ventricular dysfunction (16.7% vs 89%, p < 0.001) compared to the early group. Reoperation was uncommon, and both groups demonstrated almost complete resolution of mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction over time. There are important differences between late and early ALCAPA subtypes. Revascularization results in excellent outcomes in both early and late groups, but long-term surveillance of ALCAPA patients is warranted as they may have functional deficits after repair.

### Long-term myocardial scarring after operation for anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^116mywQW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a very rare disease. Accordingly, the incidence and distribution of myocardial scarring in long-term follow-up of patients after successful surgery of ALCAPA is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the distribution of left ventricular (LV) myocardial scarring by late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance in these patients.

Methods

Fourteen consecutive patients over 12 years of age with ALCAPA without any further cardiac abnormalities, and after corrective surgery at our center, participated prospectively in this study. All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance including LV function analysis and late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance. Of these 14 patients, 12 patients also underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

Results

Four patients had no evidence of myocardial scarring. The median extent of the myocardial scar of all patients by late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance, expressed as a percentage of the total LV myocardial volume, was only 2% (range, 0% to 11%). Median LV ejection fraction was 0.55 (range, 0.31 to 0.73). Median LV end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area was 84 mL/m(2) (39 to 120 mL/m(2)). Median peak oxygen uptake during cardiopulmonary exercise was 24 mL · kg(-1) · minute(-1) (range, 19 to 51 mL/kg/minute).

Conclusions

We conclude that despite often severely compromised LV function and evidence of scarring before corrective surgery of patients with ALCAPA, in long-term follow-up scar tissue is relatively scarce.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^1119i8JK]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

With a high index of suspicion and the advent of low-dose, high-quality cardiovascular CT, used in conjunction with invasive angiography, we believe we have uncovered a clinically important association between two rare clinical entities.

We suggest that any patient presenting with scimitar syndrome should be investigated in a manner that allows the diagnosis of ALCAPA and other associations to be made. Given its noninvasive nature and ability to simultaneously image the lungs, cardiovascular CT is the most appropriate first-line investigation for patients with suspected scimitar syndrome on echocardiography.

### Atypical presentation of anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^117WnzJq]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital anomaly that usually presents in childhood. Ninety percent of the patients with ALCAPA die within the first year of life without surgical intervention. In adults, ALCAPA is associated with left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and sudden death. The present report describes the case of an adult patient who presented with an abnormal stress test and ALCAPA was diagnosed during cardiac catheterization.

### Myocardial perfusion, scarring, and function in anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery syndrome: a long-term analysis using magnetic resonance imaging [^114hv7zR]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart defect. We aimed to examine the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the long-term surveillance of repaired ALCAPA with regard to myocardial scarring, wall motion abnormalities, perfusion deficits, and myocardial function.

Methods

Twenty-one patients after direct reimplantation of ALCAPA (median age at operation, 2.8 years) were examined after a median 10.6 years by MRI at rest and under dobutamine stress conditions, echocardiography, and ergometry. Results were compared with preoperative, immediately postoperative (5 days), and intermediate-term (5.8 years) echocardiography.

Results

No early or late deaths occurred. Improvements in indexed left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, ejection fraction, and mitral valve function were observed in all patients. However, MRI at rest showed wall motion abnormalities in 67% and perfusion deficits in 28%. Myocardial scars were seen in 67%. Dobutamine stress MRI detected wall motion abnormalities in 19% and perfusion deficits in 14%, which were not seen on MRI at rest. Exercise testing did not reflect cardiac dysfunction.

Conclusions

Although long-term follow-up showed global left ventricular function had improved after ALCAPA repair, MRI showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, perfusion deficits, and myocardial scarring were seen in many patients. Dobutamine stress MRI identified deficits that were not evident on MRI at rest, and can therefore be considered a valuable surveillance tool. These results suggest the need for lifelong surveillance of repaired ALCAPA.

Synthetic interposition graft from the aorta to the origin of the left coronary artery.

Central Message

We demonstrated repair of an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery in an adult on a beating heart with pump assist.

Anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) syndrome is rare and carries a poor prognosis if untreated. We present a case of adult ALCAPA repaired with a synthetic interposition graft on a beating heart with cardiopulmonary bypass assistance. To our knowledge, this represents the first case of ALCAPA managed with this technique (institutional review board approval #014–209; August 10, 2023; consent waived).

### ALCAPA: the role of myocardial viability studies in determining prognosis [^112DwGmq]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

ALCAPA is optimally treated by coronary artery reimplantation early in neonatal life. Delayed diagnosis, however, is not infrequent, because symptoms often do not manifest until about 3 months of age, coinciding with the physiological nadir in pulmonary vascular resistance. With delayed diagnosis, there is potential for coronary steal and irreversible myocardial injury, which worsens outcome.

Objective

To assess the utility of MRI in determining prognosis in children with surgically corrected ALCAPA.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed in two children with ALCAPA who underwent coronary reimplantation and postoperative cardiac MRI. Both children subsequently underwent cardiac transplantation. The imaging findings and pathological findings at explant are presented.

Results

In both children, there was severe, globally depressed left ventricular systolic function and abnormal delayed enhancement in a predominantly subendocardial distribution. Pathological examination of the cardiac explants showed extensive fibrotic tissue, which correlated with areas of abnormal delayed enhancement on MRI.

Conclusion

Severe reduction in systolic function and presence of delayed enhancement indicate extensive myocardial injury and pathologically correlate with irreversible fibrotic changes, which may help identify a subgroup of children who will not recover ventricular function and ultimately require heart transplantation.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) — recommended imaging strategy states that transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) "should be the primary screening tool and is usually diagnostic in suspected ALCAPA in infants and children". Confirmation with cardiac computed tomography (CCT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) "should be reserved for cases where the anatomy is unclear; cardiac catheterization is rarely needed for diagnosis". After surgical repair, "CCT and/or CMR may be used when there are concerns about coronary anatomy and/or persistent myocardial perfusion abnormalities". Supportive echocardiographic findings include "Prominent intramyocardial color Doppler signals within ventricular septum and LV myocardium due to dilated RCA collaterals", "Significant LV chamber dilation and dysfunction", and "Mitral valve papillary muscle fibrosis with significant MR".

### Congenital anomalies of coronary arteries in children: the evaluation of 22 patients [^112PtYH5]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although congenital coronary artery anomalies are seen in 0.6–1% of adult patients undergoing coronary angiography, the data for the pediatric population are few. This study of 22 children with coronary artery anomalies evaluated them in terms of demographic and clinical features and analyzed their angiographic findings and surgical results. Databases in the Department of Pediatric Cardiology at the University of Uludag were searched for all the patients with a diagnosis of congenital coronary artery anomaly who underwent coronary angiography between 1993 and 2013. Patients with coexistent congenital heart disease were excluded from the study. The study noted 22 patients (0.9%; 10 boys and 11 girls) with coronary artery anomalies. The mean age of these patients was 58.77 ± 52.04 months (range, 1 month-16 years). Coronary arteriovenous fistula (50%) and anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) (36%) were the most common anomalies. In addition, the study included one patient with diffuse coronary artery hypoplasia, one patient with muscular bridge, and one patient with left main coronary artery originating from the right aortic sinus valsalva. Of the 11 patients who had coronary atrioventricular fistula, 7 were asymptomatic, whereas 75% of the patients with ALCAPA syndrome were admitted because of heart failure. Although 13 patients had an exact diagnosis by echocardiography, 50% of the patients with ALCAPA syndrome had their diagnosis determined by catheter angiography performed because of severe mitral regurgitation or dilated cardiomyopathy. The mortality rate for all the patients was found to be 18.1%. Eight patients with coronary arteriovenous fistula have been followed up without surgery to the present. In contrast, seven patients with ALCAPA syndrome have undergone surgery, and three have died. Two of these patients died during the postoperative period, and the remaining patient died suddenly during the preoperative period at home. Isolated congenital coronary artery anomalies are very rare in the pediatric population. Although most congenital coronary artery anomalies are clinically silent, they may be associated with severe symptoms in children. Recognition of potentially serious anomalies such as ALCAPA syndrome is mandatory so that early surgical treatment can be prescribed.

### N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in patients with anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery [^114LQyLW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main site of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) synthesis and release is the cardiac ventricle, which releases BNP in response to stretch due to increased blood volume or pressure. Previous work has established the role of NT-pro-BNP in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure (HF). NT-pro-BNP has also been indicated as a strong independent prognostic factor in patients with various congenital heart disease s (CHD). However, the presentation of natriuretic peptides in ALCAPA has rarely been reported.

ALCAPA is a rare but potentially fatal CHD which is associated with adult sudden death and early infant mortality. Currently the most effective treatment is surgical coronary artery rebuilding while the prognosis is poor if left untreated. ALCAPA is conventionally divided into two types, which present in infants or adults. In infants, little or no collateral coronary circulation develops and there is early onset of symptoms when pulmonary artery (PA) pressure falls after closure of the ductus arteriosus. Without surgical intervention, most patients die within several months due to LV dysfunction. Survival of adult patients relies on a dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with extensive coronary collaterals and a restrictive opening between the PA and ALCAPA. With ongoing subclinical myocardial ischemia, these patients may be asymptomatic until adulthood. At a mean age of 35 years, there is an estimated 80% incidence of sudden death in the adults. Arrhythmias and ventricle dysfunction triggered by inadequate perfusion are the main causes of complications in patients with ALCAPA. Mortality and morbidity of ALCAPA patients were associated with LVEF and MR, finally associated with heart function. The role of NT-pro-BNP in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure is distinct. However the relationship between NT-pro-BNP and LVEF, the grade of MR in patients with ALCAPA remained unknown.

The aim of our study was to identify the difference in NT-pro-BNP levels between the two types of ALCAPA and if there was any correlation between elevated NT-pro-BNP and LVEF or MR grade.

### Very late presentation of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: case report [^113jF48G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly. The enlarged right coronary artery provides retrograde collaterals to supply the left ventricle then preferentially directs into the lower pressure pulmonary artery system causing coronary steal phenomenon. Few patients who survive through adulthood without surgery must have abundant, well-formed functioning collaterals with adequate perfusion of the left ventricle. We present the oldest reported patient with ALCAPA to undergo corrective surgery.

Case Presentation

A 79-year-old woman presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination discovered a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent flow from color Doppler. Moreover, there was a severe mitral regurgitation from posterior mitral leaflet restriction associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation. Coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia suggesting adequate collateral circulation. Remarkably, there was a left coronary ostial stenosis, which served as a protective mechanism against myocardia ischemia by limiting the steal effect. The patient successfully underwent the ligation of anomalous artery at its origin in combination with bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. Her postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusions

This case utilized multimodality imaging for delineating the course of abnormal vessels and helping to formulate therapeutic decision.

### Bland-white-Garland syndrome of anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA): a historical review [^115A6GHq]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The landmark 1933 case report from Massachusetts General Hospital by Bland, White and Garland (Am Heart J 8:787–801) described a 3-month-old child with progressive feeding problems, cardiomegaly on chest radiography, and EKG evidence of left ventricular damage. Of interest was the fact that the vigilant father of the infant was Aubrey Hampton, a radiologist and future chairman of radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. At autopsy, the left coronary artery originated from the pulmonary artery rather than from the aorta. Effective treatment for this condition was not available until 1960 when Sabiston, Neill and Taussig showed that the blood flowed from the left coronary artery toward the pulmonary artery. The anomalous left coronary artery was ligated at its junction with the pulmonary artery and the child survived. This historical review of Bland-White-Garland syndrome, now known as anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), stresses the continued diagnostic significance of cardiomegaly on chest radiography and EKG changes suggesting left ventricular damage in 2- to 3-month-old infants with feeding intolerance or irritability. With a high index of suspicion, an echocardiogram can be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Modern surgical methods involve left coronary artery translocation and afford excellent outcomes.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

ALCAPA — pre-operative echocardiographic goals: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice in the identification of ALCAPA in infants, while cardiac CT, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and/or cardiac catheterization may be needed to confirm the diagnosis in some infants and in older children and adults when the diagnosis is unclear or acoustic windows are limited, particularly when there is associated congenital heart disease. Goals of pre-operative TTE with 2D and color Doppler include demonstration of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery and the direction of flow within the left coronary artery, and characterization of the normal origin of the right coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva and any dilation of the right coronary artery system by both color Doppler and 2D imaging.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

ALCAPA multimodality imaging beyond echocardiography — angiography, coronary computed tomography (CCT), and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) roles are complementary. Because no finding is 100% identified by echocardiography, other modalities may be required to make the diagnosis when suspicion remains high. Although angiography has been the gold standard for confirmation, CCT is now commonly used to confirm the origin and course of suspected cases and to delineate coronary anatomy after surgery; ALCAPA is best evaluated with a double oblique centerline through the PA, and once the origin is visualized, the centerline should be placed in the coronary artery to display vessel length and relationships to the aorta and PA. Both angiography and CCT are excellent techniques for post-operative assessment when there are concerns about CA patency, and CMR can also be quite useful in older children and adults before and after repair, including to assess for residual CA stenosis and/or thrombosis, degree of MR, and regional myocardial dysfunction or fibrosis at rest and with adenosine stress perfusion imaging.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery presenting in adulthood: a French nationwide retrospective study [^113DUDbd]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease usually diagnosed during the first months of life. Without surgical treatment, ALCAPA carries a high mortality risk, and disease presentation in adulthood is rare. We describe the diagnosis and management of patients presenting with ALCAPA in adulthood. This multicenter French nationwide retrospective study included adult patients diagnosed from 1980 to 2014. Eleven adult patients (mean age: 38 ± 17 years) were analyzed. All patients were symptomatic, presenting with chest pain, palpitations, heart failure, or syncope. Electrocardiogram was abnormal in 8 (73%) patients. Echocardiogram showed a mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 ± 13%, kinetic abnormalities in 5 (45%) patients, and significant mitral regurgitation in 8 (73%) patients. Coronary angiography was performed in 10 (91%) patients and confirmed the diagnosis. Computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and myocardial scintigraphy were performed when deemed necessary. Ten patients underwent reconstructive surgery, but 1 patient was not operated because of age. Four patients experienced postoperative complications including cardiogenic shock, heart failure, renal failure, or additional surgery. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, all 10 operated patients were alive and asymptomatic, and the nonoperated patient had died at the age of 70 from syncope related to ventricular tachycardia. ALCAPA may be diagnosed in adults. Although complications may occur postoperatively, long-term outcome is favorable in adult patients undergoing surgical correction. Surgery should be discussed as first-line therapy in adults with ALCAPA.

ALCAPA postoperative assessment — serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is essential, with attention to remodeling and residual lesions. Serial TTE evaluation after ALCAPA repair is essential to characterize the presence and extent of left ventricular (LV) remodeling, improvement in ventricular performance, and the decrease in degree of mitral regurgitation (MR). In most patients, there is significant improvement, but LV dysfunction and MR may persist and occasionally require additional intervention, including mitral valve repair/replacement and, in rare cases, heart transplantation. Ongoing assessment of LCA patency and adequacy of coronary artery (CA) supply to the LV is also essential, and stress echocardiography and deformation imaging provide insights into long-term myocardial reserve; postoperative imaging should also include evaluation of the main PA in patients who undergo Takeuchi-type repair to assess for main PA stenosis or baffling leak.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) presenting with ventricular fibrillation in an adult: a case report [^111E9Dfy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

85% of all cases of ALCAPA present within the first two months of life. However, symptoms may be misinterpreted (as in our case) or even be absent. In adult life patients with ALCAPA could present with symptoms of heart failure, mitral valve insufficiency, angina or arrhythmias. There are two potential substrates for arrhythmias in these patients. Firstly, areas with scar tissue after previous myocardial infarctions (MI) may alter the conduction in the left ventricle and become arrhythmogenic. Secondly, arrhythmias could be triggered from an acute ischemic event during exercise, where coronary steal phenomena may cause inadequate perfusion. Syncope due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest due to VF is therefore a major clinical presentation of ALCAPA in adults.

Objective findings include cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, and ECG may display an anterolateral infarct pattern. In children, the diagnosis can often be made by two-dimensional echocardiography with direct visualization of the abnormal origin of the left coronary artery and retrograde flow into the pulmonary artery. However, in adults the origins of the coronary arteries may be difficult to visualize, and in cases where the clinical suspicion is strong, a coronary angiography or CT-angiography should be performed.

In cases of ALCAPA several surgical treatment options have been proposed. Ligation of the anomalous artery at its origin in order to prevent coronary steal phenomena is one option, but this method depends on extensive collateral supply from the right coronary artery. An alternative percutaneous treatment approach was recently introduced by which the left coronary artery was closed by device embolization in a patient with large collaterals and coronary steal phenomena. Today surgical procedures are aimed at creating a two-coronary system either via 1) a bypass graft (mammary artery or saphenous vein) in combination with ligation of the anomalous artery, 2) the Takeuchi-procedure where an intrapulmonary tunnel from the aortopulmonary window to the coronary artery is created or 3) translocation of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk to the aortic sinus. The latter depends on the distance between the origin of the anomalous artery and the aorta, but is possible in the majority of the cases.

### Electrocardiogram of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in infants [^1134Y7Da]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram of an infant with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA, Bland-White-Garland syndrome) usually shows typical signs of an anterolateral myocardial infarction, manifested by abnormal Q waves in leads I, avL, V5, and V6, as well as by transient ST changes in these leads. Because 20–45% of such patients do not show abnormal Q waves, the diagnosis should be strongly suspected if there is an abnormal R wave progression in the chest leads.

### Anesthetic management in untreated bland-white-Garland syndrome: a case report and literature review [^115vqD6J]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bland-White-Garland syndrome (BWGS), also known as anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), is a rare congenital malformation affecting 1 in every 300,000 live births and represents 0.24–0.46% of all congenital cardiac diseases. It is characterized by high mortality due to chronic myocardial ischemia, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. If the adequate collateral circulation between right and left coronary artery exists, only about 10–15% of the patients survive to adulthood. However, in 80–90% of the BWGS cases, sudden cardiac death occurs within the first year of life. The survival depends greatly on an adequate collateral circulation between the left and right coronary arteries. Moreover, identification of dilated collaterals is often the first indication of pathology. Survival to adulthood is unusual, and patients over the age of 50 are rare.

Here, a rare case of a patient with BWGS will be presented, who also suffered from chronic biliary calculi. Although his cardiac function was in poor status and the risk of anesthesia was extremely high﻿, choledocholithiasis was the only chance for him to survive. This case is rare because it describes the anesthetic management of a patient with BWGS, and as far as the author knows there are very few studies that focus on the anesthetic management of patients with BWGS, especially ones undergoing noncardiac surgery.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^1166CTk6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In ALCAPA patients, MR is a common symptom that is observed early than even ventricular dysfunction. Our cases suggest that the accompaniment of dilated cardiomyopathy and MR is observed in asymptomatic children or adolescents with ALCAPA too. The timing of mitral valve repair at the time of ALCAPA remains controversial because mitral regurgitation degree may gradually decrease or remain stable in patients with preoperative mild and moderate mitral regurgitation without concomitant mitral valve repair, mitral valve repair or replacement is generally not necessary in this in this situation particularly in infants. However, some authors advocate routine mitral valve repair at the of coronary artery revascularization because early postoperative cardiac output is improved and operative mortality is reduced. We did not recommend concomitant mitral valve repair because mitral regurgitation in ALCAPA patients is related both to ischemic left ventricular dilatation with mitral annulus enlargement and to ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles and the mitral regurgitation may recover after the surgery. Moreover performing complex mitral valve repair is time-consuming, thus increasing the ischemic time, which may be deleterious in patients with compromised myocardial function. Due to the lifelong risk of ischaemia, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death due to cardiac arrest, surgery is the only definitive treatment of ALCAPA suggested even in asymptomatic adult patients. However, the treatment for asymptomatic children or adolescents with ALCAPA was not mentioned. Considering the abnormal coronary system, dilated cardiomyopathy, and MR, early surgery is also necessary to recover normal circulation and prevent long-term myocardial ischaemia and fibrosis.

### Adult ALCAPA: from histological picture to clinical features [^112Lc96E]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the late gadolinium-enhanced MRI findings, Schmitt et al. documented myocardial scarring caused by ischemia in 65% of adult ALCAPA patients who had undergone surgical correction, although all displayed good LV recovery. Browne et al. reported the cases of two children with ALCAPA who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation, and pathological examination of the cardiac explants in both cases showed extensive fibrotic tissue that correlated with the areas of abnormal delayed enhancement on their MRI scans.

Establishment of a dual coronary system is currently the accepted norm for correction of an ALCAPA in adults. The return of antegrade flow in the LCA has been associated with a reduction in size of the previously dilated RCA and regression of the intracoronary collateral network. Establishment of a dual coronary system can be achieved by various procedures, including a saphenous vein graft, left internal mammary graft, Takeuchi procedure, and direct implantation. Direct implantation is considered technically more difficult and hazardous in adults, but it provides a more physiologic correction and reestablishment of a dual coronary system with a better outcome. Schwartz et al. reported finding that the degree of preoperative mitral regurgitation is predictive of outcome, but that the severity of preoperative cardiac dysfunction and the magnitude of ventricular dilation are not. After undergoing an intrapulmonary baffling procedure, the majority of the patients develop supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, and several develop baffle leaks; many patients require reoperation for these complications.

### Aberrant left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery with patent ductus arteriosus-a case report and review of the literature [^112euBZW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Aberrant left coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a very rare congenital heart defect. Its coexistence with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is extremely rare. The high pressures created by the left-to-right shunt in the pulmonary arteries can delay symptoms and create a real challenge in diagnosing ALCAPA. Missing this diagnosis can have severe results, including extensive ischemia and sudden death.

Case Presentation

We present a case of an infant born with a large PDA. Initially treated conservatively, however, due to congestive heart failure and lack of weight gain, she underwent surgical ligation of the PDA at the age of four and a half months. Following surgery, she developed pulmonary edema. Echocardiography revealed decreased ventricular function. ECG revealed ST elevations on lateral leads, and serum troponin was significantly increased. The patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed signs of wall ischemia and decreased function of the left ventricle (LV) with unclear coronary anatomy. Diagnostic catheterization revealed an ALCAPA. She underwent surgical intervention, and the left coronary artery was re-implanted in the aortic sinus. Follow-up revealed slow improvement of cardiac function.

Discussion and Literature Review

The coexistence of PDA and ALCAPA is a very rare occurrence. We found at least 10 reported cases in the literature. Delayed diagnosis might be detrimental. The prognosis of these patients is variable.

Conclusion

An unusual post-surgical course following PDA repair requires a high index of suspicion and appropriate evaluation for ALCAPA, preferably with angiography.

### From asymptomatic adult patient to cardiopulmonary resuscitation-treatment of ALCAPA with total arterial myocardial revascularisation and mitral valve repair [^111TeEwc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 34-year-old female suffered a sudden witnessed collapse at work. Out-of-hospital cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was initiated and after 8 min and cardiac defibrillation spontaneous circulation was re-established. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and extubated the next day without neurological complications. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle with globally reduced ejection fraction of 40% due to ischemia, leading to fibrosis and malfunction of papillary muscles causing a tethering of the mitral valve leaflets. This resulted in secondary moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation. In addition, a mitral annular dilatation contributed further to the severity of the mitral valve insufficiency (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the right coronary artery ostium was found to be dilated (Fig. 1 B). The coronary angiogram and CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of ALCAPA syndrome (Fig. 1 C and D). Following the discussion of the case in our interdisciplinary heart team, the patient was scheduled for urgent surgical therapy.

### Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery reconstructed without cardiac arrest [^117NAuaM]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adults with ALCAPA typically present with subacute symptoms; however, these typically progress and there is high risk for cardiac death. Therefore, surgical intervention is recommended. Multiple strategies have been described to establish a dual-vessel coronary system.

Adults have a greater distance between the aorta and the origin of the ALCAPA and less tissue elasticity compared with pediatric populations, making direct coronary artery button transfer challenging if not unfeasible. Aortocoronary bypass with a saphenous vein or left internal thoracic artery conduit is feasible, but concern exists about long-term graft patency due to competitive flow. A Takeuchi repair is also possible, but is technically challenging and risks injury to surrounding structures. Due to these factors, including the ALCAPA origin location an interposition graft was chosen.

Interposition grafting to the LCA has been increasingly described, and multiple conduits have been utilized. Compared with the prior reports, our case is the first in the literature during which repair was performed on a beating heart. This was possible due to the extensive coronary vascular collateralization and accessible origin of the ALCAPA. Saphenous vein or radial arterial interposition grafting was considered; however, due to a lack of coronary artery disease, we elected to preserve these conduits in case future bypass is needed.

Adult ALCAPA is a rare diagnosis requiring surgical correction and synthetic interposition grafting is a promising approach in adults. We have demonstrated 1 such repair of ALCAPA in an adult on a beating heart with pump assist.

### Bland-white-Garland syndrome in pregnancy: reoperation of ALCAPA with an internal thoracic radial artery "Y"-graft [^116CFhmK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is rare and more so in the adult. Reimplantation of the left main coronary into the aorta is successful in early life, but it may be more difficult in the adult who had a previous repair. We report a successful reoperation of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in an adult patient using a left internal thoracic and radial artery "Y"-graft. Composite arterial grafting has become an established and straight forward technique in coronary surgery, and it is appropriate and recommended for congenital lesions in adults and at any age if necessary.

### Congenital aortic-left atrial tunnel with coarctation and anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: a first-of-its-kind case report [^112bgNNd]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Congenital tunnels between the aorta and atria are an extremely rare vascular anomaly with newborn clinical presentation ranging from clinically silent to cardiogenic shock. Aortic-left atrial tunnels have a much lower reported incidence than aortic-right atrial tunnels. Most of these cases have been associated with concurrent cardiac anomalies such as atrial septal defects. This is the first case to report a neonate with an aortic-left atrial tunnel with a concomitant ALCAPA, VSD, and coarctation of the aorta. Based on our patient's course, this becomes especially significant as infants diagnosed with ALCAPA are at high risk for myocardial infarction, congestive failure, and early death at less than 1 year of life. Although ALCAPA is most often an isolated anomaly it has been described in association with other cardiac defects, most commonly coarctation of the aorta.

### Recommendations for multimodality assessment of congenital coronary anomalies: a guide from the American Society of Echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1161SM8E]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) assessment emphasizes imaging windows and Doppler signs. Direct TTE visualization of the anomalous coronary artery origin from the pulmonary artery is best accomplished from parasternal short-axis and long-axis scan planes. The anomalous left coronary artery typically inserts into the posterior or leftward aspect of the main pulmonary artery near its usual left sinus of Valsalva origin. Identification of retrograde filling of the left coronary artery using color Doppler is an essential echocardiographic component of the diagnosis of ALCAPA; in a normal left coronary artery, color flow progresses away from the aortic root. In ALCAPA, color Doppler shows retrograde left coronary artery filling with flow reversal from myocardium to pulmonary artery and this flow can often be seen emptying into the main pulmonary artery, though very rarely persistent pulmonary hypertension can maintain antegrade flow so retrograde flow is not appreciated. In older patients with delayed presentation, extensive collateralization supplying the left ventricular myocardium results in right coronary artery vessels that become significantly dilated and tortuous with prominent color flow Doppler signals within the ventricular septum.

### Oxygen supplementation is helpful for the echocardiographic detection of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^117LDvBB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The echocardiographic diagnosis of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) can be challenging. The aim of this study was to assess the hypothesis that diagnosis can be enhanced by using supplemental oxygen, which decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and increases retrograde flow from the coronary artery into the pulmonary artery.

Methods

Demographic, echocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization data were reviewed in patients presenting with ALCAPA from 1999 to 2007.

Results

Twenty-one patients (seven male; median age, 5 months) presented with ALCAPA. Nine underwent imaging with oxygen. Two of these nine (22%) had previous standard echocardiographic studies that missed the diagnosis. Cardiac catheterization was required for diagnosis of ALCAPA in 42% of patients who underwent standard echocardiography compared with 11% of patients who received supplemental oxygen in addition to standard echocardiography. The administration of oxygen caused no significant change in heart rate or cardiorespiratory support.

Conclusion

Transient oxygen administration is useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of ALCAPA.

### Late complications after takeuchi repair of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: case series and review of literature [^1178WNSv]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart lesion that if left untreated, results in high mortality. Surgical treatment options include reimplantation of the anomalous coronary ostia, use of extracardiac arterial blood supply, or the Takeuchi procedure. The Takeuchi procedure involves creation of an aortopulmonary window and an intrapulmonary tunnel that baffles the aorta to the ostium of the anomalous left coronary artery. The incidence of late complications following the Takeuchi repair is unknown. The goal of our study was to determine the long-term outcome after palliation of ALCAPA using the Takeuchi Procedure. A total of 9 patients with a history of ALCAPA palliated with the Takeuchi procedure were identified from our surgical database. Chart review was performed. The mean age at time of Takeuchi procedure was 49.6 months (range 5 weeks-14.6 years). There was one late death, of unknown cause. Of the remaining 8 patients, the mean length of follow-up after surgery was 15.9 years (13.5–19.7 years). All 8 survivors had some degree of main pulmonary artery stenosis in the area of the intrapulmonary baffle, with moderate stenosis in 2 and severe stenosis in 1. Three late survivors (38%) had a baffle leak. Two patients (25%) had decreased left ventricular systolic function and 3 (38%) had developed at least moderate mitral valve regurgitation. Three of the 8 late survivors (38%) required a reoperation for repair of mitral valve regurgitation, baffle leak, and main pulmonary artery (MPA) stenosis. Review of literature demonstrated similar complication rates and need for reoperation following the Takeuchi procedure. Compared with patients after direct reimplantation for ALCAPA at our institution, there was no significant difference in late survival or freedom from reoperation. The Takeuchi procedure is a method to establish a two-coronary repair for ALCAPA. Late complications are common, necessitating lifelong care in a center experienced with caring for adults with congenital heart disease.

### Characteristics and surgical outcomes of patients with late presentation of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: a multicenter study [^1157Ceit]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

We sought to describe the clinical course and outcomes of patients who are diagnosed with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) after infancy. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent ALCAPA surgery between January 2009 to March 2018 at 21 US centers. Clinical presentation, inpatient management, and postoperative outcomes of patients repaired ≥ 1 year of age were described. To characterize this cohort, we compared these data to patients repaired before 1 year of age. Of 248 ALCAPA patients, 71 (29%) underwent repair ≥ 1 year of age. Among this subset, the median age at diagnosis was 8.3 years. Chronic arrhythmia occurred in 7%. Patients had good postoperative recovery of left ventricle (LV) dysfunction (90%) and LV dilation (75%), although a low incidence of recovery of mitral regurgitation (40%). Compared to infants, older patients were more likely to present with cardiac arrest (11% vs 1%) and less likely to have moderate or worse LV dysfunction or mitral regurgitation. Older patients had significantly less postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, and shorter ICU and hospital stay. In the older cohort, operative mortality occurred in only 1 patient and no patient died after discharge (median follow-up 2.7 years). Survival of patients who presented with ALCAPA beyond infancy was excellent, although chronic mitral regurgitation and chronic arrhythmia were not uncommon. Patients who underwent ALCAPA repair ≥ 1 year of age were less likely to present with LV dysfunction but more likely to present with cardiac arrest than younger patients.

### Aberrant left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery with patent ductus arteriosus-a case report and review of the literature [^113gaFUn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Angiography remains the gold standard for ALCAPA diagnosis; this is also reflected in the cases described in this paper. TTE can be very effective in finding this diagnosis, but the combination with PDA might limit its utility. This observation may be attributed to the substantial jet generated by the PDA into the pulmonary artery, along with the normal flow direction in the aberrant coronary artery. In our case, apart from TTE, the first modality chosen was cardiac MRI. This was to rule out other considered diagnoses, specifically myocarditis. MRI use is not common in this context. In our case, though it didn't directly reveal the ALCAPA, it strongly suggested it, and the diagnosis was finalized via angiography as mentioned before.

The prognosis of these patients is variable. Three patients died: one was diagnosed with a significant delay of two years and didn't survive the surgery, another, diagnosed on POD 2 after duct ligation, also didn't survive the re-implantation procedure. Both of these cases are from the 80s; surgical and anesthesia techniques and expertise have evolved since. The third case of mortality described an infant with severe comorbidity, a hypoplastic aortic arch, who was diagnosed in the operating room following weaning off bypass; he also didn't survive the surgery.

For surviving patients, prognosis appears to be good, although it was only described in four of the seven living cases. The long-term prognosis of patients with isolated ALCAPA is reported to be good. A large series describing more than 100 patients four years after corrective surgery reported very low mortality and normalization of the LV function in almost all patients.

In our case, seven months after surgical repair, the patient unfortunately continues to have a dilated LV with decreased fractional shortening, however, she is gaining weight gradually and managed mostly in the ambulatory setting.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) diagnosed in children and adolescents [^117Nxb97]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 9.5 years. One five-year-old boy was diagnosed with congenital heart disease when he was hospitalized for "cough" 4 years ago but did not undergo the surgical treatment. One five-year-old girl was diagnosed with endocardial fibroelastosis syndrome in another hospital and went through medical treatment; she was sent to our hospital after the mitral regurgitation worsened. Other patients were diagnosed in our hospital due to the pansystolic murmur at the left sternal border and the apex having been found in the regular physical examination (Table 1).

Table 1
ALCAPA syndrome diagnosed in children and adolescents: patient demographics, clinical, imaging data and outcome data

The pansystolic murmur was found in all the 9 patients. Seven patients (77.8%) had cardiomegaly on CXR; one patient (11.1%) appeared to be normal and another did not go through CXR. ECG changes in the lateral or precordial leads were recorded in 7 (77.8%) patients. Echocardiography could provide an initial diagnosis. All the patients (100%) showed sufficient LV function. MR was confirmed in six patients (66.7%) (Fig. 1) and two of them needed surgery. CT, CMR, or coronary angiography confirmed the diagnosis in all the patients. These methods identified a single large RCA derived from the aorta with extensive LCA-derived collaterals draining into the PA (Fig. 2).

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^114UMEVG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) occasionally require perioperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO). Outcomes and associations with survival in this cohort are poorly described. This study utilized an international database to identify the associations with mortality and cardiac non-recovery in children with ALCAPA receiving perioperative ECMO. Retrospective analysis was performed using the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry database for patients with ALCAPA undergoing ECMO cannulation between 2005 and 2022. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, and ECMO-related variables and complications were compared. Of 163 patients with ALCAPA analyzed, overall survival to discharge was 74%. Non-survivors had lower weight and suffered more complications on ECMO compared with survivors. In multivariable analysis, time to ECMO (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05), pre-ECMO pH (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.67), length of ECMO run (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.01), and presence of mechanical (OR 6.33, 95% CI 1.81–22.1) and neurologic complications (OR 7.6, 95% CI 2.1–27.9) had increased odds for poor outcome. Factors associated with mortality and cardiac non-recovery for patients with ALCAPA on ECMO include pre-ECMO variables and accrued complications on ECMO. Thoughtful consideration of timing of ECMO deployment and careful ECMO management to prevent complications are necessary to improve outcomes in this population.

### Repair of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) by sinus pouch technique [^111X26ZS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

ALCAPA causes myocardial ischemia, which leads to impaired cardiac function and MR. Various methods of coronary artery grafting have been reported, and necessity of intervention for MR has been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of ALCAPA with coronary artery implantation by applying sinus pouch technique, which has been reported in transposition of the great arteries.

### Anomalous right coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery: a report of 7 cases and a review of the literature [^112iWdGy]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the experience with anomalous right coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) at our institution.

Background

Anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare congenital defect affecting 0.002% of the population. Unlike anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), ARCAPA generally has not been considered to be a lethal defect in infancy or childhood, although case reports of sudden death exist. The natural history of ARCAPA is difficult to describe because of the relatively small number of cases reported. Medical knowledge of this defect has been collected from case reports alone. No pediatric series of ARCAPA has been published.

Methods

Hospital databases were retrospectively searched for cases of ARCAPA diagnosed at the New York Presbyterian Hospital over the past 25 years. A comprehensive literature search for case reports of ARCAPA was performed.

Results

Seven pediatric cases are described. The cases range in clinical presentation from a young infant with tetralogy of Fallot to an adolescent with chest pain on exertion. Only 1 patient came to medical attention because of chest pain; 6 patients were asymptomatic. In these 6, ARCAPA was diagnosed upon evaluation of either a murmur (3) or associated congenital heart disease (3). All 7 patients have undergone repair. One patient died after repair of complex tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia. One patient developed a thrombus in the dilated right coronary artery years after repair. The thrombus resolved with anticoagulation.

Conclusions

Anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is an uncommon coronary anomaly that, unlike ALCAPA, rarely leads to sudden death. Surgical correction is low risk and should be considered for all patients.

ALCAPA echocardiographic imaging — parasternal short-axis imaging in a 10-year-old shows an appropriately arising right coronary artery (RCA) from the anterior aorta that is markedly dilated with chronically increased flow, measuring 5.6 mm in diameter proximally. Color Doppler of the ventricular septum shows coronary collateral flow with a turbulent linear diastolic flow signal anterior to the left ventricle (LV), and color Doppler and spectral Doppler timing of flow in diastole helps differentiate this septal collateral from a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is generally characterized by a high-velocity systolic flow signal.

### Electrocardiographic changes at presentation and over time in children with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: a multicenter analysis [^111XXhrD]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multicenter studies describing electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns in children presenting with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), to our knowledge, have not been published. This study aimed to describe the ECG findings at presentation and over time in a multicenter cohort of children with ALCAPA and assess their association with clinical outcomes. We performed a retrospective ECG analysis of 188 patients with ALCAPA who presented between 1/2009 and 3/2018 at 21 centers affiliated with Collaborative Research for the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society. ECGs were categorized apriori as Classic (pathologic Q waves in anterolateral leads), non-classic (abnormal but without pathologic Q waves), and normal. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) following ALCAPA repair, defined as extracorporeal support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, heart transplantation, or death. Classic, non-classic, and normal ECG findings were seen at presentation in 124 (66%), 49 (26%), and 15 (8%) patients, respectively. There was no association between ECG category and MACE. Patients with non-classic or normal ECG findings were significantly more likely to present with normal or mildly diminished left ventricular systolic function and had significantly shorter duration of ventilation and hospital stay. Among 70 patients with ECGs at~3 years following surgery, classic, non-classic, and normal ECG patterns were seen in 6 (8%), 29 (41%), and 35 (50%) patients, respectively. In conclusion, one-third of patients with ALCAPA presented with non-Classic or normal ECG patterns, and these patients were more likely to have preserved cardiac function and recover more quickly following surgical repair.

### N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in patients with anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery [^111zpuUJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ALCAPA is a rare but potentially fatal congenital coronary malformation associated with early infant mortality and adult sudden death. The degree of coronary collateral circulation determines the type of ALCAPA. In infantile type, the left coronary artery (LCA) flow decreases and may reverse when pulmonary arterial pressure decreases. This leads to myocardial ischemia and infarction in the first or second month of life. Adult type patients have relatively well-established coronary collateral circulation, and this extensive collateral circulation makes it possible to survive beyond infancy.

The assessment of collateral circulation development is challenging. Communication and flow from the LCA into the PA can be demonstrated by SSFP cine MR imaging, and the flow can be assessed by fast cine phase-contrast imaging qualitatively and quantitatively. Delayed gadolinium enhancement may help determine myocardial viability. However, MR imaging has significant disadvantages including low spatial resolution and long examination times. Previous studies have indicated that it is reasonable to use 300 pg/mL as cutoff value to "rule out" HF. When interpreting NT-pro-BNP values in ALCAPA patients, the NT-pro-BNP cutoff point (300 pg/mL) may provide quick information about the severity of myocardial ischemia and LV dysfunction. In our study, we have shown a statistically significant difference in LVEF (p < 0.0001) between groups with NT-pro-BNP levels above or below 300 pg/mL, and a negative correlation between LVEF and NT-pro-BNP levels (r = 0.570, p < 0.0001), also in the group with NT-pro-BNP levels above 300 pg/mL (r = 0.403, p = 0.011). These data indicate that left ventricular dysfunction is more severe in patients with NT-pro-BNP levels above 300 pg/mL. Considering the convenience of measuring plasma NT-pro-BNP levels, NT-pro-BNP may serve as a useful diagnostic biomarker to determine the type of ALCAPA, especially in the non-acute setting when MR imaging is not immediately available.

### Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) presenting with ventricular fibrillation in an adult: a case report [^1168VkfF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital anomaly. The usual clinical course is severe left sided heart failure and mitral valve insufficiency presenting during the first months of life. However, in some cases collateral blood supply from the right coronary artery is sufficient and symptoms may be subtle or even absent. Arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death in adult life may be the first clinical presentation in patients with ALCAPA. We report a case, where a 39-year old woman presented with ventricular fibrillation during phycial exertion. Coronary angiography and CT-angiography revealed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery, and an aortic reimplantation of the left coronary artery was performed followed by ICD implantation. A review of the literature on ALCAPA is presented along with CT images before and after surgery.

### Repair of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in infants and children [^1169vipf]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Although mortality after direct aortic reimplantation for anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) has significantly decreased, many questions remain unanswered.

Methods

Between 1986 and June 2010, we operated on 27 consecutive pediatric patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). All patients underwent reestablishment of a dual coronary system with direct aortic reimplantation of the left coronary artery into the aorta. Postoperative extracorporeal mechanical circulatory support was necessary in 7 cases. In all 7 patients, hemodynamic stability was achieved after 4 to 10 days of support. Mitral valve repair was performed in 9 patients with severe mitral valve incompetence and resulted in stable mitral valve function during follow-up as long as 19 years.

Results

There were no early or late deaths. During follow-up (3 months-17.5 years), both early and late improvement of myocardial function was observed in all patients. Reduced left ventricular regional function late after successful surgical correction of ALCAPA was related to the presence of left ventricular myocardial scar tissue, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusions

Despite the absence of early and late mortality, the long-term prognosis for patients after reimplantation of ALCAPA into the aorta is not clear. Scars and perfusion deficits of the left ventricle may not be detected by standard echocardiographic evaluation of global left ventricular function and therefore may be underestimated. We therefore recommend lifelong surveillance of these patients, including magnetic resonance imaging.

### Outcomes following repair of anomalous coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in infants: results from a procedure-based national database [^1149FnWs]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ACAPA) is a very rare anomaly which usually occurs in isolation. ACAPA can be classified in infant ACAPA and non-infant (adult) ACAPA. They have a different clinical presentation and mechanism of disease. In infancy, the vast majority of patients present with the anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) rather than the right coronary connection (ARCAPA). Severe forms of ARCAPA are usually associated with right coronary dominance. Some infants develop ischaemic cardiomyopathy, resulting in left ventricular (LV) failure and various degrees of mitral regurgitation. A small number of patients do survive until childhood or adulthood untreated, due to secondary coronary collateralisation.

Both infant and adult ACAPA variants need urgent surgical repair. Reported short and long-term results vary, depending on centre experience, patient characteristics and technique used. The aim of this multicenter study is to report outcomes following the repair of infant anomalous coronary artery from the pulmonary artery using coronary transfer or the tunnel operation in consecutive patients treated nationally.

Literature review

Recent literature on anesthetic management of patients with BWGS were reviewed by conducting a thorough search on PubMed and MEDLINE of all the case reports of Bland-White-Garland syndrome published from 1950 to 2018. The keywords used included "Bland-white-Garland Syndrome", "ALCAPA", "coronary anomaly", "anaesthesia", "anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery". The references of the selected literature have also been included. In addition, cases without definitive diagnosis of BWGS, reports only about surgical procedures, ultrasound or radiologic diagnosis were excluded.

Our literature search showed a total of 6 cases related to anesthetic management between 1996 and 2008. The characteristics of the reported cases of BWGS patients undergoing general anesthesia are listed in Table 1, and the clinical course of anesthetic management in Table 2. These patients were between the ages of 7 weeks and 68 years. Cardiovascular surgery with CPB took place in 5 cases (5/6), and noncardiac surgery took place only in 1 case (1/6). Suspicion and diagnostic modalities of BWGS were completed before surgery (5/6), during or after the surgery (1/6). Five cases had symptoms of myocardial ischemia (5/6).

### Intermediate outcomes after repair of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery [^113BcRdi]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Multicenter studies on infants with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) are lacking. We report the intermediate-term outcomes after ALCAPA repair in a multicenter cohort and identify risk factors for reintervention or death after discharge.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed infants under 1 year of age who underwent ALCAPA repair from January 2009 to March 2018 at 21 US centers. The primary composite outcome was freedom from reintervention or death after discharge. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to examine freedom from reintervention or death and the Cox proportional hazard analysis to identify risk factors for this composite outcome.

Results

One hundred seventy-seven infants underwent ALCAPA repair; 170 (97%) survived to hospital discharge without transplantation. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up. The median duration of follow-up in the remaining 147 patients was 3.8 years (25%, 75%: 1.9 years, 6.0 years). Echocardiographic data were available at ∼3 years after discharge in 98 patients. Left ventricular function was normal in 96 patients (98%), whereas 26 patients (27%) had greater than mild mitral valve regurgitation. Sixteen patients (11%) underwent 20 reinterventions with 1 late death. Patients undergoing the Takeuchi procedure or atypical repairs (hazard ratio, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.1–30.0) or with moderate or greater mitral regurgitation on discharge echocardiogram (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–9.1) were at increased risk for reintervention.

Conclusions

Intermediate-term outcomes after ALCAPA repair in infants are favorable. Persistent left ventricular dysfunction and reinterventions were uncommon, and mortality was rare. Patients who required atypical surgical repair or had moderate or greater mitral regurgitation at discharge warrant closer follow-up.
