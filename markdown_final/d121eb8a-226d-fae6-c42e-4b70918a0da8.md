## Question

Use of metronidazole in upper gi bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of metronidazole in upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether metronidazole is being considered for acute management versus H. pylori eradication. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about antibiotics in nonvariceal versus variceal bleeding. Next, I will examine the specific role of metronidazole in H. pylori regimens after bleeding peptic ulcers. After that, I need to check for any evidence of metronidazole as a hemostatic or prophylactic agent in acute UGIB. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions where metronidazole might be appropriate despite not being a routine therapy for acute UGIB itself.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Upper GI bleeding is broadly divided into nonvariceal and variceal etiologies, and management diverges significantly, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios when discussing antibiotics or metronidazole specifically. Nonvariceal UGIB is most often due to peptic ulcer disease, where H. pylori testing and eradication are standard, whereas variceal bleeding in cirrhosis mandates antibiotic prophylaxis due to high infection risk and its association with rebleeding and mortality [^b6307b72] [^07f406a1].

> Now, I should verify the role of antibiotics in nonvariceal UGIB. Wait, let me verify guideline positions before jumping ahead. Contemporary guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic antibiotics for nonvariceal UGIB, including peptic ulcer bleeding, because infection risk is not elevated and antibiotics do not improve rebleeding or mortality outcomes in this population. Instead, the focus is on resuscitation, timely endoscopy with hemostasis, and high-dose PPI therapy post-endoscopy, with H. pylori testing and eradication as indicated [^b6307b72] [^3b533ba5] [^8ef2ec86].

> Hold on, I should verify the variceal side. In cirrhosis with suspected variceal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis is strongly recommended and reduces mortality, infections, and rebleeding. Typical regimens include ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones, chosen based on local resistance patterns, and metronidazole is not a standard agent for this indication. So metronidazole should not be used as prophylaxis for variceal bleeding itself, even though antibiotics are indicated in that scenario [^07f406a1] [^5eb3b6bc] [^e24ce71d].

> Next, I will examine the specific role of metronidazole in H. pylori eradication after a bleeding peptic ulcer. I need to check which regimens are endorsed. Guidelines advise testing for H. pylori in the acute setting and treating if positive, with re-testing to confirm eradication. Metronidazole is a component of several evidence-based eradication regimens, particularly bismuth-based quadruple therapy and some sequential regimens, and is especially relevant when clarithromycin resistance is high or when patients cannot tolerate penicillin, though amoxicillin is generally preferred when not contraindicated [^b6307b72] [^3b533ba5] [^f4e156f2].

> Let me consider the practical timing and regimen details. I should confirm whether eradication therapy should start during the acute admission or be deferred. Many guidelines support initiating H. pylori therapy during the index admission when feasible, with confirmation of eradication after completion, and metronidazole is commonly dosed at 500 mg four times daily in bismuth quadruple therapy for 10–14 days. Importantly, PPIs should be held briefly before testing to avoid false negatives, and urea breath or stool antigen testing is preferred for confirmation of cure [^b6307b72] [^76dc807b].

> But wait, what if someone is proposing metronidazole for acute hemostasis or as a prokinetic to improve endoscopic visualization? I should double-check that. Metronidazole has no hemostatic properties and is not recommended to improve endoscopic visualization; erythromycin is the agent with conditional recommendations for pre-endoscopic use to reduce repeat endoscopy and length of stay, whereas metronidazole has no such role in acute UGIB management. So using metronidazole for acute bleeding control or pre-endoscopic prep would be inappropriate [^b6307b72] [^3e70decb] [^8ef2ec86].

> I will now examine whether any high-quality evidence supports metronidazole outside of H. pylori therapy in UGIB. I need to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. Systematic reviews and guidelines consistently show no benefit for routine antibiotics in nonvariceal UGIB, and metronidazole is not highlighted as a standalone therapy for acute bleeding control or prophylaxis in any major guideline, reinforcing that its role is confined to H. pylori eradication regimens in appropriate patients [^b6307b72] [^3b533ba5] [^8ef2ec86].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the recommendation is precise. Metronidazole is not indicated for acute management of upper GI bleeding itself, whether nonvariceal or variceal. Its appropriate role is as a component of H. pylori eradication therapy after a bleeding peptic ulcer, typically within bismuth-based quadruple regimens or select sequential therapies, with testing and confirmation of cure. In variceal bleeding, antibiotics are indicated, but metronidazole is not a standard prophylactic choice, and clinicians should use ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones guided by local resistance patterns [^b6307b72] [^3b533ba5] [^07f406a1].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps so there's no ambiguity. In a patient with nonvariceal UGIB, prioritize resuscitation, early endoscopy with hemostasis, high-dose PPI post-endoscopy, and test for H. pylori with eradication if positive, where metronidazole may be included in the regimen depending on the chosen protocol and resistance considerations. In suspected variceal bleeding, initiate guideline-directed antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and avoid substituting metronidazole for this purpose. Do not use metronidazole for acute hemostasis or pre-endoscopic preparation [^b6307b72] [^3b533ba5] [^07f406a1].

Metronidazole is **not routinely used** for acute upper GI bleeding management. It is only indicated when H. pylori is confirmed or strongly suspected, as part of **eradication therapy** [^b6307b72] to reduce rebleeding risk [^20cc5806]. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for nonvariceal UGIB [^8ef2ec86], and metronidazole is not used for variceal bleeding [^07f406a1]. If H. pylori is present, metronidazole may be included in bismuth-based quadruple or sequential regimens [^f4e156f2], but resistance is common, so regimen selection should be guided by local resistance data [^22563d43].

---

## Indications for metronidazole in upper GI bleeding

Metronidazole is **not indicated for acute UGIB itself**; its role is limited to H. pylori eradication when infection is present, as eradication reduces rebleeding risk [^20cc5806]. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for nonvariceal UGIB [^8ef2ec86], and metronidazole is not used for variceal bleeding [^07f406a1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major gastroenterology societies provide clear recommendations on the use of metronidazole in UGIB:

- **ACG 2021 guidelines**: Recommend testing for H. pylori in patients with UGIB and initiating eradication therapy if positive. Metronidazole may be included in bismuth-based quadruple therapy or sequential therapy, but routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for nonvariceal UGIB [^b6307b72].

- **ESGE 2015 guidelines**: Recommend investigating for H. pylori in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy if detected. Metronidazole may be part of the eradication regimen, but routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for nonvariceal UGIB [^3b533ba5].

- **WSES 2020 guidelines**: Recommend a 10-day sequential therapy including metronidazole for H. pylori-positive bleeding peptic ulcers in selected patients, particularly when clarithromycin resistance is high [^f4e156f2].

---

## Evidence supporting metronidazole use in UGIB

The evidence supporting metronidazole use in UGIB is **limited to its role in H. pylori eradication**. A landmark study showed that in patients with H. pylori infection and a history of UGIB, eradication therapy was comparable to omeprazole in preventing recurrent bleeding in aspirin users, but omeprazole was superior in NSAID users [^20cc5806]. This supports eradication therapy — which may include metronidazole — in H. pylori-positive patients with UGIB.

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Metronidazole is generally well tolerated, but **important adverse effects** include:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, and dysgeusia [^notfound].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, and seizures, particularly with prolonged use or high doses.

- **Hematologic effects**: Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, though rare.

- **Drug interactions**: Potential interaction with warfarin, increasing INR and bleeding risk.

Given these risks, metronidazole should be used cautiously, especially in patients with hepatic impairment or those receiving anticoagulant therapy.

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Metronidazole is **primarily used for anaerobic coverage** in H. pylori eradication regimens. Other antibiotics commonly used in UGIB include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Role in ugib** |
|-|-|-|
| Metronidazole | H. pylori eradication | Part of bismuth-based quadruple or sequential therapy [^f4e156f2] |
| Clarithromycin | H. pylori eradication | Part of standard triple therapy, but resistance is high [^22563d43] |
| Amoxicillin | H. pylori eradication | Part of standard triple or sequential therapy [^f4e156f2] |
| Ceftriaxone | Variceal bleeding prophylaxis | Reduces infections, rebleeding, and mortality in cirrhotic patients [^5eb3b6bc] |

---

## Current clinical practice and controversies

Current practice emphasizes **targeted H. pylori eradication** in UGIB patients with confirmed infection, with metronidazole included in regimens when appropriate [^b6307b72]. Controversies include rising metronidazole resistance, which may limit efficacy and necessitate alternative regimens or susceptibility testing [^22563d43]. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about the optimal duration and composition of eradication therapies, particularly in the context of antibiotic resistance [^22563d43].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Metronidazole is **not routinely used** for acute UGIB management. Its role is limited to H. pylori eradication in confirmed or strongly suspected cases, as eradication reduces rebleeding risk [^20cc5806]. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for nonvariceal UGIB, and metronidazole is not indicated for variceal bleeding [^8ef2ec86] [^07f406a1]. Clinicians should consider local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors when selecting eradication regimens, and monitor for adverse effects during therapy.

Regarding medical management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to eradication therapy, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a 10-day sequential therapy with four drugs (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and PPI) in selected patients with H. pylori-positive bleeding peptic ulcer if compliance to the scheduled regimen can be maintained and if clarithromycin high resistance is detected.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^f4d85d3b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

Due to heightened awareness regarding testing for and eradication of infection, the prevalence and incidence of H pylori infection (and by extension the prevalence and incidence of peptic ulcer disease) appear to have declined in recent years. However, antimicrobial resistance is mounting and traditional clarithromycin- or metronidazole-containing triple therapies may no longer be highly effective at eradicating the infection. Combined bismuth- and metronidazole-containing quadruple therapy or sequential 4-drug therapy may be better choices for first-line treatment against this unique pathogen that is ideally suited to survive in the human stomach.

### Role of medical therapy for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^ee438c39]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mortality from UGIB has remained 5–10% over the past decade. This article presents current evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of UGIB. Preendoscopic management includes initial resuscitation, risk stratification, appropriate use of blood products, and consideration of nasogastric tube insertion, erythromycin, and proton pump inhibitor therapy. The use of postendoscopic intravenous proton pump inhibitors is strongly recommended for certain patient populations. Postendoscopic management also includes the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori, appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors and iron replacement therapy.

### How would you manage this patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^eebf99af]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common, morbid, and potentially fatal. Cornerstones of inpatient management include fluid resuscitation; blood transfusion; endoscopy; and initiation of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which continues in an individualized manner based on risk factors for recurrent bleeding in the outpatient setting. The International Consensus Group released guidelines on the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2019. These guidelines provide a helpful, evidence-based roadmap for management of gastrointestinal bleeding but leave certain management details to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 gastroenterologists consider the care of a patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a peptic ulcer, specifically debating approaches to blood transfusion and endoscopy timing in the hospital, as well as the recommended duration of proton-pump inhibitor therapy after discharge.

### Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^c50c8b94]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) may be decreasing, the case fatality associated with it remains unchanged. What do the most recent studies tell us about medical and endoscopic therapy? Erythromycin is a potentially useful adjunct to endoscopy, and further data are needed to establish its role in the management of patients with NVUGIB. The use of proton-pump inhibitors in addition to combination endoscopic therapy appears to reduce the rebleeding rate consistently across different studies; the route of administration, dosage, and duration of treatment require further definition. Although two controlled studies suggest improved outcomes with clot removal and endoscopic therapy, the exact role of endoscopic treatment in the setting of overlying clots remains controversial. Hemoclips have not been found, in general, to be superior to the available endoscopic techniques. Currently, other hemostatic techniques such as injection and thermocoagulation - and in particular, combination therapy using both methods - are preferable. No major "breakthrough" endoscopic treatment has emerged. Newer endoscopic therapies such as cryotherapy are interesting, but have not had widespread application. Endoscopic suturing techniques, as used in the treatment of esophageal reflux and obesity, have not been adapted to the management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^62afe72e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Pre-endoscopic medical therapy with erythromycin in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — we suggest an infusion of erythromycin before endoscopy in patients with UGIB (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). The rationale for using a prokinetic agent such as erythromycin is to propel blood and clot distally from the upper GI tract and improve visualization at endoscopy, thereby improving diagnostic yield, which could increase the proportion of patients who receive appropriate management based on endoscopic findings. The panel also predicted potentially meaningful benefits including reduction in repeat endoscopies and reduction in hospital stay.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^83a7df89]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NVUGIB is a common and serious condition that, unfortunately, still carries a high degree of mortality. While the advances of the past few years promise to improve management, they also open up new questions and avenues for investigation. There is now growing evidence that the use of prokinetic agents can benefit certain subsets of patients with upper GI bleeding, but more research will likely be required before their use is adopted by all major guideline committees. The introduction of novel hemostatic methods, such as nanopowders, offers exciting new possibilities for the mechanical management of bleeding lesions. More research should also be devoted to investigating the various other mechanical and injectable hemostatic modalities that are already more widely in use. The appropriate hemoglobin level for consideration of red blood cell transfusion and the optimal dose and route of administration for PPI after endoscopy are unclear, but stronger evidence is required before firm changes can be made to practice guidelines. Finally, much of the data that exists focuses specifically on the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding; studies on the optimal ways to manage the other entities that result in upper GI bleeding require strong consideration as well.

### Proton pump inhibitors for acute upper GI bleeding [^150466e7]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Each year, around 1 in 1,000 adults in the UK has an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed. Acute treatment often includes the use of a proton pump inhibitor, although none is licensed in the UK for this indication. Here we consider whether such treatment helps and, if so, how it should be used.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^7d8b1c14]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Pre-endoscopic medical therapy — prokinetic therapy (erythromycin) in upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Intravenous infusion of erythromycin (250 mg ~30 min before endoscopy) should be considered to improve diagnostic yield and decrease the need for repeat endoscopy. However, erythromycin has not consistently been shown to improve clinical outcomes (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Infusions of erythromycin 250 mg or 3 mg/kg were given over 5 or 30 min before endoscopy and endoscopy was performed 20–60 min after the infusion finished, and meta-analysis showed a modest benefit in diagnosis at first endoscopy (relative risk (RR) = 1.13, 1.02–1.26; number needed to treat (NNT) = 9) while not significantly reducing clinical outcomes but decreasing second endoscopy; in a randomized comparison in 253 patients with UGIB there were no significant differences in visualization, diagnosis at first endoscopy, second-look endoscopy, further bleeding, or transfusions.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^9edbe9e8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) pre-endoscopic medical therapy — intravenous infusion of erythromycin (250 mg ∼30 min before endoscopy) should be considered to improve diagnostic yield and decrease the need for repeat endoscopy; however, infusion has not consistently been shown to improve clinical outcomes (Conditional recommendation). Pre-endoscopic intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (e.g., 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/h infusion) may be considered to decrease the proportion of patients who have higher risk stigmata of hemorrhage at endoscopy and who receive endoscopic therapy; however, PPIs do not improve clinical outcomes such as further bleeding, surgery, or death (Conditional recommendation). If endoscopy will be delayed or cannot be performed, intravenous PPI is recommended to reduce further bleeding (Conditional recommendation).

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^b2ca1e0a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding — trial outcomes prioritization: The critical outcome was further bleeding, which includes persistent and recurrent bleeding. Further bleeding was recommended as the primary endpoint for RCTs of UGIB management by an International Consensus Panel because prevention of further bleeding is the primary clinical goal for patients with UGIB. Mortality was defined as an important outcome but not critical for decision making because death is uncommon in patients with UGIB (~2% in the United States), and sample sizes for most RCTs are not based on assessment of mortality.

### Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: an update [^1a4fc3b9]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage is a common cause for admission to hospital and is associated with a mortality of around 10%. Prompt assessment and resuscitation are vital, as are risk stratification of the severity of bleeding, early involvement of the multidisciplinary team and timely access to endoscopy, preferably within 24h. The majority of bleeds are due to peptic ulcers for which Helicobacter pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are the main risk factors. Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used before endoscopy, this is controversial. Pre-endoscopic risk stratification with the Glasgow Blatchford score is recommended as is the use of the Rockall score postendoscopy. Endoscopic therapy, with at least two haemostatic modalities, remains the mainstay of treating high-risk lesions and reduces rebleeding rates and mortality. High-dose PPI therapy after endoscopic haemostasis also reduces rebleeding rates and mortality. Variceal oesophageal haemorrhage is associated with a higher rebleeding rate and risk of death. Antibiotics and vasopressin analogues are advised in suspected variceal bleeding; however, endoscopic variceal band ligation remains the haemostatic treatment of choice. Balloon tamponade remains useful in the presence of torrential variceal haemorrhage or when endoscopy fails to secure haemostasis, and can be a bridge to further endoscopic attempts or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. This review aims to provide an update on the latest evidence-based recommendations for the management of acute upper GI haemorrhage.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^60f0b68f]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, a major cause of which are bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialised centres, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and recurrent bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%. The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarise the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^5467a947]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

### Surgical management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^3bffa655]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of surgery in managing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has rapidly diminished secondary to advances in our understanding of the pathologies that underlie upper GI bleeding, pharmaceutical treatments for peptic ulcer disease, and endoscopic procedures used to gain hemostasis. A surgeon must work collaboratively with gastroenterologist and interventional radiologist to determine when, and what kind of, surgery is appropriate for the patient with upper GI bleeding.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and management [^2b583943]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is defined as hemorrhage from the mouth to the ligament of Treitz. Common risk factors for upper GI bleeding include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. Causes of upper GI bleeding include peptic ulcer bleeding, gastritis, esophagitis, variceal bleeding, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and cancer. Signs and symptoms of upper GI bleeding may include abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, hematemesis, and melena. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and crossmatch. A bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution should be rapidly infused to correct hypovolemia and to maintain blood pressure, and blood should be transfused when hemoglobin is less than 7 g per dL. Clinical prediction guides (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score) are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and to determine therapy. Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy, performed within 24 hours of presentation. A common strategy in patients with failed endoscopic hemostasis is to attempt transcatheter arterial embolization, then proceed to surgery if hemostasis is not obtained. Proton pump inhibitors should be initiated upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Guidelines recommend high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the first 72 hours post-endoscopy because this is when rebleeding risk is highest. Deciding when to restart antithrombotic therapy after upper GI bleeding is difficult because of lack of sufficient data.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper… [^5eb3b6bc]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should antibiotic prophylaxis be used for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Evidence-Based Answer Antibiotics should be used for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Prophylaxis reduces all-cause mortality by 21%, as well as bacterial infections and rebleeding. Evidence Summary A 2011 meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials involving 1, 241 patients compared different types of antibiotic therapy vs. no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic in adults with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, regardless of etiology of cirrhosis or severity of disease. 1 Antibiotics were administered alone or in combination, orally or intravenously, and included cephalosporins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and vancomycin. No antibiotic regimen was superior to the others, and the authors recommended basing the antibiotic choice on local resistance profiles and treatment cost. The studies included in the meta-analysis did not report adverse effects. A 2015 retrospective cohort study examined 235 patients with cirrhosis and acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage who were undergoing therapeutic upper endoscopy. 2 Prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone was administered to 88 of these patients at a dosage of 1 g immediately after endoscopy, then every 12 hours until discharge. Compared with the control group, the antibiotic group had a lower risk of bacterial infections, including bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, and a lower risk of rebleeding.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^d53e7c19]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Drug intervention pre-endoscopy

Prokinetic agents

Use of intravenous erythromycin at 250 mg for 30–120 minutes before endoscopy has been shown to improve gastric mucosa visualisation in several randomised controlled trials. A subsequent meta-analysis reported that this might reduce transfusion requirements, need for second endoscopy and length of stay. A more recent meta-analysis of 598 patients also reported that intravenous erythromycin led to a reduced requirement for repeat endoscopy (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77) and shorter length of stay (mean difference −1.75 days, 95% confidence interval −2.43 to −1.06), although no difference in transfusion requirement was identified. Despite these findings, erythromycin has not been widely adopted within the UK. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus bundle advises use of erythromycin in selected patients at the discretion of the endoscopist.

This antifibrinolytic agent inhibits the interaction of plasminogen with plasmin and fibrin, and is widely used in the management of major bleeding in trauma, obstetrics, and surgery. Results from relatively small studies and meta-analyses are conflicting about the effectiveness of its use in UGIB. The HALT-IT study, an international, placebo controlled randomised controlled trial of 12 009 patientsshowed no improvement in five day mortality with tranexamic acid compared with placebo (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.18; figure 3). Additionally, risk of venous thromboembolism was increased with tranexamic acid (1.85, 1.15 to 2.98). As a result, guidelines recommend that tranexamic acid is not used in UGIB outside of clinical trials.

Pre-endoscopic management

There are a number of interventions that can be considered prior to endoscopy for patients experiencing upper GI bleeding. Nasogastric tubes or orogastric tubes have been used for gastric lavage in the past, but there is no evidence that this improves outcomes and the recommendations are conflicting regarding their utility in terms of diagnosis or improvement of visualization at the time of endoscopy. Pre-endoscopic PPI treatment can be considered, as it reduces the severity of bleeding lesions at the time of endoscopy but has not been shown to improve important clinical outcomes (such as rebleeding and mortality) and it should not replace or delay endoscopy. Pre-endoscopic PPI treatment would theoretically be most beneficial when endoscopy is expected to be delayed or when the endoscopists have limited experience in endoscopic hemostasis.

The question of pre-endoscopic medical management frequently involves the decision to administer prokinetic agents prior to endoscopy. This can be considered in patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, but should not necessarily be used in all patients. Barkun et al published a meta-analysis of RCTs on the use of prokinetics (erythromycin or metoclopramide) in upper GI bleeding in 2010. This included 3 full publications and 2 abstracts with a combined total of 319 patients. They found that use of prokinetics prior to endoscopy significantly decreased the need for repeat endoscopy to determine the source of bleeding (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32–0.94). No significant difference was found regarding number of units of blood transfused or length of hospital stay. Previously published guidelines recommend erythromycin as the prokinetic agent of choice.

Considerations

Clinicians should consider the use of pre-endoscopic PPIs, particularly for those patients in whom endoscopy will be temporarily or indefinitely delayed. Naso- or orogastric tube placement is rarely useful. Prokinetic agents should be considered to reduce the need for repeat diagnostic endoscopy in patients when large amount of fresh blood or clots are anticipated to be present in the stomach.

### The role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^a6a1f569]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pre-endoscopic administration of PPIs in patients with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding is still of controversial efficacy. It downstages the severity of the endoscopic signs of recent bleeding and may reduce the requirement for endoscopic hemostatic therapy at index endoscopy. However, there is no evidence of an effect on mortality, rebleeding, or surgical intervention rates. In contrast, the efficacy of PPIs in endoscopically diagnosed peptic ulcer bleeding is supported by high-quality evidence from numerous RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs. PPIs compared with H2RAs or placebo consistently reduce rebleeding rates regardless of dose, route of administration, application or not of endoscopic hemostatic treatment, and geographic location. Surgical intervention rates and the need for further endoscopic hemostatic treatment are also reduced by PPI treatment, although the results are not as robust as those for rebleeding. There is no evidence of an overall effect of PPI treatment on all-cause mortality. However, all-cause mortality is reduced among patients with high-risk endoscopic signs and among trials that had been conducted in Asia. The optimal dose and route of PPI administration has yet to be determined.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^8ef2ec86]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

Overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial triage and pre-endoscopic management algorithm: Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating 0–1% false negatives for transfusion, hemostatic intervention, or death with Glasgow-Blatchford Score 0–1, is managed with discharge from the emergency department with outpatient management if no other reason for hospitalization, whereas Not Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating > 1% false negatives with Glasgow-Blatchford Score ≥ 2, is managed with admission to hospital or observation unit. Pre-endoscopic management includes resuscitation and attention to active comorbidities, RBC transfusion if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL, suggesting erythromycin 250mg infusion 30–90 minutes before upper endoscopy, and there is no recommendation for or against proton pump inhibitors. The pathway specifies upper endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation; after endoscopy, low-risk endoscopic findings such as clean-based ulcer, nonbleeding Mallory-Weiss tear, or erosions lead to discharge if stable vital signs and hemoglobin and no other reason for hospitalization, whereas non-low-risk findings such as ulcer with stigmata of hemorrhage, varices, neoplasm, or Dieulafoy lesion result in the patient remaining in hospital.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^d7118b86]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production and are used to manage upper GI bleeding. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitors initiated before endoscopy in people with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the effects of PPI treatment initiated prior to endoscopy in people with acute upper GI bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and major conference proceedings to October 2008, for the previous versions of this review, and in April 2018, October 2019, and 3 June 2021 for this update. We also contacted experts in the field and searched trial registries and references of trials for any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with a PPI (oral or intravenous) versus control treatment with either placebo, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) or no treatment, prior to endoscopy in hospitalised people with uninvestigated upper GI bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes assessed at 30 days were: mortality (our primary outcome), rebleeding, surgery, high-risk stigmata of recent haemorrhage (active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel or adherent clot) at index endoscopy, endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy, time to discharge, blood transfusion requirements and adverse effects. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs comprising 2223 participants. No new studies have been published after the literature search performed in 2008 for the previous version of this review. Of the included studies, we considered one to be at low risk of bias, two to be at unclear risk of bias, and three at high risk of bias. Our meta-analyses suggest that pre-endoscopic PPI use may not reduce mortality (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.70; 5 studies; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce rebleeding (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.06; 5 studies; low-certainty evidence). In addition, pre-endoscopic PPI use may not reduce the need for surgery (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26; 6 studies; low-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the proportion of participants with high-risk stigmata of recent haemorrhage at index endoscopy (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.21; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). Pre-endoscopic PPI use likely reduces the need for endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data to determine the effect of pre-endoscopic PPI use on blood transfusions (2 studies; meta-analysis not possible; very low-certainty evidence) and time to discharge (1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no substantial heterogeneity amongst trials in any analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that PPI treatment initiated before endoscopy for upper GI bleeding likely reduces the requirement for endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether pre-endoscopic PPI treatment increases, reduces or has no effect on other clinical outcomes, including mortality, rebleeding and need for surgery. Further well-designed RCTs that conform to current standards for endoscopic haemostatic treatment and appropriate co-interventions, and that ensure high-dose PPIs are only given to people who received endoscopic haemostatic treatment, regardless of initial randomisation, are warranted. However, as it may be unrealistic to achieve the optimal information size, pragmatic multicentre trials may provide valuable evidence on this topic.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^3b533ba5]. Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between 7g/dL and 9g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e.g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of 0–1, do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, 250mg given 30–120 minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e.g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e.g. FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day 3 after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (UGIB) shows no demonstrated clinical benefit for further bleeding or mortality, and the panel could not make a recommendation for pre-endoscopic PPI therapy while also stating it did not recommend against pre-endoscopic PPI therapy; prior non-directive phrasing such as "may be considered" is no longer used. Available evidence indicates no benefit of pre-endoscopic PPI therapy for clinical outcomes, though pre-endoscopic PPI therapy may modestly reduce need for endoscopic treatment, and guideline statements now require a recommendation action rather than allowing consideration-only wording.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting 36 to 48 per 100,000 persons annually. Aggressive resuscitation and upper endoscopy remain the cornerstones of therapy; however, in cases refractory to endoscopic diagnosis and management, radiology plays an increasingly vital and often lifesaving role, thanks to improvements in both imaging and interventional techniques. The various etiologies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed along with specific management recommendations based on an extensive literature review of current radiographic methods.

Methods

We produced this NMA as an additional, updated analysis of our previously published Cochrane reviewand followed the objectives described in the review protocol. We reported this NMA in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) NMA reporting guidelineand conducted the systematic review according to Cochrane standards. Refer to online supplemental file 1 for the PRISMA NMA checklist.

Eligibility criteria

All RCTs with participants (any age and gender) admitted to ICUs for longer than 24 hours were included. We excluded studies in which participants were admitted to the ICU primarily for management of upper GI bleeding. We compared the following interventions administered by any route and at any dose: H2RA, PPIs, prostaglandin analogues, anticholinergics, potassium-competitive acid blockers, systemic and non-systemic drugs that neutralise gastric acid (antacids), ulcer protectives, ulcer healing drugs and other pharmacological intervention used to reduce upper GI bleeding and combinations of interventions (eg, omeprazole-bicarbonate combinations). We compared each class of drugs versus placebo or no prophylaxis and we compared all classes of drugs against one another. We did not compare different drugs within a single class with one another.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome of interest was clinically important upper GI bleeding. For this outcome, we used the definition used by the study authors. Our secondary outcomes were nosocomial pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia, all-cause mortality in ICU, all-cause mortality in the hospital, duration of intubation, including duration of mechanical ventilation, the number of participants requiring blood transfusions, the number of units of blood transfused, serious adverse events of interventions leading to discontinuation of treatment, prolongation of ICU stay or disability; any other adverse event and C. difficile -related diarrhoea.

### Updates on management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^edbdd937]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common and life-threatening condition in the United States and worldwide.

Recent Findings

There have been several exciting recent advances in the endoscopic management of UGIB. One such advance is the recent approval of Hemospray by US Food and Drug Administration in May 2018. Another one is the emerging role of video capsule endoscopy as a triage and localization tool for UGIB patients. Finally, the development of new reversal agents for antithrombotic medications is an important advance in the management of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Summary

In this article, we will broadly review the management of nonvariceal UGIB, focusing primarily on the data addressing these new advances.

### Erythromycin prior to endoscopy for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage [^3e70decb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper endoscopy is the definitive treatment for upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH). However, up to 13% of people who undergo upper endoscopy will have incomplete visualisation of the gastric mucosa at presentation. Erythromycin acts as a motilin receptor agonist in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and increases gastric emptying, which may lead to better quality of visualisation and improved treatment effectiveness. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of erythromycin in UGIH.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of erythromycin before endoscopy in adults with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, compared with any other treatment or no treatment/placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 15 October 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated erythromycin before endoscopy compared to any other treatment or no treatment/placebo before endoscopy in adults with acute UGIH.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. UGIH-related mortality and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. visualisation of gastric mucosa, 3. non-serious adverse events, 4. rebleeding, 5. blood transfusion, and 5. rescue invasive intervention. We used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with 878 participants. The mean age ranged from 53.13 years to 64.5 years, and most participants were men (72.3%). One RCT included only non-variceal haemorrhage, one included only variceal haemorrhage, and eight included both aetiologies. We defined short-term outcomes as those occurring within one week of initial endoscopy. Erythromycin versus placebo Three RCTs (255 participants) compared erythromycin with placebo. There were no UGIH-related deaths. The evidence is very uncertain about the short-term effects of erythromycin compared with placebo on serious adverse events (risk difference (RD) -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to 0.02; 3 studies, 255 participants; very low certainty), all-cause mortality (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 3 studies, 255 participants; very low certainty), non-serious adverse events (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; 3 studies, 255 participants; very low certainty), and rebleeding (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.90; 2 studies, 195 participants; very low certainty). Erythromycin may improve gastric mucosa visualisation (mean difference (MD) 3.63 points on 16-point ordinal scale, 95% CI 2.20 to 5.05; higher MD means better visualisation; 2 studies, 195 participants; low certainty). Erythromycin may also result in a slight reduction in blood transfusion (MD -0.44 standard units of blood, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.01; 3 studies, 255 participants; low certainty). Erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage versus no intervention/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage Six RCTs (408 participants) compared erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage with no intervention/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage. There were no UGIH-related deaths and no serious adverse events. The evidence is very uncertain about the short-term effects of erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage compared with no intervention/placebo plus nasogastric tube lavage on all-cause mortality (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.03; 3 studies, 238 participants; very low certainty), visualisation of the gastric mucosa (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.48 points on 10-point ordinal scale, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.85; higher SMD means better visualisation; 3 studies, 170 participants; very low certainty), non-serious adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; 6 studies, 408 participants; very low certainty), rebleeding (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.02; 1 study, 169 participants; very low certainty), and blood transfusion (MD -1.85 standard units of blood, 95% CI -4.34 to 0.64; 3 studies, 180 participants; very low certainty). Erythromycin versus nasogastric tube lavage Four RCTs (287 participants) compared erythromycin with nasogastric tube lavage. There were no UGIH-related deaths and no serious adverse events. The evidence is very uncertain about the short-term effects of erythromycin compared with nasogastric tube lavage on all-cause mortality (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.08; 3 studies, 213 participants; very low certainty), visualisation of the gastric mucosa (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.79; 2 studies, 198 participants; very low certainty), non-serious adverse events (RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.13; 3 studies, 213 participants; very low certainty), rebleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.49; 1 study, 169 participants; very low certainty), and blood transfusion (median 2 standard units of blood, interquartile range 0 to 4 in both groups; 1 study, 169 participants; very low certainty). Erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage versus metoclopramide plus nasogastric tube lavage One RCT (30 participants) compared erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage with metoclopramide plus nasogastric tube lavage. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of erythromycin plus nasogastric tube lavage on all the reported outcomes (serious adverse events, visualisation of gastric mucosa, non-serious adverse events, and blood transfusion).

Authors' Conclusions

We are unsure if erythromycin before endoscopy in people with UGIH has any clinical benefits or harms. However, erythromycin compared with placebo may improve gastric mucosa visualisation and result in a slight reduction in blood transfusion.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^91cac577]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or NSAID use.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^a52d489c]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This review found evidence of moderate certainty to show that a number of interventions might be effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Also, the effect of any intervention on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU, all-cause mortality in the hospital, duration of the stay in the ICU, duration of intubation and serious adverse events remains unclear with no intervention seeming more effective as compared with placebo, no prophylaxis or any other intervention.

Our research emphasises that decisions in practice should be based on individual assessments of patient needs and underlying conditions. Overall, the local context and resources must be considered in selection of treatment.

Our findings are mostly based on evidence of low and very low certainty except for the primary outcomes. Given that antacids are almost no longer used in practice, only good quality research to assess the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, serious adverse events, C. difficile infections and other harms in patients receiving sucralfate, H2RAs or PPIs might be useful to ascertain the effectiveness of these interventions.

Provided H2RAs and PPIs are the drugs used most often, the effect of PPIs on any adverse event including nosocomial pneumonia and mortality should be investigated in meta-analyses that clearly take into consideration the underlying conditions of study participants and any concomitant intervention.

Materials and methods

Literature search

A literature search was performed in November 2015 consisting of three well-known search strategies. First, a search of popular databases, including Medline/PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane databases, was performed using erythromycin, endoscopy, and bleeding ("erythromycin"[MeSH Terms] OR "erythromycin"[All Fields]) AND ("endoscopy"[MeSH Terms] OR "endoscopy" [All Fields]) AND ("hemorrhage"[MeSH Terms] OR "hemorrhage"[All Fields] OR "bleeding" [All Fields]). Second, a search of abstracts from major meetings in gastroenterology, including those from Digestive Disease Week and the American College of Gastroenterology national meeting, was conducted over the last decade. Lastly, all references were searched in each article identified in an effort to reduce exclusion of potential articles. If any data was missing or questionable, authors were contacted for clarification. All articles in English and Polish were included.

Data extraction

Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers (RR, MLB) from all included studies using a standardized data extraction sheet. Any disagreement among those two reviewers was settled by mutual agreement or involvement of a third party reviewer (DN).

Statistical analysis

Studies on adult patients with UGIB that compared erythromycin administration before endoscopy to no erythromycin or placebo were identified and used in this meta-analysis. Data was collected for the following outcomes: gastric visualization, need for second-look endoscopy, units of blood transfused, length of endoscopy, length of hospital stay, and need for emergent surgery. The data was pooled, analyzed, and reported as odds ratio (OR), for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD), for continuous data, using the Mantel-Haenszel (fixed effect) model in outcomes with no heterogeneity and the DerSimonian and Laird (random effects) model in outcomes with significant heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among pooled studies was calculated using the I 2 measure of inconsistency (significant if P < 0.10 or I 2 > 50%). If heterogeneity was discovered, the random effects model was utilized as well as a sensitivity analysis performed by removing the least amount of studies necessary to reach non-significant heterogeneity and comparing results to the original pooled data. Data was analyzed by using RevMan 5.3 (Review Manager, Version 5.3, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^29511979]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Erythromycin infusion before endoscopy in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — An intravenous infusion of 250 mg is recommended, given over 5–30 minutes (most often 20–30 minutes) and followed by endoscopy 20–90 minutes later, with meta-analysis showing reduced need for repeat endoscopy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51, 0.34–0.77) and fewer hospital days (mean difference = − 1.75, − 2.43 to − 1.06), a tendency toward fewer transfused units (mean difference = − 1.06, − 2.24 to 0.13), and no mortality benefit (RR = 0.81, 0.41–1.60); the conclusion states that infusion of 250 mg 20–90 minutes before endoscopy may reduce repeat endoscopy and length of hospitalization, is not documented to improve further bleeding, and previously "should be considered", while intravenous erythromycin can prolong the QT interval and is very rarely associated with torsade de pointes.

We recommend giving intravenous antibiotics to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding

Level of evidence: High

Strength of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous antibiotics if suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding (100% agreement)

Bacterial infections are common in patients with cirrhosis and AUGIB and are associated with rebleeding and mortality. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n = 1241) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis in this context was superior to placebo in reducing mortality, bacterial infections, rebleeding and LOS. The benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis has also been observed following endoscopic haemostasis for peptic ulcer bleeding. There is evidence to support the use of intravenous prophylactic antibiotics over oral agents. Fernandez et al randomised patients (n = 111) with AUGIB and cirrhosis to either oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily) or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/day) for 7 days, and assessed outcomes within 10 days. Patients assigned to intravenous ceftriaxone had lower rates of proven infections, bacteraemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In accordance with the BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle, patients with cirrhosis and AUGIB should be empirically managed as variceal bleeding and commenced on antibiotic prophylaxis according to local antimicrobial policy.

We recommend continuing aspirin at presentation

Level of evidence: Moderate

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 90%

Bundle recommendation: Continue aspirin (80% agreement)

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^5aba3ab5]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) epidemiology and initial management — NVUGIB is described as a serious clinical problem with an incidence of approximately 61–78 per 100,000 persons in the United States in 2009–2012 and mortality estimated to be between 2% and 10%. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment remains the clinical mainstay of care in hemodynamically stabilized patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, typically esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Although endoscopy is a cornerstone in the management of NVUGIB, it should come after triage, medical management, and stabilization.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) epidemiology and outcomes — LGIB is diagnosed in 20% to 30% of all patients presenting with major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; the annual incidence of LGIB is 0.03%, it increases 200-fold from the second to eighth decades of life, and the mean age at presentation ranges from 63 to 77 years; approximately 35.7 per 100,000 adults in the United States are hospitalized for LGIB annually, and a full-time gastroenterologist manages more than 10 cases per year; although blood loss from LGIB can range from trivial to massive and life-threatening, the majority of patients have self-limited bleeding and an uncomplicated hospitalization; compared with acute upper GI bleeding (UGIB), patients with LGIB tend to present with a higher hemoglobin level and are less likely to develop hypotensive shock or require blood transfusions; the mortality rate ranges from 2% to 4%; and an epidemiologic study reported a decreased incidence of LGIB (41.8/100,000 in 2001 vs 35.7/100,000 in 2009; P = 0.02) and a lower age-adjusted and sex-adjusted case fatality rate (1.93% in 2001 vs 1.47% in 2009; P = 0.003).

### Proton-pump inhibitors to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding-an updated meta-analysis [^7a8c2141]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The goal of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy and safety of proton-pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients.

Methods

We included randomized trials comparing proton-pump inhibitors versus placebo or no prophylaxis in critically ill adults, performed meta-analyses, and assessed certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. To explore the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on mortality based on disease severity, a subgroup analysis was conducted combining within-trial subgroup data from the two largest trials and assessed credibility using the Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses.

Results

Twelve trials that enrolled 9533 patients were included. Proton-pump inhibitors were associated with a reduced incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.76]; high certainty evidence). Proton-pump inhibitors may have little or no effect on mortality (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05]; low certainty). Within-trial subgroup analysis with intermediate credibility suggested that the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on mortality may differ based on disease severity. Subgroup results raise the possibility that proton-pump inhibitors may decrease 90-day mortality in less severely ill patients (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98) and may increase mortality in more severely ill patients (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.20]. Proton-pump inhibitors may have no effect on pneumonia and little or no effect on Clostridioides difficile infection (low certainty).

Conclusions

High certainty evidence supports the association of proton-pump inhibitors with decreased upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton-pump inhibitors may have little or no effect on mortality, although a decrease in mortality in less severely ill patients and an increase in mortality in more severely ill patients remain possible.

Gastrointestinal bleeding encompasses a broad array of clinical scenarios. The spectrum is diverse because of the multiple types of lesions that can cause bleeding, and because bleeding can occur from virtually anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The fundamental tenets of management of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding include the following: (1) the patient must undergo immediate assessment and stabilization of hemodynamic status, (2) the source of bleeding must be identified, (3) active bleeding should be stopped, (4) the underlying abnormality should be treated, and (5) recurrent bleeding should be "prevented.

Introduction

Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers. A proportion of these patients develop clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and the mortality rate in such patients is high. Numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies have investigated the role of different stress ulcer prophylactic drugs and strategies for the prevention of stress ulcers and thereby upper GI bleeding. In pooled analysis, when compared with placebo, stress ulcer prophylaxis with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or sucralfate results in a reduction in clinically important bleeding with prophylaxis. In a recent large RCT enrolling 3298 patients and comparing pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), with placebo, there was no difference in the 90-day mortality despite a significant reduction (relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86) in one or more episodes of clinically important GI bleeding. Stress ulcer prophylaxis, on the other hand, also alters the acidity of the stomach content leading to changes in gastric and tracheobronchial colonisation with pathogenic bacteria. This may result in an increased risk for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea or other therapy-related adverse events. There is also evidence that the addition of pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis in enterally fed patients, does not result in a reduction in the incidence of GI bleeding when compared with patients who received enteral feeding alone. Hence, prophylaxis may not be indicated in all critically ill patientsand is often overused. Thus, the benefits of stress ulcer prophylaxis need to be balanced against its risks.

Over the last few years, despite a growing number of systematic reviews that were conducted on the prevention of upper GI bleeding, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were narrowed to comparisons of a limited number of interventions. These have been inconclusive or generated conflicting results. While there are new and ongoing studies on the topic, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of current evidence on different pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of upper GI bleeding was undertaken to provide direct and indirect evidence on the benefits and harms of bleeding prophylaxis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The current study is an extension and update of our Cochrane review published in 2018, presents new findings derived from an NMA, offering additional depth for informed decision-making.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two review authors from a pool of five (IT, LK, MTB, SH, MAW, JVP and JLZN) independently screened each title, abstract and full text, extracted data in a standardised form and assessed them with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We classified a study's overall risk of bias as high if the study had high risk of bias in any domain. Likewise, we classified the risk of bias as unclear if the study had no high risk of bias and had unclear risk of bias in any domain. Last, we classified a study's overall risk of bias as low if the study had low risk of bias in all domains.

Data synthesis

We used risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with their respective 95% CIs. We assessed heterogeneity between studies by visually examining the forest plot to check for overlapping CIs and by using the χ² test for homogeneity with a 10% level of significance and the I² statistic. We assessed the likelihood of potential publication bias by using funnel plots, provided that at least 10 studies were included in a meta-analysis.

Firstly, we performed standard pairwise meta‐analyses for every treatment comparison (not reported here) if adequate. We combined continuous data using the weighted mean difference. We used the random-effects model for data synthesis when we identified heterogeneity as substantial or considerable based on χ² test and I² statistics. We interpreted I² values from 0% to 25% as possibly not important, from 26% to 50% as moderate heterogeneity, from 51% to 75% as substantial heterogeneity and from 76% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity.

### Preventing recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection who are taking low-dose aspirin or naproxen [^20cc5806]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients who have had upper gastrointestinal bleeding continue to take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain. It is uncertain whether infection with Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for bleeding in such patients.

Methods

We studied patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were infected with H. pylori and who were taking low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs. We evaluated whether eradication of the infection or omeprazole treatment was more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding. We recruited patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was confirmed by endoscopy. Their ulcers were healed by daily treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole for eight weeks or longer. Then, those who had been taking aspirin were given 80 mg of aspirin daily, and those who had been taking other NSAIDs were given 500 mg of naproxen twice daily for six months. The patients in each group were then randomly assigned separately to receive 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months or one week of eradication therapy, consisting of 120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, all given four times daily, followed by placebo for six months.

Results

We enrolled 400 patients (250 of whom were taking aspirin and 150 of whom were taking other NSAIDs). Among those taking aspirin, the probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 1.9 percent for patients who received eradication therapy and 0.9 percent for patients who received omeprazole (absolute difference, 1.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1.9 to 3.9 percent). Among users of other NSAIDs, the probability of recurrent bleeding was 18.8 percent for patients receiving eradication therapy and 4.4 percent for those treated with omeprazole (absolute difference, 14.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 4.4 to 24.4 percent; P = 0.005).

Conclusions

Among patients with H. pylori infection and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are taking low-dose aspirin, the eradication of H. pylori is equivalent to treatment with omeprazole in preventing recurrent bleeding. Omeprazole is superior to the eradication of H. pylori in preventing recurrent bleeding in patients who are taking other NSAIDs.

### Interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units [^ecf3a65b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to stress ulcers contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Stress ulceration refers to GI mucosal injury related to the stress of being critically ill. ICU patients with major bleeding as a result of stress ulceration might have mortality rates approaching 48.5% to 65%. However, the incidence of stress-induced GI bleeding in ICUs has decreased, and not all critically ill patients need prophylaxis. Stress ulcer prophylaxis can result in adverse events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia; therefore, it is necessary to evaluate strategies that safely decrease the incidence of GI bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the effect and risk-benefit profile of interventions for preventing upper GI bleeding in people admitted to ICUs.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 23 August 2017, using relevant search terms: MEDLINE; Embase; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature; and the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Disease Group Specialised Register, as published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 8). We searched the reference lists of all included studies and those from relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses to identify additional studies. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal and contacted individual researchers working in this field, as well as organisations and pharmaceutical companies, to identify unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with participants of any age and gender admitted to ICUs for longer than 48 hours. We excluded studies in which participants were admitted to ICUs primarily for the management of GI bleeding and studies that compared different doses, routes, and regimens of one drug in the same class because we were not interested in intraclass effects of drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 2292 unique records. We included 129 records reporting on 121 studies, including 12 ongoing studies and two studies awaiting classification. We judged the overall risk of bias of two studies as low. Selection bias was the most relevant risk of bias domain across the included studies, with 78 studies not clearly reporting the method used for random sequence generation. Reporting bias was the domain with least risk of bias, with 12 studies not reporting all outcomes that researchers intended to investigate. Any intervention versus placebo or no prophylaxisIn comparison with placebo, any intervention seems to have a beneficial effect on the occurrence of upper GI bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.57; moderate certainty of evidence). The use of any intervention reduced the risk of upper GI bleeding by 10% (95% CI -12.0% to -7%). The effect estimate of any intervention versus placebo or no prophylaxis with respect to the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU, duration of ICU stay, duration of intubation (all with low certainty of evidence), the number of participants requiring blood transfusions (moderate certainty of evidence), and the units of blood transfused was consistent with benefits and harms. None of the included studies explicitly reported on serious adverse events. Individual interventions versus placebo or no prophylaxisIn comparison with placebo or no prophylaxis, antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and sucralfate were effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients. Researchers found that with H2 receptor antagonists compared with placebo or no prophylaxis, 11% less developed upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.16 to -0.06; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.70; 24 studies; 2149 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). Of ICU patients taking antacids versus placebo or no prophylaxis, 9% less developed upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.17 to -0.00; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.99; eight studies; 774 participants; low certainty of evidence). Among ICU patients taking sucralfate versus placebo or no prophylaxis, 5% less had upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.10 to -0.01; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.88; seven studies; 598 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). The remaining interventions including proton pump inhibitors did not show a significant effect in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients when compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Regarding the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, the effects of H2 receptor antagonists (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.48; eight studies; 945 participants; low certainty of evidence) and of sucralfate (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.04; four studies; 450 participants; low certainty of evidence) were consistent with benefits and harms when compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. None of the studies comparing antacids versus placebo or no prophylaxis provided data regarding nosocomial pneumonia.H2 receptor antagonists versus proton pump inhibitorsH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are most commonly used in practice to prevent upper GI bleeding in ICU patients. Proton pump inhibitors significantly more often prevented upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with H2 receptor antagonists (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.83 to 4.58; 18 studies; 1636 participants; low certainty of evidence). When taking H2 receptor antagonists, 4.8% more patients might experience upper GI bleeding (95% CI 2.1% to 9%). Nosocomial pneumonia occurred in similar proportions of participants taking H2 receptor antagonists and participants taking proton pump inhibitors (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35; 10 studies; 1256 participants; low certainty of evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that antacids, sucralfate, and H2 receptor antagonists might be more effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. The effect estimates of any treatment versus no prophylaxis on nosocomial pneumonia were consistent with benefits and harms. Evidence of low certainty suggests that proton pump inhibitors might be more effective than H2 receptor antagonists. Therefore, patient-relevant benefits and especially harms of H2 receptor antagonists compared with proton pump inhibitors need to be assessed by larger, high-quality RCTs to confirm the results of previously conducted, smaller, and older studies.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) continues to be an important cause for emergency room visits and carries significant morbidity and mortality. Early resuscitative measures form the basis of the management of patients presenting with UGIB and can improve the outcomes of such patients including lowering mortality. In this review, using an evidence-based approach, we discuss the initial assessment and resuscitation of patients presenting with UGIB including identifying clues from history and physical examination to confirm UGIB, preendoscopic risk assessment tools, the role of early fluid resuscitation, utilization of blood products, use of pharmacologic interventions, and the optimal timing of endoscopy.

Gastrointestinal bleeding

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common with an estimated incidence of 134 per 100,000 population, equating to approximately one presentation every 6 min. The commonest causes include peptic ulcer disease, varices and malignancy. Despite advances in medical care, mortality over the past two decades has remained high at 10%. Initial management includes fluid resuscitation if haemodynamically unstable, transfusion support, risk stratification, pharmacological therapies (e.g. terlipressin for those with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding) and timely access to endoscopy or interventional radiology. Anaesthetists are often involved in the care of these patients for airway protection in those with ongoing haematemesis and altered mental and respiratory status.

High certainty evidence recommends a transfusion threshold of 70 g.l ‐1, aiming for a target of 70–100 g.l ‐1. A higher threshold should be considered in patients with cardiovascular disease. The role of tranexamic acid in gastrointestinal bleeding has recently been questioned with the results of a large, pragmatic trial showing no reduction in mortality and increased risk of venous thrombosis. Its use in this setting is therefore not recommended. There are limited data characterising changes in coagulopathy in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and the limited role of conventional coagulation tests (e.g. PT, INR) in predicting bleeding, particularly in patients with liver disease, is increasingly recognised. In patients who are actively bleeding/haemodynamically unstable, adherence to standard major haemorrhage protocols and referral to critical care are recommended.

The incidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding is increasing and accounts for 3% of emergency surgical referrals with an inpatient mortality of 3.4%, which rises to 18% in patients who develop lower gastrointestinal bleeding while already hospitalised. The most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the UK is diverticular disease, followed by benign anorectal conditions (e.g. fissures, haemorrhoids and rectal ulcers). Management includes risk stratification, interventions to diagnose and treat bleeding (e.g. colonoscopy, interventional radiology, endoscopic therapy and surgery), reversing anticoagulant therapy in life‐threatening haemorrhage and transfusion support. Nearly one‐third of patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding will receive a RBC transfusion but up to 80% of these may be inappropriate or unnecessary. Evidence for RBC transfusion thresholds is limited and there are no RCT data. Therefore, similar thresholds to those recommended in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding are recommended.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^19217bf2]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of antiplatelet therapy, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, BSG/ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend to do not discontinue aspirin routinely for secondary prevention. Resume aspirin, if discontinued, as soon as hemostasis is achieved, or there is no further evidence of bleeding.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^07f406a1]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m 2] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70-90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Pre-endoscopic erythromycin administration in upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated meta-analysis and systematic review [^10cabaf4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In patients suffering from upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), adequate visualization is essential during endoscopy. Prior to endoscopy, erythromycin administration has been shown to enhance visualization in these patients; however, guidelines have not fully adopted this practice. Thus, we performed a comprehensive, up-to-date meta-analysis on the issue of erythromycin administration in this patient population.

Methods

After searching multiple databases (November 2015), randomized controlled trials on adult subjects comparing administration of erythromycin before endoscopy in UGIB patients to no erythromycin or placebo were included. Pooled estimates of adequacy of gastric mucosa visualized, need for second endoscopy, duration of procedure, length of hospital stay, units of blood transfused, and need for emergent surgery using odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) were calculated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.

Results

Eight studies (n = 598) were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Erythromycin administration showed statistically significant improvement in adequate gastric mucosa visualization (OR 4.14; 95% CI: 2.01–8.53, P < 0.01) while reduced the need for a second-look endoscopy (OR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34–0.77, P < 0.01) and length of hospital stay (MD -1.75; 95% CI: -2.43 to -1.06, P < 0.01). Duration of procedure (P = 0.2), units of blood transfused (P = 0.08), and need for emergent surgery (P = 0.88) showed no significant differences.

Conclusion

Pre-endoscopic erythromycin administration in UGIB patients significantly improves gastric mucosa visualization while reducing length of hospital stay and the need for second-look endoscopy.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^f82344d4]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).

Design and Setting

Systematic review and frequentist network meta-analysis using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane for screening of records, data extraction and analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.

Participants

Randomised controlled trials involving patients admitted to ICUs for longer than 24 hours were included.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Gut Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) databases were searched from August 2017 to March 2022. The search in MEDLINE was updated in April 2023. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the prevention of clinically important upper GI bleeding.

Results

We included 123 studies with 46 996 participants. Cimetidine (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77, moderate certainty), ranitidine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76, moderate certainty), antacids (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.68, moderate certainty), sucralfate (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75, moderate certainty) and a combination of ranitidine and antacids (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.62, moderate certainty) are likely effective in preventing upper GI bleeding. The effect of any intervention on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU or the hospital, duration of the stay in the ICU, duration of intubation and (serious) adverse events remains unclear.

Conclusions

Several interventions seem effective in preventing clinically important upper GI bleeding while there is limited evidence for other outcomes. Patient-relevant benefits and harms need to be assessed under consideration of the patients' underlying conditions.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^a49b8565]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Primary outcome (clinically important upper GI bleeding)

We included 94 RCTs in the analysis with 42 548 participants (see figure 3). No evidence of global or loop-specific incoherence was found in the network (see online supplemental file 5).

Figure 3
Network of interventions for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Compared with placebo, ranitidine with antacids likely reduces clinically important upper GI bleeding (see table 1, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.62, moderate certainty evidence). Also, cimetidine (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77, 13 studies, 1288 participants; 79 fewer cases per 1000 from 108 fewer to 41 fewer), ranitidine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76, 12 studies, 871 participants; 88 fewer cases per 1000 (from 118 fewer to 46 fewer), antacids (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.67, 8 studies, 708 participants; 87 fewer cases per 1000, from 113 fewer to 54 fewer) and sucralfate (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75, 8 studies, 698 participants; 58 fewer cases per 1000, from 78 fewer to 32 fewer) likely reduce clinically important upper GI bleeding compared with placebo (moderate certainty evidence) (see summary of findings in table 2). Omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole and pirenzepine might be more effective than placebo but the evidence is of low or very low certainty. There was no clear effect of other interventions on the incidence of clinically important upper GI bleeding. All effect estimates and rankings are reported in online supplemental file 6,7.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^0dfbbd13]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps indicate that further research would be helpful in guiding decision-making. One of these gaps reflects lack of evidence about the effects of bleeding prophylaxis on different population subgroups, including people with pneumonia at the time of ICU admission, as well as the effects of cointerventions such as different feeding regimens, antibiotics, etc, on the effectiveness of bleeding prophylaxis. Furthermore, more evidence from RCTs is needed on the effects of PPIs on C. difficile infection-related diarrhoea. This adverse event has been observed in non-randomised studies but rarely in RCTs. C. difficile infection-related diarrhoea was not included as an outcome of this review at the stage of formulating the review protocol. We identified only eight studies that reported on this adverse event.

In recent years, several systematic reviews have investigated the risk–benefit profile of bleeding prophylaxis in ICU patients. Their conclusions about the beneficial effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis on clinically important upper GI bleeding in ICU patients varied. The scope of these reviews mostly focuses on a limited number of interventions compared with each other or of one or with placebo or no prophylaxis and our review complements a comprehensive and up-to-date evidence base for this important medical topic. Alquarini et al compared sucralfate versus H2RAs in ICU patients for prevention of upper GI bleeding and the incidence of pneumonia and found no difference between the two treatments in the occurrence of upper GI bleeding but found a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in the sucralfate arm, which confirms the findings of this reviewthat compared the effects of H2RAs, PPIs to placebo in ICU patients. The systematic review and trial sequential analysis included 42 trials with 6899 participants. In the trial sequential analysis, no clear effect of prophylactic treatment on the occurrence of upper GI bleeding was identified. Krag et al conducted a systematic review using Cochrane methods and compared the effects of H2RAs or PPIs versus placebo or no treatment. They reported lower risk of upper GI bleeding in the pooled effect of all studies with treatment versus placebo or no treatment. However, they emphasised that this result was not maintained in an analysis of low risk of bias studies only. Similar to our findings, risk of pneumonia was not significantly different between treatment and no prophylaxis or placebo. Recently conducted RCTseemed to be adequately powered to detect meaningful differences in the effect on clinically important upper GI bleeding.

### Success and shortcomings of a clinical care pathway in the management of acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^ff8bc617]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most common medical emergency encountered by gastroenterologists resulting in high patient morbidity and cost. We sought to establish if a GI bleeding clinical care pathway could improve the quality and cost effectiveness of inpatient medical care.

Methods

A disease management program for acute upper GI bleeding was established. Length of stay, time to endoscopy, utilization of potentially unnecessary radiological tests, acid suppression, and cost of care were compared between patients pre- and postinitiation of GI bleeding pathway guidelines.

Results

The instituted GI bleeding management program significantly reduced the use of intravenous H2-blockade from 65.3% to 47.7% (p = 0.002). The use of radiological tests, time to endoscopy, and length of hospital of stay were unchanged. There was a trend toward a reduction in total cost and variable direct cost per patient admitted with acute upper GI bleeding, from $5,381 to $4,627 and from $2,269 to $1,952, respectively.

Conclusion

A clinical care pathway may affect the management of acute upper GI bleeding and reduce costs. However, there are significant limitations and barriers to the overall effectiveness of such a pathway in actual clinical practice.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^4535a1f5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding — recommendations: We recommend colonoscopy in patients with occult GI bleeding. We recommend EGD in patients with occult GI bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in those patients with upper GI symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We suggest small-bowel evaluation after negative EGD and colonoscopy results in patients with occult GI bleeding who have persistent anemia. We recommend colonoscopy for the evaluation of chronic intermittent scant hematochezia in patients aged > 50 years and for patients who have iron deficiency anemia, risk factors for colorectal neoplasia, or the alarm symptoms of weight loss or bowel habit changes. We suggest that in younger patients presenting with chronic intermittent scant hematochezia without alarm symptoms, a digital rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient evaluation. We recommend EGD in the initial evaluation of patients with melena followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We recommend an initial EGD in patients with severe hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to evaluate for a high-risk upper GI lesion, followed by colonoscopy if the EGD result is negative. We suggest colonoscopy within 24 hours of admission after a rapid bowel preparation in the evaluation of patients with severe hematochezia. We recommend endoscopic treatment with epinephrine solution injection combined with thermal coagulation or endoscopic clip placement.

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^b4da1e34]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^f136a336]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) resuscitation and evaluation — care setting and initial measures are outlined: The majority of patients with chronic LGIB can be managed electively in the outpatient setting, whereas patients presenting with acute LGIB with hematochezia usually require inpatient management. These patients should undergo stabilization and resuscitation with crystalloids or blood products, and coagulation factors and platelets may be necessary in patients on antithrombotic agents or with underlying bleeding disorders. Patients with clinical evidence of ongoing or severe bleeding, those with a transfusion requirement of greater than 2 units of packed red blood cells, and those with significant comorbidities may require admission and monitoring in an intensive care unit setting. The role of nasogastric tube placement and gastric lavage to exclude an upper GI source has not been studied prospectively in suspected acute LGIB; however, this approach should be considered in patients with hematochezia and hemodynamic instability to rule out brisk UGIB. An actively bleeding upper GI source is unlikely if bile is seen in the nasogastric lavage, but it cannot be ruled out in the presence of a clear aspirate.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The editorial office of the Cochrane Gut Group at McMaster University developed and ran searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled or uncontrolled observational studies, and systematic reviews of any study design published in the English language as full text (conference abstracts were not included) between January 1, 1995 (January 1, 1985, for some searches), and August 13, 2020. Full details of search strategies can be found in Supplementary Digital Content (see Appendix 1). Each identified abstract was screened for eligibility in duplicate by at least 2 of the 4 voting gastroenterologists. Potentially eligible studies were assessed as full-text articles by the GRADE methodologists or 1 of the 4 voting gastroenterologists. A GRADE methodologist verified data extraction. An evidence map was prepared for each PICO question. The panel reviewed the preliminary evidence map, proposed additional articles, and assisted in supplementary literature searches targeting broader populations when gaps in the evidence were identified. Where appropriate, more recent publications available after the formal literature search and evidentiary review are discussed for contextual information if deemed to provide critical additional contemporary insight.

The 2 GRADE methodologists prepared assessments of the risk of bias of each included study and developed complete evidence reports, including a summary of evidence tables (see Appendix 2, Supplementary Digital Content). The certainty of the evidence for each PICO question was categorized as very low, low, moderate, or high depending on the assessment of (i) limitations in the design and execution of the studies, (ii) indirectness, (iii) inconsistency, (iv) imprecision, and (v) other considerations including publication bias, according to the GRADE approach. Manuscripts initially deemed potentially eligible but eventually excluded are listed in Supplementary Digital Content (see Appendix 3,) with reasons for exclusion. Each GRADE methodologist, in turn, prepared half of the evidence reports, whereas the other methodologist double-checked them, providing feedback until agreement was achieved. For each PICO, 3 versions of the wording of the potential recommendation were prepared a priori (in favor, against, or unable to recommend). The opinions of individual content experts were sought for specific issues. The evidence reports and risk of bias tables were shared with the whole panel on April 16, 2021, and discussed by e-mail. The finalized document was shared before the voting videoconference meetings on May 8 and 15, 2021.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure — classification of infection acquisition and empiric therapy emphasizes that first-line antibiotic therapy should be determined by the etiology and severity of the infection, acquisition setting, and local resistance patterns; community-acquired infections are diagnosed < 48 hours from admission without healthcare exposure in the past 90 days, healthcare-associated infections are diagnosed < 48 hours from admission with healthcare exposure in the past 90 days, and nosocomial infections are diagnosed > 48 hours after admission, and because the initial antibiotic regimen impacts prognosis, determining when and how the infection was acquired is critical to choose initial antibiotics.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^6b02c701]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

International guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the evidence for this recommendation has not been reassessed recently.

Objective

To determine whether current evidence continues to support the recommended 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Sources

Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics.

Study Selection

Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations (or 0 days) in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Observational and pediatric studies, gray literature, comparisons of systemic antibiotics, studies not reporting mortality or early rebleed, and studies of nonsystemic antibiotics were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were pooled by random-effects bayesian meta-analyses using a noninformative prior for the effect and a weakly informative prior for heterogeneity. To account for therapeutic advancements, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for studies published after 2004.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference (RD) scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes.

Results

The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants (mean age range, 41.5 to 62.0 years; 981 male [74.2%] individuals), of whom 1202 (90.9%) had a variceal source of bleeding. Study quality was low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events. Two RCTs compared longer (5–7 days) to shorter (2–3 days) durations and 12 RCTs compared any prophylaxis (1–10 days) to none. Shorter durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [95% CrI],-2.6 to 4.9). Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI,-4.2 to 10.0) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD,15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0 to 25.9). The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for all 3 outcomes were higher in studies published after 2004.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis do not support the purported mortality benefit driving guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Although prophylaxis reduced reported infections, methodological concerns regarding infection definitions introduced high risk of bias. Higher-quality RCTs are needed to determine the benefit and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the modern era of advanced interventions. Until these studies are available, clinicians should be aware that the current guideline recommendations are not based on high-quality evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^13d47ce0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions — acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7f847bcd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding management — hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed, and risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24 h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation, and endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by endoscopist experience, the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities, and repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia, and patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin (secondary prophylaxis) should generally resume aspirin as soon as possible after bleeding ceases and at least within 7 days. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^f2ae2137]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, BSG/ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering reversal agents - idarucizumab in dabigatran treated patients, and andexanet in anti-factor-Xa treated patients, or IV 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate if andexanet is not available
- in patients with hemodynamic instability taking DOACs.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^76dc807b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)–positive ulcer — confirmation of eradication and test selection: Document cure of infection at ≥ 1 month after completing therapy, and if repeat endoscopy is not needed, a urea breath test or stool antigen test should be done; antibody testing should not be employed. Because PPIs can cause falsely negative results in approximately one third of cases, PPIs should be discontinued 2 weeks before testing to ensure optimal sensitivity.
