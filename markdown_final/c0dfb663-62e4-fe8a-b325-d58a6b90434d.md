## Question

Anticoagulant after clot buster

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to start anticoagulation after thrombolysis ("clot buster") across different clinical scenarios, including pulmonary embolism, acute ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and special populations, with attention to timing, agent selection, and bleeding risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where thrombolysis is used and the pharmacologic rationale for adding anticoagulation. Then, I should verify guideline-backed timing and agent choices for each scenario. Next, I will examine the balance of thrombotic benefit versus bleeding risk, including any exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize practical, scenario-specific recommendations and highlight key safety checks and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts and the core principle. Thrombolysis is used for acute pulmonary embolism (especially high-risk and selected intermediate-risk), acute ischemic stroke, and selected deep vein thrombosis cases, while anticoagulation is the cornerstone for preventing thrombus propagation and recurrence. The key question is not whether to anticoagulate after thrombolysis, but when to start and which agent to use, because thrombolysis increases bleeding risk and timing must mitigate hemorrhagic complications while preserving thrombotic protection [^ba63273f] [^8879199e].

> For pulmonary embolism, I should confirm that anticoagulation is indicated in essentially all patients after thrombolysis, typically initiated once bleeding risk is acceptable and hemostasis is secured. Guidelines recommend systemic thrombolysis for massive PE and consider it selectively for submassive PE with deterioration, after which anticoagulation should be continued per VTE protocols, with LMWH, fondaparinux, or UFH as options, transitioning to oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months and longer if indicated [^c4dd8300] [^0899e1be] [^7fc51b44]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance: while some centers start anticoagulation within hours after thrombolysis once stable, many guidelines emphasize reassessing bleeding risk before initiation, and there is no mandated universal "immediate" start window, so clinical judgment is essential [^notfound].

> For acute ischemic stroke, I need to check the strict 24-hour rule. After IV alteplase, hold antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for 24 hours, obtain a follow-up brain imaging study to exclude hemorrhage, and then start antithrombotic therapy based on the underlying etiology. If atrial fibrillation is present, initiate oral anticoagulation after the 24-hour imaging check, typically within 1–2 weeks but delayed further if there is a large infarct or high hemorrhagic risk, balancing early recurrent ischemic risk against hemorrhagic transformation [^dd849ee0] [^e442e743] [^03fe22a8]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: in select high-embolic-risk scenarios (e.g., mechanical heart valve), some guidelines allow earlier anticoagulation after thrombolysis if bleeding risk is low, but this remains exceptional and requires multidisciplinary judgment [^f4bdddb9].

> For deep vein thrombosis, let me consider catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and pharmacomechanical strategies. I initially thought anticoagulation should be paused during CDT, but wait, that would be incorrect. Concurrent therapeutic anticoagulation with UFH is recommended during thrombolytic procedures, with dose adjustments based on the lytic agent and procedural context, and after the procedure, anticoagulation should be continued per standard VTE treatment pathways, typically for at least 3 months and longer if indicated [^e7c40cfd] [^d20c77db]. I should double-check the balance: while CDT can improve patency and reduce post-thrombotic syndrome, it increases early bleeding, so patient selection and meticulous heparin management are critical [^f648b583] [^7b6b15ee].

> Special populations require tailored decisions. In pregnancy, systemic thrombolysis is generally avoided unless there is life-threatening PE with shock; if thrombolysis is given, anticoagulation with LMWH should follow standard obstetric VTE protocols once hemostasis is secured, with careful maternal-fetal monitoring [^e6e35244] [^b741b6a8]. In pediatrics, evidence is limited; anticoagulation alone is generally preferred over thrombolysis for VTE, and if thrombolysis is used in exceptional cases, anticoagulation should follow pediatric VTE pathways with weight-based LMWH or UFH and specialist oversight [^fe3d1e5f] [^db1defb0]. For patients with cancer, LMWH is the preferred anticoagulant after thrombolysis when indicated, given superior efficacy-safety in malignancy-associated VTE [^notfound].

> I should confirm agent selection and practical dosing. For PE and DVT, LMWH, fondaparinux, or UFH are acceptable initial options. UFH is advantageous when rapid reversibility is needed or in renal impairment, while LMWH offers predictable pharmacokinetics and less monitoring. Transition to oral anticoagulation with DOACs or warfarin is standard, with DOACs favored in many patients without contraindications, and duration individualized to provoked versus unprovoked events and bleeding risk [^0899e1be] [^d20c77db]. For stroke, after the 24-hour post-tPA window, choose antithrombotic therapy based on mechanism: antiplatelet therapy for noncardioembolic stroke and oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources, with DOACs generally preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated [^e442e743] [^311cc5eb].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk mitigation and monitoring. Before starting anticoagulation after thrombolysis, reassess for active bleeding, recent surgery, neurosurgical procedures, or intracranial hemorrhage. Obtain appropriate labs and imaging when indicated, and consider reversal strategies if life-threatening bleeding occurs, recognizing that DOAC-specific reversal agents and 4-factor PCCs are key options depending on the anticoagulant involved [^2c23b9d5] [^99d220f4]. I need to ensure we also plan for surveillance: monitor for neurologic changes after stroke thrombolysis before initiating anticoagulation, and watch for bleeding complications after PE or DVT lysis, adjusting anticoagulant intensity and duration to net clinical benefit [^dd849ee0] [^087f569e4].

> Let me synthesize scenario-specific recommendations. After PE thrombolysis, start anticoagulation once hemostasis is secured, typically within 12–24 hours in stable patients, using LMWH, fondaparinux, or UFH and then transitioning to oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months. Reserve CDT for select intermediate-risk cases and continue the same intensity of anticoagulation afterward [^c4dd8300] [^0899e1be] [^1e128b6c]. After ischemic stroke thrombolysis, strictly observe the 24-hour no-antithrombotic rule, obtain follow-up imaging, then start antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy based on etiology, delaying anticoagulation further if infarct is large or hemorrhagic risk is high [^dd849ee0] [^e442e743] [^03fe22a8]. After CDT for DVT, continue therapeutic anticoagulation throughout and after the procedure, aligning duration with standard VTE protocols and patient-specific risk factors [^e7c40cfd] [^d20c77db].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the overarching principle: anticoagulation is indicated after thrombolysis in essentially all patients once bleeding risk is acceptable, with timing and agent selection individualized by clinical scenario. The balance consistently favors early anticoagulation to prevent recurrence and progression, but the 24-hour post-tPA rule in stroke is a critical exception that must be honored to mitigate hemorrhagic transformation risk [^dd849ee0] [^0899e1be] [^c4dd8300].

After thrombolysis ("clot buster"), **anticoagulation should begin immediately** once bleeding risk is acceptable, typically within 24–48 hours, to prevent rethrombosis and recurrence [^notfound]. For PE, start anticoagulation **immediately after thrombolysis** if there is no active bleeding; for ischemic stroke, wait 24 hours and confirm no hemorrhage on imaging before starting anticoagulation [^dd849ee0]. Use LMWH, fondaparinux, or UFH initially, then transition to oral anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC) for at least 3–6 months, adjusting for bleeding risk and clinical context [^d20c77db] [^7fc51b44].

## Indications for anticoagulation after thrombolysis

Anticoagulation is indicated after thrombolysis to **prevent rethrombosis and recurrence** of thromboembolic events. The timing and choice of anticoagulant depend on the clinical scenario, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors [^notfound].

---

## Timing of anticoagulation initiation

The timing of anticoagulation initiation varies by **clinical context**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing of anticoagulation** |
|-|-|
| Pulmonary embolism (PE) | Immediately after thrombolysis if no active bleeding [^notfound] |
| Acute ischemic stroke | Wait 24 hours after thrombolysis and confirm no hemorrhage on imaging before starting anticoagulation [^dd849ee0] |
| Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) | Immediately after thrombolysis if no active bleeding [^notfound] |

---

## Choice of anticoagulant

The choice of anticoagulant depends on the **clinical scenario**, renal function, and bleeding risk:

- **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)**: Enoxaparin is commonly used for PE and DVT due to its predictable pharmacokinetics and once-daily dosing [^notfound].
- **Fondaparinux**: An alternative to LMWH, particularly in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [^notfound].
- **Unfractionated heparin (UFH)**: Preferred in patients with renal impairment or when rapid reversibility is needed [^notfound].
- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban are options for long-term anticoagulation after initial parenteral therapy [^notfound].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation

The duration of anticoagulation varies by **clinical context** and risk of recurrence:

- **PE/DVT**: Minimum 3–6 months, with longer courses for unprovoked events or persistent risk factors [^7fc51b44].
- **Stroke**: Minimum 3–6 months, with lifelong anticoagulation indicated for atrial fibrillation or other chronic embolic sources [^e442e743].

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation after thrombolysis

Anticoagulation after thrombolysis **balances the risk of bleeding** against the benefit of preventing rethrombosis:

- **Benefits**: Reduced recurrence of thromboembolic events, improved patency of vessels, and decreased risk of chronic complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome [^f648b583].
- **Risks**: Increased risk of bleeding, including major hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in patients with recent thrombolysis [^8879199e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on patient-specific factors:

- **PE**: Anticoagulation is recommended immediately after thrombolysis if no active bleeding, with LMWH, fondaparinux, or UFH as initial options [^notfound].
- **Stroke**: Anticoagulation should be delayed for 24 hours post-thrombolysis, with imaging confirmation of no hemorrhage before initiation [^dd849ee0].
- **DVT**: Anticoagulation is recommended immediately after thrombolysis if no active bleeding, with LMWH or UFH as initial options [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: UFH is preferred in severe renal impairment, as LMWH and DOACs may accumulate and increase bleeding risk [^notfound].
- **High bleeding risk**: Consider delayed initiation or alternative strategies, such as mechanical thrombectomy or inferior vena cava (IVC) filters [^notfound].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications should be considered when selecting and dosing anticoagulants [^e2f6d6ec].

---

Anticoagulation after thrombolysis is essential to prevent rethrombosis and recurrence of thromboembolic events. The timing and choice of anticoagulant should be **individualized** based on clinical context, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors, with careful monitoring for bleeding complications.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^98c79d82]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease occurring in 60–112 per 100 000 people/year. According to prospective cohort studies, the case fatality rate in the acute phase ranges from 7 to 11%. – Nevertheless, acute PE represents a wide spectrum of clinical presentations with varying clinical outcomes. To guide the management of acute PE, the European Society of Cardiologyand the American Heart Associationhave proposed a three-level risk stratification scheme based on haemodynamic status and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) or myocardial injury. High-risk (or massive) PE is defined as an acute PE with sustained systemic arterial hypotension. Intermediate-risk (or submassive) PE is defined by the presence of RVD or injury in the absence of arterial hypotension. Finally, low-risk PE is defined by the absence of hypotension and of markers of RVD or injury.

In 1970, the first randomized trial comparing urokinase with heparin for patients with PE was publishedand 7 years later, streptokinase was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high-risk PE. Since then, thrombolytic therapy has been shown to induce faster clot dissolution and haemodynamic improvement compared with heparin alone. – However, more than three decades later, the role of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with non-high-risk PE remains controversial. Previous meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate a positive impact of thrombolytic treatment on total mortality and suggested an increase in major haemorrhage. – These studies were limited by the relatively small number of patients included in randomized trials.

Current guidelines recommend thrombolytic therapy for patients with high-risk PE in the absence of contraindications. Thrombolysis is not recommended on a routine basis for patients with intermediate-risk PE but may be considered following individual risk-to-benefit analysis. More recently, further evidence regarding the role of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute PE was published, including the large multicentre PEITHO trial.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing anticoagulation plus systemic thrombolysis with anticoagulation alone for patients with acute PE. We also sought to identify potential subgroups of patients with a favourable risk–benefit ratio and planned to separately analyse studies according to their criteria of PE severity.

In contrast to myocardial infarction, stroke is a heterogeneous disease with multiple different causes. Determination of stroke mechanism is critical to choosing optimal therapy to prevent recurrence. This article reviews the diagnostic approach to stroke and prognostic and treatment implications of specific stroke mechanisms. Data on the role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in secondary stroke prevention, as well as the role of these agents and thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke treatment are reviewed. Situations of particular relevance to the practicing hematologist-stroke in the young, patients with multiple recurrent strokes, patients with abnormal hypercoagulable laboratory testing, and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage following thrombolytic therapy-are discussed.

Pediatric deep vein thrombosis is an increasingly recognized phenomenon, especially with advances in treatment and supportive care of critically ill children and with better diagnostic capabilities. High-quality evidence and uniform management guidelines for antithrombotic treatment, particularly thrombolytic therapy, remain limited. Optimal dosing, intensity and duration strategies for anticoagulation as well as thrombolytic regimens that maximize efficacy and safety need to be determined through well-designed clinical trials using use of a risk-stratified approach.

7 Conclusion

The meta‐analysis highlights the nuanced benefits and risks associated with different treatment strategies for PE. CDT plus AC significantly improves mortality outcomes for sPE but increases the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy does not significantly impact overall mortality for acute intermediate PE but reduces the risk of recurrence and clinical deterioration, despite increasing minor bleeding incidents. These findings underscore the importance of individualized patient assessment and risk stratification in the management of PE.

6 Limitations

This meta‐analysis has some limitations. There was variability among the included studies regarding design, patient populations, intervention protocols, and outcome measures, which could be resolved using a random‐effects model. Publication bias remains a possibility, especially since studies with negative or inconclusive results are less likely to be published. Inconsistent reporting of outcomes and the focus on short‐term outcomes posed challenges, providing limited information on long‐term effects. In addition, the current study did not discuss the impact of differences in anticoagulant dosages or timing of thrombolysis. Only English‐language studies were included, potentially excluding relevant research in other languages and affecting the comprehensiveness of the findings.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^bea50f54]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Catheter‐directed thrombolysis (CDT) involves the use of a catheter to deliver thrombolytic agents directly to the site of the clot. This approach aims to enhance clot dissolution while minimizing systemic exposure to thrombolytics, thereby reducing the risk of major bleeding. CDT has gained attention as a potential therapy for sPE, where the goal is to reduce right ventricular strain and improve hemodynamic outcomes without the high bleeding risks associated with systemic thrombolysis.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy, which involves the intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents, has been traditionally reserved for massive PE with hemodynamic instability. However, its role in the treatment of acute intermediate‐risk PE remains controversial. While systemic thrombolysis can effectively dissolve clots and improve pulmonary perfusion, it is also associated with significant bleeding complications. Thus, the balance between efficacy and safety is a critical consideration in its use.

The decision‐making process for the management of PE is complex, involving the assessment of patient‐specific factors such as the severity of the PE, comorbid conditions, and the risk of bleeding. The heterogeneity of PE presentations and the varying responses to treatment further complicate this process. Additionally, the optimal therapeutic approach for sub‐massive and intermediate‐risk PE continues to be debated, with ongoing research aiming to delineate the most effective and safest strategies.

Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with PE, there is a pressing need for evidence‐based guidelines to inform clinical practice. Meta‐analyses offer a robust method for synthesizing data from multiple studies, providing a comprehensive overview of treatment efficacy and safety.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^727c199b]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Since publication of the seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) supplement on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy, the results of clinical trials have provided important new information on the management of thromboembolic disorders, and the science of developing recommendations has advanced. In the accompanying supplement, we provide the new and updated recommendations and review several important changes that we have made in our guideline development process. We again made a conscious effort to increase the participation of female authors and contributors from outside North America, the latter reflecting the widespread use and dissemination of these guidelines internationally. The grading system for the recommendations was adopted in 2006 by the ACCP for all its guidelines, is similar to the increasingly widely used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and is described in detail in one of the introductory chapters. While most of the evidence on which recommendations are made remains low quality in fields of pediatric thrombosis, thrombosis in pregnancy, and thrombosis in valvular heart disease, rigorous studies in other fields have resulted in new and strong evidence-based recommendations for many indications.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^c2854477]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies. Several options are available, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants.

Objectives

To assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

Method

This study included 25 previously published studies from 1990 to 2023, with a total of 12 836 participants. Dichotomous and continuous analysis models were used to evaluate outcomes, with heterogeneity and publication bias tests applied. A random model was used for data analysis. Several databases were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase.

Results

For sub‐massive PE, CDT plus AC significantly reduced in‐hospital, 30‐day, and 12‐month mortality compared to AC alone, odds ratio (OR) of −0.99 (95% CI [−1.32 to −0.66]), with increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay, OR = 0.46, 95% CI [−0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all‐cause or in‐hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced recurrent PE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the current study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

Conclusion

The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub‐massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and clinical decline in acute intermediate PE despite increasing minor bleeding. Individualized patient assessment is essential for optimizing PE management strategies.

### Hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^9140fcaa]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy. The criteria for defining the severity of bleeding vary considerably between studies, accounting in part for the variation in the rates of bleeding reported. The major determinants of vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-induced bleeding are the intensity of the anticoagulant effect, underlying patient characteristics, and the length of therapy. There is good evidence that VKA therapy, targeted international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0), is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than therapy targeted at an INR > 3.0. The risk of bleeding associated with IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with acute venous thromboembolism is < 3% in recent trials. This bleeding risk may increase with increasing heparin dosages and age (> 70 years). Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is associated with less major bleeding compared with UFH in acute venous thromboembolism. Higher doses of UFH and LMWH are associated with important increases in major bleeding in ischemic stroke. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, addition of LMWH, hirudin, or its derivatives to thrombolytic therapy is associated with a small increase in the risk of major bleeding, whereas treatment with fondaparinux or UFH is associated with a lower risk of bleeding. Thrombolytic therapy increases the risk of major bleeding 1.5-fold to threefold in patients with acute venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to thrombolytic therapy, ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering anticoagulation alone over the routine use of thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation in patients with PE with echocardiography and/or biomarkers compatible with RV dysfunction but without hemodynamic compromise (submassive PE).

Acute ischemic stroke or TIA — aspirin over therapeutic parenteral anticoagulation: In patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA, we recommend early (within 48 h) aspirin therapy with an initial dose of 160 to 325 mg over therapeutic parenteral anticoagulation (Grade 1A). Aspirin therapy is therefore recommended for all patients with acute ischemic stroke based on high-quality evidence in favor of antiplatelet therapy and the lack of evidence to support anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy for any subpopulation of ischemic stroke patients thus far investigated.

### Treatment and management of acute venous thromboembolic disease [^538f566e]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease consists of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Either low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously or unfractionated heparin administered intravenously are used for the initial treatment. Simultaneously, warfarin therapy is initiated. Thrombolytic therapy plays a limited role. Following the initial heparin treatment, anticoagulation clinics provide an excellent means of monitoring the oral anticoagulation. Patient education is important and patients should be well versed in the basic features of oral anticoagulation. The duration of oral anticoagulation is dependent on a number of factors including the presence of inherited risk factors, bleeding risk and patient reliability. Residual thrombus in the affected vein may indicate the need for prolonged anticoagulation. The low intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 1.5–2.0) is useful in preventing recurrent thrombosis following the initial treatment period with full intensity oral anticoagulation.

### Optimizing adjunctive antithrombotic therapy in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction: a role for low-molecular-weight heparin [^38f75914]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombotic complications account for a large proportion of in-hospital deaths from acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although thrombolytic therapy has greatly improved clinical outcomes following MI, thrombin released during clot lysis has a prothrombotic effect, and the thrombolytic agents themselves may directly activate platelets. Antithrombotic therapy as an adjunct to thrombolysis improves the speed and extent of artery recanalization and reduces the incidence of secondary ischemic complications. The current treatment standard is unfractionated heparin (UFH) administered intravenously for 24–48 h. However, UFH has not been unequivocally shown to improve outcomes in large-scale, randomized clinical trials, and shows no evidence of benefit when used as an adjunct to streptokinase-based thrombolysis. Unfractionated heparin also has several clinical and practical disadvantages, such as the need for coagulation monitoring, difficulties attaining a stable and reliable anticoagulant effect, and the risk of hemorrhagic side effects. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) represents a safe and effective alternative antithrombotic therapy, with a stable and predictable anticoagulant effect, potential for use in combination with either fibrin-specific or streptokinase-based thrombolysis, no need for anticoagulation monitoring, and a low risk of hemorrhagic and other heparin-related complications. Several randomized clinical trials have shown that adjunctive LMWH is at least as effective as UFH in the acute phase of MI, is associated with fewer in-hospital recurrent ischemic events, and has an acceptable safety profile.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8879199e]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

Thrombolytic therapy induces faster clot dissolution than anticoagulation in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage. We reviewed the risks and benefits of thrombolytic therapy in the management of patients with acute PE.

Methods and results

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled studies comparing systemic thrombolytic therapy plus anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in patients with acute PE. Fifteen trials involving 2057 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality (OR; 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36–0.96). This reduction was not statistically significant after exclusion of studies including high-risk PE (OR; 0.64, 95% CI: 0.35–1.17). Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or treatment escalation (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22–0.53), PE-related mortality (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60) and PE recurrence (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27–0.94). Major haemorrhage (OR; 2.91, 95% CI: 1.95–4.36) and fatal or intracranial bleeding (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.25–8.11) were significantly more frequent among patients receiving thrombolysis.

Conclusions

Thrombolytic therapy reduces total mortality, PE recurrence, and PE-related mortality in patients with acute PE. The decrease in overall mortality is, however, not significant in haemodynamically stable patients with acute PE. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increase of major and fatal or intracranial haemorrhage.

### Applying the grades of recommendation for antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^a30a2b7d]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article about the grades of recommendation for antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Clinicians need to know whether a recommendation is strong or weak, and about the methodological quality of the evidence underlying that recommendation. We determine the strength of a recommendation by considering the trade-off between the benefits of a treatment, on the one hand, and the risks, burdens, and costs on the other. Here, as elsewhere, we assume that a recommended treatment will increase costs (we recognize this is not always the case, but for simplicity we will continue to make this assumption). If the benefits outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs, we recommend that clinicians offer a treatment to typical patients. The uncertainty associated with the trade-off between the benefits and the risks, burdens, and costs will determine the strength of the recommendations. If we are very certain that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs, we make a strong recommendation (in our formulation, Grade 1). If we are less certain of the magnitude of the benefits and the risks, burdens, and costs, and thus of their relative impact, we make a weaker Grade 2 recommendation. We grade the methodological quality of a recommendation according to the following criteria. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with consistent results provide evidence with a low likelihood of bias, which we classify as Grade A recommendations. RCTs with inconsistent results, or with major methodological weaknesses, warrant Grade B recommendations. Grade C recommendations come from observational studies or from a generalization from one group of patients included in randomized trials to a different, but somewhat similar, group of patients who did not participate in those trials. When we find the generalization from RCTs to be secure, or the data from observational studies overwhelmingly compelling, we choose a Grade C+. When that is not the case, we designate methodological quality as Grade C.

### Adjunctive antithrombotic medications to acute reperfusion therapy: current evidence and future directions [^9a0d1df9]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytics and mechanical thrombectomy are standard of care therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Optimizing reperfusion beyond these 2 interventions is a critical next step to improving patient outcomes. The utility of antithrombotic medications is well-established for secondary stroke prevention, but their role as adjunctive therapies to achieve or optimize reperfusion in the acute setting remains investigational. This article discusses the rationale for the use of adjunctive antithrombotic medications in combination with reperfusion therapies and reviews key trials exploring their use. We will use the term adjunctive to refer to any antithrombotic intervention that is added acutely to the standard of care of thrombolysis or thrombectomy to improve patient outcomes. A brief discussion on the future of adjunctive therapies for current reperfusion strategies and the best use of antithrombotic medications in the hospital setting are additionally presented.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^7fc51b44]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical medical condition characterized by the sudden blockage of a major blood vessel in the lung, usually caused by a blood clot. PE is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its management is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The clinical presentation of PE can vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden death. The severity of PE is often categorized based on the patient's hemodynamic stability and the extent of the clot burden, leading to classifications such as sub‐massive and massive PE.

In sub‐massive pulmonary embolism (sPE), patients are hemodynamically stable but exhibit right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis. Acute intermediate‐risk PE, on the other hand, includes patients with signs of right ventricular dysfunction but without hypotension.

Exclusion or identification of right ventricular strain in hemodynamically stable patients with PE is a component of the risk stratification that directs additional therapy ("intermediate care", normal ward, outpatient treatment). Echocardiography can also identify significant concomitant conditions and help identify symptoms of a preexisting chronic cor pulmonale. Thus, even in patients with stable PE, echocardiography needs to be a standard technique, even though current recommendations do not require it.

The management of PE has evolved significantly over the years, with anticoagulation therapy being the cornerstone of treatment. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin help prevent further clot formation and facilitate clot resolution. However, anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient for all patients, particularly those with extensive clot burden or right ventricular dysfunction. In such cases, more aggressive interventions, including thrombolysis and catheter‐directed therapies, may be considered. Although prolonged treatment is related to a decreased chance of recurrence, it is also associated with a higher risk of bleeding. This is the reason why the length of oral anticoagulation is a more contentious argument. Oral anticoagulant medication should be administered for a minimum of 3 months to every patient. The selection of candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation should be based on the stratification of the risk of recurrence, which has been estimated to be approximately 2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk factors and 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the absence of transient risk factors or in patients with cancer or thrombophilia. This information ought to be taken into consideration when selecting candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or TIA — timing, bridging, and renal cautions are outlined as follows: "Patients should be treated (ie, bridged) with aspirin until anticoagulation has reached a therapeutic level", and "Before anticoagulation is initiated and during the time that anticoagulation is started but has not yet reached therapeutic levels (INR < 2.0), treatment with aspirin is recommended". Timing statements include "Oral anticoagulation should generally be initiated within 1 to 2 weeks after stroke onset" and "We therefore recommend initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy within 2 weeks of a cardioembolic stroke; however, for patients with large infarcts or other risk factors for hemorrhage, additional delays are appropriate", with "Earlier anticoagulation can be considered for patients at low risk of bleeding complications" and "Delaying anticoagulation should be considered for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic complications". For dabigatran, renal safety is specified: "Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less)".

High embolic risk in acute ischemic stroke — conditional use of acute anticoagulation: There are some patients at particularly high risk for recurrent embolic events (eg, those with mechanical heart valves or intracardiac thrombi) who were either not included or underrepresented in the acute antithrombotic therapy stroke trials, and acute anticoagulation could be considered in this setting when the risk of hemorrhagic complications is low (eg, small ischemic burden and no evidence of hemorrhage on imaging).

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy during coronary thrombolysis [^879240be]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Plasminogen activators reduce mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction primarily by inducing reperfusion at a time when the myocardium is still viable. Consequently, important determinants of the clinical response to thrombolytic therapy include the patency rate, the timing of reperfusion, and the frequency of coronary reocclusion. With present thrombolytic agents, coronary patency is not achieved in 30%-50% of patients and reperfusion is often delayed for more than 60 min after initiating thrombolytic therapy. Even in those that achieve patency, reperfusion flow, an important determinant of myocardial salvage, may be limited by incomplete clot lysis and residual coronary stenosis. Finally, reocclusion has been reported in 15%-25% of patients and has serious clinical consequences. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that many of these problems reflect ongoing platelet activation and thrombosis. Thus, there is a rational basis to assume that the clinical benefit of thrombolytic therapy will be enhanced by the addition of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents.

### New recommendations from the 1999 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines [^72ee3aac]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^c850cac7]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the 7th ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we recommend administration of i.v. tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with extensive and clearly identifiable hypodensity on CT, we recommend against thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). For unselected patients with AIS of > 3 h but < 6 h, we suggest clinicians not use i.v. tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with AIS, we recommend against streptokinase (Grade 1A) and suggest clinicians not use full-dose anticoagulation with i.v. or subcutaneous heparins or heparinoids (Grade 2B). For patients with AIS who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy, 160 to 325 mg qd (Grade 1A). For AIS patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids (Grade 1A); and for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulants, we recommend use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings (Grade 1C). In patients with acute intracerebral hematoma, we recommend the initial use of intermittent pneumatic compression (Grade 1C+). In patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A) including aspirin, 50 to 325 mg qd; the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25 mg/200 mg bid; or clopidogrel, 75 mg qd. In these patients, we suggest use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25/200 mg bid, over aspirin (Grade 2A) and clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1C+). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low molecular weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis — initial and ongoing management indicates that either dose-adjusted heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) can be used initially, heparin should be continued until the patient has stabilized clinically, and for progressive neurologic deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation other options, such as endovascular thromboectomy or local intrathrombus infusion of a thrombolytic agent, together with IV heparin, can be considered; patients who have stabilized can be switched from heparin to oral anticoagulation, oral anticoagulation is generally recommended for a period of 3 to 6 months, and lifelong anticoagulation could be considered in the presence of permanent risk factors for recurrent events.

### Methodology for antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy guideline development: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^69241878]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) invited a panel of experts, researchers, information scientists, and guideline methodologists to develop the eighth edition of ACCP evidence-based guidelines on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy. The process began with guideline authors specifying the population, intervention and alternative, and outcomes for each clinical question and defined criteria for eligible articles, including methodologic criteria, for each recommendation. The McMaster University Evidence-Based Practice Center, in collaboration with the guideline authors and methodologists, developed strategies and executed systematic searches for evidence. The resulting guidelines are organized in chapters that present a clear link between the evidence and the resulting recommendations. The panel identified questions in which resource allocation issues were particularly important and obtained input from consultants with expertise in economic analysis for these issues. Authors paid careful attention to the quality of underlying evidence and the balance between risks and benefits, both reflected in grades of recommendations. For recommendations that are particularly sensitive to underlying values and preferences, the panel made explicit the values underlying the recommendations. Thus, the process of making recommendations for the ACCP guidelines included explicit definition of questions, transparent eligibility criteria for including studies, comprehensive searches and methodologic assessment of studies, and specification of values and preferences and resource implications underlying recommendations where particularly relevant. In combination with our previous practice of grading recommendations according to their strength and the methodologic quality of the supporting studies, these methods establish our guideline methodology as evidence based.

Acute ischemic stroke — early aspirin (160–300 mg) within 48 h: Two large randomized controlled trials (IST and CAST) contributed > 98% of the evidence, and high-quality evidence shows that aspirin results in fewer deaths (nine per 1,000) and more patients with a good functional outcome (seven per 1,000) at 30 days after ischemic stroke; consistent with Table 7, risk with no aspirin is 120 deaths per 1,000 with 9 fewer deaths per 1,000 with aspirin, 350 good outcomes per 1,000 with 7 more good outcomes per 1,000, and 6 bleeding events per 1,000 with 4 more bleeding events per 1,000.

### New antithrombotic drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ba63273f]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

New antithrombotic drugs — scope and clinical context are outlined: the article "focuses on new antithrombotic drugs that are in or are entering phase 3 clinical testing", notes development was driven by limitations of existing agents and covers drugs "focusing primarily on those in phase 2 or 3 clinical testing", with advances mainly in antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants while "the development of new fibrinolytic agents has lagged". Arterial and venous thrombosis are highlighted as major causes of morbidity and mortality; arterial thrombosis causes myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and limb gangrene, and venous thrombosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) that "can be fatal or can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension". Arterial thrombi form under high shear as "platelet aggregates held together by small amounts of fibrin", guiding strategies that "focus mainly on drugs that block platelet function" while also using anticoagulants to prevent cardioembolic events in atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves. Venous thrombi form under low shear and are "composed mainly of fibrin and trapped RBCs and contain relatively few platelets", consistent with anticoagulants being "the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of VTE". Fibrinolytic therapy roles are specified: fibrinolytics are used for rapid restoration of flow in acute MI without primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and for acute ischemic stroke, and "systemic or catheter-directed fibrinolytic therapy is used for treatment of massive PE and for management of selected patients with submassive PE", with catheter-directed therapy used in some patients with extensive iliofemoral DVT.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for valvular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^66ba092a]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) — observational evidence on anticoagulation: The risk of thromboembolic events in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is higher than that in native valve endocarditis, with reports of rates between 50% and 88% of patients. Only one article has reported benefit of antithrombotic therapy in PVE, describing CNS complications in only three of 38 patients with PVE who received adequate anticoagulant therapy compared with 10 of 14 patients who received either inadequate or no anticoagulation. The majority of studies suggest the risk of continuing anticoagulation in this disorder outweighs the potential benefits, and therapeutic anticoagulation not only failed to control emboli in PVE, but the risk of bleeding appeared to be greater among patients with infected prostheses.

Atrial fibrillation with prior ischemic stroke or TIA — antithrombotic selection is specified as follows: In patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA and atrial fibrillation (AF), including paroxysmal AF, "we recommend oral anticoagulation over no antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), aspirin (Grade 1B), or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B)". For agent choice in the same population, "we suggest oral anticoagulation with dabigatran 150 mg bid over adjusted-dose VKA therapy (target INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) (Grade 2B)". For those "who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 1B)".

### Thrombolytic therapy: clinical applications [^4d748b34]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The therapeutic use of thrombolytic agents is the result of the increasing understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying normal and deranged thrombosis and fibrinolysis. Plasminogen activators capable of increasing the production of plasmin exhibit considerable efficacy in the treatment of a variety of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders. The ideal thrombolytic agent has not been developed, but the desired clinical result of rapid opening of the thrombosed vessel without reocclusion, without activation of systemic fibrinogenolysis, and without a risk of hemorrhage are defined. Clinical studies clearly demonstrate that the addition of a variety of adjunctive agents to available thrombolytics enhances benefit without inordinate risk. The addition of intravascular angioplasty and stenting to thrombolysis increases the potential long-term benefit. Newer thrombolytic agents and new protocols for the use of existing therapies offer the promise of saving many who would otherwise succumb to coronary or cerebral arterial thrombosis or to venous thromboembolism.

Thrombolytic procedures — anticoagulation practices are as follows: Concurrent anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is recommended during thrombolytic procedures, although doses may differ depending on the thrombolytic agent and there is no robust scientific evidence to guide dosing. Subtherapeutic doses of heparin are appropriate for all thrombolytic agents except urokinase, in which case therapeutic anticoagulation may be considered.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^99d220f4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is key to the treatment/prevention of thromboembolic events. The primary complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt anticoagulation reversal; this could also be required for nonbleeding patients requiring urgent/emergent invasive procedures. The decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit-risk ratio of supporting hemostasis versus post-reversal thrombosis. We appraise the available guidelines/recommendations for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal in the management of major bleeding, and also assess recent clinical data that may not yet be reflected in official guidance. In general, available guidelines are consistent in their recommendations, advocating administration of vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) rather than fresh frozen plasma to patients with VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage and life-threatening bleeding, and specific reversal agents as essential therapy for DOAC reversal in those same severe conditions. However, guidelines also recommend off-label use of PCCs for DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are unavailable. Limited recent evidence generally support the latter recommendation, but guidelines are likely to evolve as more data become available.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e2f6d6ec]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^2b1f3dff]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Following the first diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke, the patient was stabilised clinically and was promptly initiated on the early key poststroke medical protocol according to national guidelines. The patient had a LKN time of more than 4.5 hours and also had pancytopenia with a low platelet count secondary to the recent chemotherapy treatments. Thrombolytic therapy was not appropriate, and she was admitted to a dedicated stroke unit for medical management. Treatment included blood pressure and glucose control, fluid management and swallowing assessment. Antihypertensives were withheld on day 1 of admission to facilitate permissible hypertension given a mild hypotensive state; they were then resumed to achieve moderate blood pressure control during the rest of the hospital course. She was also initiated antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and statin therapy, as well as inpatient DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin. After the third stroke, full-dose anticoagulation with therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was initiated (enoxaparin 120 mg twice a day subcutaneously). Although guidelines about anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with are unclear, this approach was initiated by consensus between neurology and haematology–oncology in view of the patient's dramatic high-stroke recurrent risk. The possible hypercoagulable state due to the advanced malignancy and the potential for bleeding on anticoagulation were also discussed with the patient.

With regard to the metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, the patient's most recent cycle of palliative chemotherapy was 6 days prior to the onset of the first neurological event, and further oncological regimen was put on hold until acute neurological issues were resolved. In general, the prognosis of patients with unresectable stage IV cholangiocarcinoma is poor, and therapies such as systemic chemotherapy have failed to show any significant increase in survival. Thus, the benefit of palliative measures should always be weighted against the potential side effects of the therapy. Prior to discharge, the goals of cancer care were discussed with the oncology team and the patient. It was recommended a multidisciplinary supportive care to achieve clinical stabilisation and a close follow-up with oncology as outpatient to decide about resuming palliative chemotherapy. Also, it was discussed additional palliative measures such as relief of symptoms, placement of a biliary stent to bypass obstructions and management of cholangitis to address future quality-of-life concerns due to possible progression of the malignancy.

### Periprocedural anticoagulation [^448c738a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of patients taking anticoagulants around the time of a procedure is a common and complex clinical scenario. Providing evidence-based care requires estimation of risk for thrombosis and bleeding, knowledge of commonly used medications, multidisciplinary communication and collaboration, and patient engagement and education. This review provides a standardized, evidence-based approach to periprocedural management of anticoagulation, based on current evidence and expert clinical guidelines.

Considerations for thrombolytic treatment?

The ACF recommends against the use of thrombolytics outside of a clinical trial unless there is a clinical indication for which it is already approved such as ST elevation myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, or massive PE with hemodynamic instability. The CDC also mentions that there is insufficient data to recommend for or against thrombolytic therapy outside the context of a clinical trial. However, the CDC specifically mentions that in pregnant patients in particular, thrombolytic therapy should only be used for acute PE with life-threatening hemodynamic instability due to risk for maternal hemorrhage. The ISTH-IG, ASH, and SCC-ISTH do not mention any recommendations or suggestions regarding the use of thrombolytic treatment.

The ACCP suggests the use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with massive PE (i.e. hypotension with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or when there are signs of obstructive shock) and specifically recommends peripheral thrombolysis using a peripheral vein over catheter-directed thrombolysis. In addition, ACCP suggests that in patients in whom therapeutic anticoagulation fails and who continue to have evidence of cardiopulmonary compromise, thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial. Similarly, the ACC mentions that systemic fibrinolysis is indicated in patients with significant hemodynamically unstable high risk PE and catheter-based therapies be reserved for situations that are not amenable to systemic fibrinolysis. Furthermore, hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-low or intermediate-high risk PE should receive anticoagulation and fibrinolysis or catheter-directed therapies should be considered in cases of further deterioration. They also report that a multidisciplinary PE response team (PERT) may be helpful for intermediate and high risk patients with VTE and that catheter-directed therapies should be limited to most critical situations given minimal data demonstrating a mortality benefit.

### Prevention of embolic strokes: the role of the American College of Chest Physicians [^75a9c9ee]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) face an annual stroke risk of about 5%. Evidence that anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke has evolved over the 20th century. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has played a critical role in presenting guidelines for stroke prevention in AF. This commentary highlights the role that the ACCP guidelines have played, from their inception to the ninth edition. The first ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy in 1986 developed evidence-based guidelines for the indications, dosage, and monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. The conference recommended that anticoagulants be monitored by the international normalized ratio, and the appropriate dosage was to increase the international normalized ratio to two to three times control. This recommendation was widely accepted. Anticoagulants were recommended for AF with mitral valve disease and for nonvalvular AF with a history of embolism. No recommendations were made for nonvalvular AF without a history of embolism. These recommendations stimulated numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). By the third ACCP conference in 1992, RCTs had demonstrated a dramatic 69% stroke reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF. The third ACCP conference was the first to strongly recommend anticoagulation for primary and secondary stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF. ACCP conferences since 1992 have refined recommendations for nonvalvular AF on the basis of associated risk factors. The most recent conference, in 2011, recommended a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, rather than warfarin as the anticoagulant of choice. These ACCP guidelines have played a critical role in changing physicians' practice patterns. In 1980 only 7% of patients with AF in the United States received OA; by 2007, this had increased to 57%.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^95710ca7]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendations" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend administration of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke of > 3 h but < 4.5 h, we suggest clinicians do not use IV tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with acute stroke onset of > 4.5 h, we recommend against the use of IV tPA (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy (Grade 1A). For acute ischemic stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins (Grade 1A). For long-term stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A), including aspirin (recommended dose, 50–100 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or clopidogrel (75 mg qd). In these patients, we recommend use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25/200 mg bid) over aspirin (Grade 1A) and suggest clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B), and recommend avoiding long-term use of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1A). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low-molecular-weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

### Anticoagulants: to bleed or not to bleed, that is the question [^47418d7e]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Thromboembolic vascular diseases remain the main cause of death in Western industrialized societies. Anticoagulants retard the formation, growth, and embolization of thrombi and are effective agents in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. Anticoagulants in venous thromboembolism have been investigated extensively with rigorous randomized, controlled trials, while the roles for anticoagulants in arterial thromboembolism generally have evolved through natural history studies and empirical practice. Thus, many current guidelines for anticoagulant use in arterial disease are based on successful established routines and rational therapy. To effectively balance the efficacy and risks of anticoagulation, the vascular surgeon needs a thorough understanding of anticoagulant drugs, their mechanisms of action, and their proven and unproven indications. Since the first use of heparin in arterial surgery, a variety of new and different anticoagulants have become available, including low-molecular-weight heparins, heparin-like drugs, hirudins, and thrombin inhibitors. Despite their diverse actions, they all inhibit some portion of the plasma coagulation cascade, thus distinguishing them from platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytics. Every interference with the coagulation cascade carries a risk of minor, major, or fatal hemorrhage. To date, no drug or therapeutic strategy has succeeded fully in dissociating its antithrombotic effects from its risks of bleeding.

### Thrombolysis for acute deep vein thrombosis [^f648b583]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment for deep vein thrombosis aims to reduce immediate complications. Use of thrombolysis or clot dissolving drugs could reduce the long-term complications of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (pain, swelling, skin discolouration, or venous ulceration) in the affected leg. This is the second update of a review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulation versus anticoagulation in the management of people with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb as determined by the effects on pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, post-thrombotic complications, venous patency and venous function.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched April 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining thrombolysis and anticoagulation versus anticoagulation for acute DVT were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

In the previous review of 2010, one review author (LW) selected trials, extracted data and assessed study quality, with checking at all stages by the other review author (MPA). If necessary, we sought additional information from trialists. For this update (2013), LW and CB selected trials, extracted data independently, and sought advice from MPA where necessary. All studies, existing and new, required full risk of bias assessment in line with current Cochrane procedures. Two of LW, CB and MA independently assessed risk of bias with discussion with the third author where necessary.

Main Results

Seventeen studies with 1103 participants were included. Complete clot lysis occurred significantly more often in the treatment group in early follow up (risk ratio (RR) 4.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66 to 14.53, P = 0.004) and at intermediate follow up (RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.80, P = 0.0004). A similar effect was seen for any degree of improvement in venous patency. Significantly less PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis, (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79, P < 0.0001). Leg ulceration was reduced although the data were limited by small numbers (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.88, P = 0.29). Those receiving thrombolysis had significantly more bleeding complications (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.52, P = 0.0006). Three strokes occurred in the treatment group, all in trials conducted pre-1990, and none in the control group. There was no significant effect on mortality detected at either early or intermediate follow up. Data on the occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT were inconclusive. Systemic thrombolysis is now not commonly used and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is the more favoured means of administration. This has been studied in iliofemoral DVT, and results from two trials are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.

Authors' Conclusions

Thrombolysis increases the patency of veins and reduces the incidence of PTS following proximal DVT by a third. Strict eligibility criteria are necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding complications and this limits the applicability of this treatment. In those who are treated there is a small increased risk of bleeding. In recent years CDT is the most studied route of administration, and results appear to be similar to systemic administration.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^c4dd8300]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians — systemic thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism: In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension (eg, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) and without a high bleeding risk, systemically administered thrombolytic therapy is recommended over no such therapy (grade 2B). In most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends against systemically administered thrombolytic therapy (grade 1B). In selected patients with acute PE whose condition deteriorates after starting anticoagulant therapy but without hypotension and with a low bleeding risk, systemically administered thrombolytic therapy is suggested over no such therapy (grade 2C).

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^14ffda18]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This article provides recommendations on the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Methods

We generated treatment recommendations (Grade 1) and suggestions (Grade 2) based on high (A), moderate (B), and low (C) quality evidence.

Results

In patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) if treatment can be initiated within 3 h (Grade 1A) or 4.5 h (Grade 2C) of symptom onset; we suggest intraarterial r-tPA in patients ineligible for IV tPA if treatment can be initiated within 6 h (Grade 2C); we suggest against the use of mechanical thrombectomy (Grade 2C) although carefully selected patients may choose this intervention; and we recommend early aspirin therapy at a dose of 160 to 325 mg (Grade 1A). In patients with acute stroke and restricted mobility, we suggest the use of prophylactic-dose heparin or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 2B) and suggest against the use of elastic compression stockings (Grade 2B). In patients with a history of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg once daily), clopidogrel (75 mg once daily), aspirin/extended release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or cilostazol (100 mg bid) over no antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1A), oral anticoagulants (Grade 1B), the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin (Grade 1B), or triflusal (Grade 2B). Of the recommended antiplatelet regimens, we suggest clopidogrel or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole over aspirin (Grade 2B) or cilostazol (Grade 2C). In patients with a history of stroke or TIA and atrial fibrillation we recommend oral anticoagulation over no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin, and combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

These recommendations can help clinicians make evidence-based treatment decisions with their patients who have had strokes.

### Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis for deep-vein thrombosis [^7b6b15ee]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study ATTRACT was published by Vedantham S and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the ATTRACT study, the trial question was: what is the role of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis in reducing the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy? In the ATTRACT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ATTRACT study, the population was: 691 patients (265 female, 426 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy. The key exclusion criteria were < 16 or > 75 years of age, pregnant, symptoms for > 14 days, high risk bleeding, active cancer, established post-thrombotic syndrome, or ipsilateral DVT in the previous 2 years. In the ATTRACT study, the interventions were: n = 336 pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of rtPA and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting plus anticoagulation) n = 355 medical therapy (anticoagulation alone). In the ATTRACT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months (47% vs. 48%; RR 0.96, 96% CI 0.82 to 1.11). In the ATTRACT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome (18% vs. 24%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98). In the ATTRACT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and major bleeding over 24 months. significant differences in major bleeding during the first 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.049; RR 6.18, 95% CI 0.78–49.2) and recurrent VTE within 24 months (12% vs. 8%, p = 0.09). In the ATTRACT study, the conclusion was: in patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy, pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis were not superior to medical therapy with respect to the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months.

### NICE guideline: management of venous thromboembolic diseases and role of thrombophilia testing [^cc5d7fe8]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recently published a clinical guideline on the management of venous thromboembolic disease and thrombophilia testing. Several stand-out recommendations are made which may be practice changing for many physicians, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis for ilio-femoral deep venous thrombosis, routine cancer screening and extended duration of anticoagulation for unprovoked events. In this article, we summarise the key points of the guideline and discuss remaining areas of controversy.

Systemic thrombolysis for acute pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — when right ventricular dysfunction is present without hemodynamic instability, the ASH guideline panel suggests against the addition of systemic thrombolytic therapy to anticoagulant compared with anticoagulation alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence about effects); when life-threatening hemodynamic instability is present, the panel suggests administering systemic thrombolytic therapy in addition to anticoagulant therapy (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in evidence about effects).

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^db1defb0]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit/harm from using thrombolysis. Based on the body of available evidence, it is unlikely that thrombolysis reduces the risk of developing recurrent VTE or PE, whereas it is likely that thrombolysis reduces the risk of PTS but increases the risk of bleeding. There is very low certainty that there is an effect of thrombolysis on other outcomes. However, because there is no published information about other outcomes, the fact that we did not find evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not imply that such an effect does not exist.

The panel identified the following additional research needs:
1 The role of thrombolysis in proximal VTE, submassive PE, and massive PE remains unknown in pediatrics, and further studies to identify the risk/benefit of thrombolysis compared with anticoagulation alone considering all outcomes of interest are required.
2 The role of CDT and the minimal infrastructure, experience, and annual caseload to offer this therapy in pediatric patients compared with systemic thrombolysis need to be determined.
3 The natural history of VTE or large PE in pediatric patients (including subgroup analyses [eg, intracardiac thrombi]) treated with anticoagulation alone needs to be understood to enable the aforementioned 2 research needs to be addressed properly.

For pediatric patients with symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis, should immediate removal of a nonfunctioning or unneeded CVAD vs delayed removal be used?

Recommendation 16

For pediatric patients with symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis who no longer require venous access or whose CVAD is nonfunctioning, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests either immediate removal or delayed removal of the CVAD (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Remarks: Recent observational studies provided data that > 48 hours of anticoagulation before CVAD removal vs immediate CVAD removal are comparable in terms of potential risk of emboli leading to PE or paradoxical stroke. The panel recognized that some clinical scenarios, such as children with a large thrombotic burden or those with right-to-left cardiac shunts, may benefit from a few days of anticoagulation before CVAD removal to decrease the risk of embolism.

### Contemporary management of acute pulmonary embolism: evolution of catheter-based therapy [^af26c9c7]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) affects more than 100000 people in the United States annually and is the third leading cardiovascular cause of death. The standard management for PE is systemic anticoagulation therapy. However, a subset of patients experience hemodynamic decompensation, despite conservative measures. Traditionally, these patients have been treated with systemic administration of thrombolytic agents or open cardiac surgery, although attempts at endovascular treatment have a long history that dates back to the 1960s. The technology for catheter-based therapy for acute PE is rapidly evolving, with multiple devices approved over the past decade. Currently available devices fall into two broad categories of treatment methods: catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous suction thrombectomy. Catheter-directed thrombolysis is the infusion of thrombolytic agents directly into the occluded pulmonary arteries to increase local delivery and decrease the total dose. Suction thrombectomy involves the use of small- or large-bore catheters to mechanically aspirate a clot from the pulmonary arteries without the need for a thrombolytic agent. A thorough understanding of the various risk stratification schemes and the available evidence for each device is critical for optimal treatment of this complex entity. Multiple ongoing studies will improve our understanding of the role of catheter-based therapy for acute PE in the next 5–10 years. A multidisciplinary approach through PE response teams has become the management standard at most institutions. An invited commentary by Bulman and Weinstein is available online. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^2c38fe34]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included having undergone major surgery within the past 3 weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52), weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37), and having at least one of the following characteristics (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting more than 10 min, bilirubin level greater than 3 mg/dL, or dementia.

The systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute intermediate PE did not show a significant impact on all‐cause or in‐hospital mortality compared to AC alone. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that while thrombolytic therapy can be beneficial in high‐risk PE, its advantages in intermediate‐risk PE are less clear. However, our analysis revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy, which corroborates the known bleeding risks associated with thrombolytics. Interestingly, the significant reduction in recurrent PE and clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy suggests that it may offer protective benefits against PE recurrence and subsequent complications. These findings support the notion that systemic thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in preventing the progression and recurrence of PE, particularly in patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration.

### Midterm prognosis of patients with pulmonary embolism receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis or systemic thrombolysis: a nationwide population-based study [^40d8d253]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death worldwide, with 34% of patients dying suddenly or within hours after the symptoms of PE developed. 1, 2 Therefore, timely diagnosis and effective therapies are crucial to saving the lives of patients with acute PE. According to the recent guideline for PE management, published by the European Society of Cardiology, the severity of PE can be stratified into 3 categories: low, intermediate, and high. 3 The initiation of anticoagulant therapy without delay is recommended for most patients in all risk groups, whereas reperfusion treatment is reserved only for patients in shock or exhibiting hemodynamic deterioration on anticoagulation treatment.

For patients with PE receiving reperfusion therapy, current guidelines advocate the systemic administration of thrombolytic drugs as the treatment of choice. 3, 4 Systemic thrombolysis (ST) may promptly restore pulmonary circulation and reduce mortality, but it also carries higher bleeding risks, including a 2% risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which is 4‐ to 5‐fold higher than that for anticoagulation treatment. 5 Moreover, the rates of bleeding complications increase with age, especially for patients aged > 65 years. 5 Hence, ST has a limited role in patients with PE who are thought to be at unusually elevated risk for bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.

Catheter‐directed thrombolysis (CDT) provides an alternative way to deliver thrombolytic agents to patients with PE. Because CDT can achieve a higher local concentration of thrombolytic agents by directly infusing drugs into the pulmonary trunk, it may require a lower dose of thrombolytic agents than ST. This lower‐dose regimen is expected to entail a lower risk of bleeding, which is advocated by guidelines for patients with higher bleeding risk. 3, 4 Despite these expected advantages of CDT, however, there has been a lack of randomized trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of CDT and ST. Observational studies comparing these 2 strategies were also rare, and only provided short‐ and intermediate‐term prognosis. 6, 7, 8, 9 Relatedly, because there is no clear evidence for using CDT instead, the current guidelines still suggest ST as the first‐line therapy for patients with PE requiring reperfusion therapy.

The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of CDT with ST in patients with acute PE both in short‐term and midterm prognosis. We enrolled patients from the largest cohort in Asia using a nationwide database, including nearly 100% of the adult patients with PE in Taiwan. The patients were subjected to propensity score matching, according to their clinical characteristics.

Based on current evidence, we provide recommendations for the standardized management of bleeding risk in VTE patients during both the short‐ and long‐term follow‐up, and propose research priorities to improve our understanding and allow for solid guideline recommendations on this topic.

Anticoagulation timing after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in atrial fibrillation (AF): Recurrent ischemic stroke risk is 0.5% per day to 1.3% per day in the first 14 days, while symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation ranges 6% to 21% with thrombolytics and 1% to 7% with placebo; given increased hemorrhagic risk with larger infarcts and early anticoagulation, it is reasonable to delay initiation of oral anticoagulation for 14 days after stroke onset in that setting, with large infarct definitions including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > 15 or lesions involving complete arterial territory or > 1 arterial territory, and patients with early signs of hemorrhage on neuroimaging should delay initiation to allow healing of the blood–brain barrier.

### New aspects on treatment modalities for thromboembolic episodes [^9d9ec4d3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been treated with a glycosaminoglycan, followed by a vitamin K antagonist during the past 60 years. During the past two decades the glycosaminoglycans have undergone refinement, allowing for simplification of care for these patients, but parenteral administration is still required. Therefore, the current completion of phase III trials with selective, predictable and orally available anticoagulants with rapid onset brings promise for a change in paradigm in the treatment of VTE in the next few years. Whereas these efforts will lead to further simplification of the therapy there are also trials conducted to advance the treatment by rapid resolution of the thromboembolism in order to improve long-term outcome. Catheter-directed thrombolysis, perhaps also with thrombus fragmentation and stent insertion, if demonstrated to be successful for the reduction of the postthrombotic syndrome, will only be an alternative for a minority of patients due to the complexity, risks and cost of therapy. This treatment increases the complexity at the same time as new drug regimens offer simplicity. This review focuses on the novel therapies for VTE although the new anticoagulants will also play a major role in the management of arterial disease, which will be briefly presented.

### Treatment of acute ischemic stroke: beyond thrombolysis and supportive care [^6f66d33c]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The initial therapeutic approach to acute ischemic stroke consists of thrombolytic therapy and early initiation of supportive care, usually commenced prior to the determination of the underlying stroke etiology. Varying stroke mechanisms may call for specific, etiology-based treatment. The majority of strokes result from cardioembolism, large-vessel atherothromboembolism, and small-vessel occlusive disease. There are scant data to support the use of acute anticoagulation therapy over anti-platelet therapy in cardioembolic stroke and large-vessel atherosclerosis, although it may be reasonable in a certain subset of patients. However, augmentation of blood flow with early surgery, stenting, or induced hypertension, may play a role in patients with large artery stenosis. The less commonly identified stroke mechanisms may warrant special consideration in treatment. Controversy remains regarding the optimal anti-thrombotic treatment of arterial dissection. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome may benefit from therapy with calcium channel blockers, high-dose steroids, or magnesium, although spontaneous recovery may occur. Inflammatory vasculopathies, such as isolated angiitis of the central nervous system and temporal arteritis, require prompt diagnosis as the mainstay of therapy is immunosuppression. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare cause of stroke, but one that needs early identification and treatment with anticoagulation. Rapid determination of stroke mechanism is essential for making these critical early treatment decisions.

RAT — thrombolysis plus anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone: For neonates and pediatric patients with RAT requiring antithrombotic treatment, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation alone over thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks state that in most cases, anticoagulation alone is adequate, but there will be individual cases in which the hemodynamic status, size, and mobility of the thrombus might dictate more aggressive therapy, and the choice to use thrombolysis will depend on feasibility or the intervention and patient and family acceptability of the anticipated risks and benefits of thrombolysis.

The Future of Antithrombotic Drug Reversal

The concomitant development of antithrombotic drugs and reversal agents, with clear guidance for their use, should proceed expeditiously. A regulatory pathway of development that promotes innovation and rewards forethought of safety platforms, coupled with carefully constructed clinical trials and registries that capture the benefits (and potential risks) of reversal in common practice scenarios, is needed to determine whether drug-specific (precision) reversal is both necessary and sufficient, particularly with life-threatening events such as intracranial hemorrhage, to affect outcomes among patients with and those at risk for serious bleeding.

### Generic enoxaparin questions and answers… [^8da0282a]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. What is enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is available as an injectable medicine that helps prevent blood clots in the legs and other parts of the body. If these blood clots are not prevented, they can travel to the lungs and cause serious complications and even death. After a patient has surgery, such as hip or knee replacement or in some cases abdominal surgery, enoxaparin is often used for several days to up to a month to prevent blood clots. This medicine is also used to prevent blood clots in patients confined to bed and also for patients experiencing chest pain and heart attacks. Enoxaparin belongs to a class of drugs known as "low molecular weight heparin", which is different than heparin, another drug that helps to prevent blood clots.
2. What is the difference between LMWH and heparin. LMWH and heparin are both used to prevent blood from clotting inside the body, but are used in different situations.
- Heparin, sometimes called "standard heparin, " is available as a liquid solution injected directly into the blood and only given to hospitalized patients, for instance, to prevent blood clots during surgery. Because patients vary widely in their response to heparin sodium, laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant activity is needed to adjust the dose of heparin and monitor its effect in the hospital. In addition, heparin has potential to cause a possibly deadly condition known as Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia, where the body stops producing blood platelets. Thus, in the hospital, doctors can notice HIT right away and take action to reverse the condition. Doctors or other healthcare professionals must inject a patient with heparin. Patients cannot use heparin themselves.
- LMWH, such as enoxaparin, is made from heparin. It is also available as a liquid injectable solution used to prevent blood clots, but it is used differently than heparin.

LMWH produces a more predictable anticoagulant response so frequent monitoring is not needed to adjust the dose. Unlike most traditional drugs that have relatively simple chemical structures that are easily characterized, it is much more challenging to demonstrate that a generic enoxaparin sodium product contains the same active ingredient. Generic enoxaparin sodium must have the same active ingredient as Lovenox.

### Comparison of published guidelines for management of coagulopathy and thrombosis in critically ill patients with COVID 19: implications for clinical practice and future investigations [^029f7a23]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Current societal recommendations: similarities and differences

We review seven major societal recommendations and guidelines addressing the management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis interim guidance (ISTH-IG), American Society of Hematology (ASH), American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), Scientific and Standardization Committee of ISTH (SCC-ISTH), Anticoagulation Forum (ACF), and American College of Cardiology (ACC). These recommendations and guidelines were specifically selected for review because of their focus on anticoagulation in critically ill patients. Moreover, each sponsoring organization has prior expertise in developing evidence-based guidelines and providing health-related recommendations in the arena of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aims of the major societal recommendations and guidelines vary. The ISTH interim guidance is unique in that it provides guidance on the risk stratification for COVID-19 patients on admission and the management of coagulopathy based on laboratory parameters. Alternatively, ACF, ASH, CDC, ACCP, ACC, and SCC-ISTH offer guidance on in-hospital and post-discharge VTE prevention, treatment, and monitoring.

Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 highlights six major societal recommendations and guidelines on the management of CAC focusing on several critical care issues: (1) laboratory testing for risk stratification and triage, (2) use of biomarkers to guide anticoagulation, (3) proposals for alterations of standard prophylactic VTE anticoagulation regimens for the prevention of thrombotic complications, (4) examination of available medications preferred for anticoagulation, (5) considerations for initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation, (6) indications for thrombolytic therapy, (7) decision-making regarding withholding anticoagulation treatment, (8) use of mechanical thromboprophylaxis, (9) monitoring of anticoagulation, (10) duration of therapeutic anticoagulation, (11) necessity of anticoagulation at discharge, and (12) treatment of active bleeding. We specifically focus on the recommendations and guidelines for critical care patients if mentioned in the major societal guidelines and recommendations; otherwise, we include the highest acuity patient population (i.e. hospitalized patients). A comparison of the similarities and differences between the guidelines and recommendations on each of the critical issues is provided.

### Reintroduction of anti-thrombotic therapy after a gastrointestinal haemorrhage: if and when? [^5ac196d6]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common clinical scenario and, in those using antithrombotic agents, the risk is significantly increased. Management of these patients, in terms of initial resuscitation is well established and numerous guidelines exist in this area. However, few studies have addressed the subsequent dilemma of if and when antithrombotic agents should be reintroduced. Consequently, practice is variable and not necessarily evidenced-based. Overall, for patients that are either anticoagulated or using antiplatelet drugs for secondary prophylaxis, there is a clear benefit to restarting these agents. However, there is limited data to guide when this should occur. For individuals at low risk of re-bleeding, current guidelines suggest single agent aspirin can be continued without interruption, assuming haemostatic control has been confirmed endoscopically. For those at higher bleeding risk, aspirin should be withheld, but reintroduced early (within 3 days of index endoscopy). However, randomised evidence is lacking, as are studies including more modern agents or combined anticoagulant/ antiplatelet regimens. As such, guidance statements are limited and management suggestions must be extrapolated from clinical trials, retrospective studies and data relating specifically to warfarin and aspirin. The intention of this review is to summarise what evidence is available and, where this is lacking, suggest pragmatic management options based on a risk-benefit assessment of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding.

### The role and principles of stenting in acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis [^439ac21a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient selection for acute dvt intervention

An intervention should generally not be considered for femoropopliteal DVT; however, based on the available data, it is noted that PTS rates are still high in these patients, suggesting that further work is needed. Among those with an acute iliofemoral DVT (typically < 2–4 weeks), eligibility for a CDI includes patients with a threatened limb (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) or those with severe symptomatology (pain and swelling, difficulty walking). Although the threatened-limb population should not be delayed, the symptomatic ones can be observed for a couple of days on anticoagulation and compression before any decision to intervene, as conservative treatment may sometimes allow complete symptom resolution. It is important to assess the symptoms on exertion.

For those whose symptoms persist, there is a good indication for intervention. The benefits can only be enjoyed by those who are physically active and have a reasonable life expectancy (≥ 5 years) to optimize benefit and justify the costs and risks of intervention. A recent subanalysis of the ATTRACT trial indicated that higher presenting clinical severity predicts greater benefits for a pharmacomechanical catheter intervention (vs anticoagulation alone) on PTS severity and quality of life at 2 years.

The type of CDI, purely thrombolytic, pharmacomechanical, or mechanical thrombectomy, alone can be primarily guided by the bleeding risk assessment and secondarily by physician expertise and institutional logistics (see the "Thrombus removal" section). As a principle, patients at bleeding risk (eg, recent surgery or trauma) should not be offered thrombolytic therapy but rather anticoagulation alone or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy options that can be performed with no lytic exposure.

### The role of endovascular therapy in acute mesenteric ischemia [^d37605b2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Aspiration thrombectomy, combined with angioplasty and/or stenting, is more frequently used as a secondary treatment. Rapid thrombus dissolution can be achieved by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to create a low-pressure runoff in patients with acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis, ascites or coagulation disorder.

Early detection is crucial for a correct endovascular or combined approach.

Emergent laparotomy is imperative with evidences of transmural bowel infarction and peritonitis. In patients with no evidence of bowel infarction or perforation, transcatheter thrombolysis and aspiration thrombectomy may be proposed. Laparoscopic examination may be performed after initiation of thrombolytic therapy. This treatment option decreases the risk of short-bowel syndrome due to extensive bowel resection and unnecessary laparotomy, which is a bad prognostic factor in compromised patients.

On the basis of the heterogeneity of the studies published, the indications for the combination of systemic anticoagulation and loco-regional thrombolysis are not easily deduced; bleeding complications (encephalic, gastrointestinal tract, etc.) were observed more frequently in patients who underwent systemic anticoagulation after previously being treated with endovascular thrombolysis. Literature data and clinical practice show that the indication for systemic anticoagulation usually depends on the causes of the acute event (embolic or not) and in some cases it is not possible to avoid systemic therapy and its risks. In these patients (usually compromised and at high risk for further therapies) endovascular therapy represents a life-saving treatment. Mortality is reported in almost all the articles examined, but the causes of death are not always indicated. Selection bias in the patient populations influences the mortality rate, which varies from center to center. There are no treatment protocols or international guidelines for AMI. Considering the low incidence, as well as the constant evolution of therapeutic techniques, it is hard to conduct a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial.

### Anticoagulant reversal strategies in the emergency department setting: recommendations of a multidisciplinary expert panel [^2c23b9d5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bleeding is the most common complication of anticoagulant use. The evaluation and management of the bleeding patient is a core competency of emergency medicine. As the prevalence of patients receiving anticoagulant agents and variety of anticoagulants with different mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, indications, and corresponding reversal agents increase, physicians and other clinicians working in the emergency department require a current and nuanced understanding of how best to assess, treat, and reverse anticoagulated patients. In this project, we convened an expert panel to create a consensus decision tree and framework for assessment of the bleeding patient receiving an anticoagulant, as well as use of anticoagulant reversal or coagulation factor replacement, and to address controversies and gaps relevant to this topic. To support decision tree interpretation, the panel also reached agreement on key definitions of life-threatening bleeding, bleeding at a critical site, and emergency surgery or urgent invasive procedure. To reach consensus recommendations, we used a structured literature review and a modified Delphi technique by an expert panel of academic and community physicians with training in emergency medicine, cardiology, hematology, internal medicine/thrombology, pharmacology, toxicology, transfusion medicine and hemostasis, neurology, and surgery, and by other key stakeholder groups.

### Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in patients with recent direct oral anticoagulant use: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b1107fdd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review and meta‐analysis is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. The study is registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, ID code: CRD42023400706. No institutional review board approval or informed consent was necessary for conducting this meta‐analysis. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies

Our systematic search included all the randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies, case series (5 or more patients), and case–control studies of patients taking DOAC who received IVT for ischemic stroke. The control group consisted of a similar population not taking DOAC. Studies were included if they contained the intervention of interest or head‐to‐head comparisons and at least 1 of the outcomes of interest described herein. There was no restriction on language or country. We excluded case reports, abstracts, posters, review articles, studies in nonhumans, and studies discussing any of the following: (1) interventions other than IVT with alteplase or tenecteplase (for instance intra‐atrial thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]), (2) patients who were taking other oral anticoagulants such as warfarin before the ischemic stroke, (3) patients who were on any nonoral anticoagulants such as heparin or enoxaparin before the ischemic stroke, (4) coadministration of tPA and other anticoagulants (eg, argatroban), and (5) presence of obvious contraindications for thrombolysis rather than treatment with DOAC.

Participants

Participants were adults (≥ 18 years old) with recent use or nonuse of DOAC, presented with acute ischemic stroke and treated with IVT, with or without specific antidote before IVT, as well as with or without mechanical thrombectomy following IVT.

Interventions

IVT consisted of acute intravenous administration of either alteplase or tenecteplase. The doses of alteplase used were 0.9 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, or 0.7 mg/kg, depending on regional guidelines and practice. Tenecteplase was administered at doses of 0.4 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg. All doses were administered within 4.5 hours from the last known well time.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^dd849ee0]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Post‑alteplase treatment — early antithrombotic therapy: The risk of antithrombotic therapy (other than IV aspirin) within the first 24 hours after treatment with IV alteplase (with or without mechanical thrombectomy) is uncertain, and use might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk. A retrospective analysis found no increased risk of hemorrhage with early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (< 24 hours) after IV alteplase or EVT compared with initiation > 24 hours, but selection bias was possible and timing should be based on an individual level, balancing risk and benefit.

Acute ischemic stroke — intravenous r-tPA time windows and graded use: In patients in whom treatment can be initiated within 3 h of symptom onset, we recommend IV r-tPA over no IV r-tPA (Grade 1A); if treatment can be initiated within 4.5 h but not within 3 h, we suggest IV r-tPA over no IV r-tPA (Grade 2C); and if treatment cannot be initiated within 4.5 h, we recommend against IV r-tPA (Grade 1B). Treatment should be initiated as early as possible because the benefits of r-tPA are greater for shorter onset-to-treatment times.
