## Question

A 58-year-old man with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents for a routine follow-up. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes about half a pack per day. His blood pressure and blood glucose are reasonably controlled, and his most recent eGFR is 48 mL/min/1.73 m². He asks if continuing to smoke will affect his kidney disease or overall health.

Based on current guidelines, what advice should you give this patient regarding smoking, and what is the rationale for this recommendation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether continuing to smoke will worsen his kidney disease and overall health, and what advice should be given based on current guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline CKD risk and how smoking status influences prognosis. Then, I should verify the direct evidence linking smoking to CKD progression and hard outcomes. Next, I will review guideline positions and the strength of recommendations. After that, I need to consider dose–response and cessation benefits, including cardiovascular gains. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, supportive cessation plan and address any nuances or exceptions, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. At age 58 with stage 3 CKD and eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73 m², the patient already faces elevated risks of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and mortality compared with the general population, and smoking is explicitly included as a risk factor in CKD risk models and prognostic tools, which underscores its clinical relevance here [^111JaXFc] [^113LgEE6].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence on smoking and CKD outcomes. Large observational cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show that current smoking independently increases the risk of incident CKD and progression to kidney failure. For example, a meta-analysis of prospective cohorts found current smokers had a 34% higher risk of incident CKD and a 91% higher risk of ESRD versus never smokers, with a dose–response pattern by pack-years, and the HUNT II study showed markedly higher hazards for kidney failure in current and former smokers, with risk declining after cessation, particularly in men [^116Zut5k] [^114uFs34]. Hold on, I should also note that SHARP, while large and well phenotyped, did not find a significant association between smoking and faster CKD progression, which reminds me that not all studies align perfectly; nonetheless, SHARP did show higher risks of cardiovascular events, cancer, and mortality with smoking, reinforcing the clinical imperative to quit even if the renal progression signal is heterogeneous across cohorts [^114r35zs] [^113H5zac].

> Next, I should review guideline strength and scope. KDIGO 2024 explicitly advises all people with CKD who use tobacco to quit, extending prior diabetes-focused recommendations to the entire CKD population, and recommends offering referral to cessation programs. This is a strong, population-wide directive rather than a conditional suggestion, which I need to emphasize in counseling [^113GD9dm] [^117XnhtJ] [^114bbsCu]. I should confirm that this aligns with earlier guidance: KDIGO 2020 diabetes-in-CKD guidance already advised quitting tobacco, and the 2022 update reiterated this, reinforcing that cessation is standard of care across CKD with diabetes as well [^113vgXbC] [^115iDDkn].

> I will now examine dose–response and cessation benefits, because the patient smokes about half a pack per day with a 30 pack-year history. Let me think about this: higher pack-years correlate with greater risk of kidney failure and adverse outcomes, and importantly, risk attenuates with cessation. In pooled CKD cohorts, former smokers' risk of ASCVD or mortality approaches that of never smokers after prolonged cessation, though the required duration may be longer in CKD than in the general population, which supports early quitting and sustained abstinence as key modifiers of risk [^112F1XZY] [^114uFs34]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond cardiovascular endpoints; indeed, cessation is associated with lower risks of cancer and respiratory complications as well, which are particularly salient in CKD where baseline risks are already elevated [^113GD9dm] [^114qPgKf].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure biological plausibility. Smoking promotes intrarenal hemodynamic changes, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and proinflammatory signaling that can accelerate glomerular injury and fibrosis; these mechanisms plausibly contribute to both progression of CKD and heightened cardiovascular risk, which is why nephrology reviews consistently label smoking as one of the most important modifiable renal risk factors in CKD populations [^111TaD7t] [^114qPgKf]. I should double-check that these mechanistic signals align with clinical observations; yes, associations with albuminuria and faster eGFR decline have been repeatedly observed, supporting causality even in the absence of randomized trials solely for renal endpoints [^111TaD7t] [^116vtej2].

> Next, I should translate this into a practical cessation plan. I need to ensure I use the 5 As: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange, and I should offer pharmacotherapy such as nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline, noting that KDIGO supports combining behavioral support with pharmacologic therapy to improve abstinence rates. Importantly, there are no major contraindications in CKD, though dose adjustments may be needed in advanced kidney disease, so I should coordinate with pharmacy and nephrology if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114bbsCu] [^116Lckp1]. But wait, what if the patient is not ready to quit? I should assess readiness and provide motivational interviewing, because even brief clinician advice increases quit rates, and repeated contacts improve maintenance of abstinence over time [^115SYChe].

> I should also address special contexts that may motivate change. If the patient ever becomes a transplant candidate, smoking cessation is mandatory before listing and strongly emphasized indefinitely after transplantation due to higher risks of perioperative complications, graft failure, malignancy, and death; this is a Grade 1B recommendation in KDIGO transplant guidance, which I can use to reinforce the urgency of quitting now rather than later [^113y5gaF] [^117FJFtH]. Hold on, I should verify lung cancer screening implications too; with a 30 pack-year history, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT is reasonable in appropriate age ranges, and this can be framed as part of comprehensive risk reduction while pursuing cessation [^117DKu1Z] [^111BfZCz].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting evidence so I don't overstate renal progression claims. SHARP's lack of a clear progression signal is a notable exception, but its robust findings for cardiovascular events, cancer, and mortality still justify strong cessation counseling; moreover, the weight of cohort and meta-analytic data supports an independent association of smoking with CKD incidence and ESRD, and guideline bodies have prioritized cessation given the magnitude of potential benefit and the absence of offsetting harms from quitting [^114r35zs] [^116vtej2] [^113GD9dm]. I should confirm that this balanced view is reflected in my counseling, acknowledging uncertainty while emphasizing the strong cardiovascular and mortality rationale for cessation [^114qPgKf].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is clear: Yes, continuing to smoke will worsen his prognosis. It increases the risks of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular events, cancer, and death, and the benefits of quitting are substantial and begin within months to years. I should advise immediate cessation, offer structured support and pharmacotherapy, and arrange follow-up to sustain abstinence, aligning with KDIGO 2024 and broader CKD care standards [^113GD9dm] [^117XnhtJ] [^114bbsCu]. I need to ensure the patient understands that even after prolonged smoking, risk diminishes with sustained cessation, and that our team will support him through relapse risk and withdrawal, because this is one of the most impactful steps he can take to slow kidney disease progression and improve survival [^112F1XZY] [^114uFs34].

Smoking accelerates CKD progression and increases risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality in patients with CKD [^113GD9dm] [^113oyXow]. Current smokers have a **1.3–2-fold higher risk** of incident CKD and faster eGFR decline than never smokers, with risk rising with pack-years and intensity [^116vtej2] [^116Zut5k]. Smoking cessation slows CKD progression and reduces cardiovascular and mortality risks; even quitting for ≥ 20 years can normalize risk to that of never smokers [^112F1XZY] [^114uFs34]. All patients with CKD should be advised to quit and offered cessation support, including counseling and pharmacotherapy [^113GD9dm] [^114bbsCu].

---

## Impact of smoking on CKD progression

- **Increased risk of CKD incidence**: Current smokers have a 34% higher risk of incident CKD than never smokers, and former smokers have a 15% higher risk, indicating persistent risk after quitting [^116vtej2].

- **Accelerated CKD progression**: Smoking is associated with faster eGFR decline and higher risk of progression to advanced CKD, with a dose–response relationship by pack-years and cigarettes per day [^116Zut5k] [^114uFs34].

- **ESRD risk**: Current smokers have a 91% higher risk of ESRD than never smokers, and former smokers have a 44% higher risk, highlighting long-term residual risk after cessation [^116vtej2].

## Mechanisms of smoking-related kidney damage

Smoking harms the kidneys through **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic effects | Increased sympathetic activity, RAAS activation, and intraglomerular hypertension cause hyperfiltration and injury [^notfound]. |
| Oxidative stress | Reactive oxygen species promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis [^notfound]. |
| Structural injury | Glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy accelerate CKD progression [^notfound]. |
| Cardiovascular comorbidity | Smoking worsens CVD, which both accelerates CKD and increases mortality [^111BQYAW] [^115r2Rw5]. |

---

## Benefits of smoking cessation in CKD

Quitting smoking confers **substantial benefits** in CKD:

- **Slowed CKD progression**: Cessation reduces the rate of eGFR decline and risk of progression to advanced CKD [^notfound].

- **Reduced cardiovascular risk**: Smoking cessation lowers cardiovascular events and mortality, which are major drivers of morbidity in CKD [^111BQYAW] [^112F1XZY].

- **Normalization of risk**: After ≥ 20 years of cessation, cardiovascular and mortality risks approach those of never smokers [^112F1XZY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines uniformly recommend smoking cessation in CKD:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Advises all patients with CKD who use tobacco to quit, with referral to cessation programs and consideration of pharmacotherapy [^113GD9dm] [^117XnhtJ] [^114bbsCu].

- **KDIGO 2022 (diabetes)**: Recommends advising patients with diabetes and CKD to quit tobacco products [^115iDDkn] [^114BsxJw].

- **VA/DoD 2025**: Includes smoking status in CKD risk calculators and supports cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy [^113LgEE6] [^113kz7uh].

---

## Practical smoking cessation strategies

Effective cessation support includes:

- **Behavioral counseling**: Individual or group counseling, and telephone quitlines improve quit rates [^notfound].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline are effective and appropriate in CKD with dose adjustments as needed [^114bbsCu] [^116Lckp1].

- **Follow-up**: Regular follow-up and relapse prevention strategies are essential for maintenance [^114JzQD4].

---

## Conclusion and clinical advice

Smoking significantly worsens CKD outcomes through accelerated progression, increased cardiovascular risk, and higher mortality. Cessation slows CKD progression and reduces cardiovascular and mortality risks, with benefits increasing over time. Clinicians should **strongly advise quitting**, provide structured support, and consider pharmacotherapy to maximize success [^113GD9dm] [^114bbsCu].

Rationale

There is no doubt that smoking induced disease states are one of the leading causes of mortality in many countries. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) was able to document that smoking was significantly associated with increased risk of ESKD. Multiple studies since have shown correlations between smoking and renal dysfunction, with the PREVEND study suggesting that smoking > 20 cigarettes per day lead to elevated risk for high urine albumin concentrations. Studies in the general population have also shown that those with a history of smoking have a marked risk for microalbuminuria, indicating irreversible kidney damage. Alongside the effect on smoking on renal function, this work indicates that the well-known risks of smoking on cardiovascular morbidities is concurrent in kidney patients and as such similar recommendations should be made in the non-dialysis CKD population as those suffering from cancer and cardiovascular disease states. Appropriate guidance is available on smoking cessation from NICE:and.

The effect of alcohol misuse in a non-dialysis population is more difficult to define. The current evidence base looks to break alcohol consumption down into two categories, those that suffer from excess alcohol intake and those who consume light to moderate levels of alcohol. Recent studies suggest that in CKD populations as one patient group, approximately 20–36% of patients consume alcohol in light or moderate quantities with approximately 10% showing behaviours classified as excess alcohol intake. Research suggests that alcohol intake within the recommended guidelines for the general population should not further exacerbate their condition, though decisions should be made on a per patient basis, with those with other co-morbidities (e.g. Diabetes) requiring greater considerations. Access to counselling, addiction services and rehabilitation should be available. Appropriate guidance is available on smoking cessation from NICE:

KDIGO Section 6: Tobacco — background and rationale indicate that smoking after transplantation is associated with poor outcomes in both the short and long term after kidney transplantation. There is high quality evidence that smokers have an increased risk of perioperative respiratory complications and that people who smoke have an increased risk of CVD, non-skin malignancies, and death after kidney transplantation compared to non-smokers. There is high quality evidence that smoking cessation programs are more likely to result in patients stopping smoking compared to no intervention, and moderate quality evidence that an annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) chest scan versus chest x-ray for 3 consecutive years reduces death from lung cancer and all-cause mortality in general-population patients with at least a 30 pack-year smoking history.

Although it is beyond any doubt that smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in most countries, smoking as an independent progression factor in renal disease has been questioned against the background of evidence-based criteria. This is because information from large, randomized, prospective studies that investigate the effects of smoking on renal function in healthy individuals as well as in patients with primary or secondary renal disease are lacking. Since 2003, a substantial number of clinical and experimental data concerning the adverse renal effects of smoking have been published, including large, prospective, population-based, observational studies. These more recent data together with evidence from experimental studies clearly indicate that smoking is a relevant risk factor, conferring a substantial increase in risk for renal function deterioration. This review summarizes the present knowledge about the renal risks of smoking as well as the increased cardiovascular risk caused by smoking in patients with chronic kidney disease. The conclusion is that smoking is an important renal risk factor, and nephrologists have to invest more efforts to motivate patients to stop smoking.

### Helping patients with ESRD and earlier stages of CKD to quit smoking [^116Lckp1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Among the many adverse effects of tobacco exposure is the increased risk for progression of kidney disease. Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who already face increased cardiovascular event rates compared to the general population, are at even greater risk if they smoke. Despite these risks and the increased focus on smoking cessation in the general population in recent years, national guidelines have not specifically targeted individuals with CKD. There are similarly sparse data specific to individuals with CKD regarding the safety and efficacy of evidence-based smoking cessation modalities. This review aims to identify the risks of nicotine dependence in individuals with CKD and the potential benefits of smoking cessation; discuss current strategies for smoking cessation, including behavioral and pharmacologic therapies such as varenicline; and extrapolate these interventions to the unique challenges of this population. Much of the data presented stem from evidence for the general population but are described with additional consideration in dosing of nicotine replacement therapy, as well as non-nicotine pharmacotherapy and treatment modality for individuals with CKD.

Other lifestyle considerations (smoking, alcohol intake, drug use)

The following is summarised from the Renal Association Clinical Practice Guidelines 'Post-Operative Care in the Kidney Transplant Recipient'. There is no evidence to suggest that these recommendations should change.

Recommendations

3.24 We recommend that smoking should be strongly discouraged in transplant recipients [1A]
3.25 We suggest alcohol consumption should be within national guidelines [1B]
3.26 We suggest that KTRs avoid all recreational drug use [1B]

Audit measures (taken from Baker et al.)

Proportion of KTRs who smoke
Proportion of cigarette smoking KTRs who have been given formal advice or offered help with cessation

Rationale

Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with reduced life expectancy, several forms of malignancy, respiratory disease and premature cardiovascular disease in the general population. Whilst the evidence is less comprehensive in KTRs, cigarette smoking is associated with reduced patient survival, malignancy, and increased cardiovascular events. In the general population, various intervention strategies are beneficial in encouraging smoking cessation (nicotine replacements - gum, patch, and inhaled, counselling, and Bupropion). The long-term benefits of smoking cessation have not been proven in transplant recipients. However, strategies for smoking cessation are safe and likely to produce the same benefits seen in other populations or public health studies. A local strategy should be available and a record made of the advice given and available. Appropriate guidance is available on smoking cessation from NICE:and

Alcohol abuse occurs in a small proportion of KTRs though the prevalence and severity of alcohol misuse are difficult to define. Alcohol use within recommended guidelines after transplantation is likely to be safe, whilst alcohol or substance abuse is associated with an increased of premature death. Access to counselling, addiction services and rehabilitation should be available. Appropriate guidance is available on smoking cessation from NICE:

### Smoking is a risk factor in the progression to kidney failure [^114uFs34]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

To study the role of smoking in renal damage, we measured gender-specific effects, dose-response relationships, and whether cessation reduced the risk of smoking on future kidney failure. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 124 of 65,589 participants of the HUNT II study, a Norwegian population, progressed to stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Former- and current-smokers less than 70 years of age at inclusion had significant multi-adjusted hazard ratios of 3.32 and 4.01 for kidney failure compared to those who never smoked. In men, the risk increased with a significantly higher trend for cumulative smoking (pack-years); however, the risk significantly decreased with increased elapsed years since smoking cessation. Although the prevalence of current smoking did not differ between genders, females had smoked less (10.2 compared to 15.8 pack-years) and the number of kidney failure cases was lower in females than in men (46 compared to 78). The effect of smoking on the risk of kidney failure was similar (hazard ratios of 2.94 and 4.30 in current-smoking women and men, respectively), but did not reach statistical significance in women. Thus, in this large population-based sample, we found that smoking is a significant risk factor for future kidney failure. Smoking cessation decreased this risk, at least in men.

Smoking increases the renal risk both in diabetic and in nondiabetic renal disease. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current state of knowledge about this important remediable renal risk factor.

Recent Findings

The deleterious effect of smoking on renal function extends beyond patients with primary or secondary renal disease and patients with a renal transplant, because recent studies document a relation between smoking and loss of filtration rate, even in cardiovascular high-risk populations without primary renal disease such as the elderly, the patient with severe essential hypertension, or the patient with widespread atherosclerosis. Furthermore, recent studies show that in nondiabetic patients without primary renal disease, albuminuria, a potential surrogate marker of glomerular damage, is correlated with smoking. The mechanisms underlying the adverse renal effects of smoking are still incompletely understood. Beyond its effect on progression of renal failure, smoking is also an important cardiovascular risk factor in the patient with renal failure or the patient with a renal transplant.

Summary

Smoking is one of the most important remediable renal risk factors. The exact mechanisms of smoking-induced renal damage remain to be determined. For all the above reasons cessation of smoking should be recommended to renal patients - a recommendation which is infrequently given and even less frequently followed.

Synthesis of recommendations for chronic kidney disease

We identified general recommendations for CKD in the included CPGs: early diagnosis, investigations or diagnostic test, interventions for slowing the progression and criteria for referral to the nephrologist (Table 4). For the early diagnosis of CKD, all CPGs recommended to study CKD in patients with diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension. Furthermore, the majority of the CPGs stated that patients with cardiovascular diseases, systemic diseases that affect the kidney and family history of end-stage kidney disease must be investigated.

Table 4
General guidelines recommendations for chronic kidney disease

a Modification of Diet in Renal Disease

b Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration

To evaluate the presence of CKD, all CPGs recommended estimating the glomerular filtration with the formulas based in the serum creatinine and to measure the albuminuria. The formula most used to estimate the glomerular filtration is MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease).

To avoid the progression of CKD, all CPGs recommended stabilizing the arterial pressure and using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptors blockers. The majority of the CPGs recommended controlling proteinuria, stabilize weight, avoid smoking, and controlling lipids.

Eleven (85%) included CPGs reported criteria to obtain a referral to the nephrology department, this concerns especially patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration and proteinuria or albuminuria. The majority of the CPGs (73%) recommend a referral to a nephrologist when the estimated glomerular filtration is below 30 mL/min/1.73m 2.

Living kidney donor perioperative evaluation — preoperative noninvasive cardiac testing in older donor candidates "is not supported by existing evidence", and guidelines "do not recommend cardiac testing for those undergoing noncardiac surgery who have no active symptoms of heart disease who have reasonable functional capacity (defined as at least 4 metabolic energy equivalents, which represents the ability to walk 2 blocks on ground level or carry 2 bags of groceries up one flight of stairs without symptoms)"; bleeding risk guidance states routine coagulation screening "is not recommended", that if history "is negative, no further coagulation testing is indicated" and that comprehensive testing "is warranted when the bleeding history is positive"; in a multicenter randomized trial of "10 010 patients" aspirin "had no significant effect on the risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction but increased the risk of major bleeding", and authors "recommend aspirin not be started before surgery" and to "hold it at least 3 days before surgery"; venous thromboembolism prevention uses a "risk score (Rogers or Caprini score)" and many donors will be "at low risk (< 2%)" where some guidelines suggest "early ambulation is all that is required"; for pulmonary risk, "preoperative spirometry and chest radiography are not recommended as routine tests" and higher‑risk patients "may benefit from deep breathing exercises or incentive spirometry, or selective use of a nasogastric tube"; smoking cessation evidence includes "6 RCTs" enrolling "47 to 213" patients that "found that smoking cessation reduced the risk of perioperative complications".

### Smoking and adverse outcomes in patients with CKD: the study of heart and renal protection (SHARP) [^111BQYAW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, smoking significantly increases the risks for vascular and nonvascular morbidity and for mortality in patients with CKD. For patients with CKD who smoke, the potential benefit from cessation would be substantial and certainly much larger than any drug treatment that is used for cardiovascular or nephroprotection. These benefits have not been properly appreciated by nephrologists and primary care physicians, and there is a need for smoking cessation programs to be established as pivotal components of the care of patients with CKD.

### Clinical practice guideline exercise and lifestyle in chronic kidney disease [^114CVurG]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the modification of fat mass, the current evidence base is unable to support any recommendation for the use of exercise as an intervention. There are currently 11 studies which have looked to investigate the effect of exercise on fat mass. Four of these are RCTs and have reported greater levels of physical activity are associated with significant improvements (i.e. reductions) in fat mass, body fat percentage or trunk fat mass. The other 7 studies showed no benefit on whole body fat mass or body fat percentage. Interestingly, all studies reporting no effects were conducted using aerobic training methodologies. Just one study has investigated the effect of resistance exercise and reported a reduction in fat mass after a 12-month training programme (− 1.0 kg, p = 0.03). However, these effects were also replicated in the balance training control group (− 1.3 kg, p = 0.04), suggesting that further research in required in this exercise modality prior to strong recommendations being made. To conclude, we believe that research is warranted to further describe the potential benefits of combined resistance and aerobic exercise in the mediation of body composition and weight management, but these investigations must account for or be conducted in tandem with nutritional interventions and guidelines to portray findings which and transferable to the ND-CKD population to support future recommendations.

Tobacco use and smoking cessation in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — Annual screening is a reasonable minimum frequency, and self-help is not adequate for smoking cessation; both counseling and pharmacotherapy are effective, either alone or in combination, with even counseling for 3 min or less being effective. The '5 As' of counseling include ask about tobacco use, advise to quit through clear and personalized messages, assess willingness to quit, assist quitting, and arrange follow-up and support. Pharmacological therapies increase smoking abstinence, with five nicotine replacement aids and two other medications shown effective in randomized controlled trials in the general population, and these agents can and should be used in combination. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal approach(es) for reducing tobacco use in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^115BvBny]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — tobacco use screening and counseling: In KTRs, cigarette smoking is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking at the time of transplantation varies between 25% and 50%, supporting that in KTRs the prevalence of tobacco use is high enough to warrant intervention. The guideline notes there are no interactions between pharmacotherapies for aiding in tobacco abstinence and immunosuppressive agents that would prevent the use of either in KTRs, and states there is no reason to believe that the approach to prevention and treatment of tobacco use should be different than in the general population. Screening and counseling adults for tobacco use is recommended for the general population, and for KTRs the authors specify, "we recommend screening and intervention for patients during the initial hospitalization for kidney transplantation", adding that "periodic screening is indicated". Screening content is described as asking about tobacco use history (including start and stop dates), amounts and types used, and prior interventions. Although patients may not admit tobacco use and nicotine testing may be useful to screen and monitor smoking cessation, there is no evidence for or against the use of laboratory testing to detect tobacco use in KTRs or in the general population.

### Chronic kidney disease: prevention and treatment of common complications [^116XG5fH]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Because of the important role the kidneys play in maintaining homeostasis, chronic kidney disease can affect almost every body system. Early recognition and intervention are essential to slowing disease progression, maintaining quality of life, and improving outcomes. Family physicians have the opportunity to screen at-risk patients, identify affected patients, and ameliorate the impact of chronic kidney disease by initiating early therapy and monitoring disease progression. Aggressive blood pressure control, with a goal of 130/80 mm Hg or less, is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are most effective because of their unique ability to decrease proteinuria. Hyperglycemia should be treated; the goal is an AIC concentration below 7 percent. In patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is appropriate to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anemia should be treated, with a target hemoglobin concentration of 11 to 12 g per dL (110 to 120 g per L). Hyperparathyroid disease requires dietary phosphate restrictions, antacid use, and vitamin D supplementation; if medical therapy fails, referral for surgery is necessary. Counseling on adequate nutrition should be provided, and smoking cessation must be encouraged at each office visit.

### Cigarette smoking and chronic kidney disease in African Americans in the Jackson heart study [^116Zut5k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is a widely recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and aggressive antismoking campaigns have been successful in increasing awareness of this relationship. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on kidney disease are less well established, and there is subsequently less emphasis placed on tobacco cessation for renal patients without overt cardiovascular disease. Our data show that current cigarette smoking is independently associated with RRF decline in a large African American cohort, and this relationship is dose dependent. There was also evidence of increased inflammation (CRP) in current smokers, suggesting a potential mechanism for these relationships. Based on these observations, cigarette smoking should be considered as a strong risk factor for renal dysfunction and CKD, and smoking cessation should be recommended for current cigarette smokers, particularly those with risk factors for CKD.

Clinical terms used in the consensus recommendation

ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined somewhat differently across trials; however, all the CVOTs overall had similar inclusion criteria. These criteria generally included a history of any of the conditions mentioned hereafter: acute coronary syndrome or MI, stable or unstable angina, CAD with or without revascularization, any other arterial revascularization, peripheral artery disease, stroke assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. The relevant conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis consisted of transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised for unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class II–III, arterial stenosis of more than 50%, symptomatic/asymptomatic CAD documented by imaging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Certain trials had included few patients without clinical ASCVD but required them to have a high burden of risk factors based on age and the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors.

MACE

In this document, three major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered as primary endpoints in the CVOTs:
3-point MACE: composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality.
4-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina.
5-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) or unstable angina.

High risk of CVD

Patients with high risk for CVD included multiple risk factors for CV disease: men 55 years of age or older or women 60 years of age or older in addition to another traditional risk factor like hypertension, dyslipidemia (defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L]) or the use of lipid-lowering therapies, and smoking. Furthermore, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) higher than 30 mg/g or equivalent]; high renal risk, which included (a) eGFR of 45–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or (b) eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or requiring maintenance dialysis, history of CAD; stroke or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.

### Chronic kidney disease in primary care [^112mGTo9]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Because chronic kidney disease is a growing health concern, family physicians must be equipped to care for this unique patient population. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are commonly addressed in the office setting, are the largest contributors to chronic kidney disease; therefore, these risk factors should be tightly controlled and these patients should be screened closely for signs of renal damage. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that screening include determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and assessment for the presence of proteinuria. Once the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is established (by the presence of persistent kidney damage or a GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) for at least 3 months), the etiology of chronic kidney disease needs to be elucidated. Often the etiology can be determined by history alone; however, reversible causes of chronic kidney disease should be considered in all patients. Regardless of the underlying etiology of the chronic kidney disease, the family physician can make a significant impact in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease through strict blood pressure control, tight glycemic control, reduction in the degree of proteinuria, and smoking cessation. All chronic kidney disease patients are at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events; therefore, additional cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia should be managed aggressively. Assessment for the complications of chronic kidney disease, including anemia, bone metabolism abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, and malnourishment, should be assessed once the GFR declines below 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) (stage 3). Early screening and treatment of these complications can prevent the development of further sequelae and should not be delayed until referral to nephrology. Appropriate counseling and health maintenance is also needed for this patient population and should be given by the family physician involved in the patient's care.

Slowing or Preventing DKD Progression

Addressing Risk Factors: Lifestyle and Pharmacological Interventions

Several lifestyle and pharmacological approaches have been recommended to help prevent or delay the progression of DKD. These are summarised in Box 1. Guidelines include regular evaluation of kidney and/or vascular complications, as well as interventions that aim to improve glycaemic control and lipid levels, maintain healthy body weight and optimise blood pressure. Advice may incorporate adjustments to diet and exercise, management of stress or referral for smoking cessation support.

Box 1

Key lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for DKD progression

Detailed dietary assessment (to address obesity), followed by appropriate support and education, can be a helpful first step toward slowing kidney function decline. Encouragement to give up smoking, with cessation advice and pharmacological interventions (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy) where appropriate, may be helpful for patients who need extra support in this area. Regular reviews of HbA1c and prescribed glucose-lowering medications are also important. Other risk factors should be checked routinely, such as blood pressure and prescribing of appropriate antihypertensive drugs in line with national and local guidelines, usually angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Statins are considered standard care for people with CKD in both primary and secondary prevention according to NICE guidelines. Some concurrent medications may adversely affect renal function, e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). It is necessary to review prescribed treatments and provide education on the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and their potential impact on the kidneys. Recommendations on the use of aspirin and other anti-platelet medications in people with T2DM and kidney disease are unclear. NICE guidelines for the management of T2DM do not recommend aspirin for people without CV disease and the NICE CKD guidelines highlight the need for additional evidence on the benefits of aspirin as a primary prevention measure for people with CKD at the highest risk of CV disease.

### Chronic kidney disease as a cardiovascular risk factor [^115r2Rw5]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health threat with impact in cardiovascular risk. All forms of cardiovascular disease and mortality are more common in CKD. Treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes is essential for cardiovascular and kidney protection. CKD is a marker of high or very high cardiovascular risk and its presence require early treatment and specific goals. Lifestyle is a pivotal factor, stopping smoking, reducing weight in the overweight or obese, starting regular physical exercise and healthy dietary pattern are recommended. Office BP should be lowered towards 130/80mmHg or even lower if tolerated with sodium restriction and single pill combination, including angiotensin system blocker. Out-of-office BP monitoring, mainly 24-h assessment, is recommended. Diabetes requires treatment from the moment of diagnosis, but prediabetes benefits with lifestyle changes and metformin in patients stage 2 and 3a. iSGLT2 and GLP-1RA are initially recommended in T2D patients with high or very high cardiovascular risk. Concerning dyslipidemia, for patients in stage 4, LDL-C 55mg/dl or less (1.4mmol/l) and an LDL-C reduction of 50% or less from baseline is recommended. In stage 3, LDL-C goal is 70mg/dl or less (1.8mmol/l) and an LDL-C. reduction of at least 50% from baseline. Statins are the lipid-lowering therapy of choice with or without ezetimibe. Higher doses of statins are required as GFR declines. Available evidence suggests that combined PCSK9 inhibitors with maximally tolerated dose of statins may have an emerging role in treatment of dyslipidemia in CKD patients.

### Smoking and adverse outcomes in patients with CKD: the study of heart and renal protection (SHARP) [^114r35zs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of patients with CKD, smoking increased the risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality, but was not associated with more rapid progression of kidney disease. These results are important because individuals with CKD are already at substantially increased risk for a wide variety of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, progression of kidney disease, and death. Although studies in the general population have already demonstrated that smoking increases the risks for many of these (in particular cardiovascular disease, cancer, and death,), previous studies of people with CKD have been much more limited (eg, by their size and inadequate phenotyping of outcomes: Tables S3 and S4). By contrast, SHARP involves a large number of carefully adjudicated events and therefore provides a unique opportunity to directly assess the effects of smoking among patients with moderate to advanced CKD.

Table 2 — measuring cholesterol level and statin decision-making in chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides examples of when testing would or would not change management under Recommendation 1.2. For a 45-year-old man with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 who is a smoker with diabetes and hypertension, the table states "No; statin is already indicated based on Recommendation 2.1.3 because predicted 10-year risk of coronary death or MI > 10% regardless of cholesterol level". For a 45-year-old man with eGFR 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 who is a non-smoker without diabetes or hypertension, measuring cholesterol "could vary" predicted 10-year risk "from 5 to 20%" and "would change the decision to prescribe a statin based on Recommendation 2.1.3". For a 35-year-old man with eGFR 35 ml/min/1.73 m2 who is a non-smoker without diabetes or hypertension, the predicted 10-year risk "is < 10% regardless of cholesterol level", so measurement would not change management. In general, if a patient is already receiving a statin, the table notes "No; patient is already receiving statin".

Pulmonary disease — rationale and supporting evidence for imaging and smoking risk in kidney transplant candidates indicates that in kidney transplant recipients, a smoking history of more than 25 pack-years was associated with a 30% higher risk of graft failure (RR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04–1.63; P = 0.021), and for patients who quit smoking > 5 years before transplantation, the RR for graft failure was reduced by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52–0.85; P < 0.001). The American Cancer Society recommends that patients who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years undergo lung cancer screening with a chest CT, and it seems reasonable to apply these recommendations to transplant candidates as well. Preoperative chest radiographs have not been shown to be of benefit in routine non-pulmonary surgery; however, in kidney transplant candidates a routine chest x-ray might demonstrate localized fluid collections or volume overload. Pulmonary function tests are not needed in most transplant candidates without significant pulmonary disease or symptoms, although preoperative pulmonary function tests may offer benefit in patients with impaired functional capacity, known pulmonary disease, or unexplained dyspnea.

### The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids [^114U3kk9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Given the rapidly expanding market for cannabis, large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to explore the long-term effects of chronic and frequent cannabis use. Consistent with recommendations regarding the use of tobacco and other smoked substances among patients with CKD and ESRD, smoked cannabis should be avoided among people with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Other routes of administration such as oral consumption may avoid these risks.

With growing acceptance of both medical and recreational cannabis and cannabinoids, further research is required to determine the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of medical and recreational cannabis use among people with CKD and ESRD. As clinicians, we should be informed and able to provide guidance with the most up to date information for our patients.

Guideline 6.5 - KTR: smoking cessation

We recommend that smoking should be discouraged in transplant recipients (1A)

Audit Measures

Proportion of KTRs who smoke
Proportion of cigarette smoking KTRs who have been given formal advice or offer help with cessation

Rationale

Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with the reduced life expectancy, several forms of malignancy, respiratory disease and premature cardiovascular disease in the general population. Whilst the evidence is less comprehensive in KTRs, cigarette smoking has been shown to be associated with reduced patient survival, malignancy, and increased cardiovascular events. In the general population, various intervention strategies have been shown to be beneficial in encouraging smoking cessation (nicotine replacements - gum, patch, and inhaled, counselling, and Bupropion). Maintenance of abstinence is challenging, as 10–20% of former smokers will resume smoking following previously successful cessation. The long-term benefits of smoking cessation have not been proven in transplant recipients, nor are long-term studies likely to be performed. However, strategies for smoking cessation are safe and likely to produce the same benefits seen in other populations or public health studies. A local strategy should be available and record made of the advice given and available.

Guideline 6.6 KTR: lifestyle measures

We suggest that advice on healthy lifestyle forms a routine part of post-transplant care:
Maintenance of a healthy diet should be encouraged (2C)
An ideal weight should be targeted (body mass index (BMI) ≤ 25 kg/m 2) (2C)
Weight management services should be available (2C)
We suggest that KTRs participate in physical activity at a level similar to that recommended to age and co-morbidity matched counterparts from the general population (2D)
Alcohol consumption should be within national guidelines (2D)
Recreational drug use should be avoided (2D)
The use of over-the-counter medications (without discussion with clinical staff) and non-proprietary medications (e.g. herbal medicines) should be discouraged (2D)

### Smoking cessation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and mortality in chronic kidney disease [^112F1XZY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Smoking cessation is recommended to reduce excess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, this recommendation is largely based on observational studies on the general population Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association of smoking dose and smoking cessation duration with ASCVD and mortality in patients with CKD.

Methods

We compiled a comprehensive pooled dataset comprising 66245 participants with CKD from the KNOW-CKD and the UK Biobank cohort. Additionally, we included 307353 participants without CKD from the UK Biobank cohort. Participants were categorized according to smoking dose and duration of smoking cessation base on a questionnaire. The primary outcome was a composite of ASCVD events or all-cause mortality.

Results

Over a median follow-up period of 13.2 years, 14671 (22.1%) participants reached the primary outcome. In the pooled CKD cohort, compared to never smokers, and former and current smokers exhibited a 1.30- and 2.14-fold higher risk of the primary outcome, respectively. Among former smokers, the hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for smoking loads < 20 and ≥ 20 pack-years were 1.05 (1.00–1.10) and 2.14 (2.05–2.25), respectively. The increased risk of the primary outcome was attenuated by longer smoking cessation. The HRs (95% CIs) for smoking cessation of < 10 years, 10–20 years, and ≥ 20 years were 1.75 (1.65–1.86), 1.43 (1.34–1.52), and 1.11 (1.06–1.16), respectively, compared with never smokers. This association was also observed in individuals without CKD, but the risk was comparable between former smokers with smoking cessation ≥ 20 years and non-smokers, suggesting that a longer cessation is required in patients with CKD to offset the smoking-related adverse effects.

Conclusions

Among former smokers with CKD, the risk of ASCVD or mortality was substantially attenuated with less smoking load and a longer duration of smoking cessation.

### Do patients with chronic kidney disease get optimal cardiovascular risk reduction? [^115h26T1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cardiovascular events are the major cause of death in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Individuals with CKD have a substantially greater risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population but have largely been excluded from clinical trials. This review highlights the complex pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, discusses the evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction and assesses the achievement of cardiovascular treatment targets in CKD.

Recent Findings

There is evidence to support both blood pressure and cholesterol reduction in the CKD population. The risk of bleeding with antiplatelet drugs is high in CKD and these should be used with caution. Although there has been recent interest in targeting nonclassical cardiovascular risk factors in CKD, few trials have demonstrated any significant reduction in cardiovascular risk. Smoking cessation remains important but is poorly studied in CKD with many dialysis patients still smoking.

Summary

The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in CKD differs subtly from that of non-CKD patients. As renal function declines, the role and impact of treating classical risk factors may change and diminish. However, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking cessation management should be optimized and may require multiple agents and approaches, particularly as CKD advances. Treatment of hypertension would appear to be one management area in which performance is less than ideal. Future work should focus on new management strategies and drug combinations that tackle the classical risk factors as well as better designed longitudinal and randomized control trials of nonclassical risk factors. Patients with CKD should be included in all cardiovascular intervention studies, given their poor outcomes without interventions.

Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased risk is due to a higher prevalence of both traditional risk factors as well as nontraditional risk factors. In this review we focus on individuals at all stages of CKD and discuss modifiable traditional risk factors, namely hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and poor glycemic control, smoking, and physical inactivity. The prevalence of each risk factor and its relationship with CVD is described. Treatment recommendations are provided using evidence available from populations with CKD or evidence extrapolated from the general population when there are insufficient data on individuals with CKD.

### Cigarette smoking and chronic kidney disease in the general population: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^116vtej2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cigarette smoking has been established as a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) development in people with diabetes. Conflicting evidence exists among representative community-based studies as to whether smoking is an independent risk factor for CKD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of tobacco smoking on the development of CKD in adult general populations.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase from their inception through 31 May 2016 for prospective cohort studies that reported relative risks of CKD with smoking status in the general population. Summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model.

Results

A total of 15 prospective cohort studies, including 65 064 incident CKD cases, were included. Compared with never-smokers, the SRRs of incident CKD were 1.27 (95% CI 1.19–1.35) for ever-smokers, 1.34 (95% CI 1.23–1.47) for current smokers and 1.15 (95% CI 1.08–1.23) for former smokers. The SRRs for end-stage renal disease development were 1.51 (95% CI 1.24–1.84) for ever-smokers, 1.44 (95% CI 1.00–2.09) for former smokers and 1.91 (95% CI 1.39–2.64) for current smokers. Considerable heterogeneity was observed among these studies. After combining an additional three prospective cohort studies, which involved 5747 incident proteinuria cases, a null smoking-proteinuria association in the general population was observed.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis suggests evidence for cigarette smoking as an independent risk factor for incident CKD. Future studies are required to investigate whether smoking cessation can decrease incident CKD in the general adult population.

CKD staging by eGFR and ACR — relative risks (RRs) are presented for all eGFR/ACR combinations for the 10 identified outcomes and are adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (current, former, or never), systolic BP (SBP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), use of antihypertensive medications, and medical diagnoses including diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Within the CKD population, risk for all 10 outcomes increases with higher stages of both eGFR and albuminuria, and the figures present only RRs and not absolute risk by cell. For eGFRcr CKD G3a with the lowest ACR severity (< 10 mg/g [< 1 mg/mmol]), the group is shown lower risk for 7 of the 10 outcomes yet has a 5-fold higher adjusted risk of AKI and 13-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with the reference group.

### Cigarette use and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease: an unappreciated modifiable lifestyle risk factor [^112ix1LP]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Tobacco use is a major modifiable cardiovascular risk factor in the general population and contributes to excess cardiovascular risk. Emerging evidence from large-scale observational studies suggests that continued tobacco use is also an independent cardiovascular risk factor among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The benefits of smoking cessation programs on improving the heath status of patients and reducing mortality are unequivocal in the general population. Despite this, there has been little effort in pursuing tobacco cessation programs in dialysis cohorts or those with lesser degrees of kidney impairment. Most of our attention to date has focused on the development of "kidney-specific" interventions that reduce rates of renal disease progression and improve dialysis outcomes. The purpose of this current review is to describe the epidemiology of tobacco use among patients with CKD, draw attention to its negative impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and finally highlight potential strategies for successful intervention. We hope that this study heightens the importance of tobacco use in CKD, stimulates renewed interest in the barriers and challenges that exist in achieving smoking cessation, and endorses the efficacy of intervention strategies and the immeasurable benefits of quitting on cardiovascular and noncardiovascular outcomes.

### Relationship between modifiable lifestyle factors and chronic kidney disease: a bibliometric analysis of top-cited publications from 2011 to 2020 [^114eagJb]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study showed obesity and health-related behaviors, such as physical activity and smoking, were among the research hotspots of modifiable factors. This evidence supports the inclusion of advice on physical activity, healthy weight, and smoking cessation into CKD management guidelines. This reflects the attention from the field of nephrology on the influence of emerging obesity issues and unhealthy behavioral factors on health outcomes. Both obesity and sedentary lifestyle have become major driving forces for global disease burdens. Their associations with CKD are investigated intensely by scholars. For example, in the top-cited articles included in the study, obesity is associated with increased CKD risk, and obese or overweight CKD patients are suggested to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. A study evaluated the risk of ESRD associated with obesity at the time of donation among live kidney donors and found that obese live kidney donors have a significant 86% increased risk of ESRD compared to non-obese donors. Regular physical activity instead of sedentariness can reduce the risk and mortality of CKD in type 2 diabetes. A randomized clinical trial found that dietary calorie restriction and aerobic exercise can improve the metabolic milieu in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Besides, a low-intensity exercise program may improve physical performance and quality of life in dialysis patients. Studies suggest that cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for incident CKD, and nonsmoking is associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes in CKD patients and all-cause mortality.

Treatment Strategies for CKD in People With T2D

Multiple treatment strategies have been shown to reduce the development and progression of CKD in people living with T2D. The most common goal of intervention is to slow progression of CKD, but sometimes with early intervention in mild CKD, UACR and eGFR may revert to normal levels.

Lifestyle

A healthy diet with appropriate nutrition, adequate physical activity, smoking cessation, and body weight management can reduce both kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes, especially when combined with appropriate drug therapies. The KDIGO guideline recommends that people with CKD should undertake moderate physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week or as tolerated and consume more plant-based foods versus animal-based foods, maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day for adults with CKD stages G3 to G5. The KDIGO guideline also recommends a sodium intake of < 2 g per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) for people with CKD.

### Smoking and adverse outcomes in patients with CKD: the study of heart and renal protection (SHARP) [^113H5zac]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Editorial, p. 338

In 2010, it was estimated that smoking tobacco resulted in about 4.5 million male and 2 million female deaths globally. Smoking was the leading global cause of disability in men and fourth most important cause in women and was ranked in the top 5 causes of disease and death in every region of the world except for parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Smoking tobacco increases the risks for a wide range of chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases,(coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure), respiratory diseases, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients with CKD have substantially elevated risks for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and progressive loss of kidney function; therefore, smoking might be expected to be particularly hazardous for such patients. However, few epidemiologic studies have examined the effects of smoking directly in populations of patients with CKD. In the largest previous study (in which 3,941 dialysis patients were followed up for a mean of 2.2 years), current smokers had a 59% increased risk for new heart failure and 37% increased risk for death when compared with never smokers, but there was no significant excess risk for ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease (albeit based on only 232 and 64 events, respectively).

The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) was a randomized trial of simvastatin plus ezetimibe versus placebo among 9,270 patients with CKD. It is well placed to address the existing uncertainties about the effects of smoking in patients with CKD. More than twice as large as previous studies, SHARP has carefully phenotyped participants at baseline, with systematic recording of smoking quantity, prior diseases, and laboratory measurements. In addition, all relevant outcomes were systematically adjudicated so that reliable information is available for cause-specific mortality (> 2,200 cases), atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic vascular events (> 2,300 cases), site-specific cancer (∼900 cases), and progression of CKD (including serial creatinine measurements and > 2,100 patients reaching end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). We therefore undertook these analyses to investigate the relevance of smoking to major morbidity and mortality in a large cohort of patients with moderate to advanced CKD.

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.
