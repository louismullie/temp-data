## Question

DLT intubation in VATS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), including indications, alternatives, positioning strategy, visualization tools, sizing, confirmation, complications, and how to integrate these into an algorithmic approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why lung isolation is needed in VATS. Then, I should verify the comparative roles of DLT versus bronchial blockers and non-intubated strategies. Next, I will examine lateral versus supine DLT intubation, followed by the impact of videolaryngoscopy and video-DLTs. After that, I need to check sizing, confirmation, and complication mitigation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight special scenarios and limitations, making sure each claim is supported by data and that I double-check any conflicting findings before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. VATS relies on one-lung ventilation (OLV) to collapse the operative lung and create a clear surgical field; historically, this has been achieved with a DLT as the gold standard because it provides rapid, reliable lung isolation and allows independent lung management, suctioning, and protection of the contralateral lung in cases of infection or hemorrhage [^116yGZJ5] [^115NsiXu] [^116vgqUA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about DLT being the only option. I need to compare alternatives. Bronchial blockers can achieve comparable lung collapse quality to DLTs in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, with similar malposition rates and device placement times, but they are associated with less postoperative sore throat and hoarseness, which can matter for recovery and satisfaction; however, blockers may take longer to achieve complete collapse and can be more technically finicky intraoperatively, especially without fiberoptic bronchoscopy [^112TnJY1] [^112uQBnV] [^112TnJY1]. Non-intubated VATS (NIVATS) avoids intubation altogether and may reduce sore throat, pulmonary complications, and length of stay in selected patients, but it carries risks of cough, mediastinal shift, and hypoxemia and requires meticulous patient selection and team expertise; meta-analyses and randomized data suggest feasibility with faster recovery, though intraoperative airway interventions are more frequent and high-quality multicenter data remain limited [^116EfCph] [^113eRtUg] [^1173vQrq] [^111EzmJ2].

> Next, I should review positioning strategy. Conventional supine DLT intubation followed by lateral positioning is associated with a substantial malposition rate, often cited around 26–37%, necessitating routine bronchoscopic reconfirmation after turning; this adds time and risk of hypoxemia during repositioning [^113PPgGG]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit with lateral intubation. Randomized trials show that performing DLT intubation directly in the lateral position reduces malposition dramatically, for example to about 2% versus 30% with supine, and also reduces intubation time, bronchoscopy use, and some postoperative symptoms; however, lateral intubation takes longer to perform and may be unsuitable for predicted difficult airways, so patient selection and team readiness are key [^114CfvRd] [^1122RKoa] [^113dTUc2] [^117XpJN8].

> I will now examine visualization tools. Videolaryngoscopy improves glottic visualization and has been associated with fewer DLT malpositions and complications in thoracic surgery cohorts, and a large cluster-randomized trial in surgical patients showed that hyperangulated video laryngoscopy increased first-attempt success and reduced attempts compared with direct laryngoscopy; however, wait, I should double-check conflicting data showing that some videolaryngoscopy approaches can prolong DLT intubation time or even increase malposition in certain settings, underscoring device-specific performance and operator technique as determinants of outcome [^113ZJA24] [^113h3AQm] [^11413eeH] [^112hr7wg]. Let me reconsider technique nuances: angulating the DLT to a hockey-stick shape and using sequential rotation can facilitate passage and reduce trauma, and combining video laryngoscopy with fiberoptic bronchoscopy in predicted difficult airways can improve first-pass success and safety [^117M8qzh] [^112ZgdY4] [^116T2YHZ] [^113LchVW].

> Now, I should review video double-lumen tubes (VDLTs). VDLTs provide continuous airway visualization and can markedly reduce reliance on fiberoptic bronchoscopy for initial placement and intraoperative checks, with studies showing 86–93% reductions in FOB use and faster confirmation times; however, I need to ensure I weigh trade-offs, as VDLTs have a larger outer diameter and may increase postoperative sore throat and hoarseness, and randomized data have not shown clear reductions in moderate-to-severe tracheal or vocal cord injury compared with conventional DLTs, so device selection should balance speed and visualization against patient comfort and airway caliber [^1125TJdr] [^113nVCtx] [^114rsNQX] [^113BWM7H] [^116hBGr7] [^112jt7dH].

> Let me think about sizing and confirmation. I should confirm that downsizing to a 35 Fr DLT for most adults performs non-inferiorly to larger sizes in terms of intraoperative hypoxemia, isolation failure, and repositioning, which may reduce airway trauma; conversely, choosing too small a DLT increases the risk of contralateral bronchial intubation, so individualized sizing and bronchoscopic verification remain essential [^113rMB7S] [^116hmM2i]. Hold on, I should verify confirmation methods beyond bronchoscopy. Lung ultrasound has shown non-inferiority to bronchoscopy for confirming DLT position in a randomized noninferiority study, offering a rapid, portable alternative when bronchoscopy is unavailable or aerosolization is a concern, though widespread adoption still requires training and local validation [^111QuGJN].

> I need to ensure I address complications and mitigation. DLT-related injuries, though uncommon, include tracheobronchial laceration and cuff-related trauma; careful technique, appropriate sizing, and minimizing repositioning reduce risk, and case reports highlight the importance of anticipating difficult extubation scenarios and coordinating with surgery to avoid entrapment or suture interference [^114fsXKU] [^117RQq6A]. But wait, what if the team is concerned about aerosolization during bronchoscopy, as in COVID-era practice? VDLTs and strategies that minimize routine FOB use can reduce aerosol exposure while maintaining safety, though continuous visual monitoring does not eliminate the need for vigilance about displacement during surgery [^116hmM2i].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. In patients with predicted difficult airways, a combined video laryngoscopy plus fiberoptic approach or an awake strategy with a bronchial blocker may be safer than forcing a DLT; in post-pneumonectomy or other complex anatomies, adapted DLT positioning or selective lobar techniques can enable effective isolation; and in prolonged or high-risk right-sided procedures, be mindful of right upper lobe obstruction with right-sided DLTs and have a low threshold to reposition or switch strategies [^116yGZJ5] [^113LchVW] [^113u743Q] [^111ttC5m].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check each branch against the evidence. For routine VATS in patients with a normal airway, lateral DLT intubation with videolaryngoscopy is reasonable to reduce malposition and streamline workflow, provided the team is trained and the airway is favorable; for predicted difficult airways, favor a bronchial blocker or an awake technique; for low-risk, short procedures in highly selected patients, consider NIVATS with robust contingency planning; for resource-limited settings or when bronchoscopy is constrained, VDLT can reduce FOB needs; and across all scenarios, confirm position with bronchoscopy or validated alternatives and reassess after lateral positioning to mitigate displacement risk [^114CfvRd] [^113h3AQm] [^116EfCph] [^1125TJdr] [^111QuGJN].

> Finally, I should confirm limitations and future directions. Much of the lateral intubation and VDLT literature is single-center and unblinded, and generalizability depends on team experience; multicenter trials and standardized training curricula are needed, and emerging data on lung ultrasound, hybrid visualization techniques, and ERAS-integrated pathways will likely refine best practices and expand the role of non-intubated strategies in appropriately selected patients [^117XpJN8] [^116EfCph] [^115tcV9g].

Double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation is the **gold standard** for lung isolation in VATS [^111QuGJN], enabling reliable one-lung ventilation and a clear surgical field [^1122RKoa]. DLTs offer **faster lung collapse** and more stable positioning than bronchial blockers, though they carry a higher risk of sore throat and hoarseness [^112uQBnV] [^112TnJY1]. Malposition is common (26–37%) [^113PPgGG] and often requires fiberoptic bronchoscopy for correction [^111QuGJN]; videolaryngoscopy and video-DLTs can reduce malposition and fiberoptic use [^113ZJA24] [^1125TJdr] [^113nVCtx]. Lateral-position DLT intubation reduces malposition and re-positioning needs but may take longer [^114CfvRd]. Non-intubated VATS is feasible in selected patients [^1173vQrq] but requires careful selection and experienced teams [^116EfCph].

---

## Indications and contraindications

### Indications

Indications include **standard VATS procedures** — lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection, mediastinal surgery, and esophageal surgery — that require lung isolation and a clear surgical field [^115cbJFu] [^11318bMH] [^1168TW6J]. DLTs are also indicated for **difficult airway** scenarios when bronchial blockers or single-lumen tubes are impractical or ineffective [^1153fy5e].

---

### Contraindications

Contraindications include **absolute** scenarios such as severe tracheal stenosis or recent tracheal/bronchial repair, and **relative** scenarios such as known difficult airway, severe coagulopathy, or significant airway deformity.

---

## Techniques and equipment

### Equipment

Equipment includes left-sided DLTs (most commonly used) [^116yGZJ5], right-sided DLTs (for left-sided surgery or specific anatomical considerations) [^1118262U], and video-DLTs (integrated camera for continuous visualization) [^113nVCtx] [^1125TJdr]. Videolaryngoscopes (GlideScope, C-MAC) improve visualization and reduce malposition [^113ZJA24], and fiberoptic bronchoscopes confirm and adjust DLT position [^111QuGJN].

---

### Intubation techniques

- **Supine position**: Standard approach; requires bronchoscopic confirmation after lateral positioning [^113PPgGG].
- **Lateral position**: Reduces malposition and re-positioning; may increase intubation time [^114CfvRd] [^11732NAT].
- **Video-DLT**: Facilitates real-time visualization, reducing fiberoptic use and malposition [^1125TJdr] [^113nVCtx].

---

## Advantages and disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|
| Rapid and reliable lung isolation [^112UZFf8] | Higher incidence of sore throat and hoarseness [^112TnJY1] |
| Stable positioning during surgery [^116hBGr7] | Risk of airway trauma and malposition [^113PPgGG] |
| Facilitates effective suctioning and bronchial toileting [^111XCBTG] | Requires bronchoscopic confirmation and adjustment [^116hmM2i] |
| Widely available and familiar to anesthesiologists [^115NsiXu] | Larger tube diameter may cause airway injury [^116hBGr7] |

---

## Complications and risks

- **Malposition**: Common (26–37%), causing inadequate lung isolation, hypoxemia, and surgical interference [^113PPgGG].
- **Airway trauma**: Mucosal injury, vocal cord injury, and rare tracheal rupture [^116hBGr7] [^114fsXKU].
- **Postoperative sore throat and hoarseness**: Higher incidence compared to bronchial blockers [^112uQBnV] [^112TnJY1].
- **Difficult extubation**: Rare but serious complication requiring careful management [^117RQq6A].

---

## Alternative lung isolation methods

Bronchial blockers offer comparable lung collapse with fewer sore throats but may require longer collapse time and are more **prone to displacement** [^112uQBnV] [^1136tW5m]. Non-intubated VATS is feasible in selected patients [^111EzmJ2] but requires **careful patient selection** and experienced teams [^116EfCph] [^1173vQrq]. Single-lumen tubes with CO2 insufflation are an alternative for select procedures but offer limited lung collapse and are **unsuitable for complex surgeries** [^1168TW6J].

---

## Recent advancements and innovations

Video-DLTs provide **continuous visualization**, reducing fiberoptic use and malposition [^1125TJdr] [^113nVCtx]. Lateral-position intubation reduces malposition and re-positioning needs, though it may **increase intubation time** [^114CfvRd] [^11732NAT]. Hybrid techniques combining video laryngoscopy with fiberoptic bronchoscopy improve **first-pass success** and reduce complications [^116T2YHZ].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

DLT intubation provides reliable **lung isolation** and optimal surgical exposure [^111QuGJN]. Postoperative **sore throat and hoarseness** are more common with DLTs than with bronchial blockers, affecting satisfaction [^112uQBnV] [^112TnJY1]. Lateral-position intubation and **video-DLTs** improve satisfaction by reducing malposition and re-positioning [^114CfvRd] [^113euQZh].

Double-lumen tube intubation remains the **gold standard** for VATS, providing reliable lung isolation and optimal surgical exposure [^111QuGJN]. It offers faster lung collapse and more stable positioning than bronchial blockers, but has a higher risk of sore throat and hoarseness [^112TnJY1]. Malposition is common and often requires bronchoscopic correction; videolaryngoscopy and video-DLTs can reduce malposition and fiberoptic use [^113ZJA24] [^1125TJdr]. Lateral-position DLT intubation reduces malposition but may take longer [^114CfvRd] [^11732NAT]. Non-intubated VATS is feasible in selected patients but requires careful selection and experienced teams [^111EzmJ2] [^113eRtUg].

### Anesthesia for nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^111EzmJ2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

With the growing adoption of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols across all surgical groups, including thoracic surgery, coupled with improved video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) equipment and techniques, nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery has gained significant popularity in recent years. Avoiding tracheal intubation with an endotracheal or double-lumen tube and general anesthesia may reduce or eliminate the risks associated with traditional mechanical ventilation, one-lung ventilation, and general anesthesia. Studies have shown a trend toward better preservation of postoperative respiratory function and improved postoperative lengths of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality; however, these have not been conclusively proven. This review article discusses the advantages of nonintubated VATS, the types of thoracic surgery in which this technique has been described, patient selection, appropriate anesthetic techniques, surgical concerns, potential complications relevant to the anesthesiologist during the conduct of nonintubated VATS surgery, and suggested management of these complications.

### Efficacy and safety of video double-lumen tube intubation in lateral position in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^11732NAT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Video double-lumen tube (VDLT) intubation in lateral position is a potential alternative to intubation in supine position in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. This non-inferiority trial assessed the efficacy and safety of VDLT intubation in lateral position.

Methods

Patients (18–70 yr) undergoing right thoracoscopic lung surgery were randomized to either the left lateral position group (group L) or the supine position group (group S). The VDLT was placed under video larygoscopy. The primary endpoint was the intubation time. Secondary endpoints included VDLT displacement rate, intubation failure rate, the satisfaction of surgeon and nurse, and intubation-related adverse events.

Results

The analysis covered 80 patients. The total intubation time was 52.0 [20.4]s in group L and 34.3 [13.2]s in group S, with a mean difference of 17.6 s [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.9 s to 25.3 s; P = 0.050], failing to demonstrate non-inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of 10 s. Group L, compared with group S, had significantly lower VDLT displacement rate (P = 0.017) and higher nurse satisfaction (P = 0.026). No intubation failure occurred in any group. Intubation complications (P = 0.802) and surgeon satisfaction (P = 0.415) were comparable between two groups.

Conclusions

The lateral VDLT intubation took longer time than in the supine position, and non-inferiority was not achieved. The incidence of displacement as the secondary endpoint was lower in the L group, possibly due to changing body positions beforehand. The indication of lateral VDLT intubation should be based on a balance between the safety of airway management and the lower incidence of displacement.

Trial Registration

The study was registered at Chictr.org.cn with the number ChiCTR2200064831 on 19/10/2022.

### Comparison of the effect of double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers on lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NsiXu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

When choosing a DLT or BB, a multidisciplinary intervention is necessary for the preoperative evaluation of the thoracic patient and whether to enter the ICU, with a full range of assessments, such as the patient's gender, age, weight, cardiac function, lung function, and the need for postoperative organ support. These are all issues that need to be considered. In the perioperative multidisciplinary team, the anesthesiologist plays a leading role in optimizing the treatment strategy. We can choose DLT or BB according to different needs. Some studies still refer to DLT as the gold standard in various surgical procedures requiring lung isolations; moreover, it was preferred by most thoracic anesthesiologists. Considering the individual variation among patients, anesthesiologists should be proficient in using both DLT and BB.

This meta-analysis has some limitations. Most of the included literature compared the use of DLT and BB in the left lung, whereas few compared their uses in the right lung. This was likely related to the anatomy and ventilation requirement of the lung.

### Efficacy and safety of video double-lumen tube intubation in lateral position in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1122RKoa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The double-lumen tube (DLT) is the most prevalent device employed for one-lung ventilation (OLV) during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), with the aim of ensuring a well-collapsed lung for optimal visualization of the surgical field. The video double-lumen tube (VDLT), compared with conventional DLT, features an integrated imaging camera located at the end of the tracheal lumen, which enables continuous airway visualization, ensures the precision of tube placement during intubation and reduces the need for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, shortening the time required for intubation. However, malposition of either the traditional DLT or the VDLT may arise during shifting patient from supine to lateral position for surgery, impacting the efficiency of lung isolation. Recently, two clinical studies have proved that lateral DLT intubation reduced the incidence of DLT malposition for patients undergoing thoracic surgery compared to supine DLT intubation. As a result, VDLT intubation undertaken directly in the lateral position may be an alternative.

Prior researches have demonstrated the feasibility of single-lumen tube and laryngeal mask airway intubation in the lateral position, with a comparable intubation time and success rate between patients placed in the supine and lateral positions. However, larger size of DLT combined with deterioration of laryngoscopic view raise the difficulty of DLT intubation in the lateral position. It was evidenced by the recent two RCTs which found that the lateral DLT intubation was associated with longer intubation attempts and a more frequent failure rate. Therefore, the feasibility of lateral VDLT intubation in terms of intubation time for patients undergoing thoracic surgery still need further study.

We designed a prospective randomized noninferiority clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VDLT intubation in lateral position in patients undergoing right thoracoscopic lung surgery. We tested the hypothesis that VDLT intubation in lateral position would be non-inferior to supine position in terms of intubation time. We further hypothesized that VDLT intubation in lateral position would decrease the incidence of VDLT displacement and not increase the incidence of intubation failure and intubation-related complications.

### Effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a double-lumen tube in patients undergoing unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomied clinical trial [^112B3qMu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become the preferred method for the treatment of most thoracic disorders because it causes less damage and fewer complications while allowing faster post-operative recovery. However, the effect of intubation in the lateral position on DLT placement during VATS has not been investigated previously.

Therefore, we conducted the randomized trial to investigate the clinical applicability and efficacy of lateral DLT intubation. We aimed to evaluate the effect of intubation in the lateral position on placement of a DLT, and to test primary hypothesis that lateral DLT intubation could reduce the incidence of DLT malposition in patients undergoing unilateral VATS compared with supine intubation. We also explored the effect of lateral DLT intubation on the patient's vital signs and post-operative complications.

### Videolaryngoscopy is associated with a lower rate of double-lumen endotracheal tube malposition in thoracic surgery procedures, retrospective single-center study [^115R5te7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations that should be considered. Firstly, this was a retrospective single-center study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other institutions or broader populations. The sample size was relatively small, with only 89 patients, which may affect the statistical power and the ability to detect smaller differences between the groups. Finally, while our study demonstrated a lower incidence of malposition and complications with VL, it did not assess long-term outcomes or patient satisfaction, which are important factors in evaluating the overall effectiveness of intubation techniques.

In conclusion, our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the superiority of VL in various clinical settings. While further research is warranted to corroborate our findings and explore the long-term implications, our results suggest that the adoption of VL in thoracic surgery procedures involving double-lumen endotracheal intubation may enhance patient safety and outcomes by reducing the incidence of malpositioned tubes. As such, we advocate for the integration of VL into clinical practice as a standard approach for endotracheal intubation in these contexts.

### Comparison of the effect of double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers on lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vgqUA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Selective bronchial intubation was first used in practice in 1931 as a solution to thoracotomy-related pneumothorax. Subsequent innovations in selective lung ventilation techniques have since greatly promoted the rapid development of thoracic surgery. In addition, the wide use of video technology, endoscopic instruments, and minimally invasive techniques has expanded the application of one-lung ventilation (OLV) from lung surgery to surgeries on the esophagus, heart, and other organs.

At present, lung isolation remains the basis of thoracic anesthesia. In the past, the poor quality of atelectasis treatment could be compensated by manual extrusion and exposure. However, with the popularization of thoracoscopic surgery, the number of incisions in thoracic surgery has reduced from three to one, which, despite meeting the definition of minimally invasive surgery, poses higher requirements for atelectasis treatment. Existing clinical lung isolation techniques mainly use either DLT or BB. Multiple studies have indicated that anesthesiologists prefer the former owing to the common belief that it provides a better quality of atelectasis treatment. However, neither the strong stimulation of double-lumen intubation nor the associated risk of postoperative sore throat can be ignored. Therefore, which technique is safer and more convenient in thoracoscopic surgery remains controversial.

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on RCTs comparing the applications of DLT and BB in thoracoscopic surgery, in order to identify differences in the quality of lung collapse, malposition rate, and incidence of postoperative sore throat between the two techniques.

Methods

This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO on February 16th, 2022 (registration number: CRD42022302483). Subsequently, a systematic search was conducted among databases including PubMed, Springer, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library using keywords such as "double-lumen tube", "bronchial blocker", "lung isolation", "one-lung ventilation", and "thoracic surgery". In addition, a list of included literature and related comments was finalized after reviewing the references. Only English literature was included in the study.

### Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation in thoracic surgery-a randomised controlled clinical trial [^11413eeH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our randomized controlled trial showed faster intubation time using a conventional laryngoscope compared to the GlideScope® Titanium videolaryngoscopy for double-lumen tube insertion. Additionally, malposition of the DLT was more common in the videolaryngoscopy group. Despite some improvements in objectivable airway injuries during the postoperative course, there was no subjective difference for the patient as a relevant patient-centered outcome parameter. Further studies are needed to increase the number of first-pass optimal placement of DLT using videolaryngoscopy.

### Effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a double-lumen tube in patients undergoing unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomied clinical trial [^114CfvRd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Approximately one-third of patients who undergo double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation in the conventional supine position experience DLT malposition. No randomized study investigates the effect of DLT intubation in the lateral position. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a DLT compared to supine intubation, and to test primary hypothesis that lateral DLT intubation could reduce the incidence of DLT malposition.

Methods

We randomly allocated 108 patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery to receive DLT intubation in the comfortable and surgically required lateral position (lateral group) or in the supine position (supine group) from October to December 2022. The primary outcome was the incidence of DLT malposition defined as movement > 1.0 cm to correct the DLT position. The secondary outcomes included intubation time, the frequency and duration of fibreoptic bronchoscopy, the need for re-intubation, intra-operative vital signs, and post-operative recovery. This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200060794).

Findings

The incidence of DLT malposition was significantly lower in the lateral group (1/53 [2%]) than that in the supine group (16/53 [30%]; RR [95% confidence interval] of 0.06 [0.01–0.46]; P < 0.001). Lateral DLT intubation decreased the intubation time, the frequency and duration of fibreoptic bronchoscopy. The incidence of hypotension, post-operative sore throat, and upper-arm discomfort was lower in the lateral group. Other secondary outcomes were similar between groups.

Interpretation

Lateral DLT intubation reduced the incidence of DLT malposition for patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery. These results support that lateral DLT intubation offers more benefits and may be a superior option compared to conventional supine intubation.

### Comparison of vivaSight double-lumen tube with a conventional double-lumen tube in adult patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^113nVCtx]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The efficiency of a double-lumen tube depends on its position in the airways, which can be verified by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. The VivaSight DL is a single-use double-lumen tube with a camera embedded in the tube's right side. The view from the camera appears continuously on a monitor. In this prospective study of 71 adult patients, we compared intubation times using either the VivaSight DL or a conventional double-lumen tube. Median (IQR [range]) duration of intubation with visual confirmation of tube position was significantly reduced using the VivaSight DL compared with the conventional double-lumen tube (51 (42–60 [35–118]) s vs 264 (233–325 [160–490]) s, respectively, p < 0.0001). None of the patients allocated to the VivaSight DL required fibreoptic bronchoscopy during intubation or surgery. The VivaSight DL enables significantly more rapid intubation compared with the conventional double-lumen tube.

### A retrospective evaluation of the use of video-capable double-lumen endotracheal tubes in thoracic surgery [^114rsNQX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the use of a video double-lumen tube reduced the need for fiberoptic bronchoscopy for (1) verification of initial tube placement and for (2) reverification of correct placement after repositioning for thoracotomy.

Design

A single-center retrospective study.

Setting

Thoracic surgery in a medical university hospital.

Participants & Interventions

After institutional review board approval, 29 patients who underwent thoracic surgical procedures using video double-lumen tubes were included in the final retrospective analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

For 27 (93.2%) patients, the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy was not needed either for initial placement or for verification of correct video double-lumen tube placement upon final positioning of the patient. However, for two patients, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was needed: for (1) one patient with severe left mainstem bronchus distortion as a result of a large left upper lobe tumor, and (2) a second patient with secretions that were difficult to clear.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the video double-lumen tube requires significantly less (6.8%) fiberoptic use for both initial placement and verification of final position, in stark contrast to standard practice in which bronchoscopy is always used to verify final positioning of the double-lumen tube. As opposed to intermittent bronchoscopy, the continuous visualization offered by an embedded camera may confer an added measure of safety.

### Effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a double-lumen tube in patients undergoing unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomied clinical trial [^117XpJN8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the clinical application and efficacy of DLT intubation in the lateral position in thoracic surgery. Our study lays the foundation for lateral DLT intubation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery, and could inspire further research on the impact of this method. We hope that lateral DLT intubation can be mastered by more anesthesiologists and be implemented widely to benefit more patients.

Our study had the following limitations. First, blinding patients and anesthesia investigators to the study protocol was not possible. Patients were informed of the method of DLT intubation after entering the operating theater and accordingly laid in the lateral position or supine position. The anesthesia investigators were also aware of the patient grouping and undertook lateral or supine DLT intubation. To ensure the accuracy of the data, an independent research nurse who was not involved in the study supervised the collection of intra-operative data, and the investigators involved in follow-up and data analyses were unaware of the patient grouping. Second, lateral DLT intubation is not appropriate for patients with known or predicted to have difficult intubation. As indicated by McCaul and colleagues, single-lumen tube intubation in the lateral position is considered inappropriate for patients with difficult intubation. Third, all patients received only total intravenous anesthesia. High doses of propofol may have side effects such as hypotension. Fourth, this is a single-center, small sample size clinical study. Multicenter investigations are required to evaluate whether lateral DLT intubation can be a viable alternative to conventional supine intubation. Fifth, in our next clinical trial of predicting the depth of lateral DLT intubation by preoperative patient CT, we will include flexible video laryngoscopic examination to evaluate vocal fold pathology.

In conclusion, our study provided evidence that performing DLT intubation in the lateral position reduced the incidence of DLT malposition compared with conventional supine intubation for patients undergoing unilateral VATS. Our findings validate the feasibility and superiority of DLT intubation in the lateral position, which may be a superior option for DLT intubation in thoracic surgery.

### Effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a double-lumen tube in patients undergoing unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomied clinical trial [^113dTUc2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The study DLT intubation in VATS was published by Xi Zhang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal EClinicalMedicine. This study is related to the following diseases: Blunt chest trauma, Coccidioidomycosis, Community-acquired pneumonia, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Pleural mesothelioma, Non-small cell lung cancer, Small cell lung cancer, Parapneumonic effusion and empyema, Pneumothorax and Pulmonary nodules. In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the trial question was: what is the role of lateral double-lumen tube intubation in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery? In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the population was: 106 patients (58 female, 48 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery. The key exclusion criteria were history of pulmonary surgery; difficulty in intubation; severe mental illness. In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the interventions were: n = 53 lateral group (receipt of double-lumen tube intubation in the comfortable and surgically required lateral position) n = 53 supine group (receipt of double-lumen tube intubation in the conventional supine position). In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in incidence of double-lumen tube malposition (2% vs. 30%; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.46). In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median intubation time (78 seconds vs. 86 seconds; MD -20.6, 95% CI -36.2 to -5) No significant difference in re-intubation (6% vs. 15%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.34) Significant decrease in fiberoptic bronchoscopy usage > 2 (4% vs. 23%; RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.71). In the DLT intubation in VATS study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery, lateral group was superior to supine group with respect to incidence of double-lumen tube malposition.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery using single-lumen endotracheal tube anesthesia [^114JX58M]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most general thoracic surgeons use double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) anesthesia for all video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We evaluated a single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLET) for VATS for drainage of pleural effusions and pleural biopsies.

Methods

A consecutive series of patients with recurrent pleural effusions underwent VATS using an SLET and only one incision. Operations were accomplished via one 2-cm incision using a 5-mm rigid thoracoscope and mediastinoscopic biopsy forceps for directed pleural biopsies. A working area was accomplished with low tidal volumes.

Results

There were 376 patients (191 women). The indications for VATS were a nondiagnosed or benign pleural effusion in 294 patients, and a malignant effusion in 82 patients. Two hundred eight patients underwent biopsy of the parietal pleura, and mean operative time was 17 min. Adequate visibility was obtained in all. When compared to preoperative cytology, VATS was more sensitive (45% compared to 99%, p < 0.001), had a higher negative predictive value (56% compared to 99%, p < 0.001), and was more accurate (67% compared to 99%, p < 0.001). Forty-seven percent of patients with a history of cancer had false-negative preoperative cytology results. Complications occurred in seven patients (2%), and there were three operative deaths (none related to the operative procedure).

Conclusion

VATS using SLET and only one incision is possible, and it affords excellent visualization of the pleural space, allowing pleural biopsies and talc insufflation. It avoids the risk, time, and cost of a DLET. It is significantly more sensitive and accurate than preoperative cytology, and it should be considered as the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice in patients with recurrent pleural effusions.

### Comparison of the effect of double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers on lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uQBnV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This meta-analysis compared the quality of lung collapse and the resultant adverse reactions between the use of double-lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT) and bronchial blockers (BB) in minimally invasive thoracic surgery.

Methods

A search was performed in five bibliographic databases, namely PubMed, Springer, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library ignoring the original language, which identified five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on or before December 31, 2021. These studies were subsequently analyzed. All included studies compared the efficacy and safety of DLT and BB as a lung isolation technique in surgery. The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The quality of lung collapse and the malposition rate were adopted as the main outcome indicators. Alternatively, the intubation time and the incidence of postoperative sore throat were adopted as secondary indicators.

Results

When either DLT or BB were utilized in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, no differences were observed in the quality of lung collapse (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.58), the intubation time (mean difference [MD], 0.06; 95% CI, -1.02 to 1.14), or the malposition rate (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.37 to 2.06). However, the incidence of postoperative sore throat among patients treated with BB was significantly lower than that among patients treated with DLT (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.55 to 10.75).

Conclusion

When utilized in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, the quality of lung collapse with DLT was identical to that with BB. However, patients treated with the latter demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative sore throat.

### Effect of intubation in lateral position on placement of a double-lumen tube in patients undergoing unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomied clinical trial [^113PPgGG]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Accurate positioning of a double-lumen tube (DLT) is important for achieving lung isolation and facilitating one-lung ventilation during thoracic surgery. With advances in DLTs and the routine use of fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), the position of DLT placement has become more stable and readily correctable. However, the incidence of DLT malposition remains relatively high (approximately 26%–37%). DLT malposition can occur due to various reasons, including shifting of the patient from the supine position to the lateral position, neck flexion or extension, and surgical manipulation. Approximately 40% of DLT-related complications are caused by DLT malposition. Failure to identify and correct DLT malposition promptly can lead to severe complications, including poor lung isolation, hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation, high airway pressure, atelectasis, and airway lacerations.

The conventional method of DLT intubation in supine position requires moving the anaesthetised patient to the surgically required lateral position after intubation, which is labor-intensive and reduces work efficiency, especially in the case of overweight patients. It also requires a second examination of the DLT position using FOB after lateral positioning, since DLT movement is particularly common during changes in patient position. Removing the headrest and wearing a neck brace can reduce the risk of DLT malposition during lateral positioning, but they cannot completely eliminate this possibility. Furthermore, supine DLT intubation often poses challenges including airway injury, difficulty in rescuing airway hemorrhage, and positioning-related injuries in anaesthetised patients.

On the basis of the feasibility of single-lumen tube intubation in the lateral position, we considered whether DLT intubation could be undertaken directly in the lateral position. A literature search revealed limited information on this topic, and no relevant randomized controlled trials. Ajimi and colleagues reported successful left-sided DLT intubation in the right lateral position for a patient with tracheal compression caused by a giant mediastinal tumour. Martinez and co-workers mentioned that an important and unique issue in non-intubated thoracic surgery was training for lateral DLT intubation in emergencies to cope with the potential need for intra-operative intubation.

### Perioperative outcomes of non-intubated versus intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in different thoracic procedures: a propensity score-matched analysis [^113eRtUg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

General anesthesia with intubation and controlled ventilation for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (IVATS) is a standard technique. Several lung isolation devices such as double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT), bronchial blocker, and single-lumen tube were applied to achieve a good surgical exposure. However, previous reports showed that the occurrence of complications correlated with intubation, which range from tracheal rupture and dental damage to sore throat. Moreover, ventilator-induced lung injury after one-lung ventilation (OLV) was reported in some studies.

Non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (NIVATS) is an alternative technique that has been increasingly performed during the last two decades. This technique is implemented for different types of thoracic procedures, such as wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, lung volume reduction, and mediastinal tumor surgery, with successful surgical outcomes.

According to the anesthetic perspective, studies about NIVATS technique reported in oxygenation and ventilation during procedure, complications correlated with anesthesia, and anesthetic and recovery time are limited. Some reports have shown that pulmonary gas exchange is preserved during the procedure. However, data about anesthetic-related complications are still lacking.

Therefore, the primary outcome of this study aimed to compare the pulmonary gas exchange between NIVATS and IVATS, with a focus on desaturation event, which was defined as an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of < 90% assessed using a pulse oximetry. The other outcomes were anesthetic induction and surgical time, conversion rate to IVATS, anesthetic and surgical complications, volume of blood loss, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality rate.

### Videolaryngoscopy is associated with a lower rate of double-lumen endotracheal tube malposition in thoracic surgery procedures, retrospective single-center study [^112V3tBG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The successful placement of double-lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT) is crucial in thoracic surgery procedures where lung isolation is required, and malposition of these tubes can lead to complications such as inadequate ventilation, hypoxia, and potential damage to the airway structures. Traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL) has been the standard method for endotracheal intubation, but advancements in video laryngoscopy have prompted a reevaluation of intubation techniques. Video laryngoscopy (VL) provides a superior view of the glottis and facilitates a more controlled and precise intubation process.

In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis that the utilization of VL for the placement of double-lumen endotracheal tubes will result in a decreased incidence of malposition compared to the conventional DL approach.

### Videolaryngoscopy vs. Macintosh laryngoscopy for double-lumen tube intubation in thoracic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hr7wg]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Double-lumen intubation is more difficult than single-lumen tracheal intubation. Videolaryngoscopes have many advantages in airway management. However, the advantages of videolaryngoscopy for intubation with a double-lumen tube remain controversial compared with traditional Macintosh laryngoscopy. In this study, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and the Web of Science for randomised controlled trials comparing videolaryngoscopy with Macintosh laryngoscopy for double-lumen tube intubation. We found that videolaryngoscopy provided a higher success rate at first attempt for double-lumen tube intubation, with an odds ratio (95%CI) of 2.77 (1.92–4.00) (12 studies, 1215 patients, moderate-quality evidence, p < 0.00001), as well as a lower incidence of oral, mucosal or dental injuries during double-lumen tube intubation, odds ratio (95%CI) 0.36 (0.15–0.85) (11 studies, 1145 patients, low-quality evidence, p = 0.02), and for postoperative sore throat, odds ratio (95%CI) 0.54 (0.36–0.81) (7 studies, 561 patients, moderate-quality evidence, p = 0.003), compared with Macintosh laryngoscopy. There were no significant differences in intubation time, with a standardised mean difference (95%CI) of -0.10 (-0.62 to 0.42) (14 studies, 1310 patients, very low-quality evidence, p = 0.71); and the incidence of postoperative voice change, odds ratio (95%CI) 0.53 (0.21–1.31) (7 studies, 535 patients, low-quality evidence, p = 0.17). Videolaryngoscopy led to a higher incidence of malpositioned double-lumen tube, with an odds ratio (95%CI) of 2.23 (1.10–4.52) (six studies, 487 patients, moderate-quality evidence, p = 0.03).

### The effects of video double-lumen tubes on intubation complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: a randomised controlled study [^113BWM7H]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of moderate-to-severe tracheal injury and vocal cord injury between DLTs and VDLTs. While improving the first-attempt success rate, intubation with VDLT increased the incidence of postoperative 24 h sore throat and hoarseness.

### Comparison of non-intubated and intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for perioperative complications-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JPjDU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since Carlens introduced double-lumen endotracheal intubation general anesthesia in 1949, it is considered the gold standard for thoracic anesthesia in the field of thoracic surgery. Lung isolation, surgical field exposure, and surgical process facilitation can all be accomplished with one-lung ventilation (OLV). However, there are noticeable side effects from intubated general anesthesia with OLV, such as postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, ventilator-related problems, nausea and vomiting, and decreased lung function.

Recently, the'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery'(ERAS) approach has gained significant prominence, and non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) has been more widely used. IVATS reduces the risks from intubating the trachea and the post-operative effects of muscle relaxants, allowing post-operative improvement in breathing functions and airway clearance and limiting the incidence of post-operative complications. This anesthesia has been successfully employed in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) procedures, such as alveolar resection, thoracic sympathectomy, pulmonary nodule resection, mediastinal tumor resection, and pleural biopsy. This procedure reduces airway complications and conforms to the modern approach of rapid rehabilitation surgery.

Although NIVATS offers advantages over IVATS, it carries risks such as mediastinal flutter, intraoperative cough, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia. These challenges require precise surgical and anesthetic management. Currently, high-quality, multicentre studies assessing the safety and efficacy of NIVATS remain limited, and it remains uncertain whether the efficacy of NIVATS is equivalent to or superior to that of IVATS. This meta-analysis evaluated the incidence of complications, quality of postoperative recovery, and duration of hospital stay to ascertain the benefits of NIVATS on overall patient recovery. Additionally, it examined intraoperative cough, hypoxemia, and heart rate arrhythmia to assess the feasibility and safety of NIVATS. These studies are important indicators of perioperative safety for the treatment of various thoracic diseases and evidence for optimizing anesthetic and surgical decision-making.

### Comparison of the airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation in patients with predicted normal airways: a prospective randomized trial [^111y4Y4K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was registered at(identifier: ChiCTR-TRC-11001628). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China (chairperson: Professor Jie Chen) on the 20th of July, 2011 (Ethical Committee approval No. S-384). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Seventy patients with ASA physical status I-II and aged between 18–75 years were enrolled in this study. The patients were scheduled for thoracic surgeries including thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries with double-lumen tube intubations. The exclusion criteria included emergency thoracic surgeries, histories of previous failed or difficult intubation or identified oral cavity or tracheal masses. Patients were also excluded from the study if they presented more than two of the following risks: mouth openings < 3 cm, thyromental distance < 6 cm, Mallampati class III or IV, neck flexation and extension < 30°.

### Videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation in thoracic surgery-a randomised controlled clinical trial [^113MR93N]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation is necessary for thoracic surgery and other operations with the need for lung separation. However, DLT insertion is complex and might result in airway trauma. A new videolaryngoscopy (GVL) with a thin blade might improve the intubation time and reduce complexity as well as iatrogenic airway complications compared to conventional direct laryngoscopy (DL) for DLT intubation.

Methods

A randomised, controlled trial was conducted in 70 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery using DLT for lung separation. Primary endpoint was time to successful intubation. The secondary endpoints of this study were number of intubation attempts, the assessment of difficulty, any complications during DLT intubation and the incidence of objective trauma of the oropharynx and supraglottic space and intubation-related subjective symptoms.

Results

65 patients were included (DL group [n = 31], GVL group [n = 34]). Median intubation time (25th–75th percentiles) in GVL group was 93 s (63–160) versus 74 (58–94) in DL group [p = 0.044]. GVL resulted in significantly improved visualisation of the larynx (Cormack and Lehane grade of 1 in GVL group was 97% vs. 74% in DL Group [p = 0.008]). Endoscopic examinations revealed significant differences in GVL group compared to DL group showing less red-blooded vocal cord [p = 0.004], vocal cord haematoma [p = 0.022] and vocal cord haemorrhage [p = 0.002]. No significant differences regarding the postoperative subjective symptoms of airway were found.

Conclusions

Videolaryngoscopy using the GlideScope®-Titanium shortly prolongs DLT intubation duration compared to direct laryngoscopy but improves the view. Objective intubation trauma but not subjective complaints are reduced.

### Comparison of the effect of double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers on lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153fy5e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis showed that while no differences were observed in the quality of lung collapse, device placement time, or malposition rate between BB and DLT, the incidence of postoperative sore throat with the former was lower than that with the latter.

During the anesthesia for minimally invasive thoracic surgery, lung isolation is mainly realized via BB and DLT. Some RCTs attempted to determine which of the two techniques was superior. A study suggested that the intubation time of BB was longer, while their malposition rate was higher. An observational study that DLT provided better lung collapse and had a lower associated malposition rate, making it the safest choice. Left-DLT (L-DLT) was found to be the primary choice device for OLV also in the case of predicted or unpredicted difficult airways. By contrast, another meta-analysis comparing the use of DLT and BB reported that despite a higher malposition rate, the operating time of BB was shorter. Our study showed that there were no significant differences in either the intubation time or the malposition rate between DLT and BB.

Alternatively, the fact that DLT yields a higher risk of airway injury is well established. A study indicated that airway injury was most likely caused by the instrument used. Since DLTs have a larger diameter compared to BBs, they are more likely to damage the airway during intubation and extubation. Another study suggested that airway damage was likely associated with operator skill. Although a different study reported that the higher incidence of airway injury in the intubation of double-lumen endotracheal tubes was possibly related to their high dislocation rate. A meta-analysis found that the incidences of postoperative hoarseness, sore throat, and air injury with double-lumen endotracheal tubes were substantially higher than those with bronchial blockers, indicating scope for improvement in double-lumen endotracheal tubes in the future.

For surgeries involving difficult airways or prolonged thoracic and esophageal surgeries, when postoperative respiratory support is needed, the fact that the endotracheal tube does not need to be replaced when BB are used reduces the risk of secondary airway injury and edema, which makes it superior to DLT. However, DLT play a crucial role in special operations such as pneumonectomy and bronchotomy.

### Nonintubated spontaneous ventilation versus intubated mechanical ventilation anesthesia for video-assisted thoracic surgery in terms of perioperative complications and practitioners' workload assessments: a pilot randomized control study [^112aHdHh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been developed and widely used due to minor trauma and rapid recovery. The uniportal approach is a more minimally invasive form of VATS. Conventional VATS is commonly performed under double-lumen intubated anesthesia with one-lung ventilation as the standard technique. This technique can fully expose the surgical field and perfectly isolate the operative lung, and may also leads to intubation- and mechanical ventilation (MV)-induced injuries.

Nonintubated spontaneous ventilation (NI-SV) anesthesia with a laryngeal mask (LMA) may be a suitable alternative to conventional intubated mechanical ventilation (I-MV) anesthesia with a double-lumen tube (DLT) for VATS in selected patients. Evidence has demonstrated the potential advantages of nonintubated VATS, such as reduced intubation- and MV-related complications, avoidance of postoperative muscle paralysis due to muscle relaxant residues, decreased opioid-related side effects, and enhanced recovery after surgery. However, the advantages and safety of this nonintubated strategy have not been fully confirmed. Thus, at present, the NI-SV strategy has not yet been routinely adopted for VATS, mainly owing to the potential risk of an unsafe airway and the concerns of poor surgical conditions, which emphasize the need for anesthesiologists to be vigilant of the surgical process and to act accordingly for providing the adequate anesthetic conditions.

Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NI-SV anesthesia with an LMA compared to I-MV anesthesia with a DLT in uniportal VATS, with a focus on perioperative complications and practitioners' workload evaluation for both scenarios. Based on the hypothesis that adequate SV and adequate intraoperative anesthetic conditions are fraught with difficulties when administering NI-SV anesthesia for VATS, the occurrence of intraoperative airway intervention events was investigated for both intervention strategies, including conversion to mechanical ventilation or intubation under NI-SV anesthesia and repositioning of the DLT and double-lung ventilation under I-MV anesthesia.

### Clinical evaluation of laryngeal mask airways in video-assisted thoracic surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114wzHPe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Double-lumen tubes (DLTs) and endotracheal tubes (ETTs) combined with endobronchial blockers can achieve reliable and effective lung isolation, which has become the mainstream anesthesia methods for thoracic surgery. However, these two techniques can induce a variety of intubation-related complications, including airway injury, postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, stress-related lung injury, lung infection, and bronchospasm. To address these issues, several surgeons and anesthesiologists have attempted to introduce nontracheal intubation techniques into thoracic surgery airway management. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) has shown broad application prospects in VATS because of its advantages in reducing small respiratory tract injuries and ensuring safe and effective airway control.

LMA anesthesia is a technique for supraglottic airway control using LMA, which has the advantages of less mechanical injury, easy to perform, less postoperative complications, quick recovery and low cost. In addition, use of LMA is associated with reduced perioperative respiratory adverse events (laryngospasm and bronchospasm, etc.) compared with endotracheal tubes in children. LMA involves optimized anesthesia and surgical management, enhanced postoperative recovery and early discharge. Although, the routine use of non-intubated anesthesia in VATS cannot be recommended, LMA still shows a promising prospect in the field of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in VATS. However, the application of LMA in thoracic surgery anesthesia is limited owing to the requirement of one-lung ventilation technique. And prolonged ventilation also results in observed obvious mucosal damage. Moreover, the combination of LMA and endobronchial blockers presents significant challenges for anesthesiologists and airway management. Therefore, in clinical practice, LMA anesthesia may not be recommended for prolonged surgery, and for those less invasive thoracic surgery procedures that are emerging and rapidly spreading around the world, LMA anesthesia may show the predominant advantage.

### Effect of lung isolation with different airway devices on postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a propensity score-matched study [^111EAMFg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an important method for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. Compared with traditional thoracotomy, VATS has the characteristics of less trauma, faster recovery and shorter hospital stay. Although VATS has certain advantages, postoperative pulmonary infection still occurs, which affects the rehabilitation and medical quality of patients. Postoperative pneumonia (POP) is the most common type of pulmonary complications after VATS. The incidence of POP in thoracic surgery is between 6.2% and 31.7%.

Lung isolation techniques are central to anaesthetic management for thoracic surgery. With thoracic surgery entering the minimally invasive era of accelerated rehabilitation, the indications and tools of lung isolation technology are constantly changing. The commonly used lung isolation techniques in clinical practice include double-lumen endobronchial intubation, tracheal tube combined with bronchial blocker, and the emerging lung isolation technique in recent years: laryngeal mask combined with bronchial blocker.

In VATS, laryngeal mask combined with bronchial blocker, as an emerging technology, is superior to double-lumen endobronchial tube in postoperative sore throat, hoarseness and airway injury. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on postoperative pulmonary complications. A current study has found that in non-cardiothoracic surgery, different airway devices have different effects on the impact on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients. Compared with tracheal intubation, patients using laryngeal mask have fewer postoperative pulmonary complications. Therefore, this study retrospectively explored the effect of different intubation lung isolation methods on POP in patients undergoing VATS using propensity score matching (PSM) method.

Interventions

After institutional review board approval, patients were randomized prior to surgery to either DLT or VDLT usage. Attending anesthesiologists placed the Mallinckrodt DLT or Vivasight (ET View Ltd, Misgav, Israel) VDLT with conventional laryngoscopy or video laryngoscopy then verified correct tube position through the view provided with either VDLT external monitor or FOB.

Measurements and Main Results

Data collected included: sex, body mass index, successful intubation and endobronchial placement, intubation time, confirmation time of tube position, FOB use, quality of view, dislodgement of tube, and ability to forewarn dislodgement of endobronchial cuff and complications. FOB use for verification of final position of the tube (VDLT 13.2% [5/38] v DLT 100% [42/42], p < 0.0001), need for FOB to correct the dislodgement (VDLT 7.7% [1/13] v DLT 100% [14/14], p < 0.0001), dislodgement during positioning (VDLT 61.5% [8/13] v DLT 64.3% [9/14], p = ns), dislodgement during surgery (VDLT 38.5% [5/13] v DLT 21.4% [3/14], p = ns), and ability to forewarn dislodgement of endobronchial cuff (VDLT 18.4% [7/38] v DLT 4.8% [2/42], p = 0.078).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated a reduction of 86.8% in FOB use, which was a similar reduction found in other published studies.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery program focusing on chest tube management improves surgical recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^115tcV9g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

The study population consisted of 60 patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after implementation of ERAS program (performed 2022 and December 2022) and another group of 60 patients undergoing VATS before implementation of ERAS program (performed 2021 and December 2021). Inclusion criteria were: (i) the VATS was performed under general anesthesia with double lumen intubation; (ii) clinical stage I to IIIB NSCLC; (iii) single peripheral mass less than 4 cm, without tumor invasion of the chest wall or great vessels; (iv) the VATS was performed by the same pool of surgeons in the year; iv) no distant metastasis, confirmed by preoperative examination; and (v) aged ≥ 18 years. Exclusion criteria were (i) N2 or N3 clinical nodal involvement of disease; (ii) induction chemotherapy or neoadjuvant therapies before surgery; (iii) conversion to thoracotomy; (iv) previous history of thoracic surgery (any type) or chest trauma; or (v) severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, or interstitial lung disease.

Surgical methods

Patients of two groups had an only difference that their postoperative management followed the ERAS program. If the patients had diabetes, their glucose levels were maintained at a mild elevation. If the patients had hypotension, their blood pressure were maintained 160/100 mmHg or below. All patients received double-lumen endotracheal intubation with single-lung ventilation in the lateral position on the healthy side and underwent uniportal VATS. An incision with a length of 3–5 cm was made, and the camera was placed on the upper edge of the incision. The intrathoracic tissues were dissociated and the lymph nodes were dissected. One chest tube was placed through the camera port after lobectomy. The chest tube was adjusted with side holes made between the diaphragm and the lung lobe to drain pleural effusion. After surgery, all patients were given multimodal analgesia.

### Bronchial blocker versus left double-lumen endotracheal tube for one-lung ventilation in right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^112TnJY1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the quality of lung deflation of a left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) with a bronchial blocker (BB) for one-lung ventilation in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).

Design

A prospective, randomized, clinical study.

Setting

A university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Participants

Forty-five adult patients undergoing esophageal tumor surgery using VATS with right lung deflation.

Interventions

Patients were assigned by a computer-generated randomization sequence to either the left-sided DLT or BB group. The correct positioning of the airway device was confirmed using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

Measurements and Main Results

The variables assessed included: (1) time required to correctly place the devices and to achieve lung collapse; (2) the number of times the device malpositioned; (3) the quality of lung deflation as rated by the surgeon; (4) blood pressure and heart rate at baseline (T 1), immediately before (T 2) and after (T 3) and 1 minute (T 4) after intubation; (5) the number of patients with hypoxemia (SpO 2 < 90%) during the one-lung ventilation (OLV) period; and (6) postoperative hoarseness of voice, sore throat, or pulmonary infection. Of the 45 patients approached for the study, 21 patients in the DLT group and 19 patients in the BB group were analyzed. The time required to place the device in the correct position was similar between the 2 groups. The time to achieve right lung collapse in the BB group was significantly longer (mean difference: 3.232, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.993–4.471; p = 0.003). The quality of lung collapse, OLV duration, number of patients with device malposition, and hypoxemia in both groups were similar. There were more patients suffering hoarseness (odds ratio [OR]: 4.85, 95% CI: 1.08–21.76; p = 0.034) or sore throat (OR: 4.29, 95% CI: 1.14–16.18; p = 0.030) in the DLT group, while no patients developed postoperative lung infection in either group. Compared to T 1, systolic blood pressure (sBP), diastolic BP (dBP), and heart rate (HR) at T 2 in both groups were higher (p < 0.05) in the DLT group. Then, compared to T 2, sBP and dBP at T 3 and T 4 and HR at T 3 in the DLT group were higher (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The results of this study showed that BB is an effective alternative for left one-lung ventilation in right VATS, but requires a longer time to achieve complete lung collapse. Moreover, the use of BB caused less hemodynamic perturbation and can reduce postoperative hoarseness and sore throat.

### Efficiency and safety of double-lumen bronchial tube and bronchial blocker for one-lung ventilation in patients with thoracic surgery: a meta-analysis [^112UZFf8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The DLBT is one of the most frequently used devices for OLV and is considered the gold standard in airway management for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Its design facilitates independent ventilation of each lung, enabling rapid achievement of OLV, which is particularly beneficial during surgeries such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Compared to the BB, the DLBT offers the advantage of allowing direct bronchoscopy and is relatively cost-effective. However, DLBT also has notable drawbacks and presents certain risks and challenges, including difficulties with repositioning the tube following displacement, as well as extended positioning times. Furthermore, complications associated with DLBT, such as bronchial mucosal injury, hoarseness, and vocal cord damage, occur more frequently than with the BB. The BB, a more recent development, is another effective tool for achieving lung isolation in VATS. It offers advantages over the DLBT, such as enabling selective pulmonary lobe isolation and improving the management of intraoperative hypoxemia. Some studies have shown that the BB can reduce peak airway pressure, minimize damage to airway mucosa and small airways, and preserve the ventilation to perfusion ratio (V/Q). Moreover, its precise placement can be guided using a fiberoptic bronchoscope, reducing the risk of tracheal mucosal injury. Despite these benefits, the BB has some limitations, including potential increases in airway pressure due to malocclusion of the main bronchus, which can negatively affect respiratory function. Additionally, in settings where fiberoptic bronchoscopes are unavailable, BB remains a contingency option for lung isolation, particularly when DLBT are contraindicated or emergent isolation is required. Nevertheless, the catheterization failure rate and the risk of complications are significantly increased. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy and safety of DLBT and BB for OLV in patients with VATS, but the results have been inconsistent.

Currently, no large-scale, multicenter RCTs or high-quality evidence directly comparing the efficiency and safety of OLV techniques in thoracic surgery are available. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the DLBT and BB in VATS procedures with OLV by systematically reviewing the literature and integrating relevant data to assess their respective efficiency and safety profiles.

Patients and surgical procedure

Before surgery, all patients underwent routine preoperative tests, revealing no contraindications for the surgical procedures. Surgeries were performed under combined intravenous and inhalation anesthesia, utilizing double-lumen tracheal intubation and selective one-lung ventilation. Patients were positioned in the lateral decubitus position for surgery. The perioperative pain management protocol was the same for both groups.

### A method for addressing right upper lobe obstruction with right-sided double-lumen endobronchial tubes during surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1118262U]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The use of a R-DLT is related to a high risk of right upper lobe obstruction and collapse. However, there are also some absolute indications for using a R-DLT, such as for treating left endobronchial tumors, disruption of the left mainstem bronchus, left lung transplantation, sleeve resection, left-sided pneumonectomy, and left bronchial compression of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Due to the uncertainty in surgical procedures and patient conditions, a R-DLT is initially preferred for left-sided thoracic surgery in a number of clinical institutions. To the best of our knowledge, only a few case reports have described attempts at right bronchial intubation using a left-sided double-lumen tube. There are no previous prospective investigations that evaluated the efficiency and safety of repositioning a R-DLT from the right main bronchus into the left main bronchus with patients in the lateral position during surgery. Therefore, we designed a study to assess the efficiency and safety of this bronchial intubation technique.

The procedure for placement of a R-DLT in the left mainstem bronchus was rated as being easier and faster than that for placement in the right mainstem bronchus, mainly because R-DLT placement requires proper positioning of the R-DLT, with the ventilation slot opening directly into the bronchial orifice of the right upper lobe. Placement of R-DLTs is easy in most patients but can be troublesome in a subset of patients. After successful bronchial intubation when in the dorsal decubitus position, some patients are moved into the right lateral decubitus position, with R-DLT malpositioning detected via FOB, indicating a lack of alignment between the right upper lobe R-DLT ventilation slot and the origin of the right upper bronchus. It is sometimes not possible to replace a R-DLT correctly despite many attempts, and multiple attempts may cause serious airway damage. At the same time, subsequent operative procedures may not require a R-DLT. In these situations, the use of a R-DLT would still provide adequate surgical conditions if the R-DLT is repositioned into the left main bronchus.

### Video double-lumen tube for one lung ventilation: implementation and experience in 343 cases of routine clinical use during the first 20 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^116hmM2i]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DLTs are representing the preferred device for intraoperative one lung ventilation in thoracic surgery. Initially insufficient positioning occurs in 4.2–39% of cases. Auscultation alone is not sufficient to check the correct position and a bronchoscopic confirmation is required both after intubation and following transfer into side position. Seo and colleagues identified choosing too small sizes of DLTs as a predictor for incorrect positioning of a left-sided DLT into the right main bronchus, in addition to a short and tiny stature and female gender. Due to a potentially limited lung function, fast and correct placement of the DLT has top priority in thoracic surgery patients. Incorrect positioning therefore bears an immediate and high risk of hypoxia. In cDLTs, bronchoscopy is required to confirm and correct position of the tube. Both deterioration in oxygenation during repositioning and aerosol generation with subsequent contamination of staff are important risks. Numerous medical societies and clinical institutions recommendations and checklists deal with staff exposure avoidance by minimizing aerosolization and reducing the time of an unprotected airway. Practical implementation resulted in various protective aids as aerosol boxes, protective barriers like covers for bronchoscopes in order to minimize the spread of aerosols.

In order to reduce routine fiberoptic bronchoscopic exam to ensure optimal position the Ambu® VivaSight™ vDLT represents an alternative to the use of a cDLT.

During the retrospective period, 77.4% of all DLT devices used were vDLTs. A possibly overt bias occurred regarding the type of surgery. In neoplasm surgery, vDLT was used more often than in small interventions like trauma surgery with presumably younger patients. This might explain the significantly larger proportion of elderly patients and longer perioperative times in the vDLT group. Due to the retrospective study approach, no causal explanation of this distribution is possible. One can speculate, that anesthesiologists might considered the relatively new vDLT procedure as more time-consuming and not worth for minor intervention.

### Comparison of the effect of double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers on lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136tW5m]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Literature selection and characteristics

A total of five 5 eligible RCTs were identified, involving 223 surgical patients. The characteristics of patients and the adopted intervention measures are listed in Table 1. All five RCTs compared the clinical safety of DLT and BB.

Quality of lung collapse

Four RCTs (n = 164) reported the quality of lung collapse, which was evaluated as either excellent, fair, or poor. There was no difference in the quality of lung collapse between the use of a DLT or BB in patients undergoing minimally invasive thoracic surgery (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.58; I² = 0%; P = 0.97) (Fig. 3). Implementing sensitivity analyses and Egger tests for publication bias did not significantly alter these results (P = 0.919).

Forest plot showing the quality of lung collapse between DLT and BB.

Device malposition rate

Four RCTs (n = 189) recorded incidences of dislocation during lung isolation. No differences in the malposition rate were observed when either DLT or BB were utilized (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.37 to 2.06; I² = 0%; P = 0.77) (Fig. 4). Implementing sensitivity analyses and Egger tests for publication bias did not significantly alter these results (P = 0.133).

Time for device placement

Four RCTs (n = 185) recorded the time required for placing the two devices. The time required to place the device in the correct position was not significantly different (RR, 0.06; 95% CI, -1.02 to 1.14; I² = 79%; P = 0.91) (Fig. 5). Implementing sensitivity analyses and Egger tests for publication bias did not significantly alter these results (P = 0.978).

### Double lumen endobronchial tube intubation: lessons learned from anatomy [^112ZgdY4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimal outcomes in thoracic surgery depend on minimizing unnecessary lung trauma. One key piece of equipment used to improve outcomes during intra-thoracic operations is the double lumen endobronchial tube (DLT), which provides the ability to employ single lung ventilation strategies. Double lumen tubes are larger and more complex than single lumen endotracheal tubes and because of this necessitate specific techniques for placement. Even with significant operator experience, placement of these tubes can be challenging. The difficulty of double lumen endobronchial tube placement has led to a myriad of reports describing techniques using various adjuncts such as bronchoscopy, ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, introducers/bougies, and video laryngoscopy, to facilitate placement of these devices. Furthermore, video-equipped double lumen tubes themselves have been developed with arguable benefits. Published reports have correlated tracheobronchial diameter, bronchial angulations, and aberrant anatomy to degree of difficulty of DLT placement. Passage of the DLT through the vocal cords and subglottic airway, which may be the most challenging part of DLT insertion, has not been thoroughly studied, and can in particularly difficult circumstances lead to airway injury. In fact, such an airway injury was a major impetus for this specific study. Over a decade ago clinicians published a correspondence that described a 180 degree rotation of the DLT during glottic insertion when utilizing video laryngoscopy. We adopted this technique and observed over the following decade that indeed rotating the DLT 180 degrees before passing the vocal cords and subglottis dramatically eases insertion of the DLT, during both direct and indirect video laryngoscopy. The goal of this study is to describe the anatomic and DLT factors that contribute to this clinical observation. We believe that a better understanding of the interaction between the upper airway anatomy and the configured angles of a DLT would enable better recognition of DLT insertion challenges and speed up adoption of this superior DLT placement technique.

### A modified technique to improve the outcome of intubation with a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube [^117M8qzh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of a video-assisted laryngoscope (VL) has been shown to reduce the time to achieve intubation with a double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT). As the blade of the VL is curved differently to a standard laryngoscope, the DLT must be angled into a hockey stick shape to fit properly. We conducted a study to establish which direction of angulation was best to facilitate correct positioning of the DLT when using a VL.

Methods

We enrolled patients scheduled for thoracic surgery who required intubation with a DLT. They were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: those intubated with a DLT angled to conceal the tracheal orifice (the tracheal orifice-covered, TOC) group or the tracheal orifice-exposed (TOE) group. The composite primary outcome measures were time taken to intubate and the frequency of first-time success. The time taken to intubate was divided into: T1, the time from mouth opening to visualization of the vocal cords with the VL; and T2, the time taken to advance the DLT through the cords until its tip lay within the trachea and three carbon dioxide waveforms had been detected by capnography. The hemodynamic responses to intubation and intubation-related adverse events were also recorded.

Results

Sixty-six patients completed the study, with 33 in each group. Total intubation time was significantly shorter in the TOC group (mean 30.6 ± standard deviation 2.7 seconds versus 38.7 ± 3.3 seconds, p < 0.0001). T2 was also significantly shorter in the TOC group than the TOE group (27.2 ± 2.5 seconds versus 34.9 ± 3.0 seconds, p < 0.0001). The severity of hoarseness on the first postoperative day and sore throat on the fourth postoperative day were significantly lower in the TOC group than the TOE group (p = 0.02 and < 0.0001, respectively). The hemodynamic responses to intubation were broadly similar between the groups.

Conclusion

When placing a left-sided DLT using a VL, angling the bronchial lumen to a hockey stick shape that conceals the tracheal lumen saves time and ameliorates the severity of post-intubation complications.

### The effects of video double-lumen tubes on intubation complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: a randomised controlled study [^116hBGr7]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tracheal injuries, vocal cord injuries, sore throat and hoarseness are common complications of tracheal intubation that affect the postoperative recovery of patients and reduce their postoperative satisfaction. – Double-lumen tubes (DLTs) have the advantages of a relatively stable tube position and a great effect on lung collapse, and are often used for lung isolation under thoracic anaesthesia. However, compared with single-lumen tubes, the DLT is made of more rigid material and has a large outer diameter and airway injuries were more obvious when DLT was used for lung isolation, and the incidence of sore throat and hoarseness after surgery was higher. – Therefore, more attention should be given to intubation complications caused by DLTs.

With the development of visualisation technology, video double-lumen tubes (VDLTs) are gradually being used for lung isolation. The VDLT (Weili Medical Instrument Ltd, Guangdong, China) has an embedded camera and a light source between the tracheal and bronchial cuffs (Fig. 1 a). The display screen is externally connected to achieve continuous airway visualisation (Fig. 1 b). The VDLT can make intubation more precise and avoid unnecessary stimulation caused by blind insertion and repeated positioning, which may reduce the risk of airway injuries. However, because of the installation of a camera, the outer diameter of the main tracheal cuff (the thickest part of the tube) of the VDLT is thicker than that of the corresponding part of the same size as the DLT, which increases the potential risk of airway injuries. There are few studies on the effect of VDLT intubation on airway injury. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of VDLT on intubation complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.

### Single lumen endotracheal intubation with carbon dioxide insufflation for lung isolation in thoracic surgery [^1168TW6J]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Double lumen tube (DLT) intubation is used for lung isolation but is not without disadvantages including increased intubation time, anesthesia expertise, risk of airway trauma, and costs over single lumen tube (SLT) intubation. SLT intubation with CO 2 insufflation can be used as an alternative for lung isolation. We reviewed our experience with this technique during thoracoscopic surgery.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained IRB-approved database from 2009 to 2018. Operations were performed with CO 2 insufflation up to 15 mmHg. Indications for surgery, operative details, intraoperative complications, pathology, and postoperative complications were reviewed.

Results

We identified 123 patients (70 females [57%]) with a median age of 40 years (range 16–80 years) and a median BMI of 26.2 kg/m 2 (range 15–59 kg/m 2) that underwent minimally invasive thoracoscopic procedures with this technique. Procedures included: mediastinal mass resection or biopsy (41%), sympathectomy (37%), wedge resection (10%), first rib resection (6%), diaphragm plication (2%), segmentectomy (2%), decortication (2%), pleural biopsy (2%), and pericardial cyst resection (1%). Median operative time was 90 min (range 25–584 min) and median intraoperative blood loss was 10 mL (range 2–200 mL). Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were obtained at procedure start, 1 h after CO 2 insufflation, and at procedure completion: we observed significant changes in heart rate and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.027 and P < 0.001, respectively) although clinically inconsequential. Mean end-tidal CO 2 1 h after insufflation was 36.6 ± 4.5 mmHg. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to a DLT. Median length of stay was 1 day (range 0–14 days). Five complications (4%) were observed and no mortalities.

Conclusions

SLT intubation and CO 2 insufflation is a feasible and safe alternative to DLT intubation for lung isolation. This can be a useful strategy to accomplish lung isolation for some thoracoscopic procedures, in particular when expertise for DLT placement is unavailable.

### Simultaneous bilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery is safe and feasible for multiple primary lung cancers [^115cbJFu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgery

The selection of the surgical approach was made by a panel of principal surgeons who were not involved in this study. The choice of surgical procedure for each case was guided by a comprehensive assessment of tumor features, such as size, location, the proportion of ground-glass opacity, and the likelihood of malignancy, as well as patient factors including age, general health status, and pulmonary function. Patient preferences were also considered in the decision-making process. Lesions deemed not to be malignant were excluded from the surgical resection plan.

All patients received general anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation. Various minimally invasive surgical approaches were used, including uni-portal, bi-portal, and three-portal, mainly depending on the complexity of the surgery. VATS lobectomy, segmentectomy resection, wedge resection and lymph node dissection were conducted according to the NCCN guidelines. Sublobar resection, which included both wedge resection and segmentectomy, was chosen for nodules that were 2 cm or smaller and met at least one of the following conditions: adenocarcinoma in situ, ground-glass opacity (GGO) exceeding 50%, or a nodule doubling time of 400 days or more. In the case of sublobar resections, a stapling device was utilized to separate the intersegmental plane. Lobectomy generally involved systematic lymph node dissection, whereas sublobar resection often involved systematic lymph node sampling. For simultaneous bilateral surgery, the patients were turned to their opposite side and re-sterilized after the first-side operation was finished.

Perioperative management

Prior to surgery, the patients were instructed to cease smoking and alcohol consumption, and given pulmonary function training. The patients could resume oral fluid intake six hours after surgery, followed by a normal diet. Early mobilization was encouraged. For postoperative pain management, we routinely prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the first line of analgesia. We adopted a stepwise escalation as needed based on the patient's reported pain levels. In cases where patients had special pain management requirements, the anesthesiologist would initiate patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) immediately postoperatively. The anesthesiologist would then make daily visits to the patient's bedside to assess the patient's condition and determine the optimal time to discontinue the PCA.

A bedside chest radiograph was performed on day 1 post-operation to evaluate lung retention and chest drainage status. The chest tube was removed when chest drainage was less than 200 ml/d and no obvious air leak or chylothorax was detected. Patients without obvious pneumothorax and pleural effusion were considered for discharge.

### A method for addressing right upper lobe obstruction with right-sided double-lumen endobronchial tubes during surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1137nmpz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, repositioning R-DLTs from the right main bronchus into the left main bronchus showed good clinical performance without causing additional injury with patients in the lateral position during surgery. Thus, this approach may offer a solution to right upper lobe occlusion by a R-DLT during surgery.

### Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: state of the art [^116JbkdX]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax remains a significant health problem. However, with time, there have been improvements in pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures and both medical and surgical approaches to treatment. Owing to better imaging techniques, it is now clear that there is almost no normal visceral pleura in the case of spontaneous pneumothorax, and that blebs and bullae are not always the cause of pneumothorax. In first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation and simple aspiration are established first-line therapies, as proven by randomised controlled trials. Aspiration should be better promoted in daily medical practice. In the case of recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, simple talc poudrage under thoracoscopy has been shown to be safe, cost-effective and no more painful than a conservative treatment using a chest tube. There are also new experimental data showing that talc poudrage, as used in Europe, does not lead to serious side-effects and is currently the best available pleural sclerosing agent. Alternatively, surgical techniques have considerably improved, and are now less invasive, especially due to the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Studies suggest that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be more cost-effective than chest tube drainage in spontaneous pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage, although it is more expensive than simple thoracoscopy and requires general anaesthesia, double-lumen tube intubation and ventilation. Recommendations are made regarding the treatment of pneumothorax. In secondary or complicated primary pneumothorax, i.e. recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, some diffuse treatment of the visceral pleura should be offered, either by talc poudrage under thoracoscopy or by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Moreover, all of these new techniques should be better standardised to permit comparison in randomised controlled studies.

### Awake thoracic surgery for lung cancer treatment: where we are and future perspectives-our experience and review of literature [^1172HFYX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed that lung resection for NSCLC in non-intubated, deeply sedated, patients could be a feasible alternative to VATS interventions performed in patients ventilated with a double-lumen orotracheal tube and with the one-lung ventilation technique. Awake VATS lung resections could be performed with a low risk of conversion to open thoracotomy and with a low risk of conversion to GA, improving the post-operative course of the patient, reducing the post-operative pain and the fasting post-operative time. However, future prospective randomized trial must be performed a better comparison between non-intubated and intubated vats lung resections, especially lobectomies, for more accurate oncological outcomes.

### Perioperative outcomes of non-intubated versus intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in different thoracic procedures: a propensity score-matched analysis [^113vtkwy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Other results showed that the overall anesthetic induction and operative times did not differ between the NIVATS and IVATS groups. However, the values in this study were still lower than those in others. These findings might be attributed to the non-routine use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy to validate DLT position and the difference in surgical procedure.

Sore throat is a cause of concern as it affects patient satisfaction after anesthesia. A previous study showed that about 10%–43.3% of patients who were intubated using the double-lumen tube up to 24 h after surgery presented with sore throat. Another research revealed that the incidence of sore throat was high at 57.5% even in single-lumen intubation. Our study showed that such an event was significantly correlated with the intubation technique.

In the era of Enhance Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program, the non-intubated technique could promote ERAS program based on our study. The NIVATS group had a lower volume of intraoperative blood loss and a shorter length of hospital stay than the IVATS group. Moreover, none of the patients in the NIVATS group presented with sore throat. In terms of other anesthetic complications, the NIVATS group had a higher proportion of patients who experienced nausea and vomiting caused by anesthesia than the IVATS group. However, the results did not significantly differ. Thus, prophylactic treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting should be included in the standard protocol.

In our study, the incidence of atelectasis confirmed on chest radiography was low. However, this finding was in contrast with that of the study of Lan and coworkers, and the difference may be associated with the type of surgery. The current research included different types of pulmonary resection procedures, and other studies focused on lobectomy alone.

One hundred eighty-two patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation were randomised into two groups: 90 in the DLT group and 92 in the VDLT group.

Intervention

VDLT was selected for intubation in the VDLT group, and DLT was selected for intubation in the DLT group. A fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to record tracheal and vocal cord injuries.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes were the incidence of moderate-to-severe tracheal injury and the incidence of vocal cord injury. The secondary outcomes included the incidence and severity of postoperative 24 and 48h sore throat and hoarseness.

Results

The incidence of moderate-to-severe tracheal injury was 32/90 (35.6%) in the DLT group, and 45/92 (48.9%) in the VDLT group (P = 0.077; relative risk 1.38, 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.95). The incidence of vocal cord injury was 31/90 (34.4%) and 34/92 (37%) in the DLT and VDLT groups, respectively (P = 0.449). The incidence of postoperative 24h sore throat and hoarseness was significantly higher in the VDLT group than in the DLT group (for sore throat: P = 0.032, relative risk 1.63, 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.57; for hoarseness: P = 0.018, relative risk 1.48, 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.06).

Conclusion

There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of moderate-to-severe tracheal injury and vocal cord injury between DLTs and VDLTs. While improving the first-attempt success rate, intubation with VDLT increased the incidence of postoperative 24h sore throat and hoarseness.

### The effects of video double-lumen tubes on intubation complications in patients undergoing thoracic surgery: a randomised controlled study [^112jt7dH]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The level of tracheal injury differed between the two groups. The incidence of the level of main tracheal injuries in the VDLT group was higher than that in the DLT group, which may be related to the larger outer diameter of the VDLT. The incidence of injury at the bronchial level was lower in the VDLT group than in the DLT group. The reason may be that, with the help of the continuous visual characteristics of the VDLT, the tube stopped immediately when it entered the appropriate position, avoiding injury caused by repeated adjustment due to a poor position of the tube.

In addition, this study found that the incidence of postoperative 24 h sore throat and hoarseness was higher in the VDLT group than in the DLT group. This may be related to the larger diameter and harder quality of the VDLT. This suggests that intubation with VDLT may result in more adverse patient experiences on the day after surgery. In the future, we need to explore more ways to alleviate the adverse experiences of patients. However, the incidence of sore throat and hoarseness in the two groups was similar and lower at postoperative 48 h. It has been suggested that the use of VDLT intubation causes more sore throats and hoarseness, which last for a shorter time and are easy to resolve. There were no serious complications such as tracheal rupture or mucosal laceration in either group.

### Videolaryngoscopy is associated with a lower rate of double-lumen endotracheal tube malposition in thoracic surgery procedures, retrospective single-center study [^113ZJA24]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstarct

BACKGROUND: The optimal positioned double-lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT) is crucial in thoracic surgery requiring lung isolation. This study aims to compare the accuracy and complication rates of DLT placement using videolaryngoscopy (VL) versus conventional direct laryngoscopy (DL).

Methods

This retrospective single-center study included 89 patients who underwent thoracic surgery with DLT placement between July 2023 and May 2024. Patients were divided into two groups: VL (n = 45) and DL (n = 44). Patient characteristics, intubation times, malposition rates, and complications were recorded. DLT position was confirmed using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

Results

The incidence of DLT malposition was significantly lower in the VL group (13.3%) compared to the DL group (31.8%) (p = 0.037). The overall complication rate was also lower in the VL group (4.4%) compared to the DL group (11.4%) (p = 0.024). The mean time from anesthesia induction to the first incision was shorter in the VL group (25.2 ± 6.1 min) than in the DL group (28.3 ± 6.5 min) (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

VL significantly reduces the incidence of DLT malposition and associated complications in thoracic surgery compared to DL. The improved visualization and multiple blade options of the C-MAC videolaryngoscopy set likely contribute to these findings. Further research is warranted to confirm these results in larger, multicenter studies.

### Unexpected difficult extubation of double lumen bronchial intubation: a case report [^117RQq6A]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The anesthetist and other members of the perioperative team need to be extremely cautious for successful completion of any surgery. If the final step of any general anesthetic-extubation is not sufficiently well planned, it can lead to critical airway incidents during the extubation and hinder transportation of the patient to the post-anesthesia care unit.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old female underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) combined with left lower lobectomy. The distal end of the left branch of the tracheal tube was lodged by surgical sutures. In this case, the respiratory physician burned the sutures using an argon electrode, after discussion with the thoracic surgery experts.

Conclusions

Teamwork is essential when caring for a patient with a shared airway. The anesthetist and surgeon must communicate well with each other to achieve optimal surgical outcomes. Importantly, testing the patency of the ETT prior to extubation should be a regular procedure, which is practical significance to guide safe extubation.

### Italian survey on non-intubated thoracic surgery: results from INFINITY group [^1146hfoE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To reduce anesthetic and surgical techniques' invasiveness, increasing their effectiveness and safety is the aim of new advances in thoracic surgery. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique employed to diagnose and treat a variety of chest pathological conditions. Recently, its use and the increased use of the uniportal approach, promoted the possibility of avoiding general anesthesia (GA) and orotracheal intubation (OTI). Consequently, many thoracic surgical procedures such as Robot-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (RATS) and VATS lobectomy, VATS metastasectomy, segmentectomy, pneumothorax surgery, interstitial lung disease biopsies, endoscopic thymectomy and minimally invasive esophagectomy have been pursued without GA, by using locoregional techniques.

Although the intubated thoracoscopic surgery provides some advantages such as a guaranteed airway, a quiet and secure operating field, and a precise fraction of inspired oxygen, however, it is associated with intubation-related complications, such as residual neuromuscular blockade, and multiple effects on the respiratory system such as OTI related damages, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Non-intubated technique in VATS procedures allows conducting surgeries through the use of regional anesthesia without GA, thus maintaining spontaneous breathing. During Non-Intubated Thoracic Surgery (NITS), iatrogenic pneumothorax provides lung isolation without needing a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker.

Among the potential advantages of NITS are a lower incidence of intubation- and ventilation-related injuries, avoiding muscle relaxants and their potiental residual effects, reducing opioid use thus decreasing postoperative nausea and vomiting, other drug-related complications 10, and lower operative morbidity.

In addition, it is known that intubated thoracic surgery results in a high risk of ventilator dependence, and difficult weaning in patients with myopathy and severe COPD with low FEV1. In contrast to this, NITS offers an option to avoid pathological lung damage by preserving negative inspiratory pressure instead of positive inspiratory pressure.

### Nonintubated spontaneous ventilation versus intubated mechanical ventilation anesthesia for video-assisted thoracic surgery in terms of perioperative complications and practitioners' workload assessments: a pilot randomized control study [^1173vQrq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (NI-VATS) has been increasingly reported to yield favourable outcomes. However, this technology has not been routinely used because its advantages and safety have not been fully confirmed. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of nonintubated spontaneous ventilation (NI-SV) anesthesia compared to intubated mechanical ventilation (I-MV) anesthesia in VATS by evaluating of perioperative complications and practitioners' workloads.

Methods

Patients who underwent uniportal VATS were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive NI-SV or I-MV anesthesia. The primary outcome was the occurrence of intraoperative airway intervention events, including transient MV, conversion to intubation and repositioning of the double-lumen tube. The secondary outcomes included perioperative complications and modified National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) scores from anesthesiologists and surgeons.

Results

Thirty-five patients in each group were enrolled in the intention-to-treat analysis. The incidence of intraoperative airway intervention events was greater in the NI-SV group than in the I-MV group (12 [34.3%] vs. 3 [8.6%]; OR = 0.180; 95% CI = 0.045–0.710; p = 0.009). No significant difference was found in the postoperative pulmonary complications between the groups (p > 0.05). The median of the anesthesiologists' overall NASA-TLX score was 37.5 (29–52) when administering the NI-SV, which was greater than the 25 (19–34.5) when the I-MV was administered (p < 0.001). The surgeons' overall NASA-TLX score was comparable between the two ventilation strategies (28 [21–38.5] vs. 27 [20.5–38.5], p = 0.814).

Conclusion

The NI-SV anesthesia was feasible for VATS in the selected patients, with a greater incidence of intraoperative airway intervention events than I-MV anesthesia, and with more surgical effort required by anesthesiologists.

### Thoracic surgery in the non-intubated spontaneously breathing patient [^1168S4CR]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/background

With the introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the early 1990s, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) under general anaesthesia (GA) with one-lung ventilation (OLV) advanced to become the standard procedure in lung surgery. Due to the use of a double lumen tube (DLT) and positive pressure ventilation, OLV can be associated with intubation-related airway trauma and barotrauma of the lung which can lead to severe long-term damage to the lung parenchyma. This can be avoided by employing thoracic surgery procedures performed in non-intubated, spontaneously breathing patients (NIVATS).

Pompeo et al. demonstrated that awake thoracoscopic resections of pulmonary nodules are feasible and as safe as surgery under GA with OLV.

Numerous terms have been used to describe video-assisted thoracic procedures in awake patients such as non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS), awake video-assisted thoracic surgery (AVATS), non-intubated thoracic surgery (NITS), monitored anaesthesia care thoracic surgery (MACTS), awake thoracic surgery (ATS), spontaneous-ventilation video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SV-VATS) or "tubeless".

They all have in common, that the surgical procedure is performed on a non-intubated spontaneously breathing and usually sedated patient in combination with a locoregional anaesthetic technique but have also been performed on awake patients without sedation. In recent years, the NIVATS technic has become more and more established in Europe, so that now not only small minimal invasive procedures but also large minimal invasive surgeries are performed. In surveys conducted in Europe among members of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS), 62 of 105 thoracic surgeons (59%) and 42% of thoracic surgeons in the German Society of Thoracic Surgery (DGT) reported performing non-intubated thoracic procedures, particularly in patients with poor cardiopulmonary function or for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease.

### Lung isolation in the patient with a difficult airway [^116yGZJ5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

One-lung ventilation is routinely used to facilitate exposure for thoracic surgical procedures and can be achieved via several lung isolation techniques. The optimal method for lung isolation depends on a number of factors that include (1) the indication for lung isolation, (2) anatomic features of the upper and lower airway, (3) availability of equipment and devices, and (4) the anesthesiologist's proficiency and preferences. Though double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLTs) are most commonly utilized to achieve lung isolation, the use of endobronchial blockers offer advantages in patients with challenging airway anatomy. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with existing alternatives to the DLT for lung isolation and alternative techniques for DLT placement in the patient with a difficult airway. Newer technologies such as videolaryngoscopy with or without adjunctive fiberoptic bronchoscopy may facilitate intubation and lung isolation in difficult airway management.

### Airway management of the right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after left pneumonectomy by an adapted double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT): a case report [^113u743Q]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Contralateral lung resection in postpneumonectomy patient is rare due to its significant perioperative mortality. Thus, the experience in ventilation and isolation for this kind of operation is very limited. Double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) has been widely used in thoracic operations to acquire better surgical fields, and the left-sided DLTs are preferred over the right-sided DLTs, because of easier intubation, positioning and effective bilateral suctioning. In postpneumonectomy patients, lung isolation with DLTs could be tricky due to one lung left only. Bronchial blockers (BB) are recommended in selective lobe blockade, however, BB is not omnipotent in selective lobe blockade, as in this case, selective right upper lobe blockade entails the balloon to be placed in the right upper lobe bronchus, however, the short right upper lobe bronchus and the angle of the right main bronchus and right upper lobe bronchus would make the placement even more difficult. We have obtained the approval from the Research Ethics Committee and a written patient consent for this report to be published.

### Unexpected difficult extubation of double lumen bronchial intubation: a case report [^116qW2zb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, chest computed tomography (CT) has become a routine screening method for most admitted patients, which has caused increasing number of lung nodules to be discovered. With advances in endoscopic, robotic and endovascular techniques, VATS can be performed in a minimally invasive way for managing most pulmonary, pleural and mediastinal diseases. Thoracoscopic pulmonary nodule resection represents the most effective and suitable treatment for pulmonary nodules, and can provide essential histopathological information for definitive diagnosis, staging, and primary treatment. Anesthetic management is essential for successful surgical management. Most thoracoscopic surgeries are performed under general anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal intubation. Extubation is an essential procedure in anesthesia and critical care medicine. Adverse events at the time of extubation account for a significant proportion of airway management-related serious adverse events. Herein, we presented the case report of a patient whose extubation management was especially challenging.

### Evaluation of a new double-lumen endobronchial tube with an integrated camera (vivaSight-DL (™)): a prospective multicentre observational study [^114Z5g9c]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The VivaSight-DL(™) is a new single-use double-lumen endobronchial tube with an integrated camera. We studied this device in 151 consecutive patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery in four different hospitals. Endobronchial intubation was successful in 148 patients (98%) (95% CI 94–99%). Median (IQR [range]) endobronchial intubation time was 59 (47–82 [17–932]) s and lung isolation was successfully achieved in 147 (99%) patients (95% CI 96–99%). A fibreoptic bronchoscope was required to assist endobronchial tube placement in 19 (13%) patients (95% CI 8–19%). Sore throat was reported by 37 (25%) patients (95% CI 18–33%), but no major complications were observed. We have reported the successful use of the VivaSight double-lumen tube for endobronchial intubation in a multicentre observational trial.

### A visual laryngoscope combined with a fiberoptic bronchoscope improves intubation outcomes in patients with predicted difficult airways in thoracic surgery [^116T2YHZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

With the continuous progress of thoracoscopic surgery, double-lumen bronchial intubation has become more widely used in clinical practice. Compared with single-lumen catheters, double-lumen bronchial catheters inherently face greater challenges during intubation, especially for patients with complex airway conditions, making their intubation much more difficult. Repeated attempts at intubation may lead to more serious complications, such as laryngeal discomfort, hoarseness, bleeding, and airway injury. Therefore, the use of visualization techniques is particularly important in anesthetic intubation. Improvements in video equipment, such as video laryngoscopes and fiberoptic bronchoscopes, have allowed anesthesiologists to develop new techniques to manage patients with difficult tracheal intubations. In their prospective studies, both Mazzinari et al. and Lenhardt et al. compared hybrid techniques with videolaryngoscopy in adult patients with predicted airway difficulties. Compared with the video laryngoscopy group, the combined intubation group presented had higher first-time successful tracheal intubation rates, shorter times to successful intubation, and less airway injury.

### A novel combined approach to placement of a double lumen endobronchial tube using a video laryngoscope and fiberoptic bronchoscope: a retrospective chart review [^113LchVW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study include the small sample size and its retrospective nature. Additionally, there was no defined control group reviewed for comparison. The intubation time was also not systematically recorded, secondary to the retrospective nature of this study, and as such, one cannot comment on whether this technique would affect total intubation time, which may be of clinical significance in patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery who frequently may have diminished pulmonary reserve. Of note, however, there were no reported desaturation events during intubation in the study population. Also, rates of success may vary depending on the type of video laryngoscope used as there has been a proliferation of various manufacturers and designs which may ultimately impact the efficacy of this approach. Finally, we cannot necessarily infer the rate of success of this approach in patients with a known difficult airway or in cases where specific airway indices may impact intubation success in different ways, for example in the setting of limited mouth opening versus limited neck mobility. However, this approach may prove helpful in some of these circumstances. Though this approach was found to aid in the successful placement of a DLT in five patients who were predicted to have potentially difficult airways, it should be noted that none of these patients had airway indices which led to consideration of awake intubation. If, on pre-operative evaluation of a patient, the attending anesthesiologist had deemed the patient's airway indices to be predictive of both difficult ventilation and difficult intubation, then an awake intubation would've been chosen as the preferred strategy in that patient. In that scenario, DLT placement with our technique would likely not have been feasible. As such, this does represent a potential limitation of our technique.

In conclusion, this novel combined approach to placement of a double lumen, endobronchial tube using a video laryngoscope and a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was largely successful with no airway related complications and a high first attempt rate of success. Further prospective research in a larger cohort of patients evaluating this combined technique in comparison to other commonly employed strategies for double lumen, endobronchial tube placement may garner further insights.

### Insertion of the double lumen tube in the difficult airway [^115g8tzQ]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Isolation of a lung and one-lung ventilation are commonly used during thoracic surgery. Insertion of double lumen tubes requires considerable skill and may be especially challenging in the difficult airway. We describe a method of inserting double lumen tubes in two patients with known difficult airways. This technique involves awake nasotracheal intubation followed by insertion of an oral double lumen tube under general anaesthesia.

### Airway management of the right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after left pneumonectomy by an adapted double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT): a case report [^117Vvpjo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung resection after previous contralateral pneumonectomy is rare. We present a case of right anterior segmentectomy despite previous left pneumonectomy, demanding special airway management strategy.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old woman who had left pneumonectomy 2years ago was scheduled to have the right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). A 32-French (Fr) left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) was chosen and adapted. The DLT was intubated into the bronchus intermedius. And the upper lobe can be isolated from the ventilation in the middle and lower lobes when the bronchial cuff's inflated. The perioperative period was uneventful and the pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma.

Conclusion

Lung cancer radical resection was discouraged after previous contralateral pneumonectomy partly due to the challenging ventilation and isolation. With this new DLT adapting and intubation technique showed in this case, the challenging ventilation and isolation that deter the implementation of the operation mentioned above could be solved.

### A visual laryngoscope combined with a fiberoptic bronchoscope improves intubation outcomes in patients with predicted difficult airways in thoracic surgery [^113uF63Y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Difficult airway management remains a challenge in modern anesthesiology. Despite tremendous advances in medical technology, difficult airways still occur, especially in unanticipated situations, and they increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. The airways can be assessed via a variety of techniques. Any single assessment metric has a low rate of positivity, but multivariable scores such as the EL-Ganzouri risk index (EGRI) may be useful for comprehensive airway assessment and choosing an appropriate intubation strategy.

In recent years, there has been a rapid advancement in visualization techniques, as shown by Abdelmalak et al. Intubation via visualization techniques can lead to a much higher success rate of intubation, with visual laryngoscopy and fiberoptic bronchoscopy as the more representative visualization devices. Under anesthesia for thoracic surgery, difficult airways are more common than they are in general surgery patients.

For half a century, double-lumen tube intubation has been the gold standard for achieving pulmonary isolation. Although both double-lumen tubes and bronchial blockers can be used for anesthetic management during thoracic surgery, double-lumen tubes are more widely used for pulmonary isolation because they are faster to insert and less prone to displacement. Furthermore, many thoracic surgical procedures require DLT intubation for absolute protection of the contralateral lung, including potentially life-threatening conditions such as massive pulmonary hemorrhage, septic pneumonia, and bronchopleural fistula. In these cases, the DLT is able to maintain adequate gas exchange and prevent contaminants/blood from polluting/flooding the other lung. Of course, when it is difficult to insert a double-lumen catheter, using a bronchial blocker is a good option, or alternatively, employing a supraglottic device in combination with FOB-guided intubation. For these considerations, we chose to use a double-lumen tube that better meets the needs of most thoracic surgical procedures in order to be applicable to a wider range of predicted difficult airway situations and thus provide broader clinical value to our study.

### Left endobronchial intubation with a double-lumen tube using direct laryngoscopy or the trachway® video stylet [^115RrfCo]. Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

We compared direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh blade vs indirect bronchoscopy with a Trachway® stylet, for endobronchial intubation with a left-sided double-lumen tube. We allocated participants scheduled for thoracic surgery and who had normal predicted laryngoscopy, 30 to each group. The mean (SD) intubation times with laryngoscope and Trachway were 48 (11) s vs 28 (4) s, respectively, p < 0.001. The rates of hoarseness on the first postoperative day, categorised as none/mild/moderate/severe, were 10/12/7/1 and 22/6/2/0, respectively, p = 0.008, without differences on subsequent days. Left endobronchial intubation with a double-lumen tube is slower using direct laryngoscopy and causes more hoarseness than indirect bronchoscopy with a Trachway stylet.

### Comparison of the airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation in patients with predicted normal airways: a prospective randomized trial [^114Q7nmW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many thoracic surgeries require one-lung ventilation for better surgical vision. Double-lumen tube intubation is commonly applied to achieve one-lung ventilation. However, such intubation can occasionally be difficult, particularly in difficult airway cases, due to the larger size and complex shape of the double-lumen tube.

The American Society of Anesthesiologists Difficult Airway Algorithm was updated in 2013. Video-assisted laryngoscopy is recommended as an initial approach during intubation. The Airtraq laryngoscope (Prodol Meditec S. A. Vizcaya, Spain) and the GlideScope (Verathon Inc. Bothell, WA, USA) were introduced in recent years. Their common features include specially designed blades and the video cameras, integrated into the GlideScope blade or as external accessory attached onto the Airtraq Laryngoscope, which provide better laryngeal views. However, the Airtraq Laryngoscope has a side channel to guide endotracheal tube advancement which is different from the GlideScope. Once the vocal cord has been optimally exposed, the endotracheal tube is introduced into the tracheal through the side channel.

Literature has demonstrated that the Airtraq Laryngoscope and the GlideScope can facilitate tracheal intubation in normal and difficult airways both in manikins and patients. However, compared with single lumen tube intubation, few studies have specifically focused on double-lumen tube intubation with video laryngoscopes. Recently, several studies have compared video laryngoscopes to the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope for double-lumen tube intubations. The results were inconsistent in comparison of the GlideScope and Macintosh laryngoscope and the advantages of the Airtraq laryngoscope were not apparent over the Macintosh laryngoscope. Furthermore, the differences between video laryngoscopes in terms of intubation efficacy and performance have not been fully revealed so far. We designed a prospective randomized study to compare the Airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation. Our hypothesis was that the specially designed Airtraq laryngoscope would likely be superior to the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation.

### Use of single-lumen tube for minimally invasive and hybrid esophagectomies with prone thoracoscopic dissection: case series [^11318bMH]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive and hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is a technically challenging procedure. Anesthesia for the same is equally challenging due to special requirements of the video-assisted thoracoscopic technique used and shared operative and respiratory fields. Standard ventilatory strategy for this kind of surgery has been 1-lung ventilation with the help of a double-lumen tube. Prone positioning for thoracoscopic dissection facilitates gravity-dependant collapse of the operative side lung induced by a unilateral capnothorax, thus making the use of single-lumen endotracheal tube a feasible option for this surgery. We report our experience of 10 consecutive cases of minimally invasive esophagectomy conducted in prone position at our center and the use of single-lumen endotracheal tube for ventilation.

VivaSight-DL (DLT-ETView) is a single-use double-lumen tube (DLT) with an integrated camera visualizing the carina continuously, which could reduce the need for a routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The objective of this study was to evaluate its rate of correct positioning.

Design

A prospective, observational study.

Setting

A university hospital.

Participants

170 patients undergoing a thoracic surgical procedure.

Interventions

Selective left bronchus intubation.

Measurements and Main Results

The main outcome measure was a double criteria assessed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy: the bronchial cuff in the left main bronchus and end of the bronchial lumen upstream of the lobar bifurcation. Between September 2013 and April 2014, 84 patients of the planned 170 were included. Seven patients were excluded: 3 for failed intubation, 3 for protocol violation, and 1 because the DLT melted before insertion. The study was terminated after this event. Seventy-six patients (99%) had correct positioning, with a median margin of safety of 20 mm (interquartile range: 15–27) in the surgical position. In 40 patients (53%), malpositioning required mobilization of the tube at least once intraoperatively.

Conclusions

The tube was well positioned in almost all patients. Continuous visualization of the carina is a major improvement for patient care as intraoperative displacement can be diagnosed immediately and corrected. However, an incident induced premature ending of the study.

### Practice patterns in choice of left double-lumen tube size for thoracic surgery [^113rMB7S]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Some anesthesiologists choose smaller than body size-appropriate left sided double-lumen tubes (DLTs) ("down-size") for lung isolation in an attempt to limit the risk of airway trauma. There are few data on the effects of DLT size on intraoperative outcome measures.

Methods

In 300 adults undergoing thoracic surgery requiring lung isolation, we conducted a prospective pilot study to evaluate whether the use of 35 FR DLT, regardless of gender and/or height (care standard of two investigators), was associated with a similar incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia, lung isolation failure, or need for DLT repositioning during surgery (noninferiority) than with the conventional goal of inserting the largest possible DLT (care standard of two other investigators). DLT insertion position was immediately confirmed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy after direct laryngoscopic placement and after lateral positioning.

Results

The combined incidence of transient hypoxemia, inadequate lung isolation, or need for DLT repositioning during surgery did not differ among patients receiving 35, 37, or 39 FR DLT, regardless of gender or height. Despite the high frequency of 35 FR DLT use, 2% of patients required further down-sizing due to the inability to introduce the DLT into the left mainstem bronchus or when no inflation of the bronchial cuff was needed for lung isolation.

Conclusions

Under the conditions of this pilot study, the use of smaller than conventionally sized DLT was not associated with any differences in clinical intraoperative outcomes.

### A modified technique to improve the outcome of intubation with a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube [^111XCBTG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) is often needed to facilitate one-lung ventilation in patients undergoing surgical procedures involving the chest cavity. A DLT not only provides independent ventilation for each lung but also allows bronchial toilet without interrupting ventilation. However, owing to its larger size and more complex design than single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT), anesthesiologists can find intubation with a DLT challenging, even in a patient with a normal airway. A DLT is relatively contraindicated in a patient with a difficult airway.

In recent years several video-assisted laryngoscopes, such as the GlideScope ® video laryngoscope (GVL; Verathon, Bothell, WA), have been developed, and have been shown to reduce the time taken to intubate with a DLT. Nonetheless, the DLT must be angulated to fit the curve of the GVL's blade, and the incidence of the common complications of tracheal intubation, such as hoarseness and sore throat, appear not to be reduced. This may be a consequence not only of the larger size and more complex structure of the DLT, but also of intubation technique. Bustamante and colleagues reported that sequential rotation of the DLT facilitated its advancement into the trachea, but a method of angulation has also been reported.

We hypothesized that making intubation with a DLT more straightforward would shorten the time to achieve intubation and reduce the incidence or severity of post-intubation complications. We identified two methods of angulating the DLT to facilitate intubation, and examined which was most effective. We also recorded the hemodynamic response to intubation, and the incidence of post-intubation complications, such as hoarseness and sore throat.

### A method for addressing right upper lobe obstruction with right-sided double-lumen endobronchial tubes during surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^111ttC5m]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In left-sided thoracic surgery, one-lung ventilation (OLV) can generally be achieved by placing a right- or left-sided double-lumen tube (R-DLT or L-DLT). A R-DLT has a smaller margin of safety for correct placement than a L-DLT. The main problem with using a R-DLT is that it is prone to cause right upper lobe obstruction and collapse. Nevertheless, many clinicians choose a R-DLT for left-sided thoracic surgery because the consensus is that the thoracic surgical procedure may change at any time, and for some procedures, using a R-DLT is absolutely indicated, such as in sleeve resection and left-sided pneumonectomy. However, it has been found that during some operations, a R-DLT is not actually necessary.

A R-DLT has a tendency to become malpositioned intraoperatively due to anatomical distortion that may occur during lateral positioning of the patient. If a R-DLT is poorly matched with the anatomy of the patient's airway, it will not be possible to replace the R-DLT correctly using a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) even with repeated attempts, and multiple attempts to replace a R-DLT can lead to severe airway injury. Although these problems can be corrected by exchanging a R-DLT with a L-DLT or by using an endobronchial blocker, exchanging a DLT with the patient in the lateral position is not only difficult but also risks losing access to the airway.

The distance between the branching point of the left upper lobe orifice and the carina is approximately 4.5 cm in women and 5.0 cm in men. For most patients, the size of the left main bronchus is long enough to hold the tip of a R-DLT without occluding the left upper lobe orifice. Thus, transferring a R-DLT from the right main bronchus into the left main bronchus may be a feasible method for instances where R-DLT repositioning is difficult due to right upper lobe occlusion during surgery. Because the performance of this method is controversial, we performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of moving a R-DLT from the right main bronchus into the left main bronchus with patients in the lateral position during surgery.

### A novel combined approach to placement of a double lumen endobronchial tube using a video laryngoscope and fiberoptic bronchoscope: a retrospective chart review [^1159cBsf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to evaluate a modern combined video laryngoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope approach to placement of a double lumen endobronchial tube and further characterize potential strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was conducted at our single institution, academic medical center, tertiary-care hospital. Patients aged 18 years of age or older were evaluated who underwent thoracic surgery and one-lung ventilation with placement of a double lumen endobronchial tube using a novel combined video laryngoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope approach. No interventions were performed.

Results

Demographics and induction and intubation documentation were reviewed for 21 patients who underwent thoracic surgery and one-lung ventilation with placement of a double lumen endobronchial tube using a novel combined video laryngoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope approach. First pass success using the combined approach was 86% (18/21). The five patients with an anticipated difficult airway had successful double lumen endobronchial tube placement on the first attempt. There were no instances of desaturation during double lumen endobronchial tube placement. No airway complications related to double lumen endobronchial tube placement were recorded.

Conclusion

Use of a combined approach employing video laryngoscopy and a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope may represent a reliable alternative approach to placement of double lumen endobronchial tubes.

### Lung ultrasound is non-inferior to bronchoscopy for confirmation of double-lumen endotracheal tube positioning: a randomized controlled noninferiority study [^111QuGJN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Single-lung isolation and ventilation (SLV) are of paramount importance during thoracic surgery to manage secretions, optimize exposure, and provide operative access to the area of surgical interest. Although several methods have been employed to achieve SLV, the preferred technique is placement of a left sided double lumen endotracheal tube (LDLT). LDLT is considered the gold standard for SLV due to its simplicity and high rate of success in achieving lung isolation and surgical exposure. These high success rates rely on optimal LDLT positioning, which minimizes intraoperative complications such as hypoxia and cross-contamination of lung contents. The LDLT is preferred for both sides of the operations due to the simplicity of insertion. The use of FOB for checking the opening of the right upper lobe is not necessary, opposite to the right-side double-lumen tube. Double lumen tube (DLT) positioning is divided into two sequential steps: insertion of the DLT and confirmation of the DLT position. Traditional methods of LDLT placement rely on blind advancement of the LDLT into the bronchus after laryngoscopic tracheal intubation. This 'blind' insertion technique — followed by clinical confirmation via auscultation and assessment of chest wall excursion — has excellent time efficiency and often results in acceptable placement of the LDLT.

Nevertheless, several studies suggest placement of LDLT using clinical methods alone lacks reliability, with significant variations in sensitivity and specificity and a strong effect of operator skill. In contrast, fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) produces more consistent results and can be used for initial placement of LDLT, assessment of appropriate depth, adjustment to optimal position within the margin of safety, and intraoperative secretion management. Therefore, FOB is considered the gold standard for confirming appropriate positioning of the LDLT and has widely supplanted the blind insertion technique in modern thoracic anesthesiology. Despite its advantages, a fiberoptic bronchoscope is an expensive and delicate piece of equipment that requires careful maintenance and the proper training to verify the anatomy of tracheobronchial tree. Moreover, from the collective experience of the authors, bronchoscopy is difficult to perform when there is bleeding in the airway.

### Comparison of the GlideScope® videolaryngoscope and the Macintosh laryngoscope for double-lumen tube intubation [^1176WJj2]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Intubation with a double-lumen tube is important for achieving one-lung ventilation and facilitating thoracic surgery. The GlideScope(®) videolaryngoscope (Verathon Inc, Bothell, WA, USA) is designed to assist tracheal intubation for patients with a difficult airway. We wished to compare the GlideScope and direct laryngoscopy for double-lumen tube intubation. Sixty adult patients requiring a double-lumen tube for thoracic surgery and predicted uncomplicated laryngoscopy were randomly assigned to a direct Macintosh laryngoscopy group (n = 30) or a GlideScope group (n = 30). The mean (SD) duration of intubation was longer in the Macintosh group (62.5 (29.7) s) than in the GlideScope group (45.6 (10.7) s; p = 0.007). There was no difference in the success of the first attempt at intubation (26/30 (87%) and 30/30 (100%) for Macintosh and GlideScope groups, respectively; p = 0.112). The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was higher in the Macintosh group (18 (60%) and 14 (47%), respectively) than in the GlideScope group (6 (20%) and 4 (13%), respectively; p = 0.003 and 0.004). We conclude that double-lumen tube intubation in patients with predicted normal laryngoscopy is easier using the GlideScope videolaryngoscope than the Macintosh laryngoscope.

### Airway management in "tubeless" spontaneous-ventilation video-assisted thoracoscopic tracheal surgery: a retrospective observational case series study [^111tig5v]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Even if current SV-VATS offers some potential advantages, technical difficulties including diaphragmatic contraction and pendelluft, airway hyperreactivity and cough, reverse trigger and breath stack during mechanical ventilation still need to be overcome. Moreover, in an attempt to minimize non-uniform transmission of pleural pressure generated by diaphragmatic contraction under spontaneously breath in the resection phase, several patients used a small dose of muscle relaxant to balance diaphragmatic contraction of spontaneous ventilation and mediastinal swing in surgical field.

In conclusion, our experiences suggested that either supraglottic airway device or endotracheal tube is a feasible and prospective strategy for tubeless TRR. They also provide options for the conversion to traditional ways under the condition of unstable spontaneous ventilate. A sample size of 33 patients will not allow a comprehensive safety evaluation, especially with regards to rare TRR surgery. Given the small number of cases examined, limitations of applied indications, contraindications, and per-operative period safety warrant further investigation. However, large patient cohorts are difficult to evaluate, as tracheal resections are relatively rare, even in specialized centers. This method needs more evidence before being recommended for potential guidelines.

### Comparison of non-intubated and intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for perioperative complications-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Lxqvp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Growth in the number of patients is reaping the advantages of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS). In 2018, the ERAS Society, in collaboration with the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS), recommended that minimally invasive surgery, early ambulation, and high-quality perioperative anesthetic management are critical components for achieving ERAS in thoracic surgery patients. The advancement of minimally invasive surgery has imposed new requirements on anesthetic procedures and management. Since 2004, Pompeo et al. initially documented the execution of VATS while maintaining spontaneous respiration, nonetheless, numerous disputes regarding anesthesia management persist. Previous meta-analyses have addressed NIVATS and IVATS; however, more relevant studies have emerged over time. This meta-analysis encompasses 19 randomized controlled trials involving 2,222 patients, offering a thorough comparison of the two anesthesia modalities to enhance patient-specific surgical protocols and anesthesia practices in clinical settings. We compared not only postoperative recovery data but also metrics related to intraoperative patient safety and the quality of medical care.

### Airway management of the right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after left pneumonectomy by an adapted double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT): a case report [^1116H2Bs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

It is a case of right lung surgery with previous left pneumonectomy, which entails the resection to be least impairment to the respiratory function and least trauma as well. Uniportal VATS right anterior segmentectomy should be the optimal choice because of its complete removal of the tumor while maximally functional lung kept, and smallest intercostal incision left.

However, this procedure is very challenging in lung ventilation, isolation and maintenance throughout the operation. Except for the way we have successfully implemented, other options could be recommended. First, a single-lumen tracheal tube (SLT) could be intubated into the right bronchus intermedius, this could make use of the ventilation in the middle and lower lobes, yet it also would lead to the upper lobar inflation, unless a detachment of the SLT with the cuff deflated and the ventilator was made before the establishment of pneumothorax. Besides, the blood and sputum from the upper lobe would be a problem since the export would have been blocked by the SLT. Another approach is BB. BB can be served for the purpose of one lung ventilation and selective lobar blockade in VATS, and also its advantages in children and difficult airway placement are widely-accepted. As for this case, however, if BB were chosen, it should be placed into the right upper lobe bronchus, given the knowledge of the anatomical features, it would be more likely placed into some segmental bronchus of the right upper lobe, resulting in inflation in the right upper lobar; besides, even if by any chance, BB were suitably placed, it would have a great probability of being dispositioned given the thought of the short right upper lobe bronchus and the surgical intervention. Although DLT has rarely been taken in selective lobar blockade for lung resections, there was a precedent in partial sternotomy. Comparing to partial sternotomy, we believe that lung resection, as in this case segmentectomy is more challenging in ventilation, isolation and drainage. First, we have to make sure the bronchial cuff is intubated into the bronchus intermedius, and it can protect the middle and lower lobes from the upper lobe contamination when inflated, and the bronchial orifice should be above the middle lobe bronchial port to guarantee the ventilation in the middle and lower lobes. But the length of bronchus intermedius varies, and that length was only about 15 mm in this woman while the length of bronchial cuff and the tip included was about 30 mm, so we cut off the tip (about 10 mm without damage to the cuff) and made it clean and smooth without any possible damage to the human body. Still, our approach has some limitations too, the bronchial cuff of this modified DLT was meant to be positioned in the bronchus intermedius, however, the shorter, the easier to be dispositioned; also, skilled adapting and intubation technique, and the recognition of the bronchial anatomy are needed.

### Training in placement of the left-sided double-lumen tube among non-thoracic anaesthesiologists: intubation model simulator versus computer-based digital video disc, a randomised controlled trial [^113aqw83]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of training with an airway model simulator versus digital video disc (DVD)-based instruction in placement of double-lumen endotracheal (DLT) tubes by anaesthesiologists with limited thoracic experience.

Design

Single academic centre parallel randomised controlled trial with computer-generated random allocation.

Participants

Sixty patients undergoing elective thoracic or oesophageal surgeries requiring one-lung ventilation. Twenty-seven non-thoracic anaesthesiologists were randomised to place a DLT.

Intervention

DLT placement instruction by an interactive airway simulator or computer-based DVD training. The main outcome measure was successful DLT placement.

Results

Twenty-seven anaesthesiologists were randomised to one of the two intervention groups. Sixty consecutive patients were assigned to a randomised anaesthesiologist (n = 30 in each group). Participants failed to correctly place or position the DLT tubes in 14 of 60 patients (failure rate of 23%). There was no difference in the probability of satisfactory placement or time for positioning of the DLT between the training groups; 80.5% (95% confidence interval 58.2–96.2%) of tubes were successfully placed following intubation model simulator training versus 73.6% (95% confidence interval 49.8–88.5%) in the DVD group (P = 0.378).

Conclusion

Both teaching methods had similar outcomes for placement of DLTs by anaesthesiologists with limited thoracic anaesthesia experience. Both groups performed better than individuals in our prior study. Therefore, these methods should be considered when training anaesthesiologists to successfully place DLTs.

### A randomised trial comparing real-time double-lumen endobronchial tube placement with the disposcopewith conventional blind placement [^113qM1wv]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Double-lumen endobronchial tube placement is challenging. This study compared double-lumen tube placement with the Disposcope ®, a wireless videostylet allowing real-time visualisation, with conventional blind placement. Patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery with normal airways requiring one-lung ventilation were randomly allocated into two groups (27 patients in each group). The Disposcope was used to assist left-sided double-lumen tube placement in one group, and conventional blind placement was performed in the control group. Placement in both groups was checked with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. The Disposcope-assisted group had a shorter total mean (SD) placement time (18.6 (2.5) s vs. 21.4 (2.9) s, p < 0.001), laryngoscopy to end of auscultation time (83.4 (3.0) s vs. 93.9 (5.7) s, p < 0.001) and total operation time (130.7 (6.1) s vs. 154.5 (6.3) s, p < 0.001). In the Disposcope-assisted group, the double-lumen tube was inserted in the correct side in all patients (100.0%), whereas in the conventional group, the double-lumen tube was placed in the correct side in 25 (92.6%) patients and in the wrong side in 2 (7.4%) patients; the difference was not significant (p = 0.150). In the Disposcope-assisted group, the double-lumen tube was inserted to the optimal depth in 24 (88.9%) patients, whereas in the conventional group it was inserted to the optimal depth in one (4.0%) patient. The Disposcope increased the success rate of double-lumen tube placement, and shortened the total operation time when compared with standard placement with confirmation using fibreoptic bronchoscopy, and may replace the conventional method.

### Comparison of non-intubated and intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for perioperative complications-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EfCph]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) avoids lung injury and intubation-related complications from mechanical ventilation, but the intraoperative safety and postoperative recovery quality of NIVATS remain controversial. Consequently, we systematically assessed the viability and safety of non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) in comparison to intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (IVATS). These findings provide evidence for optimizing anesthetic and surgical decision-making.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, OVID, and Google Scholar were queried from their establishment until October 2024. We included eligible studies that compared non-intubated anesthesia with intubated anesthesia for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for thoracic conditions. Following the evaluation of bias risk in these randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (Manager 5.4).

Results

Nineteen randomized controlled trials were incorporated into the study. NIVATS demonstrated a reduced length of hospital stay, feeding time, and chest-tube dwell time compared to intubated methods. IVATS groups, hypoxemia exhibited a reduced incidence, but perioperative cough and perioperative arrhythmias revealed no statistically significant differences between IVATS and NIVATS groups. The NIVATS groups exhibited a significantly reduced risk compared to the IVATS groups for postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and sore throat.

Conclusions

NIVATS avoid complications associated with intubation and are able to accelerate patient recovery to a certain extent. Although NIVATS carries intraoperative safety risks, careful patient selection can mitigate these risks.

### Prospective in-depth analysis of anaesthetic management of spontaneous ventilation VATS for lung cancer resection: a matched pairs comparison to intubated VATS [^116dMA7g]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous ventilation video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SV-VATS) has been propagated for nearly two decades without a prospective in-depth analysis of anaesthetic management and anaesthetic processing times. This would be important as anaesthetic management of SV-VATS imposes fundamental changes to standards in thoracic anaesthesia and may increase anaesthetic risks. Therefore, this study aimed to provide such in-depth analysis and compare the results to data from matched intubated VATS (I-VATS) patients. 3D-reconstruction of bronchial airways helped to estimate the risk reduction by avoiding double-lumen tube (DLT) intubation according to common selection methods in SV-VATS patients.

Methods

SV-VATS patients receiving anatomical (N = 22) and non-anatomical (N = 16) lung cancer resections were prospectively enrolled. A retrospective I-VATS control cohort (N = 76) allowed for a 2:1 propensity score matching. DLT sizes necessary for SV-VATS patients according to common selection methods were evaluated by 3D-reconstruction of the left main bronchus and the ≥ 1 mm criterion.

Results

SV-VATS patients required substantially less propofol dosage (P < 0.001) with an increase in variability of drug dosing (P < 0.001) and higher BIS values (P < 0.001) as compared to I-VATS patients. SV-VATS lead to higher variability in respiratory parameters (P < 0.001) with less driving pressure (P < 0.001) and similar mean tidal volumes, oxygenation, and hemodynamic parameters compared to I-VATS. Spontaneous ventilation was achieved by allowing for permissive hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Anaesthetic processing time was reduced by 7 min (P < 0.001). 5–10% of female and 5% of male patients would have received a DLT larger than their bronchial airway.

Conclusions

Our study provides the first prospective quantitative in-depth analysis of a standardised anaesthetic management regime for SV-VATS, including anaesthetic processing times. Respiratory parameters during SV-VATS are compatible with reduced mechanical power as compared to patients undergoing I-VATS. The anaesthetic management regime reduced the risk of airway damage imposed by choosing too-large DLTs in up to 10% of patients without compromising oxygenation and hemodynamic stability. Changes in anaesthetic processing time by 7 min would not allow for a higher caseload of SV-VATS for lung cancer surgery.

### Trachway® flexible stylet facilitates the correct placement of double-lumen endobronchial tube: a prospective, randomized study [^1114b1VY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The mainstream facilitation of one-lung ventilation is using double-lumen endobronchial tubes. However, it is more difficult to be positioned properly and more likely to cause airway injuries. How to place double-lumen endobronchial tubes rapidly and correctly is important for thoracic anesthesiologists.

Methods

One hundred eight patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I to III were 20 years of age or over, and required one-lung ventilation for thoracic surgery. They were randomly assigned to the conventional technique group (n = 36), the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy group (n = 36), or the Trachway® flexible stylet group (n = 36). The primary endpoint was the time needed for intubation. T1, the time from the tip of the blade passing between the patient's lips to identification of the vocal cords; and T2, the time from identification of the vocal cords to the bronchial lumen was in the correct position.

Results

T1 had no significant difference between groups, but T2 was significantly shorter in the Trachway® flexible stylet group (p < 0.0001) and longer in the conventional technique group (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Using Trachway® flexible stylet for correct placement of double-lumen endobronchial tubes not only significantly shortened the intubation time, but also reduced incidence of carinal injuries. It is an alternative, and a choice with good safety.

### Airway management in "tubeless" spontaneous-ventilation video-assisted thoracoscopic tracheal surgery: a retrospective observational case series study [^115xn2z9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In this trial, 33 patients were analyzed. We showed that a supraglottic airway device or endotracheal tube were both alternative airway options as traditional airway devices. Tubeless is better but the conventional airway techniques for tracheal stenosis is the technology-bases. When there are unstable spontaneous-ventilation condition and difficulty in progression in the resection and reconstruction phase, conversion to traditional mechanical ventilation is necessary to ensure patient safety. In such case, plan B: ProSeal LMA alongside a high frequency catheter or cross field intubation was selected. The device failure rate was 27.3% (9/33). The develop of new devices for airway management (eg, igel, more and better intravenous anesthetics such as dexmedetomidine), and stricter patient selection will help decrease the device failure rate of this surgery when ERAS of VATS was just beginning. Nevertheless, in this review, instability of spontaneous breath resulted in failure of tubeless during dissection and resection of the airway in 9 cases were smoothly processed for respiratory support conversion. Limited by the number of cases, serious complications such as pulmonary aspiration, early postoperative bleeding or suture dehiscence were not observed in this cohort.

LMA was considered as a feasible alternative during open tracheal surgery, and was still used in several studies of SV-VATS. As a superior glottis airway can't be affected by narrow airways, it has a unique advantage in cases when the tumors are near the glottis or stenosis after intubation. This device is effective for various types of airway surgery, presents excellent clinical outcomes and has been recommended for use in cervical trachea reconstruction or cases near the glottis. In some patients, a single-lumen endotracheal catheter can be selected if the stenosis area is far away from the glottis. We selected this option for obese patients but high quality randomized trials are recommended to further objectify this decision. Kashii et al. reported that after ETT insertion, a patient maintained spontaneous respiration without any hypoxic event. For patients with high BMI, high risk of regurgitate or other factors that may cause unstable spontaneous breath, some anesthetists chose a single-lumen endotracheal tube because an LMA cannot ventilate with high pressure. However, use of endotracheal tube may be impossible if the stenotic segment is too high and too close to the glottis. On the other hand, given that there's difference in airway management preferences by the anesthesiologist, whether these potential benefits can be proved in the future by well-designed RCTs are not known.

### A comparison of bronchial blocker under artificial pneumothorax and double-lumen endobronchial tube for lung isolation in thoracoscopic enucleation of oesophageal leiomyoma [^1138Kyqx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oesophageal leiomyomas are the most common benign oesophageal tumours, accounting for approximately 70% — 80% of oesophageal submucosal tumours. In recent years, video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation of oesophageal leiomyoma has been shown to have better postoperative recovery than the thoracotomy approach. Compared with double-lumen endotracheal intubation anaesthesia, single-lumen endotracheal intubation combined with a bronchial blocker under artificial pneumothorax is an improved lung separation technology. Artificial pneumothorax achieves better lung collapse and surgical field exposure and decreases blood loss, which are more convenient for tumour enucleation with less morbidity. This study retrospectively analysed a total of 36 patients diagnosed with oesophageal leiomyoma undergoing thoracoscopic surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2014 to 2020. We present surgical outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation of oesophageal leiomyoma and evaluate the advantages of single-lumen endotracheal intubation combined with a bronchial blocker under artificial pneumothorax compared with traditional double-lumen endotracheal intubation.

### Effect of lung isolation with different airway devices on postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a propensity score-matched study [^113o9Vze]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the propensity score matching method was used to match the three groups of patients to obtain a balanced research cohort. In selecting the matching variables, general information about the patients (age, sex, weight), as well as preoperative albumin, ASA classification, duration of surgery, intraoperative fluid volume, and prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, which have a potential impact on postoperative pneumonia, were included in the equations in order to reduce the impact of these factors on the outcome. Finally, the results of the study showed that there was no significant statistical difference in the incidence of pneumonia within 7 days after surgery and the length of hospital stay among the three groups, but the group of the laryngeal mask combined with the bronchial occluder was lower than the other two groups in terms of the incidence of postoperative pneumonia, the length of hospital stay, and the cost of hospitalisation.

In thoracic surgery, double-lumen endobronchial tube is the most common method for lung isolation. This traditional lung isolation technique provides good surgical conditions for the surgeon, but it also brings strong stress response to the patient, especially the increase of blood pressure and heart rate during intubation, as well as cough, bronchospasm, and postoperative pharyngeal discomfort after extubation. In order to avoid the related risks caused by the above double-lumen endobronchial tube intubation, some scholars began to use laryngeal mask combined with bronchial blocker to compensate for the shortcomings of double-lumen intubation. Compared with tracheal intubation, the use of laryngeal mask can reduce the incidence of laryngeal-related complications and reduce the stimulation to the root of epiglottis. And the protective function of laryngeal mask for the throat may help to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications using laryngeal mask. In addition, laryngeal mask airway can also reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory and circulatory system related complications, reduce the cough symptoms caused by extubation, greatly increase the comfort of patients, and is more conducive to the clinical recovery of patients after surgery.

### Rupture of contralateral mainstem bronchus during uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery lobectomy and 3 successful cases of repair [^114fsXKU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In thoracic surgery, in order to facilitate the operation, placement of a double-lumen endotracheal tube is needed to ensure the isolation of lungs. During the process, the occurrence of tracheobronchial injuries (TBI) is quite difficult to treat, and sometimes even life-threatening. It has been reported previously in the literature that the incidence of airway injury caused by double-lumen endotracheal intubation was very low, about 0.2%. Airway injury is a rare complication, and sometimes a relatively small bronchial tear associated with that is not easy to be found. The causes include the lack of experienced anesthesiologists, accidental injuries associated with operating of surgeon, anatomical malformations of tracheal bronchi in themselves, repeated intubation, and excessive balloon inflation, etc. In this paper, our goal was to discuss the treatment for rupture of contralateral mainstem bronchus during uniportal VATS lobectomy.

### Comparison of the airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope for double-lumen tube intubation in patients with predicted normal airways: a prospective randomized trial [^112fuH56]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Airtraq laryngoscope and the GlideScope are commonly used in many airway scenarios. However, their features have not been fully described for double-lumen tube intubation. A prospective randomized study was designed to compare their intubation performances in thoracic surgery patients.

Methods

Seventy ASA physical status I and II patients with predicted normal airway were scheduled for thoracic surgeries with double-lumen tube intubation. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups and intubated with either the Airtraq laryngoscope (group A, n = 35) or the GlideScope (group G, n = 35). Airway assessments were performed prior to anesthesia, and all patients were induced with a standard anesthetic regimen. The Cormack-Lehane grades were initially evaluated with a Macintosh laryngoscope and subsequently with the group-specific laryngoscope before intubation. Intubation time was recorded as the primary outcome. The Cormack-Lehane grade, the success of the first intubation attempt, the intubation difficulty scales and ease of tube advancement were noted. Hemodynamic variables during intubation and incidence of post-operative sore throat were documented as well.

Results

The intubation time of group A was shorter than that of group G (36.6 ± 20.2 s vs. 54.6 ± 25.7 s, p = 0.002). The Cormack-Lehane grade (I/II/III/IV) was significantly better in group A (33/2/0/0 vs. 28/7/0/0, p = 0.042). The mean arterial pressure and heart rate rose to higher levels during intubation with the GlideScope than with the Airtraq laryngoscope. The success of the first intubation attempt and the intubation difficulty scales were comparable between the two groups. The numbers of patients who experienced postoperative sore throat were similar (6 vs. 8) in the two groups.

Conclusions

Compared with the GlideScope, the specially designed Airtraq laryngoscope might be more suitable for double-lumen tube intubations in patients with predicted normal airway.

### NCT02137291 | IPg2 study: left-sided lung isolation… [^114YjsJs]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

IPg2 Study: Left-sided Lung Isolation ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Background: Lung isolation is frequently used in thoracic surgery. The quality of the isolation is crucial, especially for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Two techniques are principally used to obtain lung isolation: the double lumen tube and the bronchial blocker. The left-sided DLT is used by the majority of anesthesiologists, as much for left as for right thoracic surgeries. The standard right-sided DLT is rarely used since positioning its lateral orifice with the origin of the right upper lobe can be difficult. In 2007, the investigators have published their results suggesting an enlargement of the lateral orifice of the Rs-DLT. They have demonstrated that the modified right-sided double lumen tube remained more frequently in optimal position than the Rs-DLT and that it was also easier to reposition the tube after turning the patient in lateral decubitus. The hypothesis to explain these observations is that when the bronchial extremity of the L-DLT is inserted into the left main stem bronchus, the LMSB and its relative superior position, associated to a progressive collapse of the left lung, could induce a dynamic obstruction of the distal extremity of the L-DLT lumen, and consequently slowing the lung collapse. Investigators have also regularly observed this type of obstruction during bronchoscopic examination when positioning the L-DLT. For these reasons, the authors consider that the time to get CLC should be measured from the pleural opening since it is the crucial moment for the surgical team. Investigators are proposing to evaluate the PO-CLC interval as a primary objective.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis of the proposed study is that the use of the L-DLT will allow for a slower and a poorer quality of CLC compared to the ones obtained with the Rm-DLT in left VATS.

### Video laryngoscopy vs conventional direct laryngoscopy for intubation… [^113h3AQm]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

aMAC is a type of anesthesia service in which an anesthesia clinician continually monitors and supports the patient's vital functions; diagnoses and treats clinical problems that occur; administers sedative, anxiolytic, or analgesic medications if needed; and converts to general anesthesia if required. Question What is the effect of initial video laryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy on number of intubation attempts in patients being intubated for cardiac, thoracic, or vascular surgical procedures. Meaning In this study of adults having elective or emergent surgical procedures requiring single-lumen endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, hyperangulated video laryngoscopy increased initial intubation attempt success and reduced the number of intubation attempts compared with direct laryngoscopy. Importance Endotracheal tubes are typically inserted in the operating room using direct laryngoscopy.

Video laryngoscopy has been reported to improve airway visualization; however, whether improved visualization reduces intubation attempts in surgical patients is unclear. Objective To determine whether the number of intubation attempts per surgical procedure is lower when initial laryngoscopy is performed using video laryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy. Design, Setting, and Participants Cluster randomized multiple crossover clinical trial conducted at a single US academic hospital. Patients were adults aged 18 years or older having elective or emergent cardiac, thoracic, or vascular surgical procedures who required single-lumen endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia. Patients were enrolled from March 30, 2021, to December 31, 2022. Data analysis was based on intention to treat. This trial therefore compared video laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy on the number of intubation attempts required to correctly position a single-lumen tube.

Specifically, the trial tested the primary hypothesis that fewer intubation attempts would be required when initial laryngoscopy was performed with a video laryngoscope rather than a direct laryngoscope in patients being intubated in the operating room for cardiac, thoracic, or vascular surgical procedures. Secondarily, the trial tested the hypotheses that video laryngoscopy would reduce the number of intubation failures and a composite of airway and dental injuries. The need for repeated intubation attempts in our trial was also broadly consistent with a large retrospective analysis in which multiple intubation attempts were required in 9% of patients with direct laryngoscopy.
