## Question

Glipizide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about glipizide's mechanism, efficacy, safety, dosing, special populations, and how it compares with alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and core mechanism. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics and formulation differences. Next, I will review efficacy data, including durability and combination therapy. After that, I need to assess safety, especially hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk. Then, I should confirm dosing, titration, and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with alternatives in mind.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism. Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that lowers glucose primarily by binding the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic β-cell KATP channels, closing them, depolarizing the membrane, and triggering calcium-dependent insulin release. This requires functional β-cells and is glucose-independent, which explains hypoglycemia risk [^5d4cf43b] [^3aa7b3bf]. Wait, let me verify extrapancreatic effects; some labeling and reviews note improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic glucose production, but the clinical contribution is modest and less consistent than the insulin secretagogue effect, so I should not overstate these mechanisms in practice [^48749596] [^90d9075a].

> I need to check pharmacokinetics and formulation differences. Immediate-release glipizide peaks at 1–3 hours with a 2–5 hour half-life, while extended-release glipizide XL provides smoother 24-hour coverage with once-daily dosing; both are hepatically metabolized with minimal unchanged urinary excretion, and protein binding is high at 98–99% [^01c45742] [^aef68faf]. Hold on, I should verify food effects; food delays absorption of IR glipizide by about 40 minutes but does not meaningfully change total exposure, which supports consistent dosing with meals to mitigate GI effects and hypoglycemia risk [^98ec0671].

> Next, I should review efficacy. Monotherapy typically lowers HbA1c by about 1.0–1.5% initially, with faster onset than metformin, but durability wanes over 6–12 months due to β-cell exhaustion and secondary failure, which is a key limitation of the class [^abeae74b] [^beefb442]. Let me consider combination therapy; adding metformin to glipizide produces synergistic effects and improves HbA1c more than either alone, with a randomized trial showing about a 1% greater HbA1c reduction versus monotherapies and more patients reaching HbA1c < 7% [^fb3160d8] [^2d9a01ce]. I should double-check durability comparisons; head-to-head data show dapagliflozin achieves similar 52-week HbA1c to glipizide but with better durability and less hypoglycemia, reinforcing the concern about sulfonylurea tachyphylaxis [^0f60cf47] [^c08d8416].

> Now, safety — this is where I need to be precise. Hypoglycemia is the most consequential risk, with glipizide causing symptomatic and sometimes severe episodes, especially in older adults, those with renal or hepatic impairment, malnutrition, or when combined with other glucose-lowering drugs; rates in trials versus comparators are markedly higher, often 30–40% for symptomatic events, and prolonged hypoglycemia can occur, particularly with ER formulations in overdose settings [^fa54921e] [^c2371bf6] [^f4779c2d]. Hold on, I should verify cardiovascular risk; while class effects are debated, contemporary comparative effectiveness and meta-analyses associate glipizide with higher all-cause mortality and MACE versus low-hypoglycemia-risk comparators, and a randomized trial in CAD patients favored metformin over glipizide for cardiovascular outcomes, so I should counsel caution in moderate-to-high CV risk patients [^070bf46f] [^1fde7488] [^8d698f42]. I also need to remember rare but serious hematologic risks, including hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency, and the possibility of secondary failure over time, which mandates periodic reassessment of glycemic control and adherence [^fa54921e] [^a25d553a].

> Let me think about dosing and titration. For IR glipizide, a typical start is 5 mg before breakfast, titrating by 2.5–5 mg increments every several days to a maximum of 20 mg/day; for glipizide XL, 5 mg once daily with breakfast is standard, with 2.5 mg in elderly or hepatic impairment, and a maximum of 20 mg/day. Titration should be guided by fasting glucose and HbA1c, with slower steps in high-risk patients [^b0e88233] [^135793b2]. I should confirm drug–drug interactions; colesevelam reduces glipizide exposure, so separate dosing by at least 4 hours, and CYP2C9 inhibitors or warfarin coadministration may increase hypoglycemia risk via pharmacokinetic interactions, warranting closer monitoring [^notfound] [^2b4913a8].

> Next, I should review special populations. In chronic kidney disease, glipizide is preferred among sulfonylureas because it is hepatically metabolized; no dose adjustment is generally required, though I should still start low and monitor for hypoglycemia as kidney function declines [^cb0a2ad0]. In hepatic impairment, start at 2.5 mg and go slowly due to reduced clearance and blunted gluconeogenesis. In older adults, begin at 2.5 mg and titrate cautiously given hypoglycemia vulnerability and recognition challenges [^e14d5a82] [^135793b2]. For pregnancy, I need to ensure I state this clearly: glipizide is not recommended; insulin is first-line, and if a sulfonylurea was used, it should be stopped at least 4 weeks before delivery to reduce neonatal hypoglycemia risk [^b6c110d2] [^097b2ed7].

> But wait, what if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated? I should consider alternatives and comparative safety. DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors provide similar or noninferior HbA1c effects to glipizide with substantially less hypoglycemia and favorable weight effects; in particular, dapagliflozin and sitagliptin have head-to-head data showing comparable glycemic control with markedly lower hypoglycemia and weight loss or neutrality versus glipizide's weight gain [^0f60cf47] [^c2371bf6]. Hold on, I should verify durability again; dapagliflozin shows better glycemic durability over 2 years than glipizide, which strengthens the case for choosing agents with lower hypoglycemia risk when feasible, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or obesity [^c08d8416].

> I should also confirm practical pearls. Always pair glipizide with structured diabetes education on hypoglycemia recognition and treatment, meal timing, and sick-day rules. Monitor for secondary failure and reassess therapy every 3–6 months. And if adding another agent, start low and watch closely for hypoglycemia, especially when combining with insulin or other secretagogues [^fa54921e] [^da77def8]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: glipizide remains a cost-effective, rapidly acting option for type 2 diabetes when used thoughtfully, but its hypoglycemia risk, weight gain, and limited durability mean it is best reserved for patients without high cardiovascular risk, with preserved renal function, and when newer agents are inaccessible or contraindicated, with careful dosing and monitoring to mitigate harm [^26f063de] [^070bf46f].

---

Glipizide is a **second-generation sulfonylurea** that lowers blood glucose by stimulating pancreatic insulin secretion [^3aa7b3bf]; it is indicated for type 2 diabetes as adjunct to diet and exercise [^b7dfe88f]. It is available as immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XL) formulations, with XL allowing once-daily dosing and a lower hypoglycemia risk [^b0e88233]. Common adverse effects include hypoglycemia, weight gain, and gastrointestinal symptoms; **severe hypoglycemia can occur**, especially in elderly or those with renal/hepatic impairment [^fa54921e]. Glipizide is not recommended in type 1 diabetes, severe renal/hepatic disease, or pregnancy; use caution with CYP2C9 inhibitors and separate dosing from colesevelam by ≥ 4 hours [^82d546d1]. Compared to some sulfonylureas, glipizide has a lower risk of prolonged hypoglycemia, but newer agents (e.g. metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) are often preferred for durability and cardiovascular safety [^53386f0d] [^0f60cf47].

---

## Mechanism of action

Glipizide binds to the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic β-cell KATP channels, closing them and causing depolarization, calcium influx, and insulin release [^3aa7b3bf]. This glucose-independent mechanism explains hypoglycemia risk, particularly when meals are missed or in overdose [^fa54921e]. Extrapancreatic effects may include reduced hepatic glucose production and improved insulin sensitivity, though these are less prominent than the insulin secretagogue effect [^48749596].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

| **Parameter** | **Immediate-release (IR)** | **Extended-release (XL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Absorption | Rapid and complete; peak at 1–3 h; delayed ~40 min with food [^98ec0671] | Slower absorption; peak at 6–12 h; food has minimal effect [^notfound] |
| Distribution | Highly protein bound (98–99%) [^aef68faf] | Highly protein bound (98–99%) [^aef68faf] |
| Metabolism | Hepatic CYP2C9 to inactive metabolites [^notfound] | Hepatic CYP2C9 to inactive metabolites [^notfound] |
| Elimination | Half-life 2–5 h; ~80% urinary, ~10% fecal [^01c45742] | Half-life 2–5 h; ~80% urinary, ~10% fecal [^01c45742] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Glipizide lowers HbA1c by about 1–1.5% in monotherapy, with effects largely at half-maximal doses; higher doses add little benefit and increase hypoglycemia risk [^abeae74b]. XL formulations provide 24-hour control with once-daily dosing and may reduce hypoglycemia compared with IR [^notfound]. Combination therapy with metformin improves glycemic control and allows lower glipizide doses, reducing hypoglycemia risk [^fb3160d8].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Hypoglycemia**: Most common risk; can be severe, especially in elderly, renally/hepatically impaired, or with inadequate caloric intake [^fa54921e].
- **Weight gain**: Common due to increased insulin levels [^b475aba6].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain [^e6a9d203].
- **Hematologic**: Rare hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency [^fa54921e].
- **Hypersensitivity**: Rare rash, urticaria, photosensitivity [^e6a9d203].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to glipizide or sulfonamides, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe renal or hepatic impairment, and pregnancy [^be125d44] [^097b2ed7]. Precautions include use in elderly (start low, go slow), renal/hepatic impairment, adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, and malnutrition; monitor for secondary failure and stress-related hyperglycemia [^fa54921e].

---

## Drug interactions

- **CYP2C9 inhibitors**: Fluconazole, miconazole, amiodarone, omeprazole may increase glipizide levels and hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].
- **Colesevelam**: Reduces absorption; separate dosing by ≥ 4 hours [^82d546d1].
- **Warfarin**: Potential displacement from protein binding and CYP2C9 competition may increase hypoglycemia risk [^2b4913a8].

---

## Special populations

In chronic kidney disease, **no dose adjustment is generally required**, but monitor closely for hypoglycemia; in hepatic impairment, start at 2.5 mg and titrate cautiously [^cb0a2ad0] [^e14d5a82]. In pregnancy, **use insulin instead**; if glipizide is used, stop ≥ 4 weeks before delivery to reduce neonatal hypoglycemia [^b6c110d2]. In pediatrics, safety and efficacy are not established [^097b2ed7].

---

## Comparison with other sulfonylureas

Compared with glyburide, glipizide has a **shorter half-life and lower risk of prolonged hypoglycemia** [^53386f0d]. Compared with glimepiride, glipizide has a higher hypoglycemia risk and less favorable cardiovascular data, though head-to-head trials are limited [^7bed2f5b]. Overall, newer agents (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) are often preferred for durability, weight neutrality or loss, and cardiovascular benefits [^0f60cf47].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines position glipizide as a **second-line option** after metformin, particularly when cost is a major constraint or newer agents are unavailable [^26f063de]. It is reasonable for patients without cardiovascular disease, CKD, or obesity, with careful dosing and hypoglycemia education [^notfound].

---

Glipizide is an effective, low-cost insulin secretagogue for type 2 diabetes, but its use is limited by hypoglycemia, weight gain, and limited durability; **individualize therapy** and consider newer agents when appropriate [^22f0b764].

### Glipizide [^5d4cf43b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action: The primary mode of action of glipizide in experimental animals appears to be the stimulation of insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue and is thus dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. In humans, glipizide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance. Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term glipizide administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. The insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within 30 minutes after an oral dose of glipizide in diabetic patients, but elevated insulin levels do not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.

Blood sugar control persists in some patients for up to 24 hours after a single dose of glipizide, even though plasma levels have declined to a small fraction of peak levels by that time (see Pharmacokinetics below).

Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness to sulfonylurea drugs, including glipizide. Alternatively, glipizide may be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to respond to other sulfonylureas.

Other Effects: It has been shown that glipizide therapy was effective in controlling blood sugar without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for NIDDM.

In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, glipizide had no antidiuretic activity and, in fact, led to a slight increase in free water clearance.

The postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses continue to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. In 2 randomized, double-blind, dose-response studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase in fasting insulin in all Glipizide XL-treated patients combined compared to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses.

Mechanism of Action:

Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablet combines glipizide and metformin hydrochloride, two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. The mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.

Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term glipizide administration, but the post prandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment.

Metformin hydrochloride is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets:

In a single dose study in healthy subjects, the glipizide and metformin components of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/500 mg were bioequivalent to co-administered glipizide and metformin hydrochloride. Following administration of a single glipizide and metformin hydrochloride 5 mg/500 mg tablet in healthy subjects with either a 20% glucose solution or a 20% glucose solution with food, there was a small effect of food on peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and no effect of food on area under the curve (AUC) of the glipizide component. Time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) for the glipizide component was delayed 1 hour with food relative to the same tablet strength administered fasting with a 20% glucose solution. Cmaxfor the metformin component was reduced approximately 14% by food whereas AUC was not affected. Tmaxfor the metformin component was delayed 1 hour after food.

Glipizide:

Gastrointestinal absorption of glipizide is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete. Peak plasma concentrations occur 1 to 3 hours after a single oral dose. Glipizide does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration. Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.

### Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group assessment of simultaneous glipizide / metformin as second-line pharmacologic treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that is inadequately controlled by a sulfonylurea [^fb3160d8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with inadequate long-term blood glucose control with sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy require additional treatment. The synergistic effects of combining glipizide with metformin on glucose control may be realized by treating the primary effects of type 2 DM, impaired insulin secretion, and insulin resistance.

Objective

This study assessed therapy with glipizide/metformin combination tablets in patients with type 2 DM that is uncontrolled by at least half the maximum labeled daily dose of a sulfonylurea.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive glipizide 30-mg, metformin 500-mg, or glipizide/metformin 5/500 mg tablets for 18 weeks (metformin and glipizide/metformin doses were titrated to achieve blood glucose control). Maximum total daily doses were glipizide 30 mg, metformin 2000 mg, and glipizide/ metformin 20/2000 mg.

Results

A total of 247 patients were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 56.2 (10.1) years; 61.5% of patients were male; 70.0% were white, 15.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 13.0% were black, and 1.2% were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Patients were, on average, obese (mean [SD] body mass index, 31.3 [4.7] kg/m²), had moderate to severe hyperglycemia (mean [SD] glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 8.7% [1.1]), and had a mean (SD) DM duration of 6.5 (4.9) years. Glipizide/ metformin tablets controlled the HbA1c level more effectively than did either glipizide or metformin monotherapies (mean treatment differences, in favor of glipizide/ metformin, of -1.06% and -0.98%, respectively, P < 0.001). At study end, an HbA1c level < 7.0% was achieved in approximately 4-fold more patients who were treated with glipizide/metformin (36.3%) compared with glipizide (8.9%) or metformin (9.9%) monotherapies. Glipizide/metformin tablets also reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and the 3-hour postprandial glucose area under the concentration-time curve more effectively than did either monotherapy, without increasing the fasting insulin level. The greater blood glucose control with glipizide/ metformin tablets was achieved at a mean daily dose of glipizide/metformin 17.5/1747 mg, compared with mean doses of glipizide 30.0 mg or metformin 1927 mg. Treatments were well tolerated, with a low incidence of symptoms of hypoglycemia evidenced by a fingerstick blood glucose measurement ≤ 50 mg/dL in the combination group (12.6%); 1 patient discontinued the study treatment for this reason. No patient required medical assistance for hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Glipizide/metformin tablets were more effective than either glipizide or metformin monotherapy in controlling HbA1c and in reducing FPG compared with baseline in patients with blood glucose that was uncontrolled with previous sulfonylurea treatment. In addition, patients receiving glipizide/ metformin were more likely to achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0%. These results were consistent with the synergistic effects on insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Glipizide/metformin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations

Dosage of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient.

With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1cshould be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1cto normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

General

Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glipizide or any other anti-diabetic drug.

Renal and Hepatic Disease: The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.

Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.

Loss of Control of Blood Glucose: When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin.

The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.

Hemolytic Anemia: Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because glipizide belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In post-marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

Laboratory Tests

Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.

Hemolytic Anemia

Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because GLIPIZIDE XL belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In post marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

Laboratory Tests

Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically. Measurement of hemoglobin A1Cmay be useful.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed that Glipizide XL extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole. Patients should not chew, divide or crush tablets. Patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. In the Glipizide XL extended-release tablet, the medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell that has been specially designed to slowly release the drug so the body can absorb it. When this process is completed, the empty tablet is eliminated from the body.

Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of Glipizide XL and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.

The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure also should be explained.

Physician Counseling Information for Patients

In initiating treatment for type 2 diabetes, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken where possible. Use of GLIPIZIDE XL or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of GLIPIZIDE XL or other antidiabetic medications. Maintenance or discontinuation of GLIPIZIDE XL or other antidiabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.

### Kinetics-effect relations of insulin-releasing drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes: brief overview [^53386f0d]. Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Sulfonylureas and glinides have similar mechanisms of action but differ in receptor affinity and binding sites and in absorption and elimination rates. This promotes differences in potency, rate of onset, and duration of action. While prominent in single-dose studies, these differences have less importance during long-term sulfonylurea treatment: at ordinary dosages, rapid- and short-acting (glipizide) and slow- and long-acting (glyburide) sulfonylureas maintained continuously effective plasma levels and similar 24-h glucose control. Moreover, there was no difference in patient outcome between the first-generation sulfonylurea chlorpropamide and the second-generation glyburide in the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study. However, the risk of long-lasting and hence dangerous hypoglycemia is higher with these two long-acting sulfonylureas. Conversely, this risk should be low with the short-acting glinides, but seemingly at the expense of less effective glucose control. The most important kinetics-effect relations are that hyperglycemia delays sulfonylurea absorption and that the sulfonylurea dose-response curve is bell shaped; continuous sulfonylurea exposure over a certain level (e.g., 10 mg glipizide) impairs rather than improves insulin and glucose responses to sulfonylurea (downregulation). Accordingly, a vicious circle may be established: unrelenting hyperglycemia may promote sulfonylurea dose increase, which increases hyperglycemia, promoting further dose increase and eventually therapeutic failure.

General Considerations:

Dosage of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), to reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and to permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient.

With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1cshould be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1cto normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c(glycosylated hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

### The risk of overall mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving glipizide, glyburide, or glimepiride monotherapy: a retrospective analysis [^52654729]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

There are a variety of proposed mechanisms for an increased mortality risk with specific sulfonylureas. Despite the differing effects of individual sulfonylureas on the SUR receptors and myocardial ischemic preconditioning, there are also differing effects regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, independent of their SUR-binding characteristics, which may be influencing mortality. Among the sulfonylureas studied in our analysis, glyburide is the most common agent associated with documented hypoglycemia. Glyburide has been shown to continue to stimulate insulin secretion in the setting of profound hypoglycemia to a greater extent when compared with glimepiride, in part because glyburide accumulates within the β-cell, unlike other sulfonylureas, prolonging insulin secretion. Thus, hypoglycemia could be playing a dominant role in increasing the risk of mortality (more so than differing selectivity and effects on the SUR receptors and ischemic preconditioning, respectively), which has previously been reported with sulfonylureas, specifically when compared with metformin (,–). Other than the increased risk of hypoglycemia documented with glyburide (and the differences in other pharmacologic properties inherent to the individual sulfonylureas: SUR specificity and effects on ischemic myocardium), glipizide, glimepiride, and glyburide generally have very similar side-effect profiles.

The current study has limitations inherent to most retrospective studies. The analysis was based on exposure to a medication based on the initial prescription entered in the EHR; however, there is no documentation of compliance with the prescribed medication. The prescribed medication at baseline defined which medication group the patient belonged; however, the medication exposure times after baseline are unknown. Current clinical practice procedures suggest that it is more likely for additional agents to be added to a baseline medication than to switch from one class of medication to another or from one sulfonylurea to another. Approximately 70% of the cohort remained on a single drug (baseline medication) throughout their time in the cohort.

The medication groups in our study were not balanced with respect to baseline variables and risk factors; however, the multivariable analysis adjusted for the differences in baseline variables and risk factors that had the most relevance with respect to the risk of mortality. Although some covariates may have changed over time, we would not anticipate these changes to favor one specific sulfonylurea versus another (besides the inherent characteristics of the individual agents). Nonetheless, we could not adjust for differences in unmeasured variables or characteristics.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^0f60cf47]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the context of a dose-titration scheme designed to optimize efficacy and minimize hypoglycemic episodes with glipizide, this head-to-head comparison study demonstrated that the novel SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin produced a long-term HbA 1c mean reduction at 52 weeks that was numerically identical and statistically noninferior to the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients poorly controlled with metformin monotherapy. This comparable long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin with a sulfonylurea, considered potent glucose-lowering agents, was achieved with > 10-fold fewer hypoglycemic episodes along with sustained weight loss. In contrast, weight increased and hypoglycemic episodes were more frequent with glipizide.

The pattern of HbA 1c change over time was substantially different between dapagliflozin and glipizide treatment (Fig. 1 A). The pattern with glipizide — rapid initial response, followed by gradual increase — is typical of that observed with sulfonylureas. In contrast, dapagliflozin response was initially smaller during titration but thereafter was sustained during the maintenance period such that it was identical to glipizide response at 52 weeks. It is interesting to speculate whether the durability of HbA 1c control with dapagliflozin will outlast that of glipizide during longer-term follow-up of these patients. In this population with a relatively low baseline mean HbA 1c (∼7.7%), clinically meaningful reductions of > 0.5% were achieved by both agents. A higher baseline HbA 1c, as observed in other clinical efficacy studies of antidiabetic agents, generally predicts larger drops in response to treatment, whichever agent is tested.

Sulfonylureas in Type 2 Diabetes Treatment

History of SUs

The history of SUs began in 1937 with the discovery of the hypoglycemic activity of synthetic sulfur containing compounds by Ruiz et al. Their efficacy on stimulation of β cell release of insulin was acknowledged in 1946, and within a decade they were introduced as the first OADs in the treatment of diabetes. Starting from 1950s with tolbutamide and followed by the introduction of the other first-generation agents (chlorpropamide, acetohexamide, and tolazamide), more potent second-generation agents [gliclazide, glipizide, gliquidone, and glibenclamide (glyburide)] and the third-generation agents [glimepiride, gliclazide MR, and glipizide MR/extended release (XL)], SUs have become the most widely distributed OADs in mainstream clinical practice for more than 60 years (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of sulfonylureas

SUs can also be classified either according to their hierarchy of development (conventional and newer-generation SUs) or based on the duration of action (short-, intermediate-, and long-acting). Conventional SUs include tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, and glipizide, while newer-generation safer and more potent SUs include glimepiride, gliclazide, gliclazide MR, and glipizide MR/XL (Table 1).

Mechanisms of Sulfonylurea Action

In basal physiological conditions, insulin release from β cells is considered to be minimal and the β cell membrane remains hyperpolarized. Upon glucose entry into the pancreatic β cells through the glucose transporter GLUT2, a cascade of events starts that finally leads to insulin secretion, including metabolization of intracellular glucose, increase in intracellular ATP levels, inhibition of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channels, depolarization of the β cell membrane, Ca 2+ influx via opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, and a rise in cytosolic Ca 2+, which stimulates the exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules.

SUs, by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunit of the K ATP channel, also induce channel closure and membrane depolarization, independent of the intracellular glucose entry, followed by a similar cascade of intracellular events until insulin secretion (Fig. 1).

Mechanism of Action

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the general mechanism of action of SUs. In brief, SUs stimulate the release of insulin from the β cells of the pancreatic islets via closure of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channel. The same channel can be closed by a buildup of ATP, the end-product of mitochondrial glycolysis. Once the K ATP channel is blocked, intracellular K + ions start to accumulate, which depolarizes the inner membrane of the cell, leading to an influx of extracellular Ca 2+. These calcium ions bind to insulin vesicles and promote insulin release into the circulation. Once insulin latches onto its cell receptor, it activates the glucose transporter GLUT2, which transports glucose molecules into the cell, initiating mitochondrial glycolysis. It should be mentioned that K ATP channels are also abundant in several tissues other than pancreatic β cells, including muscles (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth) as well as some neurons. These extrapancreatic K ATP channels respond to different SU classes based on their sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) affinities. Tolbutamide (a first-generation SU), glibenclamide (a second-generation SU), and glimepiride (sometimes classified as a third-generation SU), for instance, target the SUR-1 found in β cells and, to a certain extent, the SURs 2A and 2B found in cardiac tissue and smooth muscle, respectively, while gliclazide MR (a third-generation SU) only has a high affinity for SUR-1. The restoration of the early insulin peak secondary to glucose and the stronger reversible binding of gliclazide MR to the β cell's SUR1 receptor compared to other SUs could be responsible for reduced pancreatic stimulation, which translates into a reduced incidence of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, this affinity for extrapancreatic SURs has been hypothesized to inhibit ischemic preconditioning and to translate into varying degrees of adverse hypoglycemia and cardiovascular outcomes with some SUs. These are also the same pharmacodynamics that made SUs the drugs of choice for neonatal diabetes secondary to genetic mutations in K ATP channels.

Fig. 1
Mechanism of action of SUs. The SU blocks the K ATP channel once it binds to a SUR, leading to an alteration in internal membrane polarity and causing an influx of Ca 2+, which then promotes exocytosis of insulin vesicles

Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin

For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.

Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.

### Glipizide (glipizide XL) [^aef68faf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Glipizide is eliminated primarily by hepatic biotransformation: less than 10% of a dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces; approximately 90% of a dose is excreted as biotransformation products in urine (80%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites of glipizide are products of aromatic hydroxylation and have no hypoglycemic activity. A minor metabolite which accounts for less than 2% of a dose, an acetylamino-ethyl benzene derivative, is reported to have 1/10 to 1/3 as much hypoglycemic activity as the parent compound. The mean total body clearance of glipizide was approximately 3 liters per hour after single intravenous doses in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mean apparent volume of distribution was approximately 10 liters. Glipizide is 98–99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. The mean terminal elimination half-life of glipizide ranged from 2 to 5 hours after single or multiple doses in patients with type 2 diabetes. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glipizide after single dose administration to older diabetic subjects compared to younger healthy subjects. There is only limited information regarding the effects of renal impairment on the disposition of glipizide, and no information regarding the effects of hepatic disease. However, since glipizide is highly protein bound and hepatic biotransformation is the predominant route of elimination, the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glipizide may be altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

In mice no glipizide or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females. In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug.

Combination Use

When adding other blood-glucose-lowering agents to Glipizide XL for combination therapy, the agent should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose, and patients should be observed carefully for hypoglycemia. Refer to the product information supplied with the oral agent for additional information.

When adding Glipizide XL to other blood-glucose-lowering agents, Glipizide XL can be initiated at 5 mg. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs may be started at a lower dose. Titration should be based on clinical judgment.

Patients Receiving Insulin

As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, many patients with stable type 2 diabetes receiving insulin may be transferred safely to treatment with Glipizide XL extended-release tablets. When transferring patients from insulin to Glipizide XL, the following general guidelines should be considered:

For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and Glipizide XL therapy may begin at usual dosages. Several days should elapse between titration steps.

For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and Glipizide XL therapy may begin at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response. Several days should elapse between titration steps.

During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily. Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests are abnormal. In some cases, especially when the patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.

Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents

As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to Glipizide XL extended-release tablets. Patients should be observed carefully (1–2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to Glipizide XL due to potential overlapping of drug effect.

Fig. 1
Mechanism of action of sulfonylureas on pancreatic β cells and cardiomyocytes

The K ATP channel is a hetero-octameric complex of two different types of protein subunits, including an inwardly rectifying K + channel (Kir6.x: Kir6.1, Kir6.2) and a SUR (SUR1, SUR2A, SUR2B). K ATP channels, with different subunit composition, are also found in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Opening of K ATP channels in response to metabolic stress leads to inhibition of electrical activity in all these tissues. Basically, Kir6.2 serves as the pore-forming subunit and associates with SUR1 in pancreatic β cells and with SUR2A in cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle, while Kir6.1 associates with SUR2B in vascular smooth muscle. This variation in the subunit composition of the K ATP channel accounts for the different metabolic and drug sensitivities of K ATP channels in different cells. SUs (i.e. tolbutamide, gliclazide, glimepiride) close K ATP channels by binding with high affinity to SUR and also interact with Kir6.2, but with low affinity.

In fact, while SUs are categorized as a drug class, they substantially differ in terms of individual SUR subtype specificity and affinity, determining their hypoglycemia risk and effects on ischemic preconditioning. Hence, individual SU expresses a different selectivity for SUR1 (β cell type), SUR2A (myocardial), and SUR2B (vascular smooth muscle) receptors. Gliclazide and glipizide specifically bind and block channels containing SUR1 (β cell type), but not SUR2 (cardiac, smooth muscle types), whereas glibenclamide and glimepiride can nonspecifically bind and block both types of SUR1- and SUR2-containing channels. Accordingly, both glimepiride and glibenclamide carry the potential to mediate effects both at the level of heart and smooth muscles. However, only glibenclamide possesses the characteristics to abolish ischemic preconditioning, a cardioprotective phenomenon limiting ischemic injury or infarct size after repeated episodes of ischemia, via blocking the cardiac myocyte K ATP channels (Fig. 1).

### Approaches to treatment of type 2 diabetes [^beefb442]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Mechanistically based treatment considerations

At the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Postgraduate Course, Ralph DeFronzo (San Antonio, TX) reviewed the mechanisms of action and utility of various antidiabetic drugs, suggesting that sulfonylureas "are very unlikely to create a durable decline in A1C", based on understanding of the physiology. Studies with glimepiride and glipizide show falls in fasting glucose of 40–50 mg/dl and in A1C by 1.5% — with monotherapy controlling 25–30% of patients — which he characterized as "a very good effect, initially". However, DeFronzo said that "after the first 6–12 months the A1C starts to rise progressively". Sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion increases portal insulin levels, suppressing hepatic glucose production and lowering fasting glucose to a greater extent than postprandial glucose. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), sulfonylureas and insulin reduced microvascular risk by 37%, but myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive health failure decreased by 14, 12, and 16% (none of the latter decreases reaching statistical significance), leading DeFronzo to contend that "there is no evidence that treatment with insulin-based therapy" reduces macrovascular disease.

General

Macrovascular Outcomes

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUCOTROL XL or any other anti-diabetic drug.

Renal and Hepatic Disease

The pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glipizide may be affected in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.

GI Disease

Markedly reduced GI retention times of the GLUCOTROL XL Extended Release Tablets may influence the pharmacokinetic profile and hence the clinical efficacy of the drug.

Hypoglycemia

All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may affect the disposition of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used. Therapy with a combination of glucose-lowering agents may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.

Loss of Control of Blood Glucose

When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin.

The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given. Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure.

Hemolytic Anemia

Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because GLUCOTROL XL belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In post marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

### Cardiovascular events in individuals treated with sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors [^8d698f42]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

A 13% relative increase in cardiovascular risk, like the one estimated in this study, is potentially clinically impactful. Decreases in cardiovascular risk of this magnitude have generally been thought to be sufficient for approval of medications for prevention of cardiovascular events, particularly in high-risk populations. The estimated absolute increase of 1.1% in risk of cardiovascular events was modest in this population at moderate risk but could be greater in a high-risk population. This study's findings therefore suggest caution in prescribing glipizide to individuals at moderate cardiovascular risk or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Treatment with sulfonylureas also has other risks, in particular hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is thought to be higher for glyburide than for shorter acting sulfonylureas. Choice between individual sulfonylureas should therefore be made in an individualized manner, balancing the risks and benefits based on the particular patient's health profile.

The potentially different cardiovascular risk between individual sulfonylureas in our study underscores the importance of evaluating each agent in a particular pharmacological class on its own merits. In multiple instances, individual pharmaceuticals were found to have a different risk-benefit profile than other medications in the same class. Among sulfonylureas, in particular, tolbutamide was found to have a greater risk of cardiovascular events, and glyburide was found to have a higher risk of hypoglycemia. These findings caution against extrapolating results of studies evaluating a single agent to the entire class, and temper concerns about the use of research and development resources for the development of multiple agents in the same pharmacological class.

In addition to pancreatic β cells, sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) are also found on cardiomyocytes (SUR 2A) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SUR 2B). Decrease in cardiac ischemic preconditioning after exposure to sulfonylureas has been found in animal experiments. This effect has been proposed as a possible mechanism for an increased cardiovascular risk from sulfonylureas. However, glipizide is not thought to have a greater affinity for either SUR 2A or SUR 2B vs pancreatic SURs (SUR 1) compared with other sulfonylureas. Furthermore, this mechanism would not explain possible differential effects on stroke. Further research is therefore needed to establish pathophysiological mechanisms of the increased incidence of cardiovascular events with glipizide.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Recommendations for SUs in T2DM Management

Modern SUs confer a lower risk of hypoglycemia and have favorable cost, efficacy, and safety profiles. Sulfonylureas constitute a reasonable choice among glucose-lowering medications, especially when cost is the key consideration. Patient education and use of variable dosing of modern sulfonylureas should be considered to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia. Glipizide, glimepiride, and gliclazide have lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to conventional sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas should be used with great caution in patients who are at increased risk of hypoglycemia, such as those with chronic kidney disease and older patients.

Hidden Facets of SUs

Selection of a specific SU should be done on the basis of efficacy, safety, and tissue specificity with respect to the β-cell. Modern SUs exhibit additional benefits over conventional SUs, which guide the choice of treatment in the management of DM. A few of these benefits have been listed below:
Effects on the pancreas Modern SUs cause stimulation of pancreatic insulin release. Modern SUs inhibit glucagon secretion by pancreatic α-cells.
Extra-pancreatic effects Modern SUs reduce insulin clearance in the liver. Modern SUs increase the levels of adiponectin. Modern SUs improve insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, thereby offering a glucose-lowering effect.

### Glimepiride in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the worldwide therapeutic experience [^dfcbe6de]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Sulfonylureas (SUs) have been used for many years as first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose levels have not been effectively controlled by diet and exercise alone. Glimepiride is a once-daily SU that was introduced in 1995. Since then, a considerable body of evidence has been amassed regarding its use in type 2 diabetes.

Objective

This review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical practice.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer of glimepiride provided additional information.

Results

Glimepiride differs from other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs. Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control.

Conclusion

Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes.

### Long-term beneficial effects of glipizide treatment on glucose tolerance in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance [^cca85bff]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the efficacy and long-term effects of glipizide treatment on glucose and insulin metabolism in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Methods

Thirty-seven first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes fulfilling WHO criteria for IGT were randomized to treatment with either glipizide 2.5 mg once daily or matching placebo for 6 months. A 75 g, 2-h oral (OGTT) and 60 min intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 6 months. The subjects were followed up for another 12 months after discontinuation of treatment and a repeat OGTT was performed at 18 months.

Results

Thirty-three subjects fulfilled the study. Markers of insulin sensitivity - i.e. fasting insulin and HOMA(IR)-index - improved in the glipizide group (P = 0.04 and 0.02 respectively) as well as HDL cholesterol (P = 0.05) compared with placebo group after 6 months. At 18 months, both fasting and 2 h glucose concentrations were significantly lower in the glipizide group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.04 and 0.03 respectively). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 29.4% in the placebo group and 5.9% in the glipizide group at 18 months. This equals an 80% relative risk reduction in the active treatment group.

Conclusions

Short-term treatment with glipizide improves glucose and insulin metabolism in subjects with IGT primarily by improving insulin sensitivity mediated by lowering glucose toxicity, thereby providing the beta cells rest. Larger studies are needed to establish whether these effects are sufficient to prevent progression to manifest type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular morbidity in subjects at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^de8895fc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

The full analysis set comprised 801 patients (dapagliflozin: n = 400; glipizide: n = 401) and the safety analysis set, 814 patients (dapagliflozin: n = 406; glipizide: n = 408). Overall, 77.9% of randomized patients completed the study. The commonest reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, AEs, and no longer meeting study criteria. Efficacy analyses used LOCF and the full analysis set, which included 98.2% of randomized patients; therefore, almost all of the discontinued patients were included in these analyses. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups.

At the end of the titration period, 353 patients (86.9%) randomized to receive dapagliflozin were receiving the maximum dose of 10 mg, whereas 296 patients (72.5%) randomized to receive glipizide were receiving the maximum dose of 20 mg, resulting in mean doses of 9.2 mg for dapagliflozin and 16.4 mg for glipizide. During the titration period, seven patients receiving glipizide versus none receiving dapagliflozin were down-titrated to receive no study treatment. Overall, 2.7% of patients receiving dapagliflozin versus 15.9% of those receiving glipizide were down-titrated during the titration or maintenance periods.

Primary end point

The HbA 1c adjusted mean change from baseline at week 52 for dapagliflozin was −0.52 (95% CI −0.60 to −0.44) vs. −0.52 (−0.60 to −0.44) for glipizide; hence, the dapagliflozin HbA 1c mean difference from glipizide at week 52 was 0.00 (−0.11 to 0.11). Thus, HbA 1c change with dapagliflozin was statistically noninferior to that with glipizide at week 52.

Although the initial drop in HbA 1c during the titration period with glipizide was greater than that observed with dapagliflozin, efficacy for glipizide waned during the maintenance period but remained stable for dapagliflozin. This resulted in equivalent efficacy at week 52 (Fig. 1 A). During the maintenance period, 5.1% of patients in the glipizide group were down-titrated versus 0.5% in the dapagliflozin group.

### Current position of gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the contemporary treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^22f0b764]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Different selectivity for SUR1 (β cell type), SUR2A (myocardial), and SUR2B (vascular smooth muscle) receptors expressed by individual SUs. Gliclazide and glipizide specifically bind and block channels containing SUR1 (β cell type), but not SUR2 (cardiac, smooth muscle types). Glibenclamide (abolishes ischemic preconditioning via blocking cardiac myocyte KATP channels) and glimepiride (no effect on cardiac myocyte KATP channels or ischemic preconditioning) can nonspecifically bind and block both types of SUR1- and SUR2-containing channels and carry the potential to mediate effects both at the level of heart and smooth muscles.

SUs also inhibit glucagon secretion from pancreatic α cells via direct stimulation of somatostatin release through a similar mechanism as well as with the paracrine effect of increased insulin. In this way, they provide glycemic control by increasing insulin release, by decreasing the hepatic glucose output via decreased glucagon release, and by reducing the hepatic uptake and the metabolic clearance rate of insulin.

SUs in Diabetes Treatment

The glucose-lowering efficacy of SUs (mean HbA1c reduction of 1.0–1.5%) is similar to metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and better than newer agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5–1.0%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (mean HbA1c reduction of 0.4–0.9%).

Newer generation SUs (glimepiride and gliclazide MR) are considered effective and safe as second-line agents in patients with metformin failure, and also as first-line agents if used in combination with lifestyle modification and metformin in patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 7.5%. They also offer glucose-lowering efficacy with minimal side effects, when used as dual or triple therapy in combination with other antidiabetic agents.

Notably, all SUs are not similar in terms of their efficacies, adverse effects, and tolerability. Newer generation SUs such as gliclazide MR offer more favorable efficacy and safety profiles. However, clinical utility of SUs and their place in diabetes treatment are being surpassed by newer, more expensive therapies; however, SUs are valuable treatment option for many patients with T2D, particularly in the resource-limited settings.

### Glipizide (glipizide XL) [^097b2ed7]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy Category C

Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5–50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glipizide. In studies in rats and rabbits no teratogenic effects were found. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Glipizide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood-glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood-glucose levels as close to normal as possible.

Nonteratogenic Effects

Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. If glipizide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected delivery date.

Nursing Mothers

Although it is not known whether glipizide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of glipizide XL PO (also known as Glucotrol XL):
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the risk of increased cardiovascular mortality observed with tolbutamide may also apply to other sulfonylureas.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients at risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients, concomitant use of other hypoglycemic medications or alcohol, patients with renal, hepatic, adrenal, or pituitary impairment, malnutrition, calorie deficit, or after severe or prolonged exercise. Reduce the starting dose to 2.5 mg daily in elderly patients and in patients with hepatic impairment or receiving other hypoglycemic agents.

### The role of glimepiride in the effective management of type 2 diabetes [^a644c2b4]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a disorder of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, has reached epidemic proportions. The effective management of Type 2 diabetes is of vital concern to clinicians. The identification of high-risk individuals and lifestyle management can help control diabetes; however, most patients require pharmacologic intervention. The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to achieve adequate glycemic control while avoiding hypoglycemia and weight gain and to minimize the risk of future micro- and macrovascular complications. There are a number of available glucose-lowering agents from which to choose. This review focuses on the sulfonylureas, the first oral agents introduced for the management of Type 2 diabetes, which are effective, well-tolerated, and well-established drugs, Second-generation sulfonylureas are now widely used in the management of Type 2 diabetes. The most recent addition, glimepiride, can be used in combination with metformin, the thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin. The unique properties of glimepiride may provide advantages over other currently available insulin secretagogues.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head trials comparing sulfonylureas and low hypoglycaemic risk antidiabetic drugs [^070bf46f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Type of sulfonylurea

Our subgroup analysis suggested that glipizide had the strongest effect on increasing all-cause mortality (8 studies, 6780 participants; OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.25–3.18; I² = 0%), while glimepiride (13 studies, 12540 participants; OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.59–1.91; I² = 0%), glibenclamide (three studies, 3361 participants; OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58–1.56; I² = 0%), and gliclazide (two studies, 2099 participants; OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.55–3.74; I² = 0%) did not increase all-cause mortality (Fig. 4). We also analysed all-cause mortality according to different comparator drug classes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Sulfonylureas posed higher risk of mortality only in comparison with DPP-4 inhibitors (12 studies, 12,594 participants; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.08–2.69; I² = 0%) but not with other drug classes. However, in vast majority of studies (8 of 12 contributing 84% weight to analysis) gliclazide was used as SU.

Glipizide (8 studies, 6780 participants; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13–2.13; I² = 0%) and glimepiride (9 studies, 10,248 participants; OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06–2.17; I² = 0%) were associated with an increased risk for MACE, while glibenclamide (2 studies, 3313 participants; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55–1.24; I² = 0%) lacked this potential (Fig. 5).

### Association between use of warfarin with common sulfonylureas and serious hypoglycemic events: retrospective cohort analysis [^2b4913a8]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Potential mechanisms

Although the underlying mechanism of action for an interaction between warfarin and glipizide/glimepiride is unclear, existing evidence suggests two possible mechanisms for increased risk of hypoglycemia. The first is through displaced protein binding, as seen with first generation sulfonylureas (acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, tolazamide, and tolbutamide). This interaction occurs when a second drug (in this case warfarin) is added that displaces the sulfonylurea, thus increasing its plasma drug concentration and drug activity, leading to potentiation of hypoglycemia. However, changes in protein binding have been shown not to have meaningful pharmacodynamics or clinical effects. The second possible mechanism is through competition for the CYP2C9 hepatic metabolic pathway. Because glimepiride, glipizide, and warfarin are all primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, larger doses of warfarin may limit the rate at which the sulfonylurea can be metabolized. However, no empirical evidence exists to support this mechanism, and we can only hypothesize on the basis of the drugs' pharmacokinetic characteristics.

Limitations of study

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, drug use was not directly measured. Warfarin dose and international normalized ratio values are potentially informative but cannot be measured in pharmacy claims. Our use of prescription fills as a proxy for use allowed for a large and representative sample but may have introduced measurement error into the analysis. Also, some patients may have first used warfarin concurrently with glipizide/glimepiride before enrollment in Medicare. Such sources of measurement error could have led to attenuation bias in our estimates of the relation between use of warfarin with glipizide/glimepiride and risk of hypoglycemia. Secondly, our findings may be confounded by unmeasured characteristics of patients that are correlated with both warfarin use and hypoglycemia risk. Although we cannot definitively rule out such confounding, our analyses were robust to several specifications intended to minimize this problem. Thirdly, our results may not be generalizable beyond the elderly population.

### Glipizide [^82d546d1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients Receiving Insulin: As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may be safely placed on Glipizide tablets. When transferring patients from insulin to glipizide tablets, the following general guidelines should be considered:

For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and glipizide therapy may begin at usual dosages. Several days should elapse between glipizide titration steps.

For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and glipizide therapy may begin at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response. Several days should elapse between glipizide titration steps.

During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily. Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests are abnormal. In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.

Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to glipizide. Patients should be observed carefully (1–2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to glipizide due to potential overlapping of drug effect.

When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, glipizide tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^810605c9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Although initially effective, sulfonylureas are associated with poor glycemic durability, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independent of insulin and may cause fewer of these adverse effects. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin with the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This 52-week, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomized patients with type 2 diabetes (baseline mean HbA 1c, 7.7%), who were receiving metformin monotherapy, to add-on dapagliflozin (n = 406) or glipizide (n = 408) up-titrated over 18 weeks, based on glycemic response and tolerability, to ≤ 10 or ≤ 20 mg/day, respectively.

RESULTS

The primary end point, adjusted mean HbA 1c reduction with dapagliflozin (−0.52%) compared with glipizide (−0.52%), was statistically noninferior at 52 weeks. Key secondary end points: dapagliflozin produced significant adjusted mean weight loss (−3.2 kg) versus weight gain (1.2 kg; P < 0.0001) with glipizide, significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5% body weight reduction (33.3%) versus glipizide (2.5%; P < 0.0001), and significantly decreased the proportion experiencing hypoglycemia (3.5%) versus glipizide (40.8%; P < 0.0001). Events suggestive of genital infections and lower urinary tract infections were reported more frequently with dapagliflozin compared with glipizide but responded to standard treatment and rarely led to study discontinuation.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite similar 52-week glycemic efficacy, dapagliflozin reduced weight and produced less hypoglycemia than glipizide in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin. Long-term studies are required to further evaluate genital and urinary tract infections with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^2d9a01ce]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Sulfonylurea Monotherapy:

In an 18-week, double-blind, active-controlled U.S. clinical trial, a total of 247 patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 12% and FPG < 300 mg/dL) while being treated with at least one-half the maximum labeled dose of a sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide 10 mg, glipizide 20 mg) were randomized to receive glipizide (fixed dose, 30 mg), metformin (500 mg), or glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/500 mg. The doses of metformin and glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets were titrated (up to the eight-week visit) to a maximum of four tablets daily as needed to achieve MDG ≤ 130 mg/dL. Trial data at 18 weeks are summarized in Table 3.

After 18 weeks, treatment with glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets at doses up to 20 mg/2000 mg per day resulted in significantly lower mean final HbA1cand significantly greater mean reductions in FPG compared to glipizide and to metformin therapy. Treatment with glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets lowered the three-hour postprandial glucose AUC, compared to baseline, to a significantly greater extent than did the glipizide and the metformin therapies. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets did not significantly affect fasting insulin levels.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in changes from baseline for all lipid parameters between glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy and either metformin therapy or glipizide therapy. The adjusted mean changes from baseline in body weight were: glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/500 mg, -0.3 kg; glipizide, -0.4 kg; and metformin, -2.7 kg. Weight loss was greater with metformin than with glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.

Glycemic Control

The results from the primary analysis in the original clinical study showed that the least squares (LS) mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52 were similar between alogliptin and glipizide (Fig. 2). Indeed, the reduction from baseline in LS mean observed HbA1c values was similar for both the alogliptin and glipizide groups throughout the 52-week study (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Mean change in HbA1c ± SE (observed and primary endpoint) from baseline to Week 52 in the per-protocol set. HbA1c glycosylated hemoglobin, LS least squares, SE standard error. Figure adapted from Rosenstock et al.

An exploratory analysis of the per-protocol set, conducted in the primary study, revealed larger reductions in HbA1c among patients who completed the study (−0.47% and −0.31% with alogliptin and glipizide, respectively) than among rescued patients (0.61% and 0.53% with alogliptin and glipizide, respectively). Similarly, greater HbA1c reductions occurred among drug-naïve patients (−0.32% and −0.12% with alogliptin and glipizide, respectively) than among the 45.6% of monotherapy patients who entered the study after a 4-week washout (0.09% and −0.03% with alogliptin and glipizide, respectively).

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^0884f281]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Alone

For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are 2.5 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. For patients whose FPG is 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL a starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg twice daily should be considered. The efficacy of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients whose FPG exceeds 320 mg/dL has not been established. Dosage increases to achieve adequate glycemic control should be made in increments of 1 tablet per day every 2 weeks up to maximum of 10 mg/1000 mg or 10 mg/2000 mg Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets per day given in divided doses. In clinical trials of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day.

Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride and periodically thereafter.

Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

Initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride in patients with an eGFR between 30–45 mL/minute/1.73 m²is not recommended.

In patients taking glipizide and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy.

Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². (See WARNINGS.)

Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures

Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart glipizide and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.

Specific Patient Populations:

Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

### Are all glitazones the same? [^05c2a14f]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

This supplement focuses on the benefits of targeting insulin resistance through therapy with a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or 'glitazones'. There are important differences between the three TZD class members that warrant discussion to enable physicians to make rational and informed therapeutic choices between the agents. Overall the TZDs appear to be similar in their effects on blood glucose, as all class members have demonstrated effective glycaemic control, both as monotherapy and in combination with sulphonylureas, metformin or exogenous insulin. The safety profiles of the three agents are more diverse, with what appear to be 'TZD class effects', (probably mediated via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPAR gamma]) and 'TZD-specific effects', which are unique to each agent and may be a consequence of differing chemical structures. While rosiglitazone and pioglitazone share some class effects with troglitazone, they have several characteristics that define them as unique agents. By tackling the control of type 2 diabetes through direct effects on insulin resistance, the TZDs represent an important new therapeutic tool for healthcare professionals.

Background

Oral antidiabetic agents are the initial and most commonly used therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. To effectively utilize the oral antidiabetic agents, familiarity with the efficacy and side effects of each agent is essential so that strategies for effective therapy with 1 or more agents can be developed when transitioning is needed either with monotherapy or to combination therapy with another antidiabetic agent.

Objectives

The purposes of this article were to review the efficacy and adverse-event profile of sulfonylureas, the most widely used class of oral antidiabetic agents in the United States, and to provide a simple set of guidelines for use in transitioning patients between sulfonylureas or to combination therapy.

Methods

A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases for the years 1966 to present and a thorough review of abstracts of recently presented clinical trials were used to identify relevant literature on dosing conversion and equivalence between sulfonylureas. Search terms used were as follows: sulfonylureas, dosing conversion, equivalence, glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride, and combination therapy. Strategies are provided for switching patients between sulfonylureas so that switching within the sulfonylurea class or to a combination tablet can be accomplished efficaciously and safely. Recommendations for dosing conversion were based on the results of the literature and abstract search, manufacturer recommendations for each available agent, and the author's clinical experience.

Results

When switching between agents or starting combination therapy, it is important to monitor for hypoglycemia. Fasting serum glucose levels and glycosylated hemoglobin should also be monitored to determine the optimal dose of sulfonylurea for each patient Patients not achieving adequate control on a single agent should be transferred to combination therapy.

Conclusion

When transferring a diabetic patient to a combination tablet, improved compliance, cost savings, and better glycemic control may be achieved.

### Durability of the efficacy and safety of alogliptin compared with glipizide in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a 2-year study [^a438b59d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the long-term durability of the efficacy of alogliptin compared with glipizide in combination with metformin in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on stable-dose metformin.

Methods

This multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study randomized 2639 patients aged 18–80 years to 104 weeks of treatment with metformin in addition to alogliptin 12.5 mg once daily (n = 880), alogliptin 25 mg once daily (n = 885) or glipizide 5 mg once daily, titrated to a maximum of 20 mg (n = 874). The primary endpoint was least square mean change from baseline in HbA1c level at 104 weeks.

Results

The mean patient age was 55.4 years, the mean diabetes duration was 5.5 years and the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.6%. HbA1c reductions at week 104 were -0.68%, -0.72% and -0.59% for alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg and glipizide, respectively [both doses met the criteria for non-inferiority to glipizide (p < 0.001); alogliptin 25 mg met superiority criteria (p = 0.010)]. Fasting plasma glucose concentration decreased by 0.05 and 0.18 mmol/l for alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively, and increased by 0.30 mmol/l for glipizide (p < 0.001 for both comparisons with glipizide). Mean weight changes were -0.68, -0.89 and 0.95 kg for alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg and glipizide, respectively (p < 0.001 for both comparisons with glipizide). Hypoglycaemia occurred in 23.2% of patients in the glipizide group vs. 2.5 and 1.4% of patients in the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg groups, respectively. Pancreatitis occurred in one patient in the alogliptin 25 mg group and three in the glipizide group.

Conclusions

Alogliptin efficacy was sustained over 2 years in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^498146c6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Weight loss with dapagliflozin was progressive during the first 6 months and stabilized during the latter half of the study. This may have resulted from glucosuria-induced fat loss, fluid loss associated with osmotic diuresis, or a combination of both. Studies of body composition are underway to assess the relative contributions of fat and fluid loss to the changes in TBW observed with dapagliflozin.

Dapagliflozin reduced blood pressure. The mechanism for this effect is unclear but may involve osmotic diuresis or sodium loss. Although modest rises in hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen occurred, no meaningful changes were noted in electrolytes, serum creatinine, heart rate, or proportions of patients experiencing orthostatic hypotension to indicate dehydration. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and concentrations of cystatin-C did not show meaningful changes. In addition, AEs of renal impairment or failure — excluding those of decrease in creatinine clearance calculated using current body weight values at each study visit — were not over-represented with dapagliflozin. Taken together, these data suggest that dapagliflozin treatment was not associated with clinically relevant dehydration or impairment in kidney function.

Patients with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of fungal genital infections and UTIs compared with the general population. Dapagliflozin-treated patients, especially women, reported an increase in events suggestive of genital infections and lower UTIs compared with glipizide-treated patients. For conservative pharmacovigilance purposes with this first-in-class agent, events suggestive of genital infection and UTI were reported spontaneously and in response to questions proactively posed to patients that were related to the signs and symptoms of these infections. Not all of these suggestive events could be confirmed as infections (Table 1). Variable reports of these events have been noted in previous studies with dapagliflozin; hence, further analyses using pooled data are required to better evaluate potential risk factors for genital and UTIs with SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin.

In conclusion, this head-to-head comparison of dapagliflozin versus glipizide added to metformin in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy demonstrated similar glycemic efficacy at 52 weeks but markedly divergent effects on weight and hypoglycemia. Whereas glipizide treatment led to weight gain and more hypoglycemic episodes, dapagliflozin produced significant weight loss and significantly fewer hypoglycemic episodes. Dapagliflozin treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, but events suggestive of genital and lower UTIs were observed more frequently in this study. Dapagliflozin is a potential valuable alternative to sulfonylureas as add-on therapy when metformin monotherapy fails to maintain adequate glycemic control.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^67a6b603]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Although initially effective, sulfonylureas are associated with poor glycemic durability, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independent of insulin and may cause fewer of these adverse effects. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin with the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

Research Design and Methods

This 52-week, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomized patients with type 2 diabetes (baseline mean HbA(1c), 7.7%), who were receiving metformin monotherapy, to add-on dapagliflozin (n = 406) or glipizide (n = 408) up-titrated over 18 weeks, based on glycemic response and tolerability, to ≤ 10 or ≤ 20 mg/day, respectively.

Results

The primary end point, adjusted mean HbA(1c) reduction with dapagliflozin (-0.52%) compared with glipizide (-0.52%), was statistically noninferior at 52 weeks. Key secondary end points: dapagliflozin produced significant adjusted mean weight loss (-3.2 kg) versus weight gain (1.2 kg; P < 0.0001) with glipizide, significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5% body weight reduction (33.3%) versus glipizide (2.5%; P < 0.0001), and significantly decreased the proportion experiencing hypoglycemia (3.5%) versus glipizide (40.8%; P < 0.0001). Events suggestive of genital infections and lower urinary tract infections were reported more frequently with dapagliflozin compared with glipizide but responded to standard treatment and rarely led to study discontinuation.

Conclusions

Despite similar 52-week glycemic efficacy, dapagliflozin reduced weight and produced less hypoglycemia than glipizide in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin. Long-term studies are required to further evaluate genital and urinary tract infections with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, compared with the sulfonylurea, glipizide, in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone: a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^c2371bf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin vs. glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) ≥ 6.5 and ≤ 10%] on metformin monotherapy.

Methods

After a metformin dose titration/stabilization period (≥ 1500 mg/day), 1172 patients were randomized to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. (N = 588) or glipizide 5 mg/day (uptitrated to a potential maximum 20 mg/day) (N = 584) for 52 weeks. The primary analysis assessed whether sitagliptin was non-inferior to glipizide regarding HbA(1c) changes from baseline at Week 52 using a per-protocol approach.

Results

From a mean baseline of 7.5%, HbA(1c) changes from baseline were -0.67% at Week 52 in both groups, confirming non-inferiority. The proportions achieving an HbA(1c) < 7% were 63% (sitagliptin) and 59% (glipizide). Fasting plasma glucose changes from baseline were -0.56 mmol/l (-10.0 mg/dl) and -0.42 mmol/l (-7.5 mg/dl) for sitagliptin and glipizide, respectively. The proportion of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia episodes was significantly (p < 0.001) higher with glipizide (32%) than with sitagliptin (5%), with 657 events in glipizide-treated patients compared with 50 events in sitagliptin-treated patients. Sitagliptin led to weight loss (change from baseline = -1.5 kg) compared with weight gain (+1.1 kg) with glipizide [between-treatment difference (95% confidence interval) = -2.5 kg (-3.1, -2.0); p < 0.001].

Conclusions

In this study, the addition of sitagliptin compared with glipizide provided similar HbA(1c)-lowering efficacy over 52 weeks in patients on ongoing metformin therapy. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia relative to glipizide and with weight loss compared with weight gain with glipizide.

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic renal insufficiency [^d19c1e59]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics and disposition

Overall, 426 patients were randomized into the study. Data from one study site (three patients) were considered potentially unreliable due to lack of compliance with Good Clinical Practice and excluded from all analyses. Of the remaining 423 randomized patients (sitagliptin, n = 211; glipizide, n = 212), 77.7% in the sitagliptin group and 80.2% in the glipizide group completed the 54-week study. The primary reasons for discontinuation in both treatment groups were AEs and withdrawal of informed consent. Demographic and anthropometric traits were generally similar for both treatment groups.

The mean dose of glipizide was 7.7 mg/day for the PP population. For the overall cohort of patients, the mean duration of exposure to study drug was 312 days in the sitagliptin group and 318 days in the glipizide group.

### The risk of overall mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving glipizide, glyburide, or glimepiride monotherapy: a retrospective analysis [^c3bf4bc3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

We have previously reported an increased risk of overall mortality with sulfonylurea monotherapy; however, sulfonylureas were analyzed as a class (as they have been historically). It is possible that meaningful clinical differences could exist between the different specific sulfonylureas given their differences in pharmacologic characteristics. Through our enterprise-wide electronic health record (EHR), we were able to identify users of a pancreatic-specific sulfonylurea, glipizide, and two non–pancreatic-specific sulfonylureas, glimepiride and glyburide (glibenclamide), with different effects on the ischemic myocardium (as well as differing risks of hypoglycemia), to determine whether differences in overall mortality risk are present, as this would have important implications when picking a sulfonylurea agent to control glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those with documented coronary artery disease (CAD).

### The place of sulfonylureas in guidelines: why are there differences? [^26f063de]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The EASD/ADA algorithm also highlights treatment choices where cost is a major issue, despite there being few places in the world where the cost of diabetes care is not a major problem. For example, in the USA, the cost of treating T2DM is increasing and with current costs of $237 billion per year. The prominent inclusion of this category in the algorithm implies that the lower socioeconomic groups should get inferior treatment, which is rather disconcerting since guidelines should ensure cost-effective and equitable care for all. Cost-effectiveness is based on measurable clinical endpoints (positive and negative) and does not necessarily equate to being the cheapest option. In fact, head-to-head studies of gliclazide versus DPP4 inhibitors demonstrated similar efficacy, minimal weight gain with gliclazide and no cases of severe hypoglycaemia. Also, at the time of publication of the ADA/EASD consensus, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs had not shown superiority when compared with conventional therapy with regard to major adverse CV event outcomes for patients without established ASCVD. A cost-effectiveness (taking into account all risks and benefits of) analysis for second-line therapies in patients without ASCVD undertaken in a first-world country clearly demonstrated that sulfonylureas remain the most cost-effective second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on metformin. In this analysis, the cost of gliclazide modified release was compared to all available DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulins. This analysis could find no measurable benefit that would have justified the higher cost of the other classes of drugs in patients without ASCVD.

Finally, the EASD/ADA do not provide guidelines for patients without compelling indications for particular drug classes in its algorithm, which is conceivably the majority of patients. Current evidence would suggest that in the absence of ASCVD, CKD or heart failure, a later-generation sulfonylurea (gliclazide > glimepiride) is still the most cost-effective second-line agent for these patients, even in a first world setting. This is probably the reason why, despite the negative narrative towards SUs over recent years, they remain the most widely prescribed second-line therapy, suggesting that practising physicians know something that the consensus experts do not.

### Comparison of treatment with sitagliptin or sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild renal impairment: a post hoc analysis of clinical trials [^546f2360]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

In Study 1, a dose-range finding study, subjects were randomized in an equal ratio among six treatment groups, of which two are appropriate for inclusion in the present analyses: the group randomized to sitagliptin (100 mg per day administered as 50 mg twice daily) and the group randomized to glipizide (in titrated doses). The primary study duration was 12 weeks, subsequently extended to 104 weeks. In Study 2, subjects were randomized 1:1 to sitagliptin (100 mg per day) or glipizide (in titrated doses). Study duration was 104 weeks with the primary time point at Week 52. In Study 3, subjects were randomized 1:1 to sitagliptin (100 mg per day) or glimepiride (in titrated doses). Study duration was 30 weeks. In all 3 studies, sulfonylureas (or matching placebo) were titrated based on self-performed fingerstick glucose values. Up-titration was withheld if the investigator considered that up-titration would place the subject at unacceptable risk for hypoglycemia, and down-titration could be done at any time during the study to prevent recurrent hypoglycemic events. The mean ± standard deviation dose of sulfonylurea achieved during the analysis period in subjects included in this analysis was 10.9 ± 5.9 mg glipizide per day, 10.4 ± 6.5 mg glipizide per day, and 2.0 ± 1.4 mg glimepiride per day in studies 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

As indicated above, the three studies had slight differences in their protocols, including background therapy (i.e. diet/exercise or metformin) and specific sulfonylurea comparator. However, efficacy and safety in both backgrounds are relevant to this analysis. Therefore, because it is not expected that a stable metformin background would impact body weight or hypoglycemic events, and because similar efficacy and side effect profiles of the two second-generation sulfonylureas were expected, data were combined from the three studies in order to increase the power and generalizability of the analysis.

All studies contributing data to the analysis reported here were conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice and were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory agencies. The analysis in this article is based on previously conducted studies, and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### A post hoc analysis of HbA1c, hypoglycemia, and weight change outcomes with alogliptin vs glipizide in older patients with type 2 diabetes [^1d29ead5]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adverse events and complications limit the long-term use of current antidiabetic treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly for older adults who are often receiving therapy for other comorbid conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, alogliptin, versus glipizide, a sulfonylurea, in achieving glycemic control without the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, or both in older patients with T2DM.

Methods

This was an exploratory, post hoc analysis of a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing alogliptin and glipizide. Patients (n = 441) aged 65–90 years with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5–9.0% who failed on diet and exercise alone or who had inadequately controlled T2DM despite oral antidiabetic monotherapy were recruited from 110 sites across 15 countries. Alogliptin 25 mg (n = 222) or glipizide 5 mg up-titrated to 10 mg (n = 219) was administered once daily for 52 weeks. Composite endpoints of HbA1c ≤ 7.0% coupled with the absence of hypoglycemia and weight gain, or an HbA1c reduction of ≥ 0.5% in the absence of hypoglycemia and weight gain, were then measured.

Results

In the primary analysis, least squares mean HbA1c changes from baseline to Week 52 were similar in both the alogliptin and glipizide groups. The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% without hypoglycemia or weight gain was significantly higher for alogliptin versus glipizide (24% vs 13%, p < 0.03). Patients with a baseline HbA1c of < 8.0% receiving alogliptin were also more likely to achieve HbA1c ≤ 7.0% without hypoglycemia or weight gain than those receiving glipizide (29% vs 13%, p < 0.03).

Conclusion

Alogliptin demonstrated similar efficacy to glipizide in lowering HbA1c in older patients with T2DM, but with significantly more patients achieving an HbA1c ≤ 7.0% without hypoglycemia or an increase in body weight. These results particularly apply to patients with baseline HbA1c below 8.0%.

### Current position of gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the contemporary treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^ed3c9998]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This scoping review was prepared by an expert panel of endocrinology specialists. The current position of SUs as a class, and gliclazide MR specifically, with respect to changing treatment algorithms in the contemporary management of T2D was discussed, as supported by scientific evidence and expert clinical opinion. The literature search involved PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to June 2023 for studies that assessed the gliclazide and sulfonylureas in the management of type 2 diabetes, using the keywords: "sulfonylurea" OR "gliclazide MR" AND "type 2 diabetes mellitus" in addition to "mechanism of action", "oral antidiabetics", "metformin", "DPP-4 inhibitors", "SGLT2 inhibitor", "GLP-1 receptor agonist", "thiazolidinedione", "insulin", "monotherapy", "combination therapy", glycemic control", "sustainability", "glycemic variability", "hypoglycemia risk", "weight gain", "antioxidant", "macrovascular complications", "cardiac mortality", "morbidity", "efficacy", "safety", "elderly", "renal disease", "hepatic disease", "Ramadan fasting", and "monogenic diabetes". In accordance with the scope of an expert panel-based narrative review, the inclusion of studies was limited to provide the scientific evidence within the context of topics addressed in the paper. Following four meetings (three online and the final face-to-face meeting), the panel critically analyzed recommendations from international guidelines, systemic reviews, and meta-analyses; results of randomized control trials (RCTs); and studies focusing on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of gliclazide MR, and agreed on a series of statements supported by scientific evidence and expert clinical opinion. The main topics addressed in this paper include (a) early and sustained glycemic control in T2D management, (b) SUs in T2D management (history, general mechanisms of action, diabetes treatment), (c) gliclazide MR (new formulation allowing once daily dosing, low hypoglycemia risk, antioxidant effects, cardiovascular neutrality, low risk of secondary failure, and the longer sustainability of glycemic control), (d) clinical studies on efficacy/effectiveness of gliclazide MR (as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, compared with other SUs or OADs, as add-on to insulin therapy), (e) clinical studies on safety of gliclazide (all-cause and cardiac mortality and macrovascular complications, hypoglycemia risk, weight gain), (f) use of gliclazide therapy in special populations (patients with renal or hepatic diseases, elderly, during Ramadan fasting, in monogenic diabetes), and (g) place of SUs as a class and gliclazide MR specifically in the current T2D treatment algorithm.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head trials comparing sulfonylureas and low hypoglycaemic risk antidiabetic drugs [^03608aa0]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Safety of sulfonylurea drugs in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes is still under debate. The aim of this study was to compare the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular adverse events of sulfonylureas and drugs with a low risk for hypoglycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (PubMed, OVID), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, WOS and Lilacs.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled head-to-head trials that compared sulfonylureas with active control with low hypoglycaemic potential in adults (≥ 18 years old) with type 2 diabetes published up to August 2015. The drug classes involved in the analysis were metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were MACE, cardiovascular events and severe hypoglycaemia.

Synthesis Of Results

Two reviewers checked study eligibility, independently extracted data and assessed quality with disagreements resolved through discussion. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials v2. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by using fixed effects model. The study is registered on PROSPERO (26/05/2016 CRD42016038780).

Results

Our final analysis comprised 31 studies (26,204 patients, 11,711 patients given sulfonylureas and 14,493 given comparator drugs). In comparison to drugs with low hypoglycaemic potential, sulfonylureas had higher odds for all-cause mortality (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00–1.75), MACE (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07–1.61), myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal) (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.17–2.38) and hypoglycaemia (OR 5.24, 95% CI 4.20–6.55). Subsequent sensitivity analysis revealed differences in the effect of sulfonylureas, with an increased risk of all-cause mortality with glipizide but not the other molecules.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis raises concern about the safety of SUs compared to alternative drugs involved in current analysis. Important differences may exist within the drug class, and glimepiride seems to have best safety profile.

### Alogliptin versus glipizide monotherapy in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with mild hyperglycaemia: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, 1-year study [^3af16732]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin versus glipizide in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 1year of treatment.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of elderly T2DM patients (aged 65-90years) with mild hyperglycaemia on diet/exercise therapy alone [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5–9.0%] or plus oral antidiabetic monotherapy (HbA1c 6.5–8.0%). Patients were randomized to once-daily alogliptin 25mg or glipizide 5mg titrated to 10mg, if needed. Hypoglycaemic episodes were systematically captured under predefined criteria.

Results

In the primary analysis, HbA1c mean changes from a baseline of 7.5% were -0.14% with alogliptin (n = 222) and -0.09% with glipizide (n = 219) at the end of the study, demonstrating non-inferiority of alogliptin to glipizide [least squares (LS) mean difference = -0.05%; one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI): -∞, 0.13%]. More clinically relevant HbA1c reductions occurred among patients who completed the study: -0.42 and -0.33% with alogliptin and glipizide, with non-inferiority again confirmed (LS mean difference = -0.09%; one-sided 97.5% CI: -∞, 0.07%). Overall, alogliptin was safe and well tolerated, with notably fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than glipizide [5.4% (31 episodes) vs. 26.0% (232 episodes), respectively]; three patients experienced severe hypoglycaemia, all with glipizide. Alogliptin also resulted in favourable weight changes versus glipizide (-0.62 vs. 0.60kg at week 52; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Alogliptin monotherapy maintained glycaemic control comparable to that of glipizide in elderly patients with T2DM over 1year of treatment, with substantially lower risk of hypoglycaemia and without weight gain.

Regarding the use of glipizide XL PO (also known as Glucotrol XL) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for hypoglycemia. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. Discontinue glipizide, if being used during pregnancy, at least 4 weeks before the expected delivery date to decrease the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The drug glipizide XL PO (also known as Glucotrol XL) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Monotherapy

A total of 304 patients with type 2 diabetes already treated with sulfonylurea therapy participated in a 14-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of glimepiride monotherapy. Patients discontinued their sulfonylurea therapy then entered a 3-week placebo washout period followed by randomization into 1 of 4 treatment groups: placebo (n = 74), glimepiride 1 mg (n = 78), glimepiride 4 mg (n = 76), and glimepiride 8 mg (n = 76). All patients randomized to glimepiride started 1 mg daily. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg had blinded, forced titration of the glimepiride dose at weekly intervals, first to 4 mg and then to 8 mg, as long as the dose was tolerated, until the randomized dose was reached. Patients randomized to the 4 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 2. Patients randomized to the 8 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 3. Once the randomized dose level was reached, patients were to be maintained at that dose until Week 14. Approximately 66% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial compared to 81% of patients treated with glimepiride 1 mg and 92% of patients treated with glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg. Compared to placebo, treatment with glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1Ccompared to placebo (Table 3).

A total of 249 patients who were treatment-naive or who had received limited treatment with antidiabetic therapy in the past were randomized to receive 22 weeks of treatment with either glimepiride (n = 123) or placebo (n = 126) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration trial. The starting dose of glimepiride was 1 mg daily and was titrated upward or downward at 2-week intervals to a goal FPG of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels for both FPG and PPG were analyzed in the laboratory. Following 10 weeks of dose adjustment, patients were maintained at their optimal dose (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 mg) for the remaining 12 weeks of the trial. Treatment with glimepiride provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1Cand FPG compared to placebo (Table 4).

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic renal insufficiency [^bf1c53d7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Efficacy

At week 54, similar reductions from baseline (mean of 7.8% in both groups) in A1C were observed in both treatment groups (Table 1). The difference in least squares (LS) mean change for sitagliptin versus glipizide (−0.11% [95% CI −0.29 to 0.06]) met the criterion for noninferiority because the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the prespecified noninferiority margin (0.4%). Change from baseline in A1C over time is presented in Fig. 1 A. At week 54, 47.4% of patients in the sitagliptin group versus 41.5% in the glipizide group met the A1C goal of < 7% (difference 5.6% [95% CI −5.9 to 16.9]) and 17.8% in the sitagliptin group versus 14.8% in the glipizide group met the A1C goal of < 6.5% (difference 3.3% [95% CI −5.7 to 12.1]). The between-group differences in A1C were generally consistent across predefined subgroups. However, greater changes from baseline in A1C were observed in patients with higher A1C at baseline (baseline A1C ≥ 8%; LS mean change from baseline −1.25% [95% CI −1.48 to −1.02] in the sitagliptin group and −1.10% [−1.32 to −0.87] in the glipizide group) relative to those with lower A1C at baseline (baseline A1C < 8%; LS mean change from baseline −0.46% [95% CI −0.63 to −0.28] in the sitagliptin group and −0.38% [−0.55 to −0.21] in the glipizide group) for both treatment groups. The post hoc composite end point (reduction in A1C > 0.5%, no body weight gain, and no hypoglycemia) was achieved in a significantly greater proportion of patients with sitagliptin versus glipizide (35.7 vs. 14.2%, respectively). The odds ratio for achieving the composite end point with sitagliptin compared with glipizide was 3.4 (95% CI 1.9–6.2).

### Cardiovascular safety of non-insulin pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes [^b475aba6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Insulin secretagogues

Sulfonylureas

The sulfonylureas are the oldest and most widely prescribed oral anti-diabetic agents. They bind to receptors on adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP) in the pancreatic β-cells, causing depolarization of the cell membrane and subsequent calcium-mediated exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. First-generation sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and chlorpropamide are no longer used due to high incidence of adverse reactions. Second-generation agents include glipizide, glibenclamide (also known as glyburide in United States) and gliclazide. Sulfonylurea monotherapy reduces HbA1c by 1–2%, but weight gain is almost inevitable. In the UKPDS, patients randomized to sulfonylureas gained a mean of 5.3 kg over 6 years. Glimepiride, a third-generation agent, has at least therapeutic equivalence to the second-generation agents, but is less associated with both weight gain and hypoglycemia, and may have lesser undesirable effects on myocardial preconditioning due to its selectivity to pancreatic K ATP.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^abeae74b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Sulfonylureas.

Sulfonylureas lower glycemia by enhancing insulin secretion. In terms of efficacy, they appear to be similar to metformin, lowering A1C levels by ∼1.5 percentage points. The major adverse side effect is hypoglycemia, which can be prolonged and life threatening, but such episodes, characterized by a need for assistance, coma, or seizure, are infrequent. However, severe episodes are relatively more frequent in the elderly. Chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (known as glyburide in the U.S. and Canada), are associated with a substantially greater risk of hypoglycemia than other second-generation sulfonylureas (gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide, and their extended formulations), which are preferable (Table 1). In addition, weight gain of ∼2 kg is common following the initiation of sulfonylurea therapy. Although the onset of the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylurea monotherapy is relatively rapid compared with, for example, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), maintenance of glycemic targets over time is not as good as monotherapy with a TZD or metformin. Sulfonylurea therapy was implicated as a potential cause of increased CVD mortality in the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study. Concerns raised by the UGDP that sulfonylureas, as a drug class, may increase CVD mortality in type 2 diabetes were not substantiated by the UKPDS or ADVANCE study. The glycemic benefits of sulfonylureas are nearly fully realized at half-maximal doses, and higher doses should generally be avoided.

Glinides.

Like the sulfonylureas, the glinides stimulate insulin secretion, although they bind to a different site within the sulfonylurea receptor. They have a shorter circulating half-life than the sulfonylureas and must be administered more frequently. Of the two glinides currently available in the U.S. repaglinide is almost as effective as metformin or the sulfonylureas, decreasing A1C levels by ∼1.5 percentage points. Nateglinide is somewhat less effective in lowering A1C than repaglinide when used as monotherapy or in combination therapy. The risk of weight gain is similar to that for the sulfonylureas, but hypoglycemia may be less frequent, at least with nateglinide, than with some sulfonylureas.

### Effects of glipizide GITS and glibenclamide on metabolic control, hepatic glucose production, and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes [^ca573b1f]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of effects of glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) administered once daily (AM or PM) and glibenclamide on glycemic control, insulin secretory response, and hepatic glucose production (HGP) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study, subjects (HbA(1c) between 8.6 and 10.0%) received a titrated daily dose (5–20 mg) of either glipizide GITS AM (n = 11), glipizide GITS PM (n = 10), glibenclamide (n = 11), or placebo (n = 10) for eight weeks. Fasting and 24-h glucose and insulin, HGP, fructosamine, and HbA(1c) were measured at baseline and at study conclusion; glucose and insulin were also evaluated after Sustacal challenge.

Results

Fasting and 24-h glucose were significantly reduced by glipizide GITS AM (33%, p < 0.001; 39%, p < 0.0001), glipizide GITS PM (33%, p < 0.0001; 32%, p < 0.0001), and glibenclamide (37%, p < 0.05; 37%, p < 0.0001). Fasting insulin was not significantly increased by any treatment; 24-h insulin was not increased by glipizide GITS AM, but was elevated by glipizide GITS PM (39%, p < 0.05) and glibenclamide (23%, p < 0.05). Fructosamine and HbA(1c) were significantly reduced by glipizide GITS AM (28%, p < 0.001; 22%, p < 0.0001), glipizide GITS PM (25%, p < 0.005; 24%, p < 0.005), and glibenclamide (17%, p < 0.001; 14%, p < 0.05). Glipizide GITS AM and glibenclamide significantly reduced HGP by approximately 19% (p < 0.05) and 17% (p < 0.01) respectively. Glipizide GITS and glibenclamide significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased the glucose excursion after Sustacal challenge. The reductions in glucose excursions were accompanied by significant (p < 0.05) increases in the insulin response, suggesting an improvement in meal-related insulin secretion.

Conclusions

Glipizide GITS and glibenclamide treatment are effective agents for improving fasting plasma glucose and HbA(1c). Each possessed a suppressive effect on basal HGP and improved postprandial glycemia, but only glipizide GITS AM was effective without causing a persistent elevation in insulin. This profile of glipizide GITS AM is therapeutically attractive, as it is consistent with the potential for a reduced risk of hypoglycemia.

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^90e8e557]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia:

Glipizide-metformin hydrochloride tablets are capable of producing hypoglycemia; therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glipizide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic insufficiency may increase drug levels of glipizide and may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.

Renal and Hepatic Disease:

The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.

Hemolytic Anemia:

Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets belong to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In postmarketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

Vitamin B12 Levels:

In controlled clinical trials with metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.

Macrovascular Outcomes

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glipizide and metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug.

### Mortality risk among sulfonylureas: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^7bed2f5b]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Sulfonylureas are common second-line options for management of type 2 diabetes; however, they are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared with other antidiabetic drugs. Since tissue selectivity and risk of hypoglycaemia differ among sulfonylureas, we aimed to assess whether mortality and the risk of cardiovascular events also varies.

Methods

We searched Medline and Embase from inception to June 11, 2014, to identify controlled studies reporting the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, or myocardial infarction for at least two sulfonylureas. We examined differences in cardiovascular event risk among sulfonylureas with random effects models for direct pairwise comparisons and network meta-analyses to incorporate direct and indirect data.

Findings

14970 (9%) of 167327 patients in 18 studies died: 841 (4%) of 19334 gliclazide users, 5482 (11%) of 49389 glimepiride users, 2106 (15%) of 14464 glipizide users, 5296 (7%) of 77169 glibenclamide users, 1066 (17%) of 6187 tolbutamide users, and 179 (23%) of 784 chlorpropamide users. Inconsistency was low for the network meta-analysis of all-cause mortality, and the relative risk of death compared with glibenclamide was 0.65 (95% credible interval 0.53–0.79) for gliclazide, 0.83 (0.68–1.00) for glimepiride, 0.98 (0.80–1.19) for glipizide, 1.13 (0.90–1.42) for tolbutamide, and 1.34 (0.98–1.86) for chlorpropamide. Similar associations were noted for cardiovascular-related mortality: the relative risk compared with glibenclamide was 0.60 (95% credible interval 0.45–0.84) for gliclazide, 0.79 (0.57–1.11) for glimepiride, 1.01 (0.72–1.43) for glipizide, 1.11 (0.79–1.55) for tolbutamide, and 1.45 (0.88–2.44) for chlorpropamide.

Interpretation

Gliclazide and glimepiride were associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality compared with glibenclamide. Clinicians should consider possible differences in risk of mortality when selecting a sulfonylurea.

### Are one or two dangerous? Sulfonylurea exposure in toddlers [^f4779c2d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sulfonylurea-based oral hypoglycemics are in widespread use in the adult population, increasing the potential for unintentional exposure in children. This article examines the risk of toxicity in children under 6 years of age who ingest one to two tablets of a sulfonylurea. We review the literature on sulfonylurea toxicity, including cases reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). The ingestion of one to two sulfonylurea tablets by a small child can lead to profound hypoglycemia with severe sequelae if untreated. As a result, all potential sulfonylurea ingestions by young children should be evaluated by a physician. A capillary glucose level must be rapidly determined at presentation and should then be repeated at regular intervals for up to 8 hours. A longer observation period is recommended for the extended release preparation of glipizide. Asymptomatic children who do not develop hypoglycemia within the recommended observation period may be safely discharged home. All children who exhibit clear symptoms of hypoglycemia or glucose levels < 60 mg/dL should be admitted for supplemental glucose (oral or intravenous), with careful observation of clinical condition and monitoring of serum glucose levels. In cases refractory to intravenous glucose, therapy with octreotide or diazoxide may be beneficial.

### Durability of glycaemic efficacy over 2 years with dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapies in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is inadequately controlled with metformin [^c08d8416]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the long-term glycaemic durability, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin alone.

Methods

This was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind study of dapagliflozin (n = 406) versus glipizide (n = 408), uptitrated over 18 weeks according to tolerability and glycaemic response to a maximum of 10 and 20 mg/day, respectively, as add-on therapies to metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day) with a 156-week double-blind extension period. Data over 104 weeks are reported here.

Results

In total, 53.1% of patients completed 104 weeks of treatment. After the greater initial decrease (0–18 weeks) in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with glipizide, the 18-104-week HbA1c coefficient of failure (CoF) was lower with dapagliflozin (0.13%/year) than with glipizide (0.59%/year), resulting in significant dapagliflozin versus glipizide differences of -0.46%/year (95% CI -0.60,-0.33; p = 0.0001) for CoF and -0.18%(-2.0 mmol/mol) [95% CI -0.33(-3.6),-0.03(-0.3); p = 0.021] for 104-week HbA1c. Dapagliflozin produced sustained reductions in weight and systolic blood pressure, whereas glipizide increased weight and systolic blood pressure, giving 104-week dapagliflozin versus glipizide differences of -5.1 kg (95% CI: -5.7,-4.4) and -3.9 mmHg (95% CI: -6.1,-1.7), respectively. Over 104 weeks, the hypoglycaemia rate was 10-fold lower with dapagliflozin than with glipizide (4.2 vs. 45.8%), whereas patient proportions with events suggestive of genital infection and of urinary tract infection (UTI) were greater with dapagliflozin (14.8 and 13.5%, respectively) than with glipizide (2.9 and 9.1%, respectively).

Conclusions

Over 2 years, compared with glipizide, dapagliflozin demonstrated greater glycaemic durability, sustained reductions in weight and systolic blood pressure and a low hypoglycaemia rate; however, genital infections and UTIs occurred more frequently.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily. Dose adjustment can be made based on the patient's glycemic control. Maximum recommended dose is 20 mg once daily (2.1).
Administer with breakfast or the first meal of the day (2.1).
For combination therapy with other blood-glucose-lowering agents, initiate the agent at the lowest recommended dose, and observe patients for hypoglycemia (2.2).

2.1 Recommended Dosing

GLUCOTROL XL should be administered orally with breakfast or the first main meal of the day.

The recommended starting dose of GLUCOTROL XL is 5 mg once daily. Start patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g. the elderly or patients with hepatic insufficiency) at 2.5 mg [see Use in Specific Population (8.5, 8.6)].

Dosage adjustment can be made based on the patient's glycemic control. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg once daily.

Patients receiving immediate release glipizide may be switched to GLUCOTROL XL once daily at the nearest equivalent total daily dose.

2.2 Use with Other Glucose Lowering Agents

When adding GLUCOTROL XL to other anti-diabetic drugs, initiate GLUCOTROL XL at 5 mg once daily. Start patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia at a lower dose.

When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, GLUCOTROL XL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

### Effects of metformin versus glipizide on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease [^1fde7488]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The two major classes of antidiabetic drugs, sulfonylureas and metformin, may differentially affect macrovascular complications and mortality in diabetic patients. We compared the long-term effects of glipizide and metformin on the major cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients who had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Research Design and Methods

This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 304 type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, mean age = 63.3 years (range, 36–80 years), were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either glipizide (30 mg daily) or metformin (1.5 g daily) for 3 years. The primary end points were times to the composite of recurrent cardiovascular events, including death from a cardiovascular cause, death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or arterial revascularization.

Results

At the end of study drug administration, both groups achieved a significant decrease in the level of glycated hemoglobin (7.1% in the glipizide group and 7.0% in the metformin group). At a median follow-up of 5.0 years, 91 participants had developed 103 primary end points. Intention-to-treat analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.54 (95% CI 0.30–0.90; P = 0.026) for the composites of cardiovascular events among the patients that received metformin, compared with glipizide. The secondary end points and adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.

Conclusions

Treatment with metformin for 3 years substantially reduced major cardiovascular events in a median follow-up of 5.0 years compared with glipizide. Our results indicated a potential benefit of metformin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients.

### The presence of two reduced function variants in CYP2C9 influences the acute response to glipizide [^074b307b]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To examine whether the presence of two common missense variants in the CYP2C9 gene (rs1799853, encoding Arg144Cys and denoted as *2, and rs1057910, encoding Ile359Leu and denoted as *3) influences the acute physiological response to a single glipizide dose in individuals naïve to diabetes medications.

Methods

In the Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH), 786 individuals genotyped for rs1799853/rs41291560 (✱2) and rs1057910/rs9332214 (✱3) were treated with 5 mg glipizide in the fasting state. Glucose and insulin levels were measured at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min for calculation of phenotypic endpoints of glipizide response. The challenge was aborted as a result of hypoglycaemia, defined as glucose < 2.8 mmol/l or hypoglycaemia-related symptoms.

Results

Carriers with two reduced function alleles had a 50% larger insulin area under the curve than carriers with zero or one copy (P = 0.037), although this finding was primarily driven by an individual with a robust insulin response. In adjusted analyses, the risk of aborting the glipizide challenge was doubled in two-copy carriers (P = 0.034). No significant findings were observed in glucose-based endpoints.

Conclusions

Carriers of two reduced function alleles in CYP2C9 may experience an increased insulin response to glipizide and be predisposed to a higher risk of hypoglycaemia, although no effect of genotype was seen in glucose-based measurements. Further studies are needed to clarify the utility of CYP2C9 genotyping to guide sulfonylurea treatment.

End points and safety assessments

The predefined primary end point was absolute change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52. Key secondary end points were 1) absolute change in total body weight (TBW) from baseline to week 52; 2) proportion of patients reporting at least one episode of hypoglycemia ("major", "minor", or "other", episode) during the 52-week double-blind treatment period; and 3) the proportion of patients achieving a TBW decrease ≥ 5% from baseline to week 52. Major hypoglycemia was defined as a symptomatic episode requiring external assistance due to severely impaired consciousness or behavior, with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and recovery after glucose or glucagon administration. Minor hypoglycemia was defined as a symptomatic episode with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 63 mg/dL (< 3.5 mmol/L), irrespective of the need for external assistance, or an asymptomatic episode with capillary or plasma glucose levels of 63 mg/dL (< 3.5 mmol/L) that did not qualify as a major episode. Other hypoglycemia was defined as an episode with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia but without measurement confirmation.

After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C < 9%).

From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In this comparative effectiveness research study of individuals with T2D, individuals treated with glipizide as a second agent after metformin monotherapy had a higher risk of MACE-4 events than individuals treated with DPP4is. These findings suggest that glipizide may not be the optimal agent in treatment of individuals with T2D at moderate cardiovascular risk.

The cardiovascular neutrality of gliclazide represents another distinct advantage over other SUs. Compared with other SUs, gliclazide binds more selectively to SUR1 (β cell type) and shows reversible binding (due to lack of benzamide moiety), along with its lower affinity to SUR2A (myocardial) and SUR2B (vascular smooth muscle) receptors.

The SUR1 specificity of gliclazide MR is important in terms of cardioprotective efficacy, since the affinity for extra-pancreatic SURs is hypothesized to inhibit ischemic preconditioning that translates into varying degrees of adverse hypoglycemia and cardiovascular outcomes with some SUs. In a population-based T2D study, SUs with high versus low cardiac mitochondrial K ATP channel affinity were associated with a significantly increased risk of three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death.

Hence, in contrast to other SUs inhibiting the opening of K ATP channels and thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular ischemia due to their high affinity for SUR2 receptors, gliclazide as a pancreas-selective SU with low SUR2 binding does not confer an increased risk of cardiovascular events or mortality. Lower incidence of hypoglycemic events and less weight gain on gliclazide compared with other SUs are also proposed as an explanation for a possible favorable cardiovascular safety profile.

Low Risk of Secondary Failure and the Longer Sustainability of Glycemic Control

The oxidative stress and subsequent β cell apoptosis are associated with a secondary failure and thus less effective glycemic control over time. While the effects of SUs, as a general class, on β cell exhaustion have always been a major concern, gliclazide is considered to enable a lower rate of secondary failure and thus longer sustainability of glycemic control than other SUs due to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as its higher physiological action in β cell insulin release.

Accordingly, the secondary failure rate over 5 years in patients with T2D was reported to be lowest with gliclazide (7%) compared with glibenclamide (17.9%) and glipizide (25.6%), while gliclazide was also reported to be more protective against secondary β cell failure than glibenclamide, delaying the initiation of insulin by 7 years (8 years for gliclazide and 15 years for glibenclamide). These findings suggest that gliclazide as a potent SU with low rate of secondary failure and a low incidence of side effects may represent a better choice in long-term SU therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic renal insufficiency [^d66d625c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, is a medication for patients with T2DM that improves glycemic control through enhancement of the incretin axis. A randomized, double-blind study in patients with T2DM and normal to mildly impaired renal function who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy showed that the addition of sitagliptin provided similar A1C-lowering efficacy over 52 weeks compared with the addition of the sulfonylurea glipizide; however, patients on glipizide reported > 10 times as many hypoglycemia events as did patients on sitagliptin, and body weight decreased with sitagliptin and increased with glipizide, resulting in a significant between-group difference.

Sitagliptin is cleared primarily by the kidney, with ∼80% of an oral dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Based on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and its renal clearance, in order to achieve a plasma concentration of sitagliptin similar to that achieved with a 100-mg daily dose in patients with normal to mildly impaired renal function, patients with moderate renal insufficiency should receive one-half of the usual clinical dose (50 mg every day), and patients with severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease should receive one-quarter of the usual clinical dose (25 mg every day). In a placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial, sitagliptin, at the appropriate doses for patients with T2DM and chronic renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease, provided clinically relevant reductions in A1C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and was generally well-tolerated, with a rate of hypoglycemia similar to that of placebo and a neutral effect on body weight. The current study compared the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin with that of glipizide, a sulfonylurea agent recommended by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for use in this patient population, in patients with T2DM and moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min/1.73 m²) or severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) renal insufficiency who had inadequate glycemic control.
