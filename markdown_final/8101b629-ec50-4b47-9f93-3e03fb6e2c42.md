## Question

When to give blood for a low h&h

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to transfuse red blood cells for low hemoglobin and hematocrit, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is actively bleeding or hemodynamically unstable. Then, I should verify the default restrictive threshold for stable, non-bleeding adults. Next, I will examine important exceptions where a higher threshold is warranted, such as acute coronary syndromes, neurologic injury, and perioperative states. After that, I need to consider special populations like pediatrics, chronic kidney disease, and sickle cell disease. Finally, I should confirm implementation details, including single-unit transfusion, reassessment, and mitigation of transfusion risks, and close with a concise synthesis of thresholds by scenario.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: transfusion decisions must be anchored in clinical context, not hemoglobin alone, with attention to active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, organ ischemia, and patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, and preferences; I need to ensure I do not jump straight to a number without verifying these elements because they shift thresholds and urgency substantially [^117G283T] [^11758etv].

> For stable, non-bleeding, hospitalized adults, I should default to a restrictive strategy with a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of less than 7 g/dL, targeting 7–9 g/dL after transfusion; wait, let me verify that this is consistent across high-quality guidelines — yes, AABB 2023, ESICM 2020, and ACCP 2025 converge on this restrictive approach, supported by TRICC and subsequent trials showing similar or improved outcomes with fewer transfusions [^111Tpie9] [^113DmYFB] [^114NyeT5] [^112wsGcq].

> Hold on, I should verify the exceptions where a higher threshold is justified; in acute coronary syndromes, including myocardial infarction, a more liberal strategy targeting hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL is reasonable to reduce cardiovascular events, supported by ACC/AHA 2025 and AABB 2025 guidance, with MINT suggesting possible short-term benefit despite a non-significant primary endpoint; I need to ensure I note that this applies to symptomatic anemia in ACS rather than asymptomatic cases [^114ZqMK5] [^114v51XM] [^116ott3A] [^117F7fd7].

> Next, I will examine neurologic injury; for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or acute ischemic stroke, I should maintain a higher hemoglobin target, generally 8–10 g/dL, because cerebral oxygen delivery is sensitive to anemia; wait, I should double-check that this is consistent — BCSH 2013 supports 7–9 g/dL in TBI and > 9 g/dL if cerebral ischemia is present, and ASH 2020 recommends rapid hemoglobin augmentation to about 10 g/dL for acute ischemic neurologic deficits in sickle cell disease, with exchange transfusion considered when appropriate [^117XXkrE] [^115Ju5vC] [^112Tb3HY] [^116zC116].

> I need to check perioperative and postpartum contexts; in major elective surgery, restrictive thresholds around 7–8 g/dL are appropriate for stable patients, with ASA guidance emphasizing unit-by-unit reassessment and individualized decisions in the 6–10 g/dL gray zone; in acute gastrointestinal bleeding, BSG 2019 recommends 7 g/dL for stable patients and 8 g/dL for those with cardiovascular disease, and in non-massive postpartum hemorrhage, ESICM suggests a restrictive approach guided by symptoms or hemoglobin less than 6 g/dL rather than a liberal 9 g/dL target; let me reconsider whether any of these contradict each other — no, they align on restrictive principles with modest upward adjustments for comorbid cardiovascular disease [^113ZhNax] [^112KpH4Z] [^112xJSYp] [^111tfNQS].

> For critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, I should confirm that a restrictive threshold of about 7 g/dL is recommended; Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 and ESICM 2020 endorse this approach, with the caveat that acute myocardial ischemia or severe hypoxemia may necessitate a higher target in select cases; I should double-check that TRISS informed this recommendation — yes, TRISS and TRICC support restrictive strategies without harm in sepsis cohorts [^117G283T] [^1161x2uA] [^113DmYFB].

> Now, let me consider cardiac surgery; I initially thought a 7.5 g/dL threshold might be broadly applicable, but wait, I should verify guideline nuances — ESICM suggests 7.5 g/dL in cardiac surgery patients, whereas STS/SCA/AmSECT recommend a restrictive strategy overall and note that transfusion is unlikely to improve oxygen transport when hemoglobin exceeds 10 g/dL; reconciling this, I will frame 7–7.5 g/dL as acceptable restrictive practice in cardiac surgery, with avoidance of routine transfusion above 10 g/dL [^114WZAdm] [^113kVc2b] [^116Mt9sP].

> I will now examine chronic kidney disease; KDIGO advises individualized decisions based on symptoms rather than arbitrary hemoglobin thresholds, and specifically recommends avoiding transfusions when possible in transplant-eligible patients due to allosensitization risk; I should confirm that KDOQI echoes this — yes, KDOQI supports symptom-based transfusion and avoidance in candidates for kidney transplantation, reinforcing a conservative approach outside acute indications [^116f4A6y] [^1142wK33] [^117Tr6eD].

> For pediatrics, I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize adult thresholds; the Surviving Sepsis pediatric guideline suggests against RBC transfusion if hemoglobin is 7 g/dL or higher in hemodynamically stabilized children with sepsis, and ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely advises against transfusion for asymptomatic iron deficiency anemia in children, emphasizing hemodynamic assessment and iron repletion instead; let me verify that this aligns with broader pediatric practice — yes, pediatric decisions remain more symptom- and hemodynamics-driven than threshold-based [^1119mwih] [^114cxLLr].

> But wait, what about sickle cell disease beyond acute neurologic events; for primary and secondary stroke prevention, ASH recommends maintaining hemoglobin above 9 g/dL and HbS below 30% with regular transfusions, and in acute chest syndrome or other severe complications, exchange transfusion is often indicated; I should confirm that these are strong recommendations — yes, stroke prevention guidance is strong, and exchange transfusion is conditionally recommended when not immediately available [^112zBYUq] [^116Vhh4N] [^116zC116].

> Next, I should review implementation details; transfuse one unit at a time with reassessment of symptoms and hemoglobin, monitor for transfusion reactions, and mitigate risks such as TACO with careful fluid management, slower rates, diuretics in heart failure, and, in renal failure, transfusing during dialysis when feasible; I need to ensure these mitigation strategies are guideline-supported — AABB and ACCP endorse single-unit transfusion and risk-mitigation tactics in liberal strategies [^114UkkQr] [^111ec7GB] [^114zJPdR].

> Let me synthesize thresholds by scenario to ensure internal consistency: for stable, non-bleeding adults, use less than 7 g/dL; for acute coronary syndromes, target at least 10 g/dL; for traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage, aim for 8–10 g/dL; for perioperative patients, 7–8 g/dL with higher triggers if cardiovascular disease is present; for sepsis, about 7 g/dL unless myocardial ischemia or severe hypoxemia is present; for cardiac surgery, 7–7.5 g/dL with avoidance above 10 g/dL; for chronic kidney disease, base on symptoms and avoid transfusion in transplant candidates; for pediatrics, prioritize hemodynamics and generally avoid transfusion at or above 7 g/dL in stabilized sepsis; for sickle cell disease, maintain above 9 g/dL for cerebrovascular risk reduction and use exchange transfusion for acute complications when indicated [^111Tpie9] [^114ZqMK5] [^117XXkrE] [^115Ju5vC] [^113ZhNax] [^117G283T] [^114WZAdm] [^116f4A6y] [^1119mwih] [^112zBYUq].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with patient blood management principles and shared decision-making; guidelines consistently emphasize restrictive strategies, individualized assessment, and informed consent, especially when values or religious beliefs affect transfusion acceptance; I need to ensure documentation of symptoms, hemodynamic status, and the rationale for deviating from default thresholds to maintain clinical rigor and transparency [^112cAFuf] [^114UkkQr] [^11758etv].

Transfuse based on **clinical context** and **symptom severity**, not hemoglobin alone [^112KZsz6]. Use a **restrictive strategy** for most stable adults (transfuse if Hb < 7 g/dL) [^111Tpie9], and raise to 7–8 g/dL for those with cardiovascular disease or active ischemia [^111zj53d]. For acute coronary syndromes, a liberal threshold (≥ 10 g/dL) may be reasonable [^114ZqMK5] [^117F7fd7]. In active bleeding, transfuse to maintain perfusion and oxygen delivery, often targeting Hb 7–9 g/dL [^111bZAbe]. Always transfuse one unit at a time with reassessment [^114UkkQr], and avoid transfusion if Hb > 10 g/dL unless there is ongoing ischemia or special circumstances [^116Mt9sP].

---

## General principles for transfusion decisions

Transfusion decisions should be **individualized**, integrating hemoglobin/hematocrit with symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical context [^116f4A6y]. A **restrictive strategy** is preferred for most stable adults, reserving transfusion for severe anemia or symptomatic cases [^112cAFuf].

---

## Transfusion thresholds by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended transfusion threshold (hemoglobin)** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population (stable, non-bleeding) | < 7 g/dL | Restrictive strategy reduces transfusions without increasing adverse outcomes [^111Tpie9] [^117MhV1G] |
| Cardiovascular disease (e.g. CAD, heart failure) | 7–8 g/dL | Higher threshold to balance oxygen delivery and cardiac workload [^notfound] |
| Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) | ≥ 10 g/dL | Liberal strategy may reduce cardiovascular events [^114ZqMK5] [^117F7fd7] |
| Active bleeding or hemorrhagic shock | 7–9 g/dL (maintain perfusion) | Restore oxygen-carrying capacity and perfusion [^111bZAbe] [^112p4YdZ] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Individualized, generally < 7 g/dL | Avoid transfusions when possible due to risks (e.g. alloimmunization) [^114zTuxt] [^1142wK33] |
| Critically ill patients (ICU) | < 7 g/dL | Restrictive strategy is safe and effective [^113DmYFB] [^112cAFuf] |
| Perioperative patients | 7–8 g/dL | Higher threshold for cardiovascular disease or significant blood loss [^112KZsz6] [^114L9kKG] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Use restrictive thresholds; transfuse if Hb < 7 g/dL in stable children, adjusting for clinical context [^1119mwih].
- **Sickle cell disease**: Transfuse to maintain Hb > 9 g/dL and HbS < 30% for stroke prevention [^112zBYUq] [^116Vhh4N].
- **Pregnancy**: Transfuse if Hb < 7 g/dL or if symptomatic, balancing maternal-fetal needs [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of transfusion

Transfusion can improve oxygen delivery and relieve symptoms but carries risks, including transfusion reactions, infections, and alloimmunization [^111bEWar]. A **restrictive strategy** minimizes these risks without increasing adverse outcomes [^117MhV1G].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

Assess for **signs of anemia-related distress** — tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness, and altered mental status [^113Y3Rwc]. Reassess hemoglobin and clinical status after each unit, and **transfuse one unit at a time** [^114UkkQr].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Restrictive strategy**: Transfuse if Hb < 7 g/dL for most stable adults [^111Tpie9].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Use 7–8 g/dL threshold [^notfound].
- **ACS**: Consider liberal threshold (≥ 10 g/dL) [^114ZqMK5].
- **Active bleeding**: Maintain Hb 7–9 g/dL to preserve perfusion [^111bZAbe].
- **Individualize**: Base decisions on symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical context [^112KZsz6].

Transfuse when hemoglobin is low and the patient is symptomatic or when clinical context warrants it, using a **restrictive approach** for most stable adults and adjusting thresholds for cardiovascular disease, active bleeding, or special populations [^112cAFuf].

KDOQI US commentary — red cell transfusion thresholds and trends endorses KDIGO's individualized decision-making and notes recent utilization changes. The commentary states "The KDIGO guideline suggests that the decision to transfuse a patient with chronic anemia should be individualized rather than based on a single Hb threshold for all patients" and "we support this suggestion". It also observes that "the product labeling for ESAs removed the lower limit of the target Hb concentration range to avoid an increased risk of cardiovascular events", after which "Hb levels have fallen", and "the proportion of patients receiving blood transfusions has increased from approximately 9% to 22% from 2011 to 2012.23".

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

Preprocedure preparation blood management protocols — Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, although no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration, with determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion based on bleeding, volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit‑by‑unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used for patients in whom transfusion is refused or not possible, and transfusion of red blood cells is rarely necessary when the hemoglobin concentration is more than 10g/dl.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111bEWar]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults — background and epidemiology: In the United States, approximately 25% of critically ill patients receive RBC transfusions, totaling approximately 1.8 million units annually. The primary indication is low hemoglobin (80%), whereas less frequently encountered indications include active bleeding (27%) and hemodynamic instability (23%). Since the publication of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, > 30 trials have examined RBC transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. Despite this evidence, significant variability exists in clinical practice regarding the indications for RBC transfusions, with most occurring in patients with hemoglobin levels of > 7 g/dL. Although RBC transfusions can be life-saving, they carry significant risks of adverse effects, including transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and immunomodulating effects that may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. These side-effects may be severe and even life-threatening. The entire process, from distribution to administration of RBCs, incurs substantial costs, which vary globally.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^113NDP2N]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) — Meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused and the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood for major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery (Category A1‑B evidence). Additional meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH combined with intraoperative red blood cell recovery compared with intraoperative red blood cell recovery alone is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused (Category A1‑B evidence) and is equivocal regarding the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood (Category A1‑E evidence). Consider ANH to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion in patients at high risk for excessive bleeding (e.g., major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery), if possible, noting that ANH may not be possible due to pre‑existing patient factors such as small blood volume, low hemoglobin, or presence of ischemic disease.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^114cxLLr]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). High credibility.

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion in pediatric iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — states to avoid pRBCs in asymptomatic, nonbleeding children and to base transfusion on hemodynamic status and blood loss rather than laboratory values. The page notes that transfusion does not correct iron deficiency, exposes patients to transfusion risks, and that effective therapy is iron repletion, with the avoidance recommendation supported by practice guidelines. Specifically, it says: "Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding", and that "the decision to transfuse pRBCs is typically guided by assessment of hemodynamic stability and ongoing blood loss rather than hemoglobin or iron levels". It adds that "Transfusion with pRBCs does not ensure complete treatment of IDA because the iron from transfused pRBCs is not immediately bioavailable for erythropoiesis and does not replenish iron stores", that unnecessary transfusions "expose patients to risks of transfusion reactions, blood-borne infections, RBC alloimmunization, and volume overload", and that "The judicious use of pRBC transfusions has been associated with cost savings for health care systems". The page states, "Effective treatment of severe IDA consists of replenishing iron stores using oral or intravenous iron supplementation while addressing the underlying causes", and that avoidance in asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable children "is supported by recently published practice guidelines in Canada".

KDIGO further notes "We suggest that the decision to transfuse a CKD patient with non-acute anemia should not be based on an arbitrary Hb threshold, but should be determined by the occurrence of symptoms caused by anemia. (2C)" and for acute care "In certain acute clinical situations, we suggest patients are transfused when the benefits of red cell transfusions outweigh the risks; these include (2C):" such as "When rapid correction of anemia is required to stabilize the patient's condition (e.g., acute hemorrhage, unstable coronary artery disease)" or "When rapid pre-operative Hb correction is required".

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115s12Mi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia guidelines — hemoglobin targets and transfusion — state that the selected hemoglobin (Hb) target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL and that the Hb target should not be above 13.0 g/dL; they also state that no single Hb concentration justifies or requires transfusion and that the target Hb should not serve as a transfusion trigger. The epoetin alfa prescribing information lists when administered to target a Hb > 12 g/dL and that the Hb concentration should not exceed 12 g/dL, while labeling lists Hb < 10 g/dL as a starting Hb in chronic kidney disease. The guideline notes that selection of Hb target and selection of Hb level to initiate therapy are separate but related steps in medical decision-making and that to avoid achieved Hb > 12 g/dL would require a Hb target as low as 9.2 g/dL.

### A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of transfusion requirements in critical care. transfusion requirements in critical care investigators, Canadian critical care trials group [^112wsGcq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1999). Excellent credibility.

The study TRICC was published by Hebert PC and colleagues in 1999 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Transfusion strategies in critical care and Red blood cell transfusion. In the TRICC study, the trial question was: is restrictive strategy of transfusion superior to liberal strategy in critically ill patients with euvolemia who had hemoglobin concentrations < 9.0 g/dL within 72 hours after admission to ICU? In the TRICC study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the TRICC study, the population was: 838 patients (314 female, 524 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients with euvolemia who had hemoglobin concentrations < 9.0 g/dL within 72 hours after admission to ICU. The key exclusion criteria were age < 16 years; inability to receive blood products; active blood loss at the time of enrollment, chronic anemia; pregnancy; brain death or imminent death. In the TRICC study, the interventions were: n = 418 restrictive blood transfusion therapy (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration < 7.0 g/dL, hemoglobin concentrations maintained at 7.0–9.0 g/dL) n = 420 liberal blood transfusion therapy (transfusion when hemoglobin concentration < 10.0 g/dL, hemoglobin concentration maintained at 10.0–12.0 g/dL). In the TRICC study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 30 days (18.7% vs. 23.3%; AD 4.7%, 95% CI -0.84 to 10.2). In the TRICC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death at 30 days among patients with APACHE II score ≤ 20 (8.7% vs. 16.1%; RR 0.54, 95% CI 1 to 13.6) Borderline significant increase in death in the hospital (22.3% vs. 28.1%; AD 5.8%, 95% CI -0.3 to 11.7) No significant difference in length of stay in the hospital (34.8 days vs. 35.5 days; AD 0.7 days, 95% CI -1.9 to 3.4). In the TRICC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in rates of cardiac events, infectious complications, multiorgan failure. significant differences in pulmonary edema (5.3% vs. 10.7%), myocardial infarction (0.7% vs. 2.9%). In the TRICC study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients with euvolemia who had hemoglobin concentrations < 9.0 g/dL within 72 hours after admission to ICU, restrictive blood transfusion therapy was not superior to liberal blood transfusion therapy with respect to death at 30 days.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^114h717R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal anemia — monitoring and timing of repeat intrauterine transfusion (IUT): After a transfusion in an alloimmunized pregnancy, fetal hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to decline at approximately 0.4 g/dL per day and 1% per day, respectively; using the MCA-PSV can give an accurate assessment of when to resample, with reported detection of severe anemia at 100% sensitivity and a false-positive rate of 6%. Following an initial transfusion, the recommended threshold for diagnosing fetal anemia that requires a second transfusion is higher (MoM > 1.69). If the posttransfusion hematocrit is known or can be estimated, timing of the next transfusion can be calculated using the expected decline in fetal hematocrit, and after a second transfusion the intertransfusion interval should be individualized based on pathology, fetal condition, and posttransfusion hematocrit rather than MCA-PSV thresholds.

Preadmission preparation and anemia management — preatmission patient preparation includes (1) treatment of anemia, (2) discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, and (3) preadmission autologous blood collection. The World Health Organization hemoglobin thresholds identifying anemia are 11.0 g/dl for children 0.50–4.99 yr, 11.5 g/dl for children 5.0–11.99 yr, 12.0 g/dl for children 12.0–14.99 yr and nonpregnant women ≥ 15.0 yr, 11.0 g/dl for pregnant women, and 13.0 g/dl for men ≥ 15.0 yr. Preadmission treatment of anemia includes erythropoietin and/or iron to improve preoperative hemoglobin. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs indicate erythropoietin with or without iron is effective in reducing the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusions and the volume transfused (Category A1-B evidence), while the literature is insufficient to evaluate erythropoietin with iron versus without iron. RCTs report equivocal findings when preadmission oral iron is compared with placebo or no iron regarding preoperative hemoglobin or perioperative allogeneic blood transfused (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state erythropoietin with or without iron may be administered when possible to reduce allogeneic blood need in select populations, and consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding iron administration for iron deficiency anemia if time permits.

American Burn Association blood product transfusion — Question 1 (adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area [TBSA]) compares a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level ≥ 7 g/ dL) with a liberal threshold (hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL); 5 studies were identified, including 3 with strong evidence and one with moderate evidence, comparing a restrictive strategy (maintain hemoglobin level ≥ 7 g/dL) to a liberal strategy (maintain hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL). Historically in the intensive care unit (ICU), RBCs were transfused if hemoglobin dropped below 10 g/dL. The TRICC trial randomized 838 stable critically ill patients to transfuse if hemoglobin dropped below 7.0 g/dL with maintenance at 7.0 to 9.0 g/dL versus transfusing when hemoglobin fell below 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL and found no difference in mortality between the 2 groups; however, the TRICC study applicability to patients with major burn injury is not clear and it did not include patients with active bleeding, a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or less within 72 hours of admission, or those requiring transfusion of > 3 units in 12 hours.

Hemoglobin/hematocrit testing before endoscopy — routine screening is not advised for minor procedures without anemia symptoms, but selective testing is appropriate for high-risk scenarios. Severe anemia is found in less than 1% of asymptomatic patients, and a hemoglobin level less than 8 mg/dL has been associated with cardiac morbidity and operative death. Although determining a baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit level is recommended before major surgery with anticipated significant blood loss, such testing is not recommended for patients undergoing minor surgeries in the absence of clinical findings suggestive of anemia. Measurement of hemoglobin should be considered for patients with preexisting anemia or risk factors for bleeding, a high risk of adverse events with significant bleeding, advanced liver disease, or a hematologic disorder when undergoing endoscopic procedures in which there is a high risk of bleeding adverse events.

Transfusion triggers — cardiac surgery recommendations — in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a restrictive perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion strategy is recommended in preference to a liberal transfusion strategy for perioperative blood conservation, as it reduces both transfusion rate and units of allogeneic RBCs without increased risk of mortality or morbidity (Class I, Level A). Allogeneic RBC transfusion is unlikely to improve oxygen transport when the hemoglobin concentration is greater than 10 g/dL and is not recommended (Class III: No Benefit; Level B-R).

Sickle cell disease — acute ischemic neurologic deficit transfusion strategy specifies immediate hemoglobin augmentation and exchange. For children and adults presenting with a focal neurological deficit suggestive of an ischemic event, including a TIA, increasing the hemoglobin level with a red blood cell transfusion is stated as the best option to improve oxygen delivery to the brain. If the hemoglobin level is less than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends increasing the hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL with a simple transfusion within 2 hours after presentation, and after the hemoglobin has reached ~10.0 g/dL with simple transfusion or if the baseline hemoglobin level is greater than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends an automated-exchange red blood cell transfusion (apheresis). The relationship between hemoglobin and oxygen delivery notes that the maximal hemoglobin (Hbmax) to deliver oxygen transport in sickle cell patients is 10 to 11 g/dL and that when the HbS level is low (∼20%), a higher hemoglobin level (such as 13 g/dL) may be beneficial; red cell apheresis can rapidly lower the HbS to levels that maximize oxygen delivery.

Anemia management in acute coronary syndromes — the guideline assigns COR 2b and LOE B-R and states: "In patients with ACS and acute or chronic anemia, blood transfusion to achieve a hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL may be reasonable to reduce cardiovascular events". For ACS populations, randomized trial evidence "suggests possible clinical benefit for a more liberal transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 10 g/dL compared with targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL". In MINT, "3504 patients with acute STEMI or NSTEMI and anemia with a blood hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL" were assigned to restrictive transfusion "(transfusing if the hemoglobin level was < 7–8 g/dL)" versus liberal "(transfusing if the hemoglobin level was < 10 g/dL)". The primary outcome of 30‑day death or recurrent MI occurred in "16.9% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 14.5% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99–1.34]; P = 0.07)". Death occurred in "9.9%" versus "8.3%" (relative risk, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.95–1.49]) and cardiac death in "5.5%" versus "3.2%" (relative risk, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.26–2.40]). Although the trial's primary endpoint was not significantly reduced, "the results suggest that a liberal blood transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL may provide short-term clinical benefit over a restrictive transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL in patients with AMI and anemia".

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^115qdZJj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Burn-related anemia and transfusion thresholds — Anemia after a major burn injury is ubiquitous, and the most common treatment of anemia in patients with major burns is to transfuse RBC units; however, blood transfusion is not without risks and potential morbidity and allogeneic RBC units are expensive and are increasingly a scarce resource, worldwide, with adverse effects including acute fluid overload, acute lung injury, immune responsiveness, allergic or hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, disease transmission, and kidney injury. In 1999, the Transfusion Requirement in Critical Care (TRICC) trial studied critically ill patients and compared a restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (10 g/dL) hemoglobin threshold for administering RBCs, and in 2017 the Transfusion Requirement in Burn Care Evaluation (TRIBE) study reported that a restrictive transfusion threshold for burn patients resulted in dramatically fewer transfusions, with no worse outcomes than a liberal approach to blood transfusion.

### Hemoglobin H disease [^115PcCsG]. Wikipedia (2016). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin H disease, also called α-thalassemia intermedia, is a disease affecting hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying molecule within red blood cells. It is a form of α-thalassemia which most commonly occurs due to deletion of 3 out of 4 of the α-globin genes. Pathophysiology Hemoglobin H disease is a genetic disorder resulting in absent or impaired production of the α-globin protein, a normal component of the hemoglobin. The disease occurs when the α-globin gene expression is reduced to less than 30% of the normal expression. In a healthy individual there are four copies of the gene which encode the α-globin protein. α-globin is encoded by the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. The genotype of healthy individuals with four normal copies of α-globin is annotated as αα/αα. In individuals with deletional HbH disease, there is deletion of three of the four α-globin alleles, which is annotated as --/-α.

Non-deletional HbH disease refers to a decreased α-globin that has not occurred as a result of the complete deletion of the DNA sequences encoding HBA1 and HBA2, and this is more rare than the deletional type. The most common hemoglobin found within adult red blood cells is hemoglobin A. The structure of HbA consists of two α-globin chains bound to two β-globin chains to form a tetramer. When there is lower than normal production of α-globin, as in HbH disease, the excess β-globin form β4-tetramers, termed hemoglobin H. These β4-tetramers accumulate in red blood cells and precipitate to form HbH inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies in the mature red blood cells are removed by the spleen and this results in an early destruction of these red blood cells. This destruction of red blood cells by the spleen is termed extravascular hemolysis.

Hemoglobin F is the predominant form in the fetus and it also contains α-globin, thus, in severe cases the disease can affect fetal development. Epidemiology The prevalence of hemoglobin H disease mirrors that of the hemoglobinopathies. As a whole, they are most prevalent in individuals of Asian, African, and Mediterranean decent. There is a protective effect against malaria for individuals carrying thalassemia genes, which explains the high frequency of thalassemia within the worldwide population. Clinical Presentation Patients with hemoglobin H disease present with chronic hemolytic anemia that ranges in severity form mild to moderate disease. Anemia is the most common presenting symptom of patients with HbH disease. Other common clinical features include jaundice, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and gallstones. All of these symptoms are related to the destruction of the red blood cells in the spleen and the associated increased hemoglobin metabolism.

Patients with non-deletional HbH disease are more likely to be symptomatic and have severe disease presentation when compared to individuals with deletional HbH disease. Disease presentation varies from asymptomatic individuals to neonatal growth retardation and death in the most severe cases. Death in the neonatal period occurs due to the severe anemia resulting in hydrops fetalis. Patients most often present initially due to hemolytic episodes that occur during times of infection or inflammation. During these episodes, patients may develop hemolytic crisis, in which there is a rapid drop in the hemoglobin due to increased red blood cell destruction. Diagnosis Hemoglobin analysis, with tests such as high-performance liquid chromatography, along with genetic testing are required for the confirmation of HbH disease.

### Hemoglobin… [^112Mvapd]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The medical condition hemoglobinemia, a form of anemia, is caused by intravascular hemolysis, in which hemoglobin leaks from red blood cells into the blood plasma. Mutations in the genes for hemoglobin can result in variants of hemoglobin within a single species, although one sequence is usually "most common" in each species. Many of these mutations cause no disease, but some cause a group of hereditary diseases called hemoglobinopathies. The best known hemoglobinopathy is sickle-cell disease, which was the first human disease whose mechanism was understood at the molecular level. A mostly separate set of diseases called thalassemias involves underproduction of normal and sometimes abnormal hemoglobins, through problems and mutations in globin gene regulation. All these diseases produce anemia. Oxyhemoglobin Oxyhemoglobin is formed during physiological respiration when oxygen binds to the heme component of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells.

This process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries adjacent to the alveoli of the lungs. The oxygen then travels through the blood stream to be dropped off at cells where it is utilized as a terminal electron acceptor in the production of ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation. It does not, however, help to counteract a decrease in blood pH. Ventilation, or breathing, may reverse this condition by removal of carbon dioxide, thus causing a shift up in pH. Hemoglobin exists in two forms, a taut form and a relaxed form. Various factors such as low pH, high CO~2~ and high 2, 3 BPG at the level of the tissues favor the taut form, which has low oxygen affinity and releases oxygen in the tissues. Conversely, a high pH, low CO~2~, or low 2, 3 BPG favors the relaxed form, which can better bind oxygen.

The partial pressure of the system also affects O~2~ affinity where, at high partial pressures of oxygen, the relaxed state is favoured. Deoxygenated hemoglobin Deoxygenated hemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. The absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ. The oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660 nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940 nm its absorption is slightly higher. This difference is used for the measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patient's blood by an instrument called a pulse oximeter. This difference also accounts for the presentation of cyanosis, the blue to purplish color that tissues develop during hypoxia. The dynamic mechanism of the cooperativity in hemoglobin and its relation with low-frequency resonance has been discussed.

Allosteric Carbon dioxide occupies a different binding site on the hemoglobin. At tissues, where carbon dioxide concentration is higher, carbon dioxide binds to allosteric site of hemoglobin, facilitating unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin and ultimately its removal from the body after the oxygen has been released to tissues undergoing metabolism. This increased affinity for carbon dioxide by the venous blood is known as the Bohr effect. Through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, carbon dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic acid, which decomposes into bicarbonate and protons: CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → HCO3− + H+ Hence, blood with high carbon dioxide levels is also lower in pH. Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which causes a conformational change in the protein and facilitates the release of oxygen. Protons bind at various places on the protein, while carbon dioxide binds at the α-amino group.

### Anemia… [^113Y3Rwc]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague, such as tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, headaches, and a reduced ability to exercise. When anemia is acute, symptoms may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss of consciousness, and increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause. Anemia can be temporary or long-term and can range from mild to severe. Anemia can be caused by blood loss, decreased red blood cell production, and increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of blood loss include bleeding due to inflammation of the stomach or intestines, bleeding from surgery, serious injury, or blood donation. Causes of decreased production include iron deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin B~12~ deficiency, thalassemia and a number of bone marrow tumors.

Causes of increased breakdown include genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, infections such as malaria, and certain autoimmune diseases like autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis of anemia in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L; in women, it is less than 120 to 130 g/L. Further testing is then required to determine the cause. Treatment depends on the specific cause. Certain groups of individuals, such as pregnant women, can benefit from the use of iron pills for prevention. Dietary supplementation, without determining the specific cause, is not recommended. The use of blood transfusions is typically based on a person's signs and symptoms. In those without symptoms, they are not recommended unless hemoglobin levels are less than 60 to 80 g/L. These recommendations may also apply to some people with acute bleeding. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are only recommended in those with severe anemia.

Symptoms of anemia can come on quickly or slowly. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. If the anemia continues slowly, the body may adapt and compensate for this change. In this case, no symptoms may appear until the anemia becomes more severe. Symptoms can include feeling tired, weak, dizziness, headaches, intolerance to physical exertion, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, irregular or rapid heartbeat, cold hands and feet, cold intolerance, pale or yellow skin, poor appetite, easy bruising and bleeding, and muscle weakness. Anemia that develops quickly, often, has more severe symptoms, including, feeling faint, chest pain, sweating, increased thirst, and confusion. There may be also additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause. In more severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output.

The person may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina, intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure. Causes The causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell production, increased RBC destruction, blood loss, and fluid overload. Several of these may interplay to cause anemia. The most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn, most commonly by iron deficiency.
- Anemia of folate deficiency, as with vitamin B~12~, causes megaloblastic anemia
- Anemia of prematurity, by diminished erythropoietin response to declining hematocrit levels, combined with blood loss from laboratory testing, generally occurs in premature infants at two to six weeks of age.

### Thalassemia… [^116fa55F]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood disorders that manifest as the production of reduced hemoglobin. Symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia and can vary from none to severe, including death. Often there is mild to severe anemia, as thalassemia can affect the production of red blood cells and also affect how long the red blood cells live. Symptoms include tiredness, pallor, bone problems, an enlarged spleen, jaundice, pulmonary hypertension, and dark urine. A child's growth and development may be slower than normal. Thalassemias are genetic disorders. Alpha thalassemia is caused by deficient production of the alpha globin component of hemoglobin, while beta thalassemia is a deficiency in the beta globin component. The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on how many of the four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are faulty.

Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing. TDTs include beta-thalassemia major, hemoglobin H disease, and severe HbE/beta-thalassemia. NTDT does not need regular transfusions but may require transfusion in case of an anemia crisis. Complications of transfusion include iron overload with resulting heart or liver disease. Other symptoms of thalassemias include enlargement of the spleen, frequent infections, and osteoporosis. Beta thalassemia symptoms typically begin to show during the first six months of life, as the body winds down production of fetal hemoglobin HbF. In a normal individual, this would be replaced by adult hemoglobin HbA. If thalassemia is untreated or undetected in the infant, this can lead to developmental issues such as slowed growth, delayed puberty, bone abnormalities, and intellectual impairment.

More generally, impaired production of hemoglobin causes anemia, resulting in tiredness and a general lack of energy, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, dizziness, pale skin, yellowing of the skin and eyes. The spleen is the organ which removes damaged red blood cells from circulation; in thalassemia patients it is abnormally active, causing it to enlarge and possibly become hyperactive, a condition called hypersplenism. The immune system can become compromised in a number of ways; anemia, iron overload, and hypersplenism may affect the immune response and increase the risk of severe infection. Pathophysiology Hemoglobin is a protein containing iron that facilitates the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the other tissues of the body, where it releases the oxygen to enable metabolism. A healthy level of hemoglobin for men is between 13. 2 and
16.

6 grams per deciliter, and in women between 11. 6 and 15 g/dl. Normal adult hemoglobin is composed of four protein chains, two α and two β-globin chains arranged into a heterotetramer. In thalassemia, patients have defects in the noncoding region of either the α or β-globin genes, causing ineffective production of normal alpha- or beta-globin chains, which can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis, premature red blood cell destruction, and anemia.
- In infants and adults, the excess β chains form unstable tetramers called hemoglobin H or HbH comprising 4 beta chains.
- In the fetus, the excess γ chains combine hemoglobin Bart's comprising 4 gamma chains Both HbH and Hb Bart's have a strong affinity for oxygen but do not release it, causing oxygen starvation in the tissues. They can also precipitate within the RBC damaging its membrane and shortening the life of the cell.

### Böhr effect… [^116Box5J]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

The Bohr effect is a phenomenon first described in 1904 by the Danish physiologist Christian Bohr. Hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity is inversely related both to acidity and to the concentration of carbon dioxide. That is, the Bohr effect refers to the shift in the oxygen dissociation curve caused by changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the pH of the environment. Since carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an increase in CO~2~ results in a decrease in blood pH, resulting in hemoglobin proteins releasing their load of oxygen. Conversely, a decrease in carbon dioxide provokes an increase in pH, which results in hemoglobin picking up more oxygen. In 1903, he began working closely with Karl Hasselbalch and August Krogh, two of his associates at the university, in an attempt to experimentally replicate the work of Gustav von Hüfner, using whole blood instead of haemoglobin solution.

Hüfner had suggested that the oxygen-haemoglobin binding curve was hyperbolic in shape, but after extensive experimentation, the Copenhagen group determined that the curve was in fact sigmoidal. Physiological role The Bohr effect increases the efficiency of oxygen transportation through the blood. After hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs due to the high oxygen concentrations, the Bohr effect facilitates its release in the tissues, particularly those tissues in most need of oxygen. When a tissue's metabolic rate increases, so does its carbon dioxide waste production. When released into the bloodstream, carbon dioxide forms bicarbonate and protons through the following reaction: Although this reaction usually proceeds very slowly, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase drastically speeds up the conversion to bicarbonate and protons.

This causes the pH of the blood to decrease, which promotes the dissociation of oxygen from haemoglobin, and allows the surrounding tissues to obtain enough oxygen to meet their demands. In areas where oxygen concentration is high, such as the lungs, binding of oxygen causes haemoglobin to release protons, which recombine with bicarbonate to eliminate carbon dioxide during exhalation. These opposing protonation and deprotonation reactions occur in equilibrium resulting in little overall change in blood pH. These waste products lower the pH of the blood, which increases oxygen delivery to the active muscles. Carbon dioxide is not the only molecule that can trigger the Bohr effect. If muscle cells aren't receiving enough oxygen for cellular respiration, they resort to lactic acid fermentation, which releases lactic acid as a byproduct. This increases the acidity of the blood far more than CO~2~ alone, which reflects the cells' even greater need for oxygen.

In fact, under anaerobic conditions, muscles generate lactic acid so quickly that pH of the blood passing through the muscles will drop to around 7. 2, which causes haemoglobin to begin releasing roughly 10% more oxygen. Strength of the effect and body size The magnitude of the Bohr effect is usually given by the slope of the \ \) vs \ curve where, P~50~ refers to the partial pressure of oxygen when 50% of haemoglobin's binding sites are occupied. The slope is denoted: \ \over \Delta {\text{pH}}} \) where \ denotes change. Mechanism Allosteric interactions The Bohr effect hinges around allosteric interactions between the hemes of the haemoglobin tetramer, a mechanism first proposed by Max Perutz in 1970. Haemoglobin exists in two conformations: a high-affinity R state and a low-affinity T state.

### Thrombocytopenia… [^111TfXfL]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

In hematology, thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood. Low levels of platelets in turn may lead to prolonged or excessive bleeding. It is the most common coagulation disorder among intensive care patients and is seen in a fifth of medical patients and a third of surgical patients. A normal human platelet count ranges from 150, 000 to 450, 000 platelets/microliter of blood. Values outside this range do not necessarily indicate disease. One common definition of thrombocytopenia requiring emergency treatment is a platelet count below 50, 000/μL. Thrombocytopenia can be contrasted with the conditions associated with an abnormally high level of platelets in the blood – thrombocythemia, and thrombocytosis. Signs and symptoms Thrombocytopenia usually has no symptoms and is picked up on a routine complete blood count.

Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding, such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms and petechiae in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin. Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not secondary to another disorder. Ensuring that the other blood cell types, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, are not also suppressed, is also important. Painless, round, and pinpoint petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form ecchymoses. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue, or yellow-green areas of skin that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body. A person with this disease may also complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness.

Acquired thrombocytopenia may be associated with the use of certain drugs. Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding, along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person's platelet count is between 30, 000 and 50, 000/μL, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15, 000 and 30, 000/μL, spontaneous bruising will be seen. Causes Thrombocytopenia can be inherited or acquired. Decreased production Abnormally low platelet production may be caused by:

- Dehydration, vitamin B~12~ or folic acid deficiency
- Leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or aplastic anemia
- Decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver in liver failure
- Sepsis, systemic viral or bacterial infection
- Leptospirosis. Increased destruction Abnormally high rates of platelet destruction may be due to immune or nonimmune conditions, including:

- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
- Hemolytic–uremic syndrome
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Post-transfusion purpura
- Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
- Hypersplenism
- Dengue fever
- Gaucher's disease
- Zika virus. Other causes
- Laboratory error, possibly due to the anticoagulant EDTA in CBC specimen tubes; a citrated platelet count is a useful follow-up study
- Snakebite
- Lyme disease
- Thrombocytapheresis
- Niemann–Pick disease. Diagnosis Laboratory tests for thrombocytopenia might include full blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, vitamin B~12~ levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear.

### Blood transfusion [^11622kB9]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Medical uses Red cell transfusion Historically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 100g/L or hematocrit fell below 30%. Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that, at 70 to 80g/L, is now usually used, as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes. The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath.

In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin due to iron deficiency, but are cardiovascularly stable, oral or parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. Other blood products are given where appropriate, e.g., fresh frozen plasma to treat clotting deficiencies and platelets to treat or prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients.
- Leukocyte reduction is the removal of white blood cells by filtration. Leukoreduced blood products are less likely to cause HLA alloimmunization, febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, cytomegalovirus infection, and platelet-transfusion refractoriness. In urgent cases where crossmatching cannot be completed, and the risk of dropping hemoglobin outweighs the risk of transfusing uncrossmatched blood, O-negative blood is used, followed by crossmatch as soon as possible. O-negative is also used for children and women of childbearing age.

It is preferable for the laboratory to obtain a pre-transfusion sample in these cases so a type and screen can be performed to determine the actual blood group of the patient and to check for alloantibodies. Immunologic reaction
- Acute hemolytic reactions are defined according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion as "fever and other symptoms/signs of haemolysis within 24 hours of transfusion; confirmed by one or more of the following: a fall of Hb, rise in lactate dehydrogenase, positive direct antiglobulin test, positive crossmatch" This is due to destruction of donor red blood cells by preformed recipient antibodies. Most often this occurs because of clerical errors or improper ABO blood typing and crossmatching resulting in a mismatch in ABO blood type between the donor and the recipient. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, hemorrhage, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and rapid drop in blood pressure.

When suspected, transfusion should be stopped immediately, and blood sent for tests to evaluate for presence of hemolysis.
- Delayed hemolytic reactions occur more than 24 hours after a transfusion. They usually occur within 28 days of a transfusion. They can be due to either a low level of antibodies present prior to the start of the transfusion, which are not detectable on pre-transfusion testing; or development of a new antibody against an antigen in the transfused blood. Therefore, delayed haemolytic reaction does not manifest until after 24 hours when enough antibodies are available to cause a reaction. The red blood cells are removed by macrophages from the blood circulation into liver and spleen to be destroyed, which leads to extravascular haemolysis. This process usually mediated by anti-Rh and anti-Kidd antibodies. However, this type of transfusion reaction is less severe when compared to acute haemolytic transfusion reaction.
