## Question

treatment for Psoriatic arthritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for psoriatic arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment goals and strategy. Then, I should verify how disease domains and severity guide therapy selection. Next, I will review first-line options for mild disease, followed by escalation to conventional synthetic DMARDs and then biologic or targeted synthetic agents. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities, and finally, I should confirm monitoring, treat-to-target principles, and when tapering is appropriate, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core treatment goals and strategy. Contemporary guidelines converge on a treat-to-target approach aiming for remission or low disease activity, with shared decision-making and regular reassessment to adjust therapy, which improves outcomes across arthritis, skin, and patient-reported quality of life [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e] [^e63e14b5].

> I need to check how disease domains and severity shape choices. PsA is heterogeneous, spanning peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin/nail psoriasis; therapy should address all active domains, and severity is typically gauged by joint counts, acute phase reactants, structural damage, and impact on function and quality of life, which together inform escalation decisions [^d0c3965c] [^e97076ee].

> For mild, oligoarticular disease, let me verify the first-line approach. NSAIDs and local intra-articular corticosteroids are appropriate for symptom control, but I should confirm they do not modify structural progression; if disease remains active after a 2–3 month NSAID trial, I should escalate to a conventional synthetic DMARD, particularly methotrexate, recognizing its lower efficacy than TNF inhibitors but its utility for skin disease and cost considerations [^339e4dec] [^7e395220] [^fea6063e].

> Now, for moderate to severe peripheral arthritis or polyarticular disease, I should confirm the role of conventional synthetic DMARDs. Methotrexate is generally preferred as first-line csDMARD, with leflunomide or sulfasalazine as alternatives when methotrexate is unsuitable; I need to ensure we set expectations that csDMARDs are less effective than TNF inhibitors and may not prevent radiographic progression in all patients, prompting timely escalation if targets are not met [^11ddd346] [^7e395220] [^b51ac9d2].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to biologic or targeted synthetic therapy. Inadequate response after 3–6 months of optimized csDMARD therapy, or intolerance, justifies escalation; active axial disease generally requires direct biologic therapy rather than csDMARDs, and I should align the mechanism to the dominant domains, for example IL-17 or TNF inhibitors for peripheral arthritis and axial disease, IL-12/23 for skin-predominant disease, and JAK inhibition when rapid onset is needed or biologics are contraindicated [^e97076ee] [^d0c3965c] [^c8787d36].

> Let me consider specific agents and their evidence. TNF inhibitors have long-standing efficacy and radiographic inhibition, with roughly 58–59% ACR20 responses in trials and inhibition of structural progression; IL-17 inhibitors are effective across peripheral and axial domains and skin; IL-12/23 inhibition with ustekinumab is particularly strong for cutaneous psoriasis; JAK inhibition with tofacitinib offers oral therapy with rapid onset; I should double-check that comparative head-to-head data are limited, so agent selection should integrate domain activity, comorbidities, and patient preference [^d863a21e] [^af040030] [^5001942d] [^c8787d36].

> But wait, what if the patient has predominant axial disease or enthesitis. I should confirm that NSAIDs remain first-line for axial symptoms, with escalation to biologics if symptoms persist or disease is active; TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors are preferred for axial PsA, and I need to ensure we do not rely on methotrexate for axial involvement given limited efficacy in this domain [^23e7a6c2] [^d0c3965c].

> I will now examine special populations and comorbidities that modify therapy. Inflammatory bowel disease favors TNF inhibitors or ustekinumab and argues against IL-17 blockade; significant infection risk may steer toward IL-12/23 or NSAIDs rather than TNF inhibitors or JAK inhibitors; cardiovascular disease and malignancy require individualized risk–benefit discussions; pregnancy planning necessitates avoidance of teratogens and careful selection of agents; I should confirm these align with guideline cautions and labeling considerations [^c8787d36] [^d0c3965c].

> Next, I should review monitoring and treat-to-target implementation. Regular assessment every 3–6 months using composite measures such as DAPSA or minimal disease activity, with joint counts, patient global, pain, function, and acute phase reactants, guides escalation; I need to ensure we also track skin, nail, enthesitis, dactylitis, and axial symptoms, and adjust therapy until remission or low disease activity is achieved [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e] [^1fdaa785].

> Hold on, I should verify when tapering is appropriate. Once a patient achieves sustained low disease activity or remission for at least 6–12 months, dose reduction or spacing can be considered with shared decision-making, close monitoring, and readiness to re-escalate if flares occur; I should confirm this is supported by BSR and EULAR guidance and note that tapering is less well studied in PsA than in rheumatoid arthritis [^01363260] [^05cbf529].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. Start with NSAIDs or local steroids for mild disease and escalate promptly if targets are not met; initiate methotrexate or an alternative csDMARD for moderate disease; escalate to biologic or targeted synthetic therapy for inadequate response or for axial disease; select the agent based on active domains and comorbidities; monitor comprehensively every 3–6 months; and consider tapering only after sustained control, adjusting as needed over time [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e] [^d0c3965c].

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) management is **individualized and domain-driven**, aiming for remission or low disease activity using a treat-to-target strategy [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e]. For mild disease, start with NSAIDs and local corticosteroids; for moderate to severe disease, use methotrexate or other csDMARDs, and escalate to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs if inadequate response [^11ddd346] [^e97076ee]. TNF inhibitors are **first-line biologics** [^c8787d36]; IL-17, IL-12/23, and JAK inhibitors are alternatives based on domain activity and comorbidities [^c8787d36]. Monitor every 3–6 months and adjust therapy to maintain control; consider tapering after sustained remission [^01363260] [^05cbf529].

---

## Treatment goals and principles

- **Treat-to-target**: Aim for remission or low disease activity with regular monitoring and adjustment [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e].
- **Domain-based care**: Tailor therapy to active domains (peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin/nail) [^d0c3965c].
- **Shared decision-making**: Incorporate patient preferences, comorbidities, and safety [^c8787d36].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological care complements pharmacotherapy: **physical therapy** improves function and reduces pain, and **patient education** enhances adherence and self-management. Lifestyle measures — weight management, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation — also improve outcomes.

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### Mild disease

For mild disease, **NSAIDs** are first-line for symptom control, and **intra-articular corticosteroids** are used for localized inflammation.

---

### Moderate to severe disease

#### Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)

- **Methotrexate**: Preferred first-line csDMARD; effective for peripheral arthritis and skin disease [^11ddd346] [^7e395220].
- **Leflunomide, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine**: Alternatives when methotrexate is unsuitable or ineffective [^notfound].
- **Limitations**: Lower efficacy than biologics; limited axial disease control [^7e395220].

---

#### Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)

| **Biologic class** | **Agents** | **Indications** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TNF inhibitors | - Etanercept <br/> - Adalimumab <br/> - Infliximab <br/> - Golimumab | - Peripheral arthritis <br/> - Axial disease <br/> - Enthesitis <br/> - Dactylitis | - First-line biologics <br/> - High efficacy <br/> - Monitor infection risk [^e9dd1d43] [^83a095c2] |
| IL-17 inhibitors | - Secukinumab <br/> - Ixekizumab | - Peripheral arthritis <br/> - Axial disease <br/> - Skin disease | Effective across domains; avoid in IBD [^c8787d36] |
| IL-12/23 inhibitor | Ustekinumab | - Peripheral arthritis <br/> - Skin disease | Effective for skin and joints; favorable safety [^5001942d] |
| CTLA-4 Ig | Abatacept | Peripheral arthritis | Option after TNF/IL-17 failure [^c8787d36] |

---

#### Targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs)

- **JAK inhibitors**: Tofacitinib, upadacitinib for peripheral arthritis; consider when rapid onset needed or biologics contraindicated [^c8787d36].
- **Safety**: Monitor for infection, thrombosis, and malignancy risk [^notfound].

---

## Treatment selection by disease domain

- **Peripheral arthritis**: Methotrexate; escalate to TNF inhibitors or other bDMARDs/tsDMARDs if inadequate response [^11ddd346] [^e97076ee].
- **Axial disease**: TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors; csDMARDs are ineffective [^notfound].
- **Enthesitis/dactylitis**: TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Skin/nail disease**: Methotrexate, IL-12/23, or IL-17 inhibitors based on severity [^11ddd346].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular assessments every 3–6 months should track disease activity, joint counts, skin involvement, and patient-reported outcomes. Therapy should be **adjusted** to maintain remission or low disease activity, with escalation or switching if targets are not met [^05cbf529] [^03a07a0e].

---

## Tapering and discontinuation

After sustained remission (≥ 6–12 months), **dose reduction or spacing** can be considered with shared decision-making and close monitoring for relapse [^01363260] [^331b3e9a].

---

## Special considerations

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and IBD influence **agent selection and monitoring**. In pregnancy, avoid methotrexate, leflunomide, and JAK inhibitors; prefer TNF inhibitors when needed.

---

Psoriatic arthritis care is **individualized and domain-driven**, using a treat-to-target approach with csDMARDs, bDMARDs, and tsDMARDs to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing adverse effects.

Since the second version of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations were published in 2015, therapeutic options for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have advanced considerably. This work reviews the literature since the previous recommendations (data published 2013–2020, including conference presentations between 2017 and 2020) and reports high-quality, evidence-based, domain-focused recommendations for medication selection in PsA developed by GRAPPA clinicians and patient research partners. The overarching principles for the management of adults with PsA were updated by consensus. Principles considering biosimilars and tapering of therapy were added, and the research agenda was revised. Literature searches covered treatments for the key domains of PsA: peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail psoriasis; additional searches were performed for PsA-related conditions (uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease) and comorbidities. Individual subcommittees used a GRADE-informed approach, taking into account the quality of evidence for therapies, to generate recommendations for each of these domains, which were incorporated into an overall schema. Choice of therapy for an individual should ideally address all disease domains active in that patient, supporting shared decision-making. As safety issues often affect potential therapeutic choices, additional consideration was given to relevant comorbidities. These GRAPPA treatment recommendations provide up-to-date, evidence-based guidance on PsA management for clinicians and people with PsA.

Although patients with mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or intra-articular steroid injections, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, particularly methotrexate, along with the biologic agents, are considered the standard of care in patients with more significant psoriatic arthritis. We will discuss the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the biologic therapies in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In the first 5 parts of the American Academy of Dermatology Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we have presented evidence supporting the use of topical treatments, phototherapy, traditional systemic agents, and biological therapies for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this sixth and final section of the Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we will present cases to illustrate how to practically use these guidelines in specific clinical scenarios. We will describe the approach to treating patients with psoriasis across the entire spectrum of this fascinating disease from mild to moderate to severe, with and without psoriatic arthritis, based on the 5 prior published guidelines. Although specific therapeutic recommendations are given for each of the cases presented, it is important that treatment be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. In addition, we will update the prior 5 guidelines and address gaps in research and care that currently exist, while making suggestions for further studies that could be performed to help address these limitations in our knowledge base.

### Recent advances in the management of psoriatic arthritis [^c5820c76]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of psoriatic arthritis is currently estimated at 7 to 42% of the population with active psoriasis, considered to affect 2 to 3% of the general population. Unmanaged psoriatic arthritis may result in progressive radiologic erosion, severe physical limitations, and disability. Newer trials in psoriatic arthritis therapy demonstrate ongoing ability to control disease symptoms and signs and the progression of the disease significantly.

Recent Findings

Recognition of the immunopathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, as with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, prompts ongoing examination of the efficacy of several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. A new crop of biologics and pharmaceuticals with increased molecular specificity compared with traditional immunosuppressant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have been shown to be highly effective in inhibiting the symptoms and progression of psoriatic arthritis with less severe side effects.

Summary

Therapies either recently approved or pending approval by the Food and Drug Administration for psoriatic arthritis management are safe and effective in the treatment of symptoms, significantly improve quality of life, and prevent long-term progression of the disease.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) — epidemiology, onset, and dermatology practice actions — shows that among patients with psoriasis, studies demonstrate a range from as low as 6% to as high as 42% developing PsA, and in the United States general population the prevalence is estimated between 0.1% to 0.25%; in a recent large clinical trial with more than 1000 patients, 84% had cutaneous manifestations for an average of 12 years before onset. Dermatologists are strongly encouraged to actively seek signs and symptoms of PsA at each visit; if PsA is diagnosed, treatment should be initiated to alleviate signs and symptoms of PsA, inhibit structural damage, and maximize quality of life (QOL), and dermatologists uncomfortable or untrained in evaluating or treating patients with PsA should refer to rheumatologists. PsA can develop at any time including childhood, but for most it appears between the ages of 30 and 50 years; PsA affects men and women equally, and erosive and deforming arthritis occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with PsA based on data from rheumatology referral centers.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) conclusions — PsA is an inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis, and left untreated a proportion of patients may develop persistent inflammation with progressive joint damage leading to severe physical limitations and disability. Several viable treatment options are available, including NSAIDs and/or intra-articular injections of corticosteroids for patients with milder, localized PsA, and DMARDs including methotrexate and/or biologics (the TNF inhibitors) for patients with more severe PsA. Because PsA can be a very severe disease with significant functional impairment, early diagnosis is critical and affords the opportunity to improve QOL, improve function, and slow disease progression. Because the large majority of patients (84%) with PsA have psoriasis for approximately 12 years before developing joint symptoms, dermatologists are in an excellent position to make this diagnosis and treat PsA appropriately; therefore, we strongly encourage dermatologists to actively seek signs and symptoms of PsA at every patient visit. If PsA is diagnosed, treatment should be initiated to alleviate signs and symptoms of PsA, inhibit structural damage, and maximize QOL, and dermatologists uncomfortable or untrained in evaluating or treating patients with PsA should refer to rheumatologists.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) moderate to severe disease — standard of care specifies that for patients with moderate to severe PsA that is more extensive or aggressive or that impacts QOL significantly, treatment with methotrexate, TNF blockers, or both is the standard of care, and although DMARD efficacy appears less than for TNF inhibitors, prospective, randomized, adequately powered, comparative, head-to-head trials are lacking to support or refute this impression.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Selected gaps in knowledge for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — natural history and subpopulations identify that there is a need for large prospective longitudinal broadly representative cohort studies of psoriasis, environmental risk factors remain poorly defined, and data are necessary to determine if modification of identified risk factors will prevent psoriasis or modify its severity. Prognosis of psoriasis is poorly understood, including the rate at which psoriasis will get worse over time versus spontaneously clear and determinants of alterations in psoriasis activity. Natural history and morbidity in subpopulations including children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and minorities requires more study, and little is known about disparities in treatment and health-related quality of life in these groups.

### GRAPPA treatment recommendations: an update from the GRAPPA 2013 annual meeting [^9c2a0a41]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the association of arthritis and periarticular inflammation in patients with psoriasis. In addition to a heterogeneous and variable clinical course, PsA is complex and multifaceted and may include prominent involvement in the peripheral and axial diarthrodial joints, the skin and nails, and in periarticular structures such as entheses. A central mission of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) is to develop guidelines, based upon the best scientific evidence, for the optimal treatment of patients with PsA. Guidelines were previously published in 2009 based on an evidence-based systematic review. Given important recent developments and robust ongoing research into the treatment of PsA, GRAPPA undertook to update the guidelines. Herein we outline the specific methods and procedures used both in the initial and the current evidence-based, systematic reviews of treatments for PsA. We also review the numerous discussions regarding how best to finalize and publish these new guidelines in 2014.

### Advances in treatment of psoriatic arthritis: current guidelines and emerging therapies [^09f29876]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a multifaceted autoimmune condition that affects the peripheral and axial joints, entheses, skin, and nails. The management of PsA relies on prompt diagnosis and early initiation of effective treatment to minimize joint destruction. Treatment options for PsA are rapidly evolving and emerging. This review will discuss screening tools, early diagnosis/outcome measures, and treatment guidelines for PsA, including the most recent EULAR/GRAPPA/ACR recommendations. Advances in science and technology are also rapidly changing the landscape of medicine, and we have discussed how targeted therapies, smartphone monitoring, and artificial intelligence could benefit PsA monitoring and treatment. Finally, we discussed the concept of treating PsA as a multisystem disorder with a multidisciplinary team of specialists and implementation of a 'Total Care' program. Overall, this review highlights the evolving treatment frameworks in PsA, advocating for early detection, comprehensive assessment, and targeted therapy that can improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of etanercept in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis… [^e30dc03c]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview Previously presented data from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials led to the approval of etanercept for reducing clinical signs and symptoms of PsA. One-year radiographic data from Protocol 20021630 led to an additional approval of etanercept for inhibiting structural progression in PsA. Data are used for the following purposes:

- To summarize the clinical efficacy and safety results previously described in the 6-month clinical study report and the radiographic results previously described in the 1-year clinical study report.
- To show the effect of etanercept on physical function in subjects with PsA and psoriasis, as measured by 2 patient-reported outcome measures.

- To present the radiographic results at 2 years from baseline and the final clinical efficacy and safety results during the open-label period of the study.
- Active PsA at the time of screening, including ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender/painful joints.

### Pan American league of associations for rheumatology recommendations for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^27e59cb3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is chronic disease that compromises multiple domains and might be associated with progressive joint damage, increased mortality, functional limitation, and considerably impaired quality of life. Our objective was to generate evidence-based recommendations on the management of PsA in Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR) countries.

Methods

We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)-ADOLOPMENT approach to adapt the 2019 recommendations of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology. A working group consisting of rheumatologists from various countries in Latin America identified relevant topics for the treatment of PsA in the region. The methodology team updated the evidence and synthesized the information used to generate the final recommendations. These were then discussed and defined by a panel of 31 rheumatologists from 15 countries.

Results

Theses guidelines report 15 recommendations addressing therapeutic targets, use of antiinflammatory agents and corticosteroids, treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (conventional synthetic, biologic, and targeted synthetic), therapeutic failure, optimization of biologic therapy, nonpharmacological interventions, assessment tools, and follow-up of patients with PsA.

Conclusion

Here we present a set of recommendations to guide decision making in the treatment of PsA in Latin America, based on the best evidence available, considering resources, medical expertise, and the patient's values and preferences. The successful implementation of these recommendations should be based on clinical practice conditions, healthcare settings in each country, and a tailored evaluation of patients.

### Clinical management of psoriatic arthritis [^7787ed3c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis, or the broader term psoriatic disease, refers to an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple organs, including the skin and joints, and that also has related extra-articular manifestations and can have comorbidities. Patients with psoriatic disease have a substantial clinical burden. Early identification leading to timely diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent long-term structural damage and disability and the associated socioeconomic consequences. The increase in therapeutic options, such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, both biological and targeted synthetic, has revolutionised the treatment of skin and joint disease, and has prompted clinicians to use the full clinical picture of an individual patient to make rational treatment decisions. Current research is also focused on treatment strategies, including treat to target, early remission-induction, and tapering.

### Treat to target in psoriatic arthritis [^1fdaa785]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

A treat-to-target approach to psoriatic arthritis has emerged as a topic of interest following successful application of this treatment paradigm to rheumatoid arthritis. In psoriatic arthritis, this has been examined in one randomized trial to date showing benefits of a tight control treatment strategy over standard care. Nonetheless, international treatment recommendations have called for clinicians to aim for a target of remission or low disease activity, although little or no consensus exists on how to measure these targets. An ideal measure to define a treatment target should be able to address all the disease domains and preferences pertinent to an individual patient.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^2075a9ba]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

Efficacy and use pattern of TNF inhibitors in PsA — when TNF inhibitors are used in the treatment of patients with PsA, they are often combined with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), particularly methotrexate; this combination approach is considered by many to be the standard of care for the treatment of PsA, although prospective, randomized, adequately powered clinical trials comparing combination therapy with either agent alone have not been performed in PsA.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) mild disease — initial management includes physical therapy, patient education, and medication; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used, and when only a few joints are involved rheumatologists may perform local intra-articular corticosteroid injections, but although these approaches can lead to good symptomatic relief, neither is capable of inhibiting the development of structural joint damage.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in psoriasis — epidemiology and treatment impact notes that PsA is common in patients with psoriasis and can be disabling, with radiographic damage in 7% to 47% of patients at a median interval of 2 years; many have cutaneous manifestations for up to 12 years before PsA onset, and treatment with TNF-alfa-blocking agents can relieve signs and symptoms, inhibit structural damage, and improve quality-of-life parameters.

Patient education in psoriasis — Patient education is essential to optimizing psoriasis treatment for all categories of disease severity, psoriasis nurse specialists play an important role by spending time counseling and educating patients and are a valuable asset, and all patients with moderate to severe psoriasis should be strongly encouraged to develop an ongoing relationship with a primary care provider so that potential comorbidities can be prevented or diagnosed and treated early to minimize end organ damage.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis: a view on effectiveness, clinical practice and toxicity [^33db51bb]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriatic arthritis is a common and often severe chronic joint disorder associated with the skin disease psoriasis (PsO). Treatment options for psoriatic arthritis patients have changed considerably over the last decade with the widespread use of biological therapies, in particular tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. Current clinical experience based on large registries and careful observations now allows us to understand the true value of these interventions in daily clinical practice.

Areas Covered

Literature searches were performed targeting effectiveness, drug survival, toxicity and safety of biological therapies as well as treatment strategies specifically focused on patients with psoriatic arthritis.

Expert Opinion

Tumour necrosis factor inhibition is a powerful and effective option for the treatment of severe psoriatic arthritis. The different available drugs have good survival rates and show an excellent balance between effectiveness and toxicity. Switching of inhibitor is feasible, but treatment changes should be carefully considered. Novel biological therapies are introduced into the market and will further provide better perspectives for the patient. New questions are also emerging: How to handle long-term remission, can biological therapies be successfully stopped and are co-morbidities sufficiently managed? These questions should be addressed for optimal long-term management of a severe chronic disease.

### Initiative for quality in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^6345fbbd]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common and severe skin disease. Up to 30% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), another severe disease that contributes significantly to the burden of psoriatic disease in patients. The treatment of patients with both psoriasis and PsA is particularly challenging, because different strategies are often followed, and considerable resources are needed for these chronic inflammatory diseases. Of note, psoriasis patients tend to be undertreated. Efforts to improve the management of psoriasis and PsA are urgently needed, to incorporate improvement of patient outcomes by promotion of best practice from both the medical and the pharmacoeconomic perspective. These are the goals of the Quality Movement in the USA and of quality management in general. The need for evidence-based guidance on safety, efficacy, overall outcome, and cost-effectiveness is being addressed by numerous initiatives striving to generate practice guidelines, control costs, and optimize cost-effectiveness of treatments. The 2007 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis's (GRAPPA) Initiative for Quality aims to secure and improve management of psoriasis and PsA, elaborating on these evidence-based guidelines by defining major domains of quality and creating a checklist that identifies physicians who can administer state-of-the-art medical services to patients who need their services.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Selected gaps in knowledge for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — treatments, safety, and biology note that comparative effectiveness of psoriasis treatments for plaque psoriasis is under-studied and few studies that exist are short term, making it difficult to determine which drugs are most safe and effective long term and leading to broad recommendations that list options in alphabetical order. Comparative effectiveness for clinical variants such as guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, inverse, and palmoplantar psoriasis is an area with almost no data. Most safety data for psoriasis therapies come from other diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, and it is unclear if such data acutely reflect safety of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, methotrexate, and other therapies in the psoriasis population; risks of clinically significant liver toxicity with methotrexate using existing liver biopsy guidelines require further study. Safety and effectiveness of home- or office-based narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) compared with other treatments in the U.S. population requires additional study. Studies indicate that the majority of patients with objectively severe psoriasis are treated only topically or not at all, and more data are necessary to determine patient, physician, treatment, and economic factors that limit long-term control. In genetics and pathomechanisms, studies evaluating correlation between psoriasis genotype and phenotype should be undertaken, and vasculature has been understudied with an animal model showing that overexpression of an angiopoietin receptor in keratinocytes leads to mice bearing numerous criteria of psoriasis.

Since its inception, one of the central missions of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) has been the development of treatment recommendations for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The initial guidelines, developed in 2009, were updated in 2015. Because of the abundance of new data concerning the therapeutic approach to PsA, GRAPPA members have been working throughout 2020–2021 to once again update the recommendations. At the GRAPPA 2021 annual meeting, the full committee presented proposals from each of the treatment domain groups, including the comorbidities and related conditions groups, based on previous systematic literature reviews. Overarching principles and summary evidence tables were presented, including results from a GRAPPA membership survey of patients and clinicians to assess levels of agreement. A draft of the figure for the treatment recommendations was presented and discussed with the wider membership.

### Treatment of psoriatic arthritis: management recommendations [^38d3a0f9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Given the varied therapeutic options available for the management of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), recommendations for the management of PsA have been developed by several expert groups. These recommendations deal mainly with pharmacological treatments. At the international level, 2 recommendations sets are available: these have been developed by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) and by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR). These recommendations were published in 2009 and in 2012, respectively; and updates of these recommendations are currently ongoing. The first sets of recommendations dealt with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, conventional synthetic disease modifying drugs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors; the 2015 sets of recommendations also deal with new drugs with other mechanisms of action, namely ustekinumab, secukinumab and apremilast. In the present paper, we will review these management recommendations.

### Systematic review of treatments for psoriatic arthritis: an evidence based approach and basis for treatment guidelines [^68e65d4b]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the association of arthritis and psoriasis. In addition to a heterogeneous and variable clinical course, PsA is complex and multifaceted and may include prominent involvement in the peripheral and axial diarthrodial joints, the skin and nails, and in periarticular structures such as entheses. A central mission of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) is to develop guidelines, based upon the best scientific evidence, for the optimal treatment of patients with PsA. We outline the specific methods and procedures used in this evidence-based, systematic review of treatments for PsA, which we hope will provide a basis for future treatment guidelines.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^bc43200c]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a complex inflammatory musculoskeletal and skin disease. The treatment of PsA has changed substantially over the past 10 years. Clinical practice guidelines are developed to help busy clinicians rapidly integrate evolving knowledge of therapeutic management into practice. In this review, we compare PsA treatment recommendations or guidelines developed by one national organization [ACR and National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) in 2018], one regional organization (EULAR in 2015), and one international organization (the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis in 2015). We examine the development of guidelines in PsA more broadly and examine similarities and differences in the three sets of recommendations.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^da115874]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of clinical practice guidelines and/or treatment recommendations is to provide clinicians with the best evidence available in selected scenarios in order to allow physicians to deliver the best health care. This is particularly important as the number of new therapies expands and we learn more about the complexity of diseases and how different disease elements may direct therapy selection. In no disease is this more relevant than psoriatic disease where six new therapies have entered the market in the past 5 years, including four first-in-class therapies.

In this paper, we discuss how treatment recommendations have dealt with the individual features of PsA, the therapies and the relative lack of comparative data in creating a decision-making pathway for physicians. We examine and compare treatment recommendations or guidelines from the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), the EULAR, and the ACR/National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF).

Treatment selection for active PsA — methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade, or the combination is considered first-line treatment for patients with moderate to severely active PsA; although there are no prognostic indicators to identify these patients early, approximately 50% of patients with PsA may develop structural damage. Not all patients require methotrexate or TNF blockade, as patients with mild PsA can be successfully treated with NSAIDs or intraarticular injections of corticosteroids.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) response criteria (PsARC) — Improvement requires meeting at least two of four components with specified thresholds and a required joint count improvement, without worsening in any component: improvement in at least two of the following 4 criteria with (1) 20% or more improvement in physician global assessment, (2) 20% or more improvement in patient global assessment, (3) 30% or more improvement in tender joint count, and (4) 30% or more improvement in swollen joint count; a mandatory component is improvement in tender or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any PsARC component should be observed. The PsARC discriminates treatment effect but has significant limitations, including focus on peripheral manifestations and diminished capacity to capture dactylitis and enthesitis.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) moderate to severe disease — patients with more extensive or aggressive disease require more potent therapy than NSAIDs or intra-articular corticosteroid injections, ie, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); methotrexate evidence includes two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with one evaluating 21 patients treated with 3 intramuscular injections at 10-day intervals and another treating 37 patients with between 7.5 and 15 mg/wk for 12 weeks that showed superior physician assessment of arthritis activity versus placebo, yet methotrexate is frequently used as the primary DMARD in PsA because of efficacy for skin and joint involvement and low cost.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatment — case example and evidence-based approach: Photographs depict a patient 1 week after initiating anti–TNF therapy with generalized plaques and the same patient after 34 weeks with major improvement. Mild PsA is most often managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, and if PsA is unresponsive after 2 to 3 months of therapy with NSAIDs, treatment with methotrexate (MTX) should be considered. For patients with moderate to severe PsA, MTX, TNF-alfa blockade, or the combination of these therapies is considered first-line treatment. In a 12-month randomized multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral cyclosporine plus oral MTX in PsA with prior incomplete MTX response, there was significant improvement in swollen joint count and C-reactive protein in the MTX–cyclosporine arm compared with baseline, but not in the MTX–placebo group. Across pivotal trials, the comparative efficacy of the 4 currently approved TNF-alfa blocking agents and ustekinumab shows similar efficacy for PsA signs and symptoms at the primary end point and marketed dosages, though differences are observed for cutaneous psoriasis; infliximab clears cutaneous psoriasis in the highest proportion and with the greatest rapidity, followed by adalimumab then etanercept. In TNF-alfa inhibitor studies of PsA, between 40% and 50% of patients were taking concomitant MTX. Golimumab has not been tested as monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who do not have PsA. PASI assessments in PsA studies often begin below 10, making PASI-75 evaluation difficult to interpret statistically. Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy in a small phase II trial, with 42% of the 76 ustekinumab-treated patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20 response at week 12 compared with 14% of the 70 placebo-treated patients.

### Cyclosporine in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis… [^45ac45f3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The short-term efficacy of cyclosporine in the treatment of six patients with moderately severe to severe psoriatic arthritis was evaluated in an open study. Patients received oral cyclosporine for eight weeks. In all patients, significant improvement of psoriasis was noted within two to four weeks. At the end of therapy, rheumatologic assessment revealed the following trends in disease activity: a decrease in the number of tender joints, joint tenderness index, duration of morning stiffness, and an increase in grip strength. There was a decrease in the number of swollen joints, joint swelling index, and the time taken to walk 50 ft. Overall disease activity significantly improved as assessed independently by the patient and physician. For psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease activity worsened toward baseline within four weeks of discontinuation of therapy. Shortterm, low-dose cyclosporine therapy may be effective in treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### Special article: 2018 American College of Rheumatology / National Psoriasis Foundation guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^c8787d36]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF).

Methods

We identified critical outcomes in PsA and clinically relevant PICO (population/intervention/comparator/outcomes) questions. A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for PsA. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A voting panel, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, other health professionals, and patients, achieved consensus on the direction and the strength of the recommendations.

Results

The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, and addresses the use of oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib). We also developed recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, and treatment in the presence of concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections. We formulated recommendations for a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, indicating the importance of active discussion between the health care provider and the patient to choose the optimal treatment.

Conclusion

The 2018 ACR/NPF PsA guideline serves as a tool for health care providers and patients in the selection of appropriate therapy in common clinical scenarios. Best treatment decisions consider each individual patient situation. The guideline is not meant to be proscriptive and should not be used to limit treatment options for patients with PsA.

### Psoriatic arthritis: new evidence for old concepts [^fd7dba4b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review gives an updated overview of some of the new concepts in the management of psoriatic arthritis (PsA): early diagnosis, remission as an objective, treat-to-target, and treatment guidelines.

Recent Findings

Early diagnosis, targeting remission as part of a treatment strategy, and new guidelines providing evidence-based support to these concepts are main topics in recent publications.

Summary

Dermatologists and rheumatologists should work together to reduce the number of patients remaining undiagnosed, and the time to do so. Remission definition in PsA is still controversial. There is good evidence and convincing arguments for both multidimensional measures, such as minimal disease activity, or unidimensional ones, as disease activity index for PsA. New data on the analysis of tight control of inflammation in early PsA trial showed that the strategy might not be cost-effective on the short term, and that oligoarthritis is less benefited. The new European League Against Rheumatism and Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and PsA recommendations exhibit differences. Methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are favored in European League Against Rheumatism guidelines, whereas other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics are equally positioned in Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and PsA recommendations.

Terminology and basic components in treatment guideline development

First, the terms 'guidelines' and 'recommendations' are used differently by various groups. The ACR uses the term 'guidelines' to refer to the full set of recommendations within the paper. GRAPPA has chosen to use the term 'recommendations' as treatment scenarios may be varied by health care system and setting and thus the term recommendation leaves up to the physician and patient the final decision instead of imposing a 'guideline', felt to be a more stringent term. EULAR follows the same convention. Regardless of the term used, the decision regarding the selection of a specific therapy for an individual patient is between the physician and the patient.

The basic development of a treatment guideline begins with identifying the process that will be used. For example, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is among the most commonly used methods for developing guidelines (and is used by the ACR and several other organizations in North America and Europe). Other options include the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (used by the American Academy of Dermatology), and the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) (used by EULAR). All of these methods require selecting a key group of decision makers, which ideally involves multiple stakeholders including content experts and, in many cases, patient representative of those receiving the therapies. These processes depend on systematic literature reviews but vary somewhat in the definitions of the strength of the evidence. After selecting a methodology to be employed and recruiting stakeholders, the scope of the guideline is decided upon. For example, will only pharmacotherapies be examined or will non-pharmacological therapies, treatment strategies or other methods of management be considered? This is more formally decided upon in GRADE and similar methods in that the specific questions [i.e. patient–intervention–comparator–outcome (PICO) questions] are designed. Evidence is then gathered to address the questions of interest through systematic literature reviews. Evidence is assembled into a readable format (i.e. tables) and reviewed by the stakeholders. Voting proceeds after evidence review (using a variety of formats). Following voting, recommendations are generated as key action statements and typically a strength and grade of recommendation is also provided. The guideline is then published. Ideally, after publication, the implementation of the guideline is appraised to determine whether the guideline was useful and whether it changed clinician behavior. We will walk through each of these components for the guideline (or set of recommendations) to understand how they are similar and different.

General recommendations for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) screening and referral — dermatologists are strongly encouraged to consider the possible concurrent diagnosis of PsA in patients presenting with psoriasis, and a PsA Screening and Evaluation tool has been developed to screen patients with psoriasis for inflammatory arthritis; in pilot testing, 69 patients were screened using a 15-item questionnaire, and a total score of 47 or higher distinguished PsA from non-PsA with 82% sensitivity and 73% specificity. Dermatologists uncomfortable evaluating or treating PsA should refer suspected cases to rheumatologists, and upon diagnosis patients should be treated and/or referred to a rheumatologist to alleviate signs and symptoms, inhibit structural damage, and improve QOL parameters.

Psoriatic arthritis prognosis — risk of erosive disease indicates that although prediction is generally not possible, one study of 71 patients suggested that polyarticular onset (≥ 5 swollen joints) may predict the appearance of erosive and deforming disease over time, and PsA can lead to chronic joint damage, increased disability, and increased mortality with important social and financial impacts including direct and indirect costs.

Psoriatic arthritis diagnosis — clinical approach emphasizes that diagnosis is based on clinical judgment; specific patterns of joint inflammation together with the absence of rheumatoid factor and the presence of skin and nail lesions of psoriasis aid clinicians, and there are no specific serologic tests to confirm PsA, while radiographs can be helpful for diagnosis.

TNF inhibitors for PsA — three TNF-α antagonists, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of PsA, and guideline ratings show adalimumab A (level of evidence I), etanercept A (I), and infliximab A (I). Because the clinical trial ACR20 efficacy data at the primary end point with all 3 FDA-approved TNF blockers are roughly equivalent, the choice of agent is an individual one with the degree and severity of cutaneous involvement an important consideration.

### Group for research and assessment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 2015 treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis [^cf32ab8f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2009 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations for the spectrum of manifestations affecting patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Methods

GRAPPA rheumatologists, dermatologists, and PsA patients drafted overarching principles for the management of PsA, based on consensus achieved at face-to-face meetings and via online surveys. We conducted literature reviews regarding treatment for the key domains of PsA (arthritis, spondylitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin disease, and nail disease) and convened a new group to identify pertinent comorbidities and their effect on treatment. Finally, we drafted treatment recommendations for each of the clinical manifestations and assessed the level of agreement for the overarching principles and treatment recommendations among GRAPPA members, using an online questionnaire.

Results

Six overarching principles had ≥ 80% agreement among both health care professionals (n = 135) and patient research partners (n = 10). We developed treatment recommendations and a schema incorporating these principles for arthritis, spondylitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin disease, nail disease, and comorbidities in the setting of PsA, using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. Agreement of > 80% was reached for approval of the individual recommendations and the overall schema.

Conclusion

We present overarching principles and updated treatment recommendations for the key manifestations of PsA, including related comorbidities, based on a literature review and consensus of GRAPPA members (rheumatologists, dermatologists, other health care providers, and patient research partners). Further updates are anticipated as the therapeutic landscape in PsA evolves.

Psoriatic arthritis systemic therapy positioning and methotrexate (MTX) comparisons state: "Until the results of the phase III trials of ustekinumab for PsA become available, the TNF-alfa inhibitors should be considered the biologic class of choice for these patients". Although MTX is less costly, "only recently have there been prospective, randomized, adequately powered clinical trials comparing MTX with the TNF-alfa inhibitors in PsA". Trial data report, "In one trial, treatment with 15 mg a week of oral MTX did not prevent radiologic progression of PsA, whereas in another trial, increasing the weekly MTX dosage to 25 mg did appear to reduce radiologic progression of PsA". The text notes, "All of the TNF-alfa inhibitors appear to diminish the likelihood of radiographic progression of PsA compared with MTX", and "Adding low-dose MTX to one of the TNF-alfa inhibitors leads to further improvement in PsA joint responses", yet "it is difficult for the clinician to make definitive recommendations regarding the proper sequence or duration of therapies that should be used to treat patients with moderate to severe PsA".

### Toward harmonized recommendations for psoriatic arthritis: a comparative viewpoint on global guidelines [^f59c3c2a]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatment guidelines aim to deliver consistent, evidence-based care across clinical settings. However, the development of multiple regional guidelines often leads to methodological overlap, variability in implementation, and resource redundancy. This Viewpoint compares recent recommendations from ACR, GRAPPA, EULAR, PANLAR exploring their similarities and differences in methodology, structure, and stakeholder composition. We discuss the challenges in maintaining updated recommendations in a rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape and propose a collaborative framework centered on core global recommendations with regional adaptations. Emerging tools, such as living systematic reviews and artificial intelligence, may support more efficient updates, but stakeholder engagement remains essential. Ultimately, a hybrid approach balancing global harmonization with local relevance may enhance the utility and sustainability of PsA guidance.

### Comprehensive treatment of psoriatic arthritis: managing comorbidities and extraarticular manifestations [^9e37a69f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis that can lead to decreased health-related quality of life and permanent joint damage leading to functional decline. In addition to joint and skin manifestations, both psoriasis and PsA are associated with numerous comorbidities and extraarticular/cutaneous manifestations, which may influence the physician's choice of therapy. The objectives of this review are (1) to identify comorbidities in patients with PsA based on the available evidence; (2) to examine the effects of these comorbidities or extraarticular/cutaneous manifestation on the management of patients with PsA as well as the selection of therapy; and (3) to highlight research needs around comorbidities and treatment paradigms. This review is part of a treatment recommendations update initiated by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA).

### Management of psoriatic arthritis in 2016: a comparison of EULAR and GRAPPA recommendations [^f7621038]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous, potentially severe disease. Many therapeutic agents are now available for PsA, but treatment decisions are not always straightforward. To assist in this decision making, two sets of recommendations for the management of PsA were published in 2016 by international organizations - the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA). In both sets of recommendations, the heterogeneity of PsA is recognized and the place of various drugs in the therapeutic armamentarium is discussed. Such agents include conventional DMARDs, such as methotrexate, and targeted therapies including biologic agents, such as ustekinumab, secukinumab and TNF inhibitors, or the targeted synthetic drug apremilast. The proposed sequential use of these drugs, as well as some other aspects of PsA management, differ between the two sets of recommendations. This disparity is partly the result of a difference in the evaluation process; the focus of EULAR was primarily rheumatological, whereas that of GRAPPA was balanced between the rheumatological and dermatological aspects of disease. In this Perspectives article, we address the similarities and differences between these two sets of recommendations and the implications for patient management.

American College of Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation psoriatic arthritis guideline — Developed as an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), it used a systematic literature review with GRADE methodology and a voting panel to reach consensus on recommendation direction and strength. The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, addressing oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib); it also includes recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, treatment with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections, and a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, and the guideline serves as a tool for therapy selection but is not meant to be proscriptive or to limit treatment options for patients with PsA.

### Therapy strategies in psoriatic arthritis [^b1c8e760]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous condition with a myriad of different clinical presentations. It commonly affects the skin and musculoskeletal system causing psoriasis, peripheral arthritis, axial arthritis, enthesitis and dactylitis. Many patients also have related conditions, such as those within the metabolic syndrome and associated spondyloarthritis (SpA) conditions including inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis. Any therapeutic strategy must be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account her/his complete clinical presentation and comorbidities. New treatment recommendations from the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) provide evidence based recommendations on effective therapies for the management of each different manifestation of PsA, and how treatment may be affected by comorbidities (1). However, the limited evidence comparing different treatment strategies in PsA is recognised as a limitation in these recommendations and further information is detailed below.

### Enhancing current guidance for psoriatic arthritis and its comorbidities: recommendations from an expert consensus panel [^979d88ee]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PsA is a chronic inflammatory joint disease occurring in approximately one-quarter of individuals with psoriasis (PsO). It is highly heterogeneous in its presentation, encompassing a range of musculoskeletal manifestations, including peripheral arthritis, axial inflammation (spondylitis), dactylitis and enthesitis. In addition to progressive joint damage and pain, PsA is associated with extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis and IBD, with comorbidities including metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, and it can adversely affect a patient's quality of life.

Recent data emphasize the importance of timely diagnosis, as untreated PsA can lead to irreversible joint damage, which is experienced by approximately half of PsA patients within 2 years of diagnosis. However, many patients experience significant diagnostic delay, owing in part to the challenges of differential diagnosis and the lack of validated biomarkers. Following diagnosis, comprehensive assessment should consider arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin/nail disease and axial involvement, as well as the overall impact on individual patients. Comprehensive evaluation facilitates the selection of appropriate treatments that target specific disease domains and associated comorbidities to reduce morbidity and mortality. To achieve optimal patient care, there is a need for clear and actionable guidance for clinicians on screening and referral (many patients with PsO are managed in primary care or dermatology settings), as well as for optimal management of PsA and its comorbidities.

The existing guidelines, such as those provided by EULAR, the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), the ACR, the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) and the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), give comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis and pharmacological management of PsA. Owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, gaps have been identified relating to the application of guidance in clinical practice, ongoing non-pharmacological management, and quality of care benchmarking, often associated with a lack of evidence.

Consequently, an expert consensus group aimed to develop an evidence- and consensus-based set of recommendations for the management of PsA in clinical practice. A consensus programme was undertaken to define minimum and best quality standards for day-to-day PsA management, adding value to existing recommendations and guidelines, and to provide practical strategies and tools for achieving these quality standards and supporting clinicians, without replacing current guidance.

Key messages

There is great heterogeneity in PsA manifestations and assessment.
There is an ever increasing number of PsA outcomes and outcome measures as quantified in this review.
It is difficult to draw conclusions on comparative effectiveness with such heterogeneity across PsA clinical trial outcomes. This has direct implications for clinical practice by increasing the complexity of evidence based treatment decisions.

### Safety and efficacy of tofacitinib vs methotrexate in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsOLSET-BD) [^ff2ab20d]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

It binds to JAK and prevents the activation of the JAK-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway which ultimately decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and prevents both inflammatory response and the inflammation-induced damage. It has shown better efficacy in many diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis, Axial spondyloarthropathies, Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Alopecia areata, dry eye disease. This prospective, open label, randomized study will be conducted in inpatient and outpatient departments of Rheumatology, BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 110 adult volunteers of both genders diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis. Patients will be divided equally into two groups, Group A will be put on Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily and Group B will be put on Methotrexate weekly in increasing dose with maximum dose of 25 mg weekly.

Background: Methotrexate, an anti-folate drug, is a widely accepted and commonly used DMARD for the treatment of PsA. Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor, and relatively new drug for this condition. Aims: To assess and compare safety and efficacy of Tofacitinib and Methotrexate in the treatment of PsA. Methodology: This open label, randomized, prospective study was conducted in Department of Rheumatology, BSMMU, Dhaka for 1½ years from September, 2017 to February, 2019. 61 patients, aged > 18 years with the diagnosis of PsA for ≥ 3 months were randomized into two groups. 29 patients and 32 patients were enrolled and followed-up at the end of 1, 3 and 6 months. Primary endpoint was ACR 20 response at the end of 3 months. Patients who achieved treatment target on the basis of DAPSA score at the end of 3 months were allowed to continue previuos treatment and assessed for safety and efficacy till 6 months.

Patients not achieving treatment target in Tofacitinib group were put on Tofacitinib 10 mg BD and in MTX group were put on Tofacitinib 5 mg BD.

### Systematic review of treatments for psoriatic arthritis: 2014 update for the GRAPPA [^ebd1f419]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the association of arthritis and periarticular inflammation in patients with psoriasis. In addition to a heterogeneous and variable clinical course, PsA is complex and multifaceted and may include prominent involvement in the peripheral and axial diarthrodial joints, the skin and nails, and in periarticular structures such as entheses. Simultaneous inflammation in the skin and musculoskeletal structures in a single patient, a relatively common scenario, often leads to marked decrease in function and quality of life. Thus, it is essential for the clinician to document the extent of disease involvement and craft a therapeutic plan that addresses the different domains of disease. In an effort to update previous treatment recommendations developed by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), several evidence-based, systemic reviews of therapies for PsA were completed, analyzed, and circulated for consensus.

### Treat-to-target in PsA: methods and necessity [^e63e14b5]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

With increasing recognition of the high burden and impact of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and the growing number of therapeutic options, there has been an intensifying focus on treatment strategy in recent years. In 2015, the Tight Control of Psoriatic Arthritis study confirmed the clinical benefit of using a treat-to-target approach in PsA. This randomised controlled trial found benefits in both arthritis and psoriasis disease activity as well as lower disease impact reported by patients, although participants allocated to tight control experienced a higher rate of serious adverse events. European and international recommendations support the use of a treat-to-target approach in PsA and have offered specific advice on how to do this using outcomes such as the minimal disease activity criteria. However, implementation of this approach in routine practice is low, with real-world data highlighting undertreatment as a result. Recent qualitative work with physicians in the UK has helped researchers to understand the barriers to implementation of treat-to-target in PsA. We now need to address these barriers, provide education and support to non-specialist clinicians in routine practice, and aid the translation of optimal care to the clinic.

### Clinical aspects of psoriatic arthritis: one year in review 2024 [^7337d67a]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a very pleomorphic inflammatory disease characterised by its association with psoriasis and the development of a wide spectrum of comorbidities that can impact patients' prognosis and quality of life. In recent years, several new drugs have been developed, showing significant efficacy in alleviating symptoms and signs, while maintaining a generally favourable safety profile. Despite these advancements, the management of PsA remains potentially suboptimal. Indeed, a percentage of patients do not respond to therapies, or they may improve only in limited outcomes, resulting in a challenge for the management of the burden of disease. In this paper we reviewed the literature on PsA from January 1st 2022 to July 1st 2024.

Regarding medical management for psoriatic arthritis, more specifically with respect to conventional DMARDs, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate a conventional synthetic DMARD, with methotrexate preferred in the presence of clinically relevant skin involvement, in patients with polyarthritis
or monoarthritis/oligoarthritis and poor prognostic factors, such as structural damage, elevated acute phase reactants, dactylitis, or nail involvement.

### Psoriatic arthritis: a comprehensive review for the dermatologist-part II: screening and management [^c268be41]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a common comorbidity of psoriasis occurring in up to one-third of patients. Dermatologists hold an essential role in screening patients with psoriasis for PsA, since as many as 85% of patients develop psoriasis before PsA. Early detection and treatment of PsA are important for both short- and long-term patient outcomes and quality of life. Many factors must be weighed when selecting the appropriate therapy for PsA. One must consider the 'domains of disease' that are manifested, the disease severity, patient comorbidities, patient preferences (routes of dosing or frequency, as examples) as well as factors often outside of patient-physician control, such as access to medications based on insurance coverage and formularies. As many patients will have involvement of multiple domains of psoriatic disease, selecting the therapy that best captures the patient's disease is required. In this review, we will address PsA screening, diagnosis, therapeutic approach to psoriatic disease, comorbidity considerations, and comanagement.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 2. psoriatic arthritis: overview and guidelines of care for treatment with an emphasis on the biologics [^873339f9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patterns and imaging detail two major patterns — peripheral joint disease (polyarticular or pauciarticular) and skeletal or axial disease — with approximately 95% of patients having peripheral joint involvement, about 5% having exclusively axial involvement, and 20% to 50% having both spine and peripheral joint involvement. Asymptomatic involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints may occur, and radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography imaging can be helpful in detecting asymptomatic disease.

### Drug therapies for peripheral joint disease in psoriatic arthritis: a systematic review [^b50d3961]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

In 2009, GRAPPA published their first evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Since then, new information has been published and drugs developed. We summarize evidence for the efficacy of available treatments for peripheral joint involvement in PsA. We performed a systematic review of current literature on the efficacy of different therapies, management, and therapeutic strategies for peripheral arthritis involvement in PsA, in order to provide information for the development of the new GRAPPA treatment recommendations.

### Psoriatic arthritis: a dermatologist's perspective [^ea71b8f7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a common, destructive arthritis that may manifest in more than one-third of psoriasis patients. Dermatologists are in a unique position to diagnose PsA early, and to start prompt, effective treatment. Such early intervention with biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists, which appear to hold particular promise in the long-term management of PsA, may significantly reduce morbidity, improve quality of life and substantially reduce the economic (patient and societal) burden of PsA.

Introduction

Individuals with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, potentially leading to delays in receiving appropriate treatment. Many individuals with PsA consider their disease to be severe but view available treatment options as equally or more burdensome. Consequently, the long-term outcomes for patients with PsA tend to be poor, marked by disease progression, poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), increasing disability, comorbidities, and high direct and indirect costs.

To explore the possible solutions to these issues, the Psoriatic Arthritis Forum was convened on October 29, 2012, in London. Its members included experts in rheumatology and dermatology as well as patient representatives from Europe and North America. The primary goals of the Psoriatic Arthritis Forum were to define unmet needs and gaps in PsA diagnosis and treatment and discuss potential ways in which to address these gaps, focusing on defining and implementing consistent standards of detection and care. This consensus statement summarizes the findings of this working group.
