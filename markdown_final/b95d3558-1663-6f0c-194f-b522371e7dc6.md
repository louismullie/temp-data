## Question

Tell me everything I need to know about ganglion cysts as a 3rd year medical student

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comprehensive overview of ganglion cysts tailored for a third-year medical student. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what a ganglion cyst is and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and typical locations. Next, I will review clinical presentation and the bedside diagnostic approach, including when to image. After that, I need to examine management strategies, including observation, aspiration, and surgery, with recurrence data and cost considerations. Finally, I should consider special populations, complications, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking areas where evidence conflicts or where I might be overgeneralizing.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. A ganglion cyst is a benign, fluid-filled lesion arising from joints or tendon sheaths, characterized by a dense fibrous capsule without a synovial lining and filled with gelatinous, mucopolysaccharide-rich fluid; this distinguishes it from a synovial cyst, which has a synovial lining and may communicate with the joint, and from a true cyst with an epithelial lining, which ganglia lack [^fddbdc4e] [^250cc4cf]. Wait, let me verify the origin theories: historically, a synovial herniation model was proposed, but more recent work supports capsular rent or degenerative changes with fluid leakage and myxoid degeneration, particularly in the dorsal scapholunate region, which aligns with the absence of synovial cells in the cyst wall on electron microscopy and the high protein content of the fluid [^8e2a6756] [^250cc4cf].

> I need to check epidemiology and common locations. Ganglion cysts are the most common soft-tissue mass of the hand and wrist, with a female predominance and peak incidence in young adults, though they occur across ages and can be seen in children; dorsal wrist ganglia predominate in adults, whereas volar wrist and flexor tendon sheath ganglia are relatively more common in children, and intraosseous and intraneural variants occur but are less frequent [^250cc4cf] [^729ec1a0] [^66d8fffb]. Hold on, I should verify location nuances: sonographic series sometimes show a higher proportion of volar cysts, which may reflect referral or ascertainment bias, so I should be cautious not to overstate volar predominance outside of specific cohorts [^faf1536b].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation. Most ganglia are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally or for cosmetic reasons; when symptomatic, patients report a firm, smooth, round mass that may fluctuate in size, with pain or mechanical symptoms if the cyst compresses tendons, ligaments, or nerves, and transillumination is a classic bedside test showing light transmission through the clear fluid [^250cc4cf] [^a823c672]. I should confirm nerve involvement: volar radial ganglia can compress the radial artery or sensory branches, and dorsal ganglia can irritate the posterior interosseous nerve, while intraneural ganglia can cause focal neuropathies such as peroneal palsy with foot drop, underscoring the need to assess neurovascular status on exam [^49a46712] [^4cdf86c1].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis is primarily clinical; transillumination and aspiration yielding thick, clear, gelatinous fluid support the diagnosis, and ultrasound is the first-line imaging when the diagnosis is uncertain, to confirm cystic nature, define size and loculations, and guide interventions; MRI is reserved for atypical features, suspected occult ganglia, intraosseous or intraneural disease, or when malignancy is a concern, with high diagnostic accuracy for distal upper-extremity ganglia on MRI [^62e61213] [^9e7ab87f] [^a823c672]. Hold on, I should verify the role of routine imaging: in classic, uncomplicated cases, imaging is not necessary, but I need to ensure I do not miss alternative diagnoses such as giant cell tumor of tendon sheath or other solid masses when the story is atypical [^250cc4cf] [^f7f20984].

> I will now examine management, starting with observation. I should double-check the natural history data: approximately 50% of wrist ganglia resolve spontaneously over time, with pediatric cohorts showing even higher spontaneous resolution, often within 1–2 years; thus, observation with reassurance is appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cysts, especially in children and when there is no functional impairment [^a74dd7a1] [^152d5f6d] [^8791c278]. Wait, let me verify pediatric specifics: children under 10 years, particularly with volar or flexor sheath ganglia, have higher spontaneous resolution rates, reinforcing a conservative approach when feasible [^152d5f6d] [^66d8fffb].

> Next, I should review aspiration. Aspiration can provide temporary relief and confirm the diagnosis when fluid is obtained, but recurrence is common, with mean recurrence around 59% in adults and even higher in some pediatric series; importantly, adding corticosteroid after aspiration does not improve outcomes, so routine steroid injection is not recommended by contemporary guidelines [^8c30c49b] [^117c9858] [^ac46829d]. Hold on, I should verify the guideline stance: AAFP 2024 explicitly recommends against corticosteroid injection for ganglion cysts, aligning with the lack of added benefit over aspiration alone [^ac46829d].

> Now, I need to assess surgical management. Surgical excision offers the lowest recurrence among active treatments, with open excision recurrence around 6–21% and arthroscopic excision around 6–17% in pooled analyses; comparative data suggest open excision may have lower recurrence than arthroscopic in some series, though technique and surgeon experience likely modulate outcomes, and both approaches are acceptable depending on expertise and patient factors [^8c30c49b] [^64ec6552]. I should confirm indications: persistent pain, functional limitation, cosmetic distress after shared decision-making, or failure of observation are reasonable reasons to proceed to excision, with counseling about recurrence and risks such as stiffness, scar tenderness, and rare neurovascular injury [^250cc4cf].

> Let me think about cost and setting. Cost-minimization analyses suggest that two aspiration attempts followed by open excision in a procedure room setting minimizes cost per resolved case compared with immediate arthroscopic excision, which is substantially more expensive; this supports a stepwise approach when patients prefer to try less invasive options first, while acknowledging recurrence risk and the need for counseling [^14173316] [^100db424]. I should double-check that these models incorporate recurrence and revision, which they do, strengthening the practical applicability for shared decision-making [^14173316].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In children, observation is favored given high spontaneous resolution, with surgery reserved for symptomatic or persistent cases; recurrence after surgery may be higher in pediatric cohorts, and prior aspiration has been associated with increased recurrence risk in some series, possibly due to scarring and more difficult dissection, so technique and timing matter [^152d5f6d] [^f8be62df] [^0308e28a]. For intraneural ganglia, particularly peroneal nerve involvement, surgical decompression with ligation of the articular branch is the standard to prevent recurrence and restore function, with excellent motor recovery reported despite frequent preoperative weakness [^312c39aa] [^b71230ac]. But wait, what if the cyst is intraosseous or periosteal? In those rarer scenarios, curettage with bone grafting or targeted excision is indicated for persistent pain or risk of pathologic fracture, and MRI helps define extent and joint communication for operative planning [^4ab169b0] [^a00ffd8c].

> Next, I should review complications and red flags. Although ganglia are benign, complications include nerve compression with neurologic deficits, vascular compromise in volar radial cysts, and rare infection or hemorrhage; iatrogenic complications can occur after procedures, and rare systemic infections such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported after excision, emphasizing sterile technique and postoperative vigilance [^6aaa3a64]. Hold on, I should verify that these are exceptional events; yes, serious complications are uncommon but real, reinforcing the principle of balancing intervention with risk and patient preference [^250cc4cf].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework. For asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cysts, recommend observation with clear return precautions; for symptomatic cysts, offer aspiration with counseling about high recurrence and the lack of benefit from steroids, or proceed directly to excision based on patient preference, severity, and access; for recurrent or complex cysts, consider MRI to define anatomy and plan surgery; and for pediatric patients, lean toward observation unless pain, dysfunction, or persistence drives intervention, with shared decision-making guiding the timing of surgery [^250cc4cf] [^ac46829d] [^152d5f6d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that aspiration is contraindicated; it is not, but patients should be counseled that recurrence is likely and that steroids do not help, which aligns with guideline-based care [^ac46829d] [^f2c05209].

> Finally, I should double-check the key takeaways. Ganglion cysts are common, benign, and often self-limited; diagnosis is clinical with transillumination and, when needed, ultrasound; observation is appropriate for many, especially children; aspiration offers temporary relief but high recurrence; surgery has the lowest recurrence but carries procedural risks; and management should be individualized with shared decision-making, cost-conscious stepwise care, and attention to special entities like intraneural or intraosseous cysts [^250cc4cf] [^8c30c49b] [^14173316] [^152d5f6d].

Ganglion cysts are **benign, fluid-filled swellings** that most often arise from the joint capsule or tendon sheath, most commonly at the dorsal wrist, volar wrist, or flexor tendon sheath [^250cc4cf]. They present as firm, smooth, round masses that **transilluminate** and may fluctuate in size; most are asymptomatic, but some cause pain, weakness, or neurovascular compression [^250cc4cf] [^62e61213]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with ultrasound used to confirm cystic nature and guide interventions; MRI is reserved for atypical or deep lesions or when malignancy is suspected [^62e61213] [^9e7ab87f]. Management is **observation first**, as many resolve spontaneously; persistent or symptomatic cysts may be aspirated, though recurrence is common, and surgical excision offers the lowest recurrence but carries risks of injury and stiffness [^8c30c49b] [^250cc4cf]. Prognosis is excellent, with low malignant potential and high patient satisfaction after appropriate care [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology and histology

- **Origin**: Ganglion cysts arise from the joint capsule or tendon sheath, likely due to mucoid degeneration of connective tissue or herniation of synovial tissue [^fddbdc4e].
- **Structure**: They lack a true epithelial lining; the wall is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue, and the content is a clear, viscous, gelatinous fluid rich in hyaluronic acid and mucopolysaccharides [^fddbdc4e].
- **Communication**: Many cysts communicate with the joint or tendon sheath via a stalk, explaining recurrence after incomplete removal [^ba25bfd1].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Appearance**: Firm, smooth, round, fluctuant swellings that transilluminate; size varies and may change with activity or spontaneously [^250cc4cf].
- **Common locations**: Dorsal wrist (most common), volar wrist, flexor tendon sheath, and less commonly intraosseous or intraneural [^250cc4cf] [^729ec1a0].
- **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic; when symptomatic, patients report pain, tenderness, weakness, or neurovascular compression (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome) [^250cc4cf] [^2ac465a2].
- **Natural history**: Many cysts resolve spontaneously; recurrence is common after aspiration or incomplete excision [^a74dd7a1] [^8c30c49b].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Primarily based on history and physical examination, including transillumination and palpation [^250cc4cf].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is first-line to confirm cystic nature, guide aspiration, and identify stalks; MRI is reserved for atypical, deep, or recurrent lesions, or when malignancy is suspected [^62e61213] [^9e7ab87f].
- **Aspiration**: Thick, clear, gelatinous fluid confirms the diagnosis; chemical analysis is rarely necessary [^250cc4cf].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes epidermal inclusion cysts, lipomas, giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath, synovial cysts, rheumatoid nodules, and soft-tissue sarcomas [^f7f20984] [^739f703d]. Key distinguishing features are transillumination, aspiration of gelatinous fluid, and ultrasound/MRI confirmation of cystic nature [^250cc4cf] [^62e61213].

---

## Management strategies

| **Treatment option** | **Indications** | **Recurrence rate** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Observation | Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cysts | 40–60% spontaneous resolution | None |
| Aspiration | Symptomatic cysts, patient preference | 50–70% | Infection, recurrence |
| Surgical excision | Persistent symptoms, functional impairment, cosmetic concern | 5–20% | Infection, scar, stiffness, neurovascular injury |

---

Observation is **first-line** because many cysts resolve spontaneously; aspiration provides temporary relief but has high recurrence; surgical excision offers the lowest recurrence but carries procedural risks [^8c30c49b] [^250cc4cf]. Intra-articular ganglia (e.g. ACL ganglion cysts) may cause mechanical symptoms and often require arthroscopic excision for resolution [^1955e871] [^ef92beab].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent**, with low malignant potential and high satisfaction after appropriate management [^notfound]. Complications are rare and include recurrence, infection, neurovascular injury, and stiffness; intraneural ganglia can cause significant neurologic deficits if not addressed [^250cc4cf] [^72010456].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be educated about the **benign nature** of ganglion cysts, the high likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and the risks and benefits of intervention options. Shared decision-making is essential, especially for asymptomatic cysts where observation is reasonable [^250cc4cf].

---

Ganglion cysts are common, benign soft-tissue lesions with a characteristic presentation and a favorable prognosis. Most can be managed conservatively, with **intervention reserved for persistent symptoms or patient preference**.

Objective

Ganglion cysts are common hand masses. This article will answer three questions that the radiologist is often asked: A mass is palpable; is it a cyst? Pain or neurologic symptoms are present; are they related to a cyst? Surgery is being considered; where precisely are the cyst and its origin located?

Conclusion

Ultrasound is often sufficient for assessing typical cysts. MRI is performed when atypical features or neurologic symptoms are present and in specific preoperative settings.

### Factors influencing why children and their families choose surgery for ganglion cysts [^28072b2f]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ganglion cysts of the hand/wrist are frequently managed without surgery but can be treated with surgical excision if there is pain or dysfunction. No studies have examined the specific factors predictive of surgical treatment for pediatric patients.

Methods

This was a study of pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) with ganglion cysts of the hand/wrist seen between 2017 and 2019 at 2 institutions. Baseline demographic data were collected in addition to cyst characteristics, Wong-Baker pain scores, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scores (pain, depression, upper extremity function, anxiety). Multivariable regression was used to determine the factors predictive of surgical intervention at ≥ 6 months of eligible follow-up.

Results

A total of 167 patients with a mean age of 10.1 ± 5.3 years were included for analysis. Forty-three (25.7%) underwent surgical excision of their ganglion cyst at means of 2.3 months after the initial visit and 12.6 months after cyst appearance. Sex and cyst location were similar between cohorts. Surgical patients were older (12.1 vs 9.4 years, respectively) and presented to the clinic later after an appearance (10.9 vs 6.5 months, respectively) compared to nonsurgical patients. Surgical patients also had higher pain scores at presentation (median, 3 vs 0, respectively). Cysts receiving surgery were larger than those without surgery (81.4% vs 55.3% > 1 cm, respectively). Pain interference Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scores were higher in the surgical than the nonsurgical group (45.2 vs 39.6, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, pain scores ≥ 4 (odds ratio, 3.4) were predictive of surgery for patients ≥ 3 years, whereas older age (odds ratio, 1.1) and a cyst size > 1 cm (odds ratio, 3.3) predicted surgery across all patients.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients with ganglion cysts who initially present at older ages with moderate/severe pain scores and larger cysts are more likely to ultimately choose surgical excision. Surgeons may observe a preference for earlier surgery in this subset of patients.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^f06cb5cb]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical excision of symptomatic, soft-tissue cystic lesions of this type, arthroscopic when possible, has been the advocated treatment so far, with satisfactory results. However, percutaneous image-guided procedures, including aspiration, with or without cyst rupture and/or steroid injection, are also effective alternatives that, despite the higher recurrence and failure rates, may avoid surgery without precluding it if warranted. Recent data suggest that the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of SCs might help in the selection of patients who may benefit the most from nonsurgical intervention as a first treatment option, with T2-hyperintensity predicting a better outcome, probably due to the lower viscosity of their content making them easier to rupture. The distinction between an SC and a GC may also help in orienting therapy toward correcting any coexisting arthropathy, frequent in SC, or in simply targeting the lesion itself by means of surgical excision for instance, which is more commonly required in GCs that are refractory to conservative therapy.

### Nonoperative treatment of an interosseous ganglion cyst [^aeaeac9b]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts of the knee are being reported more frequently secondary to an increased rate of magnetic resonance imaging studies. Although knee pain is the impetus for imaging, ganglion cysts are often incidental findings. Nonoperative treatment is a successful therapeutic option. We report a patient with variable pain presentations over the course of her treatment. The pattern of complaints pointed to different primary etiologies about the knee, but all were common to an interosseous ganglion cyst. A stepwise assessment and expansion of the differential diagnosis allowed for appropriate utilization of modalities and limited morbidity with nonoperative therapy.

### Hand tumors: I. skin and soft-tissue tumors of the hand [^739f703d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Hand tumors of the skin and soft tissue are frequently encountered by plastic surgeons. Although similar to lesions affecting other parts of the body, the presentation, workup, and treatment options often differ in the hand secondary to its complex anatomy and functional significance. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of those lesions that commonly arise in the hand-including epidermal inclusion cysts, ganglion cysts, and glomus tumors-in addition to tumors such as soft-tissue sarcomas that are rare but nonetheless require astute diagnosis and expedient initiation of treatment. Presenting symptoms and clinical features, recommended workup, and appropriate treatment options are reviewed.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^a823c672]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Most GCs in the wrist are asymptomatic and easily diagnosed by physical examination, seen as a smooth nodular tumefaction of firm consistency on palpation of 1–2 cm that transilluminates, imaging remaining reserved for less obvious cases, especially those presenting with sensory and/or motor symptoms due to nerve compression. Nevertheless, spontaneous resolution occurs in up to 50% of cases, and the main reason that patients seek medical evaluation is cosmetic concern, as symptoms are rarely significant.

As previously mentioned, US is the first-line imaging modality. The GC is also the most accurate MRI-based diagnosis among distal, upper-extremity soft-tissue masses, with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 94.4%.

US-guided aspiration is an effective procedure when treatment is required, reducing patient discomfort and the risk of damage to adjacent structures when compared to the non-guided technique, as well as avoiding the potential risks of surgery. However, mainly due to its lower recurrence rate, surgical resection remains the gold-standard treatment option, arthroscopy being a very promising alternative. Steroid injection after aspiration does not seem to significantly improve the success rate of simple aspiration.

### Ganglions in the hand and wrist: advances in 2 decades [^250cc4cf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Ganglion cysts represent the most common soft-tissue mass in the hand and wrist. Ganglion cysts are most commonly encountered at the dorsal or volar aspects of the wrist, although cysts may arise from the flexor tendon sheath, interphalangeal joint, and extensor tendons. Intraosseous and intraneural ganglion cysts have also been described. Diagnosis of ganglion cysts relies primarily on history and physical examination. Transillumination and aspiration of masses may be useful adjuncts to diagnosis. Imaging such as radiography and ultrasonography may be indicated to evaluate for associated conditions, such as degenerative joint disease, or to rule out a solid or heterogeneous mass. Advanced imaging such as MRI is generally reserved for patients in whom occult ganglions, intraosseous ganglions, or solid tumors, including sarcoma, remain a concern. Treatment of ganglion cysts includes observation, aspiration or puncture with possible corticosteroid injection, and surgical excision. Nonsurgical management may result in cyst resolution in over 50% of patients. Surgical excision is associated with recurrence rates of 7% to 39%. Advances in surgical techniques have allowed surgeons to conduct arthroscopic ganglion excision, with recurrence rates similar to those of open management. This study highlights the advances in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes that have taken place over the past 2 decades for this common condition affecting the hand and wrist in the adult population.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: what the radiologist needs to know [^e7f74b1d]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Given the fact that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being performed more frequently for assessment of the knee joint (e.g. post-traumatic, in sport injuries, in rheumatological disorders, in oncological imaging), the number of incidental cystic and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee joint found on routine knee MRI scans has also increased. The vast majority of these lesions are benign, ranging from benign cysts to complications of underlying diseases and many of them demonstrate characteristic features on MRI, thus allowing a confident diagnosis to be made. Knowledge of the common anatomical locations and appearances of bursae, recesses, cysts and ganglia is necessary so that radiologists do not misinterpret these benign entities as soft-tissue tumours. It is of paramount importance for the radiologist to be aware of the MRI features because understanding the spectrum of appearances of the various benign cystic lesions is vital for optimal patient management. This article is intended to be a comprehensive pictorial review of the most common and uncommon benign cystic and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee joint. For easier classification purposes, benign cysts were subdivided into categories as following: (1) synovial cysts, (2) ganglion cysts, (3) meniscal cysts and (4) intraosseous cysts. Similarly, "cyst-like" lesions were subclassified into the following: (1) normal knee bursae, (2) normal knee recesses and (3) miscellaneous cyst-like lesions.

### Active treatment of pediatric ganglia of the wrist: what is the risk of recurrence? [^117c9858]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ganglion cysts are the most common soft tissue mass in the hand and wrist in both adults and children. More is known about wrist ganglia and their treatment outcomes in adults than in children. Current literature to guide the management of pediatric wrist ganglia is limited. The purpose of this study is to report on the rates of recurrence of pediatric wrist ganglia after active intervention-aspiration or surgical excision-at a single center, as well as to explore factors associated with recurrence in one of the largest samples to date of pediatric wrist ganglia.

Methods

In all, 205 pediatric patients with wrist ganglia from our institution with at least 2-year follow up were included. The primary outcome was the recurrence rate after treatment type (aspiration vs. surgery). Secondary outcomes were demographic factors (age, sex, etc.), cyst location (volar vs. dorsal), duration of cyst before intervention, and surgeon specialty training (hand vs. non-hand).

Results

Recurrence was seen in 58.4% (n = 94) of patients undergoing their first aspiration. Recurrence was seen in 34% (n = 97) of patients after the first surgery, but there was a significant difference in recurrence rate based on the surgeon's fellowship training.

Conclusion

In conclusion, surgery does appear to offer a higher chance of definitive resolution of pediatric wrist ganglia. Differences in technique among surgeons should be explored as a possible factor to explain the range of recurrence rates described in the limited literature on this topic.

### Ganglion cyst of temporomandibular joint – A systematic review [^650f735c]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ganglion cyst of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is an uncommon pathology with uncertain etiology. There is no consensus on their management. The current systematic review aimed to discuss the clinical and histopathological features of ganglion cysts of TMJ, to aid in appropriate treatment. A literature search was done and a total of 20 cases were retrieved from published databases such as PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. The cyst presented with swelling in all the cases followed by pain (50%) and trismus (35%) as other common symptoms. Though CT and MRI proved helpful in determining the location of the cyst, a histopathological examination was essential in concluding its final diagnosis. It is a pseudocyst lined by dense fibro-connective tissue with myxoid tissue degeneration. Histologically, it is essential to distinguish them from the clinically and radiographically similar true cyst of TMJ, synovial cyst. The lining of ganglion cyst is devoid of epithelium and synovial cells. Surgical excision was found to be the treatment of choice with minimal recurrence (10%) being reported.

### Bone tumor mimics: avoiding misdiagnosis [^d25a1903]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Whether discovered incidentally or as part of a focused diagnostic evaluation, the finding of a benign osseous lesion that has radiologic features resembling a bone tumor is not uncommon. Some of the more common benign and nonneoplastic entities that can sometimes be confused with tumors are the following: cortical desmoid, Brodie abscess, synovial herniation pit, pseudocyst, enostosis, intraosseous ganglion cyst, fibrous dysplasia, stress fracture, avulsion fracture (healing stage), bone infarct, myositis ossificans, brown tumor, and subchondral cyst. Accurate diagnosis and management of these lesions require a basic understanding of their epidemiology, clinical presentations, anatomic distributions, imaging features, differential considerations, and therapeutic options. This in-depth review of 13 potential bone tumor mimics will assist the radiologist in correctly identifying these benign lesions and in avoiding misdiagnosis and related morbidity. This review will also aid the radiologist in making appropriate recommendations to the referring physician for management or further imaging.

### Lumbar spinal ganglion cyst: a systematic review with case illustration [^ccf1d608]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ganglion cysts are benign soft tissue lesions found in joints, most commonly wrists. The incidence for juxtafacet cysts, the condition under which spinal ganglion cysts are categorized, is between 0.06% and 5.8%. Spinal ganglion cysts often arise in the most mobile segment of the lumbar spine, L4-L5. Patients commonly present with pain, radiculopathy, and weakness. Conservative management is used, but surgical resection is the most common treatment modality. We aim to review the literature and present a rare case of an L2-L3 situated spinal ganglion cyst, treated with maximal safe resection.

Methods

A systematic review of literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were queried using Boolean operators and search terms, "spinal ganglion cyst, lumbar ganglion cyst, and lumbar juxtafacet cyst". Presentation, surgical management, and postoperative course of a 29-year-old male with an L2-L3 spinal ganglion cyst are also described.

Results

The search yielded 824 articles; 23 met inclusion criteria. These papers consisted of 27 spinal ganglion cyst cases with disaggregated patient data. 63.0% of patients were male, and 53.4 years (range: 23–86) was the average age at presentation. Mean symptom duration was 1.9 years (range: 3 days-12 years). 70.4% of patients reported complete symptom resolution. 14.8% of cases noted neural foramen involvement.

Conclusions

Spinal ganglion cysts are benign lesions typically presenting with radiculopathy. Maximal safe resection is an effective treatment modality with low complication rates. Future studies are needed to understand if neural foramen involvement leads to increased symptom severity.

### Practical management of lumps and bumps of the fingers, hand, and wrist [^b51fffc9]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care physicians encounter many patients who present with lumps and bumps on their fingers, hands, and wrists. Some benign lesions including ganglion cysts, epidermal inclusion cysts, and giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath that are benign and can be managed by primary care clinicians most of the time in an outpatient setting.

Methods

We conducted a narrative of review of literature on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis, and management of common types of lumps and bumps found on the fingers, hand, and wrist.

Conclusions

Based on the literature review and our clinical practice, we provide indications for referral to plastic surgeons or other specialists for these lesions.

### Pediatric ganglions of the hand and wrist: a review of current literature [^66d8fffb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The etiology, epidemiology, and treatment outcomes of ganglions in children have not been studied in depth. Most research has mainly focused on adults with this condition, with some research suggesting differing epidemiology and outcomes in the pediatric population. This review focuses on the existing literature on pediatric ganglions of the hand and wrist, highlighting 17 studies focused on prevalence and treatment outcomes. Within the pediatric population, epidemiology and outcomes differ depending on patient age. In children aged < 10 years, cysts present on the volar aspect of the wrist and are generally amenable to observation, with spontaneous regression. For patients aged > 10 years, ganglions resemble those in the adult population and present on the dorsal aspect of the wrist. Open surgical excision demonstrates a relatively low recurrence rate with minimal complications and is currently recommended for treatment.

### Peroneal intraneural ganglia. part I. techniques for successful diagnosis and treatment [^b71230ac]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The common peroneal nerve is the peripheral nerve most often affected by intraneural ganglion cysts. Although the pathogenesis of these cysts has been the subject of controversy in the literature, it is becoming increasingly evident that they are of articular origin. Recent recognition of this fact has proven to be significant in reducing recurrences and improving treatment outcomes for patients.

### Incidence of surgery for pediatric wrist ganglion cysts [^d5d8123f]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While diagnosis of ganglion cysts of the wrist in the pediatric population is common, data on management are limited. This study describes a nationwide analysis of the incidence and treatment of pediatric ganglion cysts.

Methods

Patients who were diagnosed with a wrist ganglion cyst were identified from the PearlDiver database. Exclusion criteria included age over 18 years, incidence of different cyst diagnosis codes, fewer than 6 months of records prior to first diagnosis, and fewer than 2 years of follow-up. The use of imaging and common treatments for ganglion cysts including bracing, aspiration/injection, and surgery were noted. Patients were followed for 2 years, and factors associated with undergoing surgery were analyzed. Trends in the diagnosis and surgical management of ganglion cysts by age were observed.

Results

A total of 33884 patients with a ganglion cyst on the wrist were identified. Diagnoses increased exponentially with age, while the percentage of patients who underwent surgery increased linearly with age. Those who underwent surgery tended to be older and were more likely to be female. These patients were also more likely to have undergone ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. There was a statistically significant difference in prior use of nonoperative management between patients that did and did not undergo surgery.

Conclusion

This study offers a nationwide analysis of pediatric ganglion cysts. These findings are important to consider during longitudinal patient counseling and surgical planning.

### Injections of the hand and wrist: part II. carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglion cyst, intersection syndrome, triangular fibrocartilage complex injury, and de quervain tenosynovitis [^f2c05209]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients who have wrist pain, especially when initial treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest fail. Although corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief, possible risks (e.g., infection, cartilage damage, skin depigmentation) should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Studies have shown significant improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome severity over 12 weeks using ultrasound-guided injections compared with landmark-guided injections. Ganglion cyst aspiration can be helpful for patients with significant symptoms, although more than 50% of ganglion cysts may recur within a year. Corticosteroid injections of ganglion cysts do not appear to produce additional benefits to aspiration. Intersection syndrome is an overuse injury; management involves rest, adjustment of activities, use of braces, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical or occupational therapy. For symptoms not improved by these methods, an ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection may be administered. Treatment options for a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury include immobilization, kinesio taping, relative rest, and analgesics; corticosteroid injection may relieve acute inflammatory pain. De Quervain tenosynovitis is treated conservatively with palpation- or ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, splinting, occupational therapy, and activity modification.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the peripheral nervous system [^49a46712]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

An accurate diagnosis is the essential first step toward a successful treatment plan in patients who present with pain and suspected nerve entrapment. Pain and dysfunction are often related to an acute traumatic event or a classic presentation that leads to a straightforward clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic approach to abnormalities of the peripheral nervous system always begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Imaging may play an important role in confirming the initial clinical [figure: see text] diagnosis so that a rational plan of treatment may be selected. Diagnostic imaging is especially important when there is significant uncertainty regarding the cause of pain and the outcome may be improved by timely implementation of various treatment options. Diagnostic accuracy is important when various conditions in the differential diagnosis would be treated differently from the beginning. Indeed, certain conditions that result in pain and dysfunction related to peripheral nerve entrapment are best treated with initial rest, protection, and rehabilitation whereas other conditions are best treated with prompt surgery. Promptly arriving at an accurate diagnosis is an essential step in designing a rational course of therapy, in achieving a good outcome, and in treating medical conditions in a timely fashion. Indeed, because pain is mediated through peripheral nerves, establishing an accurate diagnosis is especially important in disorders of the peripheral nervous system in which there may be considerable pain and suffering with an incorrect or delayed diagnosis. Moreover, an early diagnosis is desirable [figure: see text] to preserve motor power and sensory function in cases of clinically occult nerve entrapment. Although entrapment syndromes are well described and widely documented in the literature, they may be easily missed in clinical practice in certain instances. Although MR imaging is useful to confirm and characterize a known or suspected case of peripheral nerve entrapment, there may be evidence of peripheral nerve pathology that is first detected with MR imaging. Clinically unsuspected nerve entrapment may occur in patients with occult dorsal ganglion cysts in the wrist that may entrap the posterior interosseous nerve and produce pain without other symptoms. In addition, the authors routinely see patients with paralabral cysts secondary to tears of the superior labrum in the shoulder resulting in entrapment of the suprascapular nerve. This diagnosis is usually not suspected clinically until there is relatively advanced weakness and muscular atrophy in addition to shoulder pain. MR imaging remains an evolving technique with ongoing improvements in technology and developing clinical experience, resulting in greater diagnostic capacity. In this article current technique and strategies for image analysis and the authors' specific clinical experience with MR imaging of peripheral nerve disorders are reviewed. The exact role of MR imaging in the evaluation of these disorders will be further defined with additional experimental work and published clinical experience.

### Pediatric ganglion cysts: a retrospective review [^0308e28a]. Hand (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Ganglion cysts are the most common type of soft tissue tumors of the hand. In the pediatric population, monitoring may be appropriate unless cysts are painful, interfering with range of motion or parental concerns exist. Reported recurrence rates after surgical removal of pediatric ganglion cysts vary widely in the literature. Notably, recurrence rates are higher for children than adults, ranging from as low as 6% to as high as 35%. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of a single pediatric hand surgeon's patients undergoing excision of primary and recurrent ganglion cysts from 2010 to 2015. Variables measured included patient age at diagnosis of ganglion cyst, time to presentation, location of cyst, hand dominance, previous therapy, previous surgery, length of surgery, tourniquet time, length of follow-up, any associated complications, and recurrence of cyst. Results: Ninety-six patients were identified with an average age of diagnosis 10.2 years. Indications for surgery: 95.8% for pain or decreased range of motion, 4.2% for cosmetic or parental concern. About 75% of the cysts were dorsally located, with the remaining 24.2% being volar. A total of 5 (5.3%) recurrences were recorded. Tourniquet time was on average 9.8 minutes longer for cases that resulted in recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the data demonstrated a 25% increased risk of recurrence with patients who had a previous aspiration. Conclusions: This is a retrospective review of a single pediatric hand surgeon's outcomes of pediatric wrist ganglion cysts. Our recurrence rate of 5.3% is low for a pediatric population indicating potential merit in this surgeon's operative and postoperative techniques. We demonstrate significantly increased rates of recurrence when a cyst had been previously aspirated, possibly indicating scarring and disruption of planes resulting in difficult dissection, increased tourniquet times, and incomplete excision.

### Cost minimization analysis of ganglion cyst excision [^100db424]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cost minimization analysis can be employed to determine the least costly option when multiple treatments lead to equivalent outcomes. We present a cost minimization analysis from the payers' perspective, of the direct per patient cost of arthroscopic versus open ganglion cyst excision. We tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in cost between the 2 procedures from the payer perspective.

Methods

We utilized data from a private payer administrative claims database comprising 16 million individuals from 2007 to 2015. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes to identify open and arthroscopic ganglion excisions, we extracted demographic data and fees paid to providers and facilities for the procedure.

Results

We identified 5,119 patients undergoing open ganglion cyst excision and 20 patients undergoing arthroscopic ganglion excision. The average cost of an open excision was significantly lower than an arthroscopic excision ($1,821 vs $3,668).

Conclusions

Surgical costs from arthroscopic ganglion excision are significantly more than open excision. This data can inform health systems participating in value-based models.

### Intraosseous ganglion cysts of the carpus: current practice [^4ab169b0]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Intraosseous cysts of the carpal bones are an infrequent cause of chronic wrist pain. The main body of work has investigated their occurrence in the proximal carpus, with limited incidence in the distal row. We review the current literature on the treatment of symptomatic carpal cysts following the report of a 17-year-old male with a 12-month history of progressive right wrist pain due to an intraosseous ganglion of the trapezoid. This review explores the pathology of carpal cysts, their varying presentation and current treatments.

### Merkel cell carcinoma disguised as a ganglion cyst in a pianist: oncologic management and functional reconstruction [^08f54e12]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MCC is exceptionally difficult to diagnose given its clinical and histologic similarities to many other dermatologic conditions. MCC typically presents as a firm, violaceous nodule. These nodules can demonstrate hyperkeratosis, ulceration, telangiectasia, and/or shiny surfaces. The differential diagnosis for MCC includes basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, lipoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, lymphoma, and atypical fibroxanthoma.

A review of the literature reveals only one other reported case of MCC presenting as a ganglion cyst with no apparent epidermal changes. This might represent an atypical clinical presentation of MCC. Other atypical clinical presentations of MCC found in the literature include atheroma, gluteal ulcer, arthropod bite reaction, and ptosis and swelling of the upper eyelid without discoloration of the skin but with a multinodular mass beneath the conjunctival surface.,

According to previous studies, the incidence of MCC increases with age, and is nearly 3 times more prevalent in males than in females. This appears to be consistent with the 2 cases of clinically atypical MCC presenting as ganglion cysts. In both cases, the patients were 72-year-old males. In the other clinically atypical cases of MCC, the age range at presentation was 55–85 years of age with an even number of presentations between males and females. MCC has also been shown to be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders such as CLL, which was present in our patient but not reported in the case reported by Rothrock et al.

While the number of clinically atypical cases of MCC reported in the literature is limited, it is important that MCC be considered in the differential diagnosis of potentially benign-appearing lesions. This is crucial when presenting in elderly patients with comorbidities predisposing to immunosuppression. For such patients, the threshold for excisional biopsy should be lowered. Furthermore, close clinical follow-up with surveillance physical exams for lymphadenopathy is essential to detect recurrence or metastasis.

### Surgical management of arteriovenous malformation in the foot: a case study [^334c575b]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous malformations are frequently found in the head and neck, and are occasionally associated with congenital syndromes. They are rarely reported in the foot and ankle; however, when encountered in these particular locations, they may become painful and interfere with ambulation. Because of the lack of literature on pedal arteriovenous malformations, they remain enigmatic when encountered clinically. They form as a result of atypical development of the vascular system during embryogenesis. The identification, diagnosis, and treatment of an arteriovenous malformation can be challenging, because it may present similarly to more frequent soft-tissue pathologies in podiatric practice. These include fibroma, lipoma, ganglion cyst, or proteinaceous cyst. They have unpredictable behavior and a high recurrence rate. Failure to recognize and treat an arteriovenous malformation appropriately could result in ulceration, hemorrhage, and amputation. The identification and diagnosis must be accompanied with a full vascular work-up to determine the magnitude, flow, and extent of the lesion. After vascular work up, conservative, and surgical treatment options can be explored. This is an unusual case report of an arteriovenous malformation of the plantar foot that was previously misdiagnosed, and later presented to our facility for a second opinion. The steps taken for identification, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed along with surgical technique for excision of an arteriovenous malformation with successful outcome at 1 year follow-up. This case report will provide clinicians with armamentarium for diagnosis, workup, and treatment, when considering arteriovenous malformation in the differential diagnosis.

### Clinical presentation and characteristics of hand and wrist ganglion cysts in children [^729ec1a0]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Ganglion cysts are the most common mass of the hand or wrist. In adults, ganglions have a female predilection and are commonly located in the dorsal wrist. However, their presentation in children has not been well reported. This investigation sought to describe the presentation of pediatric ganglion cysts in a prospective cohort.

Methods

A multicenter prospective investigation of children (aged ≤ 18 years) who presented with ganglion cysts of the hand or wrist was conducted between 2017 and 2019. The data collected included age, sex, cyst location, hand dominance, pain, and patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) scores for upper-extremity (UE) function. The patients were divided into cohorts based on age, cyst location, and cyst size. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of worse UE function and higher pain scores.

Results

A total of 173 patients with a mean age of 10.1 ± 5.3 years and female-to-male ratio of 1.4:1 were enrolled. The dorsal wrist was the most commonly affected (49.7%), followed by the volar wrist (26.6%) and flexor tendon sheath (18.5%). In older patients, dorsal wrist ganglions were more common than tendon sheath cysts (11.9 ± 4.1 years vs 6.2 ± 5.8 years) and were larger (86.7% were > 1 cm) than cysts in other locations (34.5% were > 1 cm). Patients aged > 10 years reported higher pain scores, with 21.5% of older patients reporting moderate/severe pain scores versus 5.0% of younger children. This cohort of patients had an average PROMIS UE function score of 47.4 ± 9.5, and lower PROMIS scores were associated with higher pain scores.

Conclusions

Ganglions in pediatric populations, which most commonly affect the dorsal wrist, demonstrate a female predilection. In younger children, cysts are smaller and more often involve the volar wrist or flexor tendon sheath. Older children report higher pain scores. Pediatric ganglion cysts do not appear to result in a clinically meaningful decrease in UE function.

### Ganglion cysts of the anterior cruciate ligament: a series of 15 cases [^1955e871]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To increase awareness of the presence of ganglion cysts of the anterior cruciate ligament and to consider this diagnosis in any knee that has lost range of motion (ROM) in the absence of osteoarthritis.

Type Of Study

Case series.

Methods

We present a series of 15 cases recorded over a period of 5 years illustrating the clinical presentation and additional pathology seen at arthroscopy. International Knee Documentation Committee scores were calculated at the recent follow-up to establish outcome of the surgery.

Results

The cysts occurred predominantly in men with the most common presenting complaint being decreased ROM and pain. Overall, results were excellent with no recurrence of symptoms at a mean 36-month follow-up, but outcome does appear to be associated with other pathology present. ROM was improved with arthroscopic excision of the cyst in all cases that were impaired.

Conclusions

Although rare, ganglion cysts related to the cruciate ligaments of the knee should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a painful knee especially when associated with a decreased ROM and no evidence of osteoarthritis on radiographs. Other pathology can often be present, which may affect the overall outcome, but arthroscopic debridement of the ganglion cyst should be considered the treatment of choice in order to reliably restore active ROM.

### Temporomandibular joint ganglion cyst: a unique case of complete resolution following subtotal excision [^1dd84263]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) are a rare entity. Most often, ganglions present in anatomic regions, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, or ankle. Ganglion cysts are pseudocysts characterized by a fibrous connective tissue lining that lacks synovial cells and contains a thick gelatinous material. The etiology remains unclear, but might involve myxoid degeneration or softening of the collagen and connective tissue after long-term irritation and trauma. Ganglion cysts of the TMJ most commonly present as a swelling in the preauricular region, produce limited or no pain, and often have no effect on mouth opening. Because of the infrequent involvement of ganglion cysts with the TMJ and the nonspecific clinical presentation, the diagnosis is challenging. Diagnostic imaging tools, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have aided in diagnosis; however, only histopathologic examination will lead to a definitive diagnosis. The precise management of ganglion cysts of the TMJ remains uncertain owing to the uncommon appearance of these lesions. Treatment has focused on surgical excision without regard for lesion size or symptoms. This seems to be due to the decreased rate of recurrence after complete excision and microscopic examination providing the best method for a definitive diagnosis. This report describes a unique case of an 88-year-old woman with a large multilocular ganglion cyst of the right TMJ that completely resolved approximately 1.5 years after subtotal cystectomy.

### Tibial nerve intraneural ganglion cyst in a 10-year-old boy [^5117b36f]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Intraneural ganglion cysts are uncommon cystic lesions of peripheral nerves that are typically encountered in adults. In the lower extremity, the peroneal nerve is most frequently affected with involvement of the tibial nerve much less common. This article describes a tibial intraneural ganglion cyst in a 10-year-old boy. Although extremely rare, intraneural ganglion cysts of the tibial nerve should be considered when a nonenhancing cystic structure with intra-articular extension is identified along the course of the nerve. This report also details the unsuccessful attempt at percutaneous treatment with US-guided cyst aspiration and steroid injection, an option recently reported as a viable alternative to open surgical resection.

### Natural history of pediatric hand and wrist ganglion cysts: longitudinal follow-up of a prospective, dual-center cohort [^152d5f6d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This investigation describes the outcomes of pediatric ganglion cysts in a prospective cohort that elected not to undergo cyst aspiration or surgical treatment. Our primary aim was to investigate the rate of spontaneous resolution over time among the subset of patients who did not undergo specific treatments.

Methods

Children (aged ≤ 18 years) who presented to the clinic with ganglion cysts of the hand or wrist were enrolled in a prospective two-center registry between 2017 and 2021. Enrolled subjects who never elected to undergo cyst aspiration or surgical treatment were analyzed. The data collected included age, sex, cyst location and laterality, hand dominance, Wong-Baker pain scale scores, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System upper-extremity scores. Follow-up surveys were completed for up to 5 years.

Results

A total of 157 cysts in 154 children, with an average age of 9.4 years and a female-to-male ratio of 1.4:1, were eligible. The most common ganglion location was dorsal wrist (67/157, 42.7%), followed by volar wrist (49/157, 31.2%), the flexor tendon sheath (29/157, 18.5%), and the extensor tendon synovial lining (8/157, 5.1%). The average follow-up duration was 2.5 years after initial presentation to the clinic, and 63.1% (99/157) of the patients responded to follow-up surveys. Among them, 62.6% (62/99) of cysts spontaneously resolved; the resolution rates ranged from 51.9% of volar wrist ganglions to 81% of flexor tendon sheath cysts, with an average time to resolution of 14.1 months after cyst presentation. Cysts were more likely to resolve in the hand than in the wrist (84.0% vs 55.4%, respectively). Cysts present for > 12 months at initial evaluation were less likely to resolve spontaneously (41.2% vs 67.1%).

Conclusions

Of children who elected not to undergo aspiration or surgical treatment, approximately two-thirds of families reported that their child's ganglion cyst resolved spontaneously. Cysts that resolve spontaneously usually do so within 2 years of presentation.

### Pediatric ganglion cysts of the hand and wrist: an epidemiologic analysis [^e892866c]. Hand (2008). Low credibility.

We analyzed all hand and wrist ganglions in patients aged 12 years and younger that were treated at our institution during a 3-year period. Our patients were predominately female (1.8:1). Volar ganglions were more common (1.2:1), whereas dorsal ganglions have been reported to be more common in adults. Ganglions had a higher incidence of arising from tendon sheaths in our patients (33%) compared to what has been previously reported for ganglions in studies of all age groups (5% to 16%). While observation and/or splinting alone will likely be helpful in resolution of a majority of pediatric hand and wrist ganglions, surgical excision should be employed in those that are symptomatic and/or do not resolve with observation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of double thyroglossal duct cyst [^d9d949d8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results of analysis of diagnostic and disease management characteristics of 11 double-cystic TDC cases and related knowledge obtained from literature reports revealed several key points. First, physical examinations of double TDC cases can be manifested as unilateral neck masses that moved as the tongue moved during swallowing. Second, cysts of most double TDC cases were arranged parallel to the hyoid bone, although cysts of a few patients crossed the hyoid bone and arranged up and down. Third, color doppler ultrasound, CT, and MRI imaging results revealed that neck masses in these patients were separated or gourd-shaped. Fourth, correct diagnosis of double TDC cases is key to successful disease treatment. Fifth, double TDC cases require careful intraoperative manipulation to avoid cyst breakage and recurrence due to missed residual cysts. Taken together, the results of this work highlight the need for future studies of rare TDC cases to enhance our understanding of TDC clinical diagnostic and management features, as the number of patients seeking treatment for TDC disease will likely increase.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: what the radiologist needs to know [^4cdf86c1]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Extra-articular ganglia

Ganglion cysts may be encountered in any of the extra-articular soft tissues around the knee, including the joint capsule, tendons, ligaments, bursae, muscles and nerves. In rare cases, extra-articular ganglia may communicate with the joint cavity. On MR images they present as well-defined rounded or lobulated fluid collections, often with associated peripheral fluid-filled pseudopodia and sharply defined internal septations ("bunch of grapes appearance"). On T2-weighted images, ganglia appear with high signal intensity. On T1-weighted images, the signal intensities of ganglia range depending on their protein concentration. Associated bone erosion and pericystic oedema have been reported. The detection on MRI of a possible communication between the ganglion and the joint capsule is of great importance in preoperative planning because of the possibility of recurrence. MRI is also the imaging modality of choice for depicting muscle denervation changes in cases of nerve sheath ganglion cysts. These cysts are most frequently associated with the common peroneal nerve and its branches and nerve compression may result in foot drop and paraesthesia over the dorsum of the foot. MRI can contribute to treatment planning because it allows visualisation of both the cyst and the presence of oedema in the innervated muscles. Detection of MR signs of muscle denervation should be regarded as indicative of surgical nerve decompression. (Figs. 6 and 7).

### Outcomes following surgery for peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts [^312c39aa]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to answer the typical questions from patients regarding the likely neurologic outcome and likelihood of recurrence when discussing peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts preoperatively.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgery for a peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst between January 1, 2000, and April 1, 2017, was performed. Postoperative neurologic outcomes and radiologic recurrences are reported.

Results

There were 65 patients. Average clinical follow-up was 14 months. Median dorsiflexion and eversion preoperatively were 2/5 and 4/5, respectively. Median dorsiflexion and eversion at last follow-up postoperatively were 5/5. Radiologic recurrence occurred in 6 (9%) patients, all extraneural.

Discussion

The data support excellent postoperative motor outcomes, despite frequent dense weakness of peroneal-innervated musculature preoperatively. The surgical approach appears to eliminate risk of intraneural recurrence and minimizes risk of extraneural recurrence. Muscle Nerve 57: 989–993, 2018.

### Common sports-related nerve injuries seen by the electrodiagnostic medical consultant [^470f286b]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

There exists much less literature on the use of high‐resolution neuromuscular ultrasound for ulnar neuropathy at the wrist compared with the elbow. However, ultrasound remains a valuable tool for evaluating ulnar neuropathy at the wrist and is used by the authors as a first‐line imaging test for electrophysiologically confirmed cases. Specifically, ultrasound is helpful in assessing for the presence of structural compressive lesions such as ganglion cysts.

5.4 Treatment

Cyclist palsy can usually be managed conservatively, through a combination of patient education, activity modification, and alterations to equipment and bicycle fit. Conservative treatment strategies are outlined in Table 3. Early recognition is critical to prevent milder demyelinating injuries from becoming more advanced axonal injuries. Figure 4 demonstrates the following three common positions on the handlebars for road bicycles: the flats, hoods, or drops. Slane and colleagues demonstrated that the drop handlebar position induces the highest pressure on the hypothenar area, relative to the flat or hood positions. Patients should be encouraged to spend more time with their hands on the flats or hoods of the handlebars.

When possible, patients should be referred to a bicycle fitter. Figure 4 outlines the key components of the bicycle frame relevant to cyclist palsy. The bicycle should be modified to reduce pressure on the wrists, by redistributing it to the saddle and pedals. The vast majority of patients recover with non‐operative management. In patients with compressive lesions, surgical referral is advised.

### A simple physical exam maneuver to distinguish trigger digit, dupuytren's nodule, and flexor sheath ganglion [^85b3e9a8]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Trigger digit, Dupuytren's disease, and ganglion cysts are 3 common disorders treated by hand surgeons. Despite the varying nature of their pathology, these 3 entities can all present as a mass at the flexor crease in the distal palm.

FIGURE 1

FIGURE 2
Intraoperative view.

Schwannomas originate from Schwann cells in the nerve sheath. Schwannomas are commonly found in patients aged 20–50 yrs in the head and neck region. However, it is sporadically observed in the sciatic nerve; hence, the diagnosis might be challenging. Schwannomas typically present with an enlarging soft tissue mass, although the patient would not experience acute or radicular pain until the tumor becomes large enough to squeeze the nerve roots. Schwannomas are hard to differentiate from ganglion cysts that present with similar clinical symptoms along with cystic fluid that commonly accumulates in the adjacent articular space. In addition to locating the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging is recognized as an effective means to diagnose a schwannoma or ganglion cyst. A magnetic resonance imaging outlines the size, shape, edge, and surrounding edema of the lesion, helps understand whether the adjacent blood nerves are invaded, and aids in making an accurate diagnosis based on the changes in signal intensity. Even if the tumor capsule is fragile or adherent to surrounding tissues, surgical excision is recommended to treat a sciatic nerve schwannoma. In conclusion, an accurate differential diagnosis of a sciatic nerve schwannoma could reinforce the management of this disease and improve the patient's prognosis.

### Trapezium tunnel syndrome [^9adbf947]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The trapezium tunnel is situated on the lateral side of the carpal tunnel, lined with synovial tissue, and accommodates the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Trapezium tunnel syndrome is characterized by flexor carpi radialis tendinitis/peritendinitis and may lead to complicated clinical scenarios, such as flexor carpi radialis tendon rupture and the formation of primary or recurrent ganglion cysts on the volar radial side of the wrist and thenar area. Notably, the simultaneous presence of trapezium tunnel syndrome might contribute to unsuccessful outcomes in carpal tunnel surgeries. Trapezium tunnel syndrome may arise from either intrinsic or extrinsic factors. The entity of trapezium tunnel syndrome has attracted a low index of clinical suspicion because the other causes of radial side wrist pain that are more prevalent and frequent. We present a narrative review of this condition in an endeavor to heighten awareness and clinical suspicion of trapezium tunnel syndrome.

### Ganglion of the distal interphalangeal joint (myxoid cyst) [^bfba4559]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Two university dermatology departments. Patients Fifty-four subjects with 47 cysts involving fingers or thumbs and 7 involving toes. Previous therapies in 37 patients had resulted in relapse. Main Outcome Measures Clinical assessment at 2 and 8 months. Results. We treated 34 women and 20 men. Communication between cyst and joint was identified by means of methylene blue injection in 48 patients. At 8 months, 48 patients remained cured with no visible scarring. An incision was made starting at the distal margin of the dye-filled cyst, and a proximally based skin flap was dissected. This technique was modified where necessary to reveal the underlying subcutaneous tissues containing the methylene-stained pedicle between the cyst and the DIPJ. When the cyst arose immediately adjacent to the cuticle, the entire nail fold was fashioned as a flap, with 2 oblique incisions taken proximally from the lateral nail folds.

All DMCs arose in the skin between the DIPJ and the cuticle. Fifteen DMCs were located so deep as to require reflection of the proximal nail fold to gain access. In all of these patients, the cyst was above the nail plate and did not extend into the nail bed or pulp. The cause of DMCs is controversial. Histologically, DMCs do not have an epithelial lining. 1 One series reports the presence of a mesothelial lining in the channel between the abnormality and the adjacent joint, 2 but the term cyst, although commonly accepted, is a misnomer. Some investigators have demonstrated a communication between the DMC and the DIPJ and argue that the condition develops as a result of a communication with the DIPJ. 3–6 Others believe that the cysts are degenerative in origin and unrelated to the adjacent joint. 7 We believe that a DMC is a ganglion and have demonstrated that there is a connection between the DMC and the DIPJ in almost 90% of cases.

Such a model of DMC formation explains why there is no formal epithelial lining to the cyst. It also explains why DMCs are prone to relapse if the whole capsule and joint are diseased, and channels of communication between cyst and joint may be multiple, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging findings. 13.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^fddbdc4e]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ganglion cysts (GC) and synovial cysts (SC) are among the most frequently occuring benign cystic lesions in the joints. Degenerative joint disease is the main predisposing factor, but they might also be related to a number of other conditions such as trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Due to their strong similarities and their unclear pathogenesis, the scientific nomenclature associated with these lesions, labeled interchangeably in the literature, remains controversial. However, according to current evidence they are distinct, not only from an anatomopathological point of view, but also in their potential therapeutic approach. By definition, SCs are herniations of the synovial membrane through the capsule of a joint filled by synovial fluid, which may or may not keep a communication with the joint. They are thought to serve as drainage reservoirs for the excessive joint effusion in the setting of any arthropathy, escaping from its regular location through a one-way-valve mechanism into the area of least resistance. Occasionally, such as in the hip and the knee, a pre-existing bursa may develop a communication with the joint and act exactly the same way, becoming enlarged. This is the reason why the terms "SC" and "bursal enlargement" are often used interchangeably in the literature.

Contrary to SCs, GCs lack a synovial cell lining and are constituted by a dense collagenous capsule surrounding a mucopolysaccharide-rich gelatinous fluid, similar to that of SC but at a higher concentration. A developmental continuum between a true SC and GC of a synovial herniation followed by myxoid degeneration has even been theorized, but not confirmed. GCs may arise from the joint capsule, the ligaments, the tendon sheaths, the bursae, or the subchondral bone, being generally classified as juxta-articular, intra-articular or periosteal.

Except for the spine, where zygoapophyseal or facet joint cysts frequently cause radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, sensory deficits and, to a lesser extent, motor deficits, most SCs and GCs in the extremities are asymptomatic and incidentally found by imaging performed for other reasons. Symptoms mainly arise from a compressive effect in adjacent structures and less frequently from inflammatory changes related to complication by rupture, hemorrhage, and/or infection.

### Degenerative intraspinal cyst of the cervical spine: case report and literature review [^287b888d]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report and a literature review are presented.

Objective

To describe and review the clinical presentations, characteristic findings from imaging studies, and treatment of synovial and ganglion cysts arising within the cervical spinal canal.

Summary Of Background Data

Synovial and ganglion cysts in the cervical spine are rare. To the authors' knowledge, 24 sporadic cases in all, designated by various terms, have been reported in the literature.

Methods

Three cases of synovial and ganglion cysts in the cervical spine are reported as well as a review of the literature.

Results

Characteristic findings from imaging studies included a fluid-containing extradural lesion demonstrated on magnetic resonance images and gas content in the lesion demonstrated on ordinary or sagittally reconstructed computed tomography images. A laminectomy with removal of the cyst was the treatment of choice in most cases.

Conclusions

Neither communication with an adjacent facet joint nor histopathology of the cyst wall provides a persuasive basis for differentiating ganglion, synovial cyst, and cyst arising from the ligaments. To accommodate the varied presentations, the authors propose a comprehensive term for these lesions: "degenerative intraspinal cyst".

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: what the radiologist needs to know [^737605bb]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Popliteal cysts. The axial (a) and sagittal (b) fat saturated proton density weighted images show a large multiseptated popliteal cyst (asterisks) emerging between the medial gastrocnemius tendon (black arrow) and the semimembranosus tendon (white arrow) and abutting the medial gastrocnemial muscle belly (GN). The axial (c) fat saturated proton density weighted image shows a ruptured popliteal cyst (arrowheads). The axial (d) fat saturated proton density weighted image demonstrates a Baker's cyst (white arrow) with a single loose osteocartilaginous body inside the cyst (black arrow)

The proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) synovial cyst is believed to represent a joint capsule herniation, due to increased intra-articular pressure. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR sequences the lesion appears as a homogeneous often fusiform fluid collection in contact with the proximal tibiofibular joint, while a communicating neck leading from the cyst into the PTFJ is sometimes also illustrated. Increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images of the peroneally innervated anterior compartment musculature may be present in cases of common peroneal nerve impingement. Erosion of adjacent bone may also be seen in cases of large cysts. Differential diagnosis from soft tissue and nerve sheath tumours with myxomatous or cystic degeneration may be required (Fig. 2).

Ganglion cysts

A ganglion cyst is defined as a benign cystic mass that is surrounded by dense connective tissue, without a synovial lining and is filled with a gelatinous fluid rich in hyaluronic acid and other mucopolysaccharides. Ganglia are traditionally divided into the following categories: intra-articular, extra-articular, intraosseous and (rare) periosteal.

### Natural history of ganglion cysts of the palmar wrist… [^a74dd7a1]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: What is the natural history of ganglion cysts of the wrist. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Cohort. Synopsis: Although ganglion cysts of the palmar wrist are quite common, the evidence base with which to guide treatment decisions is limited. The results from aspiration plus steroid infiltration are no better than those from aspiration alone. The authors wondered about the natural history of ganglion cysts. In this study, 155 of 233 patients referred to a hand surgeon for treatment of a palmar wrist ganglion cyst responded at two or five years to a mailed survey. Of the respondents, 38 patients were treated with aspiration, 79 patients were treated with surgical excision, and 38 patients were given reassurance alone. Outcomes were similar: 42 percent of excised cysts and 47 percent of aspirated cysts had recurred at the time of follow-up, while 53 percent of cysts that were not treated spontaneously disappeared.

Bottom Line: Although not a randomized trial, the results of this simple observational study show that approximately one half of ganglion cysts spontaneously resolve, and that approximately one half of surgically treated cysts recur. Thus, the net long-term benefit is similar whether the cysts are treated surgically or conservatively.

### The efficacy of nonsurgical and surgical interventions in the treatment of pediatric wrist ganglion cysts [^f8be62df]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The treatment of ganglion cysts of the wrist remains understudied in the pediatric population, with the literature showing variable recurrence rates following different interventions. This study sought to determine whether surgical and nonsurgical management of pediatric ganglion cysts was associated with improved resolution rates when compared to observation alone.

Methods

We identified 654 cases of pediatric ganglion cysts treated across 5 institutions between 2012 and 2017. The mean age at presentation was 11.6 ± 5.2 years. Of the patients, 315 had > 2 years (mean, 50.0 months) of follow-up, either via chart review or telephone callbacks. There were 4 different treatment groups: (1) observation, (2) cyst aspiration, (3) removable orthosis, and (4) surgical excision.

Results

For patients followed > 2 years, the cyst resolved in 44% (72/163) of those observed. Only 18% (9/49) of those treated with aspiration resolved, and 55% (12/22) of those treated with an orthosis resolved. Surgical excision was associated with resolution of the cyst in 73% (59/81) of patients. Observation had higher rates of resolution compared to aspiration. Orthosis fabrication and observation had similar rates of cyst resolution. Surgery had the highest rates of resolution when compared to observation and aspiration. Patients older than 10 years were less likely to have the cyst resolve with observation (35%; 28/80) than those younger than 10 years (53%; 44/83) at > 2 years of follow-up.

Conclusions

This study did not find evidence that nonsurgical treatments were associated with improved rates of cyst resolution compared to observation alone in a large pediatric sample. Surgical excision had the overall highest rate of resolution. Despite the costs and increased clinic time of orthosis fabrication and aspiration, these treatments were not associated with improved rates of cyst resolution in pediatric ganglion cysts compared to observation, with aspiration having higher rates of recurrence compared to observation.

### Ganglion cysts of the proximal tibiofibular joint: low risk of recurrence after total cyst excision [^f3ac3c8b]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peroneal nerve neuropathy due to compression from tumors or tumor-like lesions such as ganglion cysts is rare. Few case series have been published and reported local recurrence rates are high, while secondary procedures are frequently employed.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the demographics of patients with ganglion cysts of the proximal tibiofibular joint, and what proportion of them present with intraneural cysts and peroneal nerve palsy? (2) What Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scores do patients with this condition achieve after decompression surgery with removal of the ganglion cyst, but no arthrodesis of the tibiofibular joint? (3) What proportion of patients experience local recurrence after surgery?

Methods

Between 2009 to 2018, 30 patients (29 primary cases) were treated for chronic peroneal palsy or neuropathy due to ganglion cysts of the proximal tibiofibular joint at two tertiary orthopaedic medical centers with total resection of the cystic lesion. MRI with contrast and electromyography (EMG) were performed preoperatively in all patients. The minimum follow-up for this series was 1 year (median 48 months, range 13 to 120); 14% (4 of 29) were lost to follow-up before that time. The MSTS score was recorded preoperatively, at 6 weeks postoperatively, and at most-recent follow-up.

Results

A total of 90% of the patients were male (26 of 29 patients) and the median age was 67 years (range 20 to 76). In all, 17% (5 of 29) were treated due to intraneural ganglia. Twenty-eight percent (8 of 29) presented with complete peroneal palsy (foot drop). The mean MSTS score improved from 67 ± 12% before surgery to 89 ± 12% at 6 weeks postoperative (p < 0.001) and to 92 ± 9% at final follow up (p = 0.003, comparison with 6 weeks postop). All patients improved their scores. A total of 8% (2 of 25 patients) experienced local recurrence after surgery.

Conclusion

Ganglion cysts of the proximal tibiofibular joint occurred more often as extraneural lesions in older male patients in this small series. Total excision was associated with improved functional outcome and low risk of neurologic damage and local recurrence, and we did not use any more complex reconstructive procedures. Tendon transfers may be performed simultaneously in older patients to stabilize the ankle joint, while younger patients may recover after decompression alone, although larger randomized studies are needed to confirm our preliminary observations.

Trigger digit, Dupuytren's disease, and ganglion cysts are 3 common disorders treated by hand surgeons. Despite the varying nature of their pathology, these 3 entities can all present as a mass at the flexor crease in the distal palm. The regional similarity of these presentations can make diagnosis more difficult. In this paper, we describe a simple clinical exam method that can assist in distinguishing between trigger digit, Dupuytren's disease, and flexor sheath ganglion cysts.

### Pediatric ganglion cyst recurrence: location isn' T the only risk factor [^5410ba1c]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ganglion cysts represent the most common benign soft-tissue masses of the hand and wrist, most are treated nonoperatively, with relatively few local recurrences. Few studies have identified risk factors for recurrence in the pediatric population. The aim of this study is to identify risks of cyst recurrence and to establish if ultrasonographic imaging aids in the prediction of recurrence.

Methods

A single-center retrospective chart review was performed, identifying patients diagnosed with a ganglion cyst of the hand or wrist. Demographic information, cyst characteristics, and ultrasound examination reports were documented. Standard statistical and logistic regression analyses were performed.

Results

A total of 132 cysts were identified in 126 patients and the average age was 8.5 years old. The most common location was the dorsal wrist (57/132, 43.2%). There were 14 recurrences [11/14, (79%) dorsal wrist, 3/14 (21%) volar wrist, 0/14 (0%) in nonwrist locations]. The risk of recurrence was significantly greater for dorsal wrist cysts than nonwrist locations (odds ratio = 18.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 316.65; P = 0.048); there was no statistical difference in recurrence rates between dorsal and volar cysts (P = 0.15). Recurrence was noted in older patients (12.2 vs. 8.1y, P < 0.001) and those patients with painful masses (P = 0.02). Patients undergoing surgical excision had a higher risk of recurrence than those who did not undergo surgical excision (P < 0.001). Cyst volume as measured by ultrasound was performed in 37 cysts, with repeat ultrasounds in 12 cases demonstrating a decreased volume of 0.85cm at baseline to 0.35cm with repeat examination (P = 0.40). In patients that received at least 1 ultrasound, there were no differences in cyst volume between those that recurred and those that did not (P = 0.40).

Conclusions

Risk factors for recurrence in pediatric patients with a ganglion cyst include older age, symptomatic masses, cysts located around the wrist, and those requiring surgical excision. Ultrasound examination of cyst volume did not predict recurrence.

Level Of Evidence

Level III-therapeutic.

### Ultrasound-guided therapy for knee and foot ganglion cysts [^0df32d7a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided aspiration/injection of ganglion cysts in the lower extremities (knee and foot) that required referral to the radiology department for precise localization. The present study is the first series to describe such results. The study population consisted of 15 patients who had undergone treatment from April 2012 to January 2015. Follow-up was by telephone survey, which was performed at a mean of 15 ± 6 months after treatment. Almost 90% of patients experienced immediate improvement in symptoms (mostly pain), and 77% of these patients had not experienced a recurrence of symptoms at a mean follow-up time of 14 ± 6 months. In conclusion, ultrasound-guided therapy is a safe and potentially effective treatment for most cases of symptomatic lower extremity ganglion cysts.

### Rapidly progressive subungual gray-brown melanonychia [^12b83f2d]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Given the rapidly progressive nature of this patient's lesion, what diagnostic technique would be most efficient and cost-effective?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
B. Ultrasound
C. Transillumination
D. Aspiration
E. Biopsy of nail unit

Answers:
A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – Incorrect. Although MRI has utility in detecting clinically challenging subungual DMCs, it is costly and may not be ideal for a rapidly progressive lesion for logistical reasons. MRI may detect cyst-joint capsule communication and associated osteoarthritis. Small osteophytes can be more difficult to detect with MRI than other modalities.
B. Ultrasound – Incorrect. Although ultrasound is faster and more cost effective for diagnosing subungual DMCs than MRI with higher sensitivity for small lesions, this modality requires access to practitioners experienced in nail unit ultrasonography and its sensitivity is operator dependent.
C. Transillumination – Incorrect. Transillumination can be a helpful ancillary test in making the clinical diagnosis of a subungual DMC, especially since it is noninvasive and efficient. However, transillumination cannot differentiate between different types of cysts (eg, ganglion vs mucinous pseudocyst) and therefore, cannot provide definitive diagnosis.
D. Aspiration – Incorrect. While aspiration of the lesion may have revealed mucinous contents characteristic of DMCs, aspiration would be more challenging and painful for a DMC in a subungual location. A lack of mucin in the aspirate would not rule out the diagnosis nor provide an alternative diagnosis. This technique would be appropriate for a DMC that is overlying the nail matrix and therefore easily accessible.
E. Biopsy of nail unit – Correct. Although a more invasive technique, biopsy of the nail unit allows for definitive histopathologic diagnosis and is readily available with rapid turnaround time. Quick, definitive diagnosis should be the priority for a rapidly progressing subungual pigmented lesion. Risk of infection and permanent nail dystrophy must be carefully considered. Nonetheless, all the modalities mentioned above have specific and individualized utility and may be indicated depending on the clinical scenario. Some may be more useful than others or used in combination for surgical management planning.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: what the radiologist needs to know [^ef92beab]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Intra-articular ganglia

They are quite uncommon cystic lesions and typically arise from the cruciate ligaments, most commonly from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) In MRI part of the lesion is interspersed within the ACL fibres and it may extend anteriorly towards the Hoffa's fat pad or posteriorly towards the femoral intercondylar fossa. Rarely it may be demonstrated between the ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). PCL ganglia have a more typical appearance and present as well-defined multilocular cysts adjacent to and along the dorsal PCL surface. Differential diagnosis should be made from a posteromedial meniscal cyst extending centrally within the joint predominantly posterior to the PCL. Ganglia within Hoffa's fat pad or in the suprapatellar recess-bursa usually appear as well-defined multilocular cysts and are most commonly encountered anterior to the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. An intrahoffatic lesion or a synovial lesion such as haemangioma or synovial sarcoma may be misinterpreted as a ganglion cyst within the fat pad and contrast-enhanced MRI is warranted in such cases for differential diagnosis (Figs. 3, 4 and 5).

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the wrist and hand region [^60ded3a5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the wrist and hand region is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint, wrist ganglion cysts, and digital flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) are reviewed. Indications for carpal tunnel syndrome injection include median nerve compression resulting from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, repetitive use injury, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the first carpometacarpal joint, injection may be used to treat pain secondary to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Pain associated with de Quervain's tenosynovitis is treated effectively by therapeutic injection. If complicated by pain or paresthesias, wrist ganglion cysts respond to aspiration and injection. Painful limitation of motion occurring in trigger fingers of patients with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis also improves with injection. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### The limited utility of routine pathologic examination of ganglion cyst excision from the hand and digits [^422da339]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

It is routine practice at many institutions to send surgically excised ganglion cysts for pathologic analysis. This adds significant cost to the procedure with questionable benefit. The purpose of this study was to determine the necessity of routine pathologic examination of ganglion cysts excised from the hand.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 443 patients who underwent ganglion excision from the hand with routine pathologic examination between 2012 and 2022. The final pathologic diagnosis was compared with the treating surgeon's clinical diagnosis, and the rates of concordant, discrepant, and discordant diagnoses were identified. Discrepant diagnoses were defined as differing clinical and pathologic diagnoses that did not change clinical management. Discordant diagnoses were defined as differing clinical and pathologic diagnoses that altered the treatment plan.

Results

The prevalence of a concordant diagnosis was 96.2% (426 of 443; 95% confidence interval, 94.4%-98.0%). The prevalence of a discrepant diagnosis was 3.8% (17 of 443; 95% confidence interval, 2.1%-5.6%), and the prevalence of a discordant diagnosis was 0. The odds ratio was 0.04 for a discrepant diagnosis and 0 for a discordant diagnosis.

Conclusions

Our study suggests abandoning routine pathologic analysis in patients undergoing ganglion cyst excision from the hand will not compromise quality of care when the surgeon is able to make a confident diagnosis. Discrepant diagnoses were rare and discordant diagnoses that did not occur. We recommend pathologic evaluation only when there is uncertainty in the clinical diagnosis.

### Management of tarlov cysts: an uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1, 000 referrals [^42e0c3f2]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Based on our experience over 1000 patient referrals and treatment experience with cyst aspiration-fibrin sealant injections of symptomatic Tarlov cysts and on a review of the literature on these cysts, we can make several key observations and recommendations on the management of these cysts. We also constructed a treatment decision algorithm to guide management of patients with symptomatic Tarlov cysts (Fig. 12).
Although sacral Tarlov cysts are an uncommon finding, prevalence estimates have often been based on incidental radiographic findings and inconsistent reporting particularly from lumbar rather than dedicated sacral MRIs and likely contribute to an underestimation of the prevalence of this spinal disease.
There is extensive evidence that sacral Tarlov cysts are associated with a diverse range of pain and neurological symptoms. Workups of patients, particularly for women presenting initially with low back pain or coccygodynial pain, should include a careful history, neurological examination, and when appropriate electrodiagnostic testing or urodynamic studies to conduct more comprehensive multidisciplinary investigations.
Imaging investigations for Tarlov cysts should include a lumbar spine MRI and a sacral MRI with axial and sagittal planes of the entire sacrum and when identified radiologically should be reported in a differential diagnosis and in the appropriate clinical context, considered a potential pain generator and contributor to neurological symptoms.
A range of strategies can be employed to determine if sacral cysts are causative or contributing agents of symptoms: Tarlov disease specific quality-of-life questionnaires, patient-completed dermatome maps, and diagnostic tests including percutaneous anesthetic injection into the cyst or cyst fluid aspiration with a two-needle technique. Fluid aspiration can also assess whether rapid cyst refilling occurs indicating a wide-necked cyst, a contraindication to fibrin sealant injection.
Sacral Tarlov cysts can cause peripheral nerve fiber neuropathy through sacral nerve root stretching or compression, and electrodiagnostic tests can detect nerve conduction abnormalities and nerve fiber neuropathy, potentially responsible for a range of commonly reported Tarlov related pain, paresthesia and, bowel/bladder dysfunctions. Early intervention for nerve fiber neuropathy is preferred to ensure better neurological outcomes. As patients with Tarlov cysts have often reported experiencing symptoms for years, there is a concern that long-standing nerve damage may be unrecoverable.
Both percutaneous and open surgical approaches have resulted in high rates of rapid symptomatic relief, but percutaneous interventions have several advantages over open surgery. The cyst aspiration-fibrin injection is an uncomplicated technique performed as an outpatient procedure with rapid reductions in symptoms and recovery with no serious complications. In comparison, there is no consensus on the optimal surgical method, and surgeries are technically demanding. They also involve variable approaches with significantly higher complication rates, longer hospital stays, and recovery than percutaneous aspiration-fibrin sealant interventions.

### Radiopalmar ganglion cysts: prevalence, morphology, and clinical significance in wrist MRI [^9504ca1e]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although most RPG were asymptomatic with regard to radiopalmar complaints (85%), we found radiopalmar-sited conditions, including pain, swelling, motion restriction, and combinations of these symptoms, significantly more often in patients with RPG than in those without RPG (15% vs. 3%). Looking for reasons, our study demonstrated that neither direct contact of an RPG with the radial vascular bundle, the FCR tendon, or the FPL tendon nor the presence of SLL tears is suitable for discriminating between patients with and without radiopalmar complaints. Interestingly, however, the dorso-palmar RPG diameter was positively correlated with radiopalmar complaints, and we could define a reliable cut-off value at 3 mm. Considering that modern high-resolution MRI allows an accurate visualization of even small ganglion cysts and definitive treatment options like cyst aspiration and arthroscopic removal may be associated with surgical complications and recurrence, this finding seems essential to avoid unnecessary interventions whose indication is based solely on accidentally detected ganglion cysts. On the other hand, it would be equally unfavorable not to treat RPG, which may be the underlying cause of pain.

Another interesting aspect of our study is that the prevalence of SLL tears was significantly higher in patients with RPG evidence than in those without. This observation was made for partial and complete tears; however, SLL tears were not eligible as a discriminator for symptomatic patients. Instead, this finding might be explained by one of the manifold theories on the origin and pathophysiology of ganglion cysts that postulate that ganglion cysts are secondary manifestations of underlying periscaphoid ligament injuries. Strengthening this hypothesis, a previous study found the majority of arthroscopically-treated dorsal wrist ganglia in patients with concomitant SLL and lunotriquetral ligament tears, wherefore the authors concluded that increased intercarpal laxity might contribute to ganglion cyst formation. However, today, the correlation between SLL tears and wrist ganglia is controversial, as many competing theories exist. For example, Rizzo et al found no cases of SLL instability among patients treated for dorsal-sided wrist ganglia and, similarly, in the study by Lowden and colleagues, most wrist ganglia detected on MRI were not accompanied by ligamentous pathologies.

### Management of tarlov cysts: an uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1, 000 referrals [^6c74751f]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tarlov cysts were thought to be anatomic variants of uncertain etiology and clinical significance when initially described over 80 years ago. They are often detected in routine lumbosacral imaging and generally not reported in a differential diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that at least some Tarlov cysts are symptomatic and can have a significant adverse impact on patients' health and well-being. Women are disproportionately affected with this condition, often presenting with long-standing pain and neurological dysfunctions. Significant gender bias has been a concern in the management of these patients. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on patient selection or management approaches for symptomatic Tarlov cysts. This review article updates information on the prevalence, diagnosis, clinical significance, and treatments of these cysts. Based on these findings and experience with over 1000 patient referrals, a treatment decision algorithm for symptomatic Tarlov cysts was constructed to provide guidance for appropriate management of patients with these complex cysts.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^ba25bfd1]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Ganglion and synovial cysts occur mainly, but not necessarily, in association with osteoarthritis. Presentation varies widely, ranging from small, incidentally detected, asymptomatic lesions to giant ones that might be the source of symptoms, either due to their compressive effect on adjacent structures or due to complications, such as rupture. On magnetic resonance imaging they are typically presented as smooth, well-circumscribed, thin-walled, unilocular, and homogeneously T2-hyperintense lesions. An identifiable thin stalk communicating to the joint space is not infrequent. Nevertheless, depending on their age, anatomic location, and eventual complication, they might have many distinct appearances, including septae and internal debris, which the radiologist must be familiar with in order to accurately differentiate them from worrisome cystic-like lesions. With regard to this diversity, some illustrative cases are presented.

### Intramedullary lesions of the conus medullaris: differential diagnosis and surgical management [^d4267e9a]. Neurosurgical Review (2009). Low credibility.

The medullary conus represents a distinct entity of the spinal cord regarding its anatomical, clinical and microsurgical features. An overview of the pathologic processes of this region is provided. Epidemiological, clinical and neuroradiological characteristics of neoplastic (glial tumors, non-glial tumors, metastasis, primary melanomas) and non-neoplastic lesions (granulomatous lesions, abscess, parasitic infections, vascular, demyelinating and dysembryogenetic lesions) are discussed. Main MR imaging characteristics used to differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions consist in pathological spinal cord expansion, gadolinium-enhancement and tumoural cyst formation. Management strategies differ substantially, depending on the kind of lesion. According to the suspected pathological entity radical resection, biopsy or conservative treatments are reasonable options. Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is a fundamental part of the surgical setting.

### MRI characteristics of cysts and "cyst-like" lesions in and around the knee: what the radiologist needs to know [^a00ffd8c]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Intraosseous ganglia

These lesions are located in the epiphyseal-metaphyseal region of long bones, most commonly the tibia, often within subchondral bone, adjacent to a joint or in proximity to ligament insertion sites. Their pathogenesis is unclear and unknown and there is still debate as to whether they are distinct from degenerative, insertional or post-traumatic cysts. Regarding MRI appearance, they manifest as solitary, unilocular or multilocular, and a sclerotic rim is usually present. Differential diagnosis may be necessary from primary epiphyseal bone tumours, such as giant cell tumour, clear cell chondrosarcoma and chondroblastoma and it can also be extremely difficult to differentiate from a simple bone cyst (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
Intraosseous ganglion cyst. The axial (a) and coronal (b) fat saturated proton density weighted images demonstrate a solitary, unilocular cystic lesion (arrows). Note the sclerotic rim (arrowheads) and mild reactive bone oedema (asterisk)

Periosteal ganglia

They are extremely rare and are thought to be produced by mucoid degeneration and cyst formation of the periosteum. They are most commonly located in the proximal tibial shaft, in proximity to pes anserinus. On MR images they typically appear as periosteally based, well-defined homogeneous lesions with fluid signal intensity. Superficial cortical erosion and scalloping, as well as reactive new bone formation may be present. Other lesions of periosteal origin, such as periosteal chondroma, subperiosteal hematoma, chronic subperiosteal abscess or malignant soft tissue tumours, mainly when they erode the adjacent bone and cause periosteal reaction, may need differential diagnosis from a periosteal ganglion.

### A case report and literature review: intraneural ganglion cyst causing tarsal tunnel syndrome [^72010456]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Intraneural ganglion cysts are benign mucinous lesions that form within joints and enter adjacent nerves via an articular branch. Despite being morphologically characterized as benign, they can demonstrate considerable intrafascicular destruction and expansion, resulting in worsening compressive neuropathies or nerve injury. There have been several suggested theories of pathogenesis, but the most widely accepted articular (synovial) theory describes a capsular defect in a neighboring joint that allows joint fluid to egress and track along the epineurium of the innervating articular branch. In this case report, we describe an intraneural ganglionic cyst located in the tarsal tunnel with extensive involvement of the tibial nerve. We describe the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment as well as review the current literature on intraneural ganglionic cysts.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^9e7ab87f]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Imaging approach

Ultrasound (US), as a low-cost, widely available modality, is the initial imaging method of choice for any palpable soft-tissue mass in the extremities, usually differentiating cystic from non-cystic ones. There is a level of evidence of A for a GC/SC in the hip, the knee, and the ankle/foot, and of C in the wrist, with an overall strength of recommendation of 3.

MRI should be performed after US in doubtful cases. It has become the gold-standard modality in the characterization of periarticular cystic lesions, mainly due to its excellent soft-tissue contrast and extremely high diagnostic power. Accurate distinction between benign and malignant soft-tissue masses, with estimated sensitivity and specificity of up to 95%, has been reported for distal upper extremity GCs.

Regarding the optimal MRI quality in the study of this kind of lesion in the extremities, the smallest surface coil that covers the entire lesion should be chosen and an initial large field of view, including the contralateral side, followed by a smaller field of view targeted to the lesion, should be used. Imaging acquisition of at least two perpendicular planes is mandatory, usually including the following weighted-sequences: T1, proton-density (PD) or T2, with and without fat suppression (FS), or short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR).

The MRI protocol that better demonstrates facet joint SCs and GCs in the spine should include at least T2-weighted sequences acquired in both axial and sagittal planes.

Delayed arthrography, either by means of radiography, computed tomography, or MRI, 1–2 h after intra-articular injection of water-soluble contrast agent, improves sensitivity of imaging in the demonstration of a cyst-joint communication, detectable in less than 50% on standard US or MRI. This is particularly valuable in the differential diagnosis between atypical GCs and cystic-like malignant tumors.

### Minimizing costs for dorsal wrist ganglion treatment: a cost-minimization analysis [^14173316]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dorsal wrist ganglions are treated commonly with aspiration, or open or arthroscopic excision in operating room (OR) or procedure room (PR) settings. As it remains unclear which treatment strategy is most cost-effective in yielding cyst resolution, our purpose was to perform a formal cost-minimization analysis from the societal perspective in this context.

Methods

A microsimulation decision analytic model evaluating 5 treatment strategies for dorsal wrist ganglions was developed, ending in either resolution or a single failed open revision surgical excision. Strategies included immediate open excision in the OR, immediate open excision in the PR, immediate arthroscopic excision in the OR, or 1 or 2 aspirations before each of the surgical options. Recurrence and complications rates were pooled from the literature for each treatment type. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed.

Results

The most cost-minimal strategy was 2 aspiration attempts before open surgical excision in the PR setting ($1,603 ± 1,595 per resolved case), followed by 2 aspirations before open excision in the OR ($1,969 ± 2,165 per resolved case). Immediate arthroscopic excision was the costliest strategy ($6,539 ± 264 per resolved case). Single aspiration preoperatively was more cost-minimal than any form of immediate surgery ($2,918 ± 306 and $4,188 ± 306 per resolved case performed in the PR and OR, respectively).

Conclusions

From the societal perspective, performing 2 aspirations before surgical excision in the PR setting was the most cost-minimal treatment strategy, although in reference to surgeons who do not perform this procedure in the PR setting, open excision in the OR was nearly as cost-effective. As patient preferences may preclude routinely performing 2 aspirations, performing at least 1 aspiration before surgical excision improves the cost-effectiveness of dorsal wrist ganglions treatment.

### An intra-articular ganglion cyst in a patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^1f573bdc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a heterogenous disorder characterized by chronic inflammatory arthritis and exacerbations that present with joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness, but should not present with a knee mass. Besides an acute flare of the disease causing joint discomfort, other causes of pain in JIA patients may include infection, trauma, tumor, or associated orthopedic conditions. We present the first patient, to our knowledge, with JIA who developed a knee mass due to an intra-articular ganglion cyst (IAGC). IAGC has been reported as a cause of knee pain in adults without arthritis, but in children without arthritis, only a few cases have been reported.

When this patient developed a knee mass, it was very concerning to the family and care providers because of the extensive family history of cancer and the previous years of treatment with methotrexate. We could not find a similar case report of IAGC in JIA patients and this possibility should be considered in patients who present with a knee mass, particularly if their arthritis is flaring up. This knee mass and pain was responsive to needle aspiration and methotrexate therapy.

### Sonography of wrist ganglion cysts: which location is most common? [^faf1536b]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The literature states that wrist ganglion cysts are most commonly dorsal; however, our experience suggests a volar location is more common. The purpose of this study was to identify the locations of ganglion cysts of the wrist as imaged with sonography.

Methods

After Institutional Review Board approval with informed consent waived, retrospective review of wrist sonography reports from January to April 2016 was completed. Only patients who had a comprehensive evaluation that included the dorsal and volar wrist were included. Ultrasound images were reviewed to characterize wrist ganglion cysts.

Results

The study group consisted of 98 subjects (78% female, 22% male) (median age, 51years; range 13–79) with 124 wrist ganglion cysts, where 69% (86 of 124) were volar and 31% (38 of 124) were dorsal. Ganglion cysts were located between the radial artery and flexor carpi radialis in 63% (78 of 124), followed by a dorsal location superficial to the scapholunate ligament in 20% (25 of 124), other dorsal locations in 11% (13 of 124), and other volar locations in 6% (8 of 124). With dorsal ganglion cysts, the scapholunate ligament when imaged appeared normal in 91% (20 of 22). Ganglion cysts were multilocular/multilobular in all subjects.

Conclusions

The most common location for wrist ganglion cysts is in the volar wrist, particularly between the radial artery and flexor carpi radialis tendon, appearing multilocular or multilobular with a mean largest dimension of 1.0cm. Given the propensity of ganglion cysts to occur at this site, attention to this area when imaging the wrist with sonography or magnetic resonance imaging should be considered.

### Imaging of wrist masses [^f7f20984]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The wrist is a complex structure with an extensive differential diagnosis for a presenting mass. However, the vast majority of hand and wrist masses are benign, and many of these have a distinctive radiographic appearance. In this article, the imaging characteristics of the most common entities are reviewed with particular attention to magnetic resonance appearance. The 3 most common hand and wrist lesions include ganglion cysts, giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath, and hemangiomas. Other common lesions that can be diagnosed radiographically include lipomas, neural sheath tumors, infection and inflammation, and variant soft-tissue or bony structures. The appearance of the fibrolipomatous hamartoma will also be demonstrated because this is a radiographically distinctive, though rare, lesion.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^9ef9eb8b]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Extremities

Shoulder

Besides bursitis, most periarticular cysts in the shoulder are associated with labrocapsular or rotator cuff tears resulting in the passage of fluid from the joint to the pericapsular soft tissues. The main example, paralabral cysts, usually occurs in the setting of a superior or a posterosuperior labral tear, the cysts tending to extend into the suprascapular and the spinoglenoid notches, respectively, with resultant compression of the suprascapular nerve and subsequent denervation of the supra and infraspinatus muscles, or the infraspinatus muscle alone, if the site of compression is the spinoglenoid notch, distal to the branch to the supraspinatus.

Far less common, acromioclavicular and intramuscular cysts are mainly but not necessarily associated with full- or partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, their presence improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI detection of partial-thickness tears. Intramuscular cysts of the shoulder are seldom-reported lesions, believed to be a result of fluid leakage through a defect in the musculotendinous junction of one of the rotator cuff muscles, dissecting within the fascial sheath or the muscle fibers. Due to their intramuscular location they are neither palpable at physical examination nor visible at surgery or arthroscopy. Although typically small, large cysts with a long axis parallel to the length of the muscle, as the one illustrated in Fig. 3, occasionally occur. In case a rotator cuff tear is present, the cyst might occur either within the muscle of the torn tendon or within another adjacent rotator cuff muscle. Figure 3 shows an intramuscular infraspinatous cyst.

Fig. 3

Intramuscular infraspinatus cyst in a 58-year-old woman with a known partial-thickness supraspinatus tear, presenting with exacerbated posterior right shoulder pain during elevation and external rotation. Axial FS T2-weighted MRI (a) shows a teardrop-shaped homogeneously hyperintense subaponeurotic intramuscular lesion along the posterior surface of the scapula. Note its thin extension toward the musculotendinous junction (arrow). The glenoid labrum (dashed arrow) seems preserved. A sagittal section (b) better demonstrates the location of this lesion within the infraspinatous muscle. Scp, scapula; Isp, infraspinatous

Regardless of the type of cyst depicted on MRI, considering the strong association, labral or rotator cuff tears must always be ruled out, as well as muscle atrophy.

### Conservative treatment for a symptomatic solitary ganglion cyst of the anterior meniscus invading into the infrapatellar fat pad [^cff5ec8e]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Symptomatic meniscal cysts without accompanying meniscal tears are uncommon, especially those which are formed from the anterior meniscus and invading into the infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP). The current recommended treatment for such cysts is excision through open method or arthroscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first case study about a symptomatic solitary meniscal cyst invading the IPFP that was successfully treated with needle aspiration and steroid injection after arthroscopic treatment of the associated disorders. In this paper, similar cases are also reviewed to discuss the treatment and the link between meniscal cyst and meniscal tear.

The patient was a 39-year-old man who was referred to a physical therapist by his primary care physician for a chief complaint of left posterior knee pain. Radiographs of the left knee, which had been previously ordered by the patient's primary care physician, were interpreted as normal. Given the patient's worsening symptoms, no history of trauma or injury, and lack of improvement with prior conservative measures, the patient was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left knee was ordered, which revealed a septated ganglion cyst within the femoral notch that caused moderate displacement of the cruciate ligaments.

### Treatment of temporomandibular joint ganglion cyst [^3be7b368]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts of the temporomandibular joint are very rare and always misdiagnosed as synovial cyst, parotid gland tumor, or other cystic lesions. They present with pain, swelling, or dysfunction. Image studies could facilitate to identify the tumor mass from the adjacent soft tissue, but a definitive diagnosis could be made from the pathologic report. A 59-year-old woman presented to the clinics with a chief complaint of a painless swelling mass in the right preauricular region of 3-month duration. Computed tomography was performed, which showed a small radiolucent lesion adjacent to the right condyle. Local excision was performed, and the specimen was sent for histologic examination. Microscopic examination showed a cystic space walled by dense fibrous connective tissue without epithelial or endothelial lining. Immunohistochemical staining of these lining cells showed positivity for vimentin and negativity for cytokeratin. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of ganglion cyst. Ganglion cysts present as unilobulate or multilobulate cysts that arise from the collagenous tissue and is filled with highly viscous fluid. It does not communicate with the joint cavity. In contrast, synovial cyst is a true cyst lined by cuboidal or flattened cells from the synoviocytes and is filled with gelatinous fluid. It may or may not communicate with the joint cavity. Excision is the treatment of choice of symptomatic cystic lesions. Incomplete excision of these lesions may cause further recurrence or infection. Thus, injection of hydrocortisone or aspiration may be considered as an alternative management.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and study of autoimmune retinopathy from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's task force [^c73b52e8]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings include that intraretinal degenerative cystic changes can be present typically in the middle retinal layer (inner nuclear layer) and can range from small slit-like cysts to larger cystoid cavities, frequently accompanied with outer retinal atrophy similar to the findings of retinitis pigmentosa; Xu and colleagues found that 24% of eyes with suspected AIR were complicated by cystoid macular edema at some point during the observed clinical course. Inner retinal thinning with ganglion cell layer loss can also complicate AIR, although isolated nerve fiber layer atrophy is very atypical early in the disease unless the optic nerve is the primary target of an autoimmune process such as in collapsin response-mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) autoimmunity. OCT scans in the mid periphery may demonstrate early disruption or loss of the outer retinal layers and can be helpful in detecting early changes before there is progression into the central macula. Pericentral retinopathy from hydroxychloroquine toxicity with damage near the arcades has been described primarily in Asian and is an important differential diagnoses for AIR. Forms of AIR with predominantly inner retinal involvement are less well characterized and require further study to understand the evolution of retinal changes across different layers as the disease progresses.

### Intraneural ganglion cyst of the peroneal nerve in a four-year-old girl: a case report [^7b233d2f]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Intraneural ganglion cysts of the peroneal nerve are rare, usually occurring in adult men with a typical presentation of knee or proximal leg pain preceding motor weakness and/or sensory disturbances in the peroneal nervous distribution. A history of knee trauma and a palpable mass of the lateral knee in the region of the peroneal nerve are common. We present the unusual case of an intraneural ganglion cyst of the peroneal nerve in a 4-year-old girl. Although extremely rare in the pediatric population, the condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with new-onset foot deformities, foot drop, or clinical examinations consistent with a peroneal nerve lesion. Surgical treatment consisting of ganglion decompression with exploration and ligation of the articular branch of the peroneal nerve may result in improved functional recovery in the pediatric population compared with the adult population. Greater access to magnetic resonance imaging may allow diagnosis of cases that were not previously identified.

### Longitudinal observation of pediatric hand and wrist ganglia [^8791c278]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the behavior of ganglia of the hand and wrist in young children treated without surgery. Fourteen consecutive children, less than 10 years of age, who presented with cysts of the hand and wrist were followed up by a single surgeon. The average age of the patient at the time of diagnosis was 38 months (range, 2 months to 9 years 3 months). The masses included 7 retinacular cysts, 5 volar wrist ganglia, and 2 dorsal wrist ganglia. These cysts had been present for an average of 3.3 months (range, 1–12 months) before medical advice was sought. None of the cysts were painful. Follow-up averaged 33 months (range, 9–112 months), with 79% of all cysts spontaneously resolving, the majority within a year. We believe that a child presenting with a benign hand lesion characteristic of a ganglion cyst should initially be treated by observation.

### The cost does not outweigh the benefit: pathologic evaluation of wrist ganglion cysts should not Be routine [^8f449401]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As health care costs in the United States continue to rise, there is increasing attention on cost-saving measures. One area of investigation is the utility of pathologic examination of specimens from routine procedures with a suspected benign pathology. We assessed the utility and cost of routine pathologic analysis for wrist ganglion cyst excision.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of all wrist ganglion cyst excisions performed by seven hand surgeons was conducted from 2015 to 2019 at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. Preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses, pathologic diagnosis, and pathology cost were assessed.

Results

A total of 407 patients underwent ganglion cyst excision, with 318 (78.1%) specimens sent for pathologic review. Of the 318, 317 (99.6%) specimens were concordant with the preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis of ganglion cyst. One specimen (0.3%) resulted as a benign cystic vascular malformation. The charge per specimen was $258, totaling $81,786 spent confirming benign pathology that was clinically correctly diagnosed by the operating surgeon in 99.6% of cases.

Conclusions

Routine pathologic analysis is not indicated in cases in which surgeons have a high clinical suspicion for ganglion cyst based on preoperative and intraoperative findings. Pathologic review should be reserved for cases with atypical presentations or intraoperative findings.

### Arthroscopically assisted removal of intraosseous ganglion cysts of the distal tibia [^6bd90ac4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Intraosseous ganglia of the distal tibia are rare. We evaluated the feasibility of surgically treating these lesions with an arthroscopically assisted technique. Five patients with symptomatic distal tibial ganglia underwent surgical curettage and excision with this technique. All patients underwent débridement of the chondral lesion and hypertrophied synovial lining when present, probing of the portal to the ganglion, and subsequently thorough curettage with bone grafting performed through a cortical window made from a separate small incision. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. All patients had eventual relief of symptoms with good integration of bone graft at final followup. There were no recurrences at a minimum followup of 19 months (mean, 38.6 months; range, 19–69 months). Mean time for return to full function was 15.4 weeks (range, 8–17 weeks). There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores increased from 73 points (range, 67–77 points) preoperatively to 94 points (range, 90–100 points) postoperatively. Arthroscopically assisted surgical treatment of ganglia of the distal tibia in the appropriate patient is a reasonably simple technique that relieves symptoms and helps the patient to regain normal gait and full function with no recurrence (in our small series).

### Dorsal wrist ganglion: clinical and imaging correlation in symptomatic population based on high-field MRI [^8e2a6756]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ganglia are the most common benign soft tissue tumor of the hand and those on the dorsal surface of the wrist represent 60 to 70% of wrist cysts. Their incidence is probably underestimated, as they are often neglected and, for the most part, asymptomatic. However, they can be a reason for consultation and treatment in rare cases where they are painful or for esthetic reasons. The pathophysiology of these cysts has been debated for many years. Although initially, the oldest theory was that of a synovial hernia, other authors have suggested the possibility of a communication channel through the scapholunate ligament (SL) linking the joint cavity and the cyst, with a non-return valve mechanism. Anatomical advances in the dorsal scapholunate region led to the description of the dorsal capsular scapholunate septum (DCSS) by Van Overstraeten (see Fig. 1), a fibrous structure derived from the dorsal capsule and inserted in a bifid way at the bone-ligament junction on the dorsal and superior aspect of the scapholunate joint, on the surface of the SL ligament, acting as a secondary stabilizer of SL joint. This new anatomical knowledge combined with electron microscopy of the cyst wall confirming the absence of synovial cells and biochemical analysis of the mucoid fluid supporting its nature, have called into question its arthro-synovial nature. The systematic origin of the cyst in the deep DCSS in contact with the SL supports the "capsular rent" theory as a consequence of joint stress causing leakage of synovial fluid towards the dorsal scapholunate complex resulting in the creation of gelatinous fluid and the formation of cyst walls by degeneration of mesenchymal cells.

### Recurrence rates of dorsal wrist ganglion cysts after arthroscopic versus open surgical excision: a retrospective comparison [^64ec6552]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This study directly compares the recurrence rates of dorsal wrist ganglion cysts in patients treated via open surgical excision versus arthroscopic surgical excision. We hypothesized that there would be no difference between recurrence rates with these 2 surgical options.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients with a dorsal ganglion cyst undergoing either open or arthroscopic surgical excision at a single academic center with 3 fellowship-trained attending hand surgeons from 2012 to 2017. Charts were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes and were reviewed using postoperative office notes for preoperative and postoperative symptoms, episodes of recurrence, time at which recurrence occurred, subsequent operations, and outcome at final follow-up.

Results

The charts of 172 patients undergoing either arthroscopic or open dorsal ganglion excision were reviewed. Nine of 54 (16.7%) arthroscopic excisions resulted in cyst recurrence, while 8 of 118 (6.8%) open excisions resulted in cyst recurrence (P = 0.044). Two of 9 (22%) recurrences after arthroscopic ganglion excision versus 2 of 8 (25%) recurrences after open ganglion excision underwent repeat surgical intervention. Time to recurrence, as well as final follow-up, was not statistically different between groups.

Conclusions

Dorsal wrist ganglion cysts are the most common benign soft tissue mass of the upper extremity, but it remains unknown whether arthroscopic or open surgical excision leads to lower recurrence rate. Scant literature exists directly comparing these 2 methods of surgical excision. This study suggests that open excision of dorsal wrist ganglia leads to a lower recurrence rate than does arthroscopic excision.

### Wrist ganglion treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c30c49b]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the clinical outcomes of treatment for adult wrist ganglions and to conduct a meta-analysis comparing the 2 most common options: open surgical excision and aspiration.

Methods

The review methodology was registered with PROSPERO. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles published between 1990 and 2013. Included studies reported treatment outcomes of adult wrist ganglions. Two independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction. We evaluated the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.

Results

A total of 753 abstracts were identified and screened; 112 full-text articles were reviewed and 35 studies (including 2,239 ganglions) met inclusion criteria for data extraction and qualitative synthesis. Six studies met criteria for meta-analysis, including 2 RCTs and 4 cohort studies. In RCTs surgical excision was associated with a 76% reduction in recurrence compared with aspiration. Randomized controlled trial quality was moderate. In cohort studies surgical excision was associated with a 58% reduction in recurrence compared with aspiration. Cohort study quality was very low. In cohort studies aspiration was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrence compared with reassurance. Across all studies mean recurrence for arthroscopic surgical excision (studies, 11; ganglions, 512), open surgical excision (studies, 14; ganglions, 809), and aspiration (studies, 12; ganglions, 489) was 6%, 21%, and 59%, respectively. Mean complication rate for arthroscopic surgical excision (studies, 6; ganglions, 221), open surgical excision (studies, 6; ganglions, 341), and aspiration (studies, 3; ganglions, 134) was 4%, 14%, and 3%, respectively.

Conclusions

Open surgical excision offers significantly lower chance of recurrence compared with aspiration in the treatment of wrist ganglions. Arthroscopic excision has yielded promising outcomes but data from comparative trials are limited and have not demonstrated its superiority. Further RCTs are needed to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to compare complications and recovery.

Current Guideline Weaknesses

Weaknesses in rigor of development and applicability were apparent among the current guidelines. Deficiencies in the former category are especially concerning given its connection with evidence-based medicine. The rigor of the development domain specifically assesses whether CPGs systematically gathered evidence, critiqued collected data, transparently used objective criteria in forming expert consensus, incorporated peer review, and outlined protocols for updating recommendations. Understandably, lacking any of these components can compromise the quality of a CPG's recommendation. This can be especially dangerous for rare pathologies such as HNPGL, for which clinical experience is limited. Shortcomings in applicability can be equally damaging. The applicability domain tests whether CPG recommendations can be carried out realistically and how impact may be measured. Again, for uncommon tumors such as HNPGL, access to centers capable of carrying out treatments must be considered. – Whether it be for specific genetic testing or operations by experienced surgeons, CPGs should provide guidance on when limited resources necessitate referring patients elsewhere. It is paramount that future guideline authors spend significant time improving every aspect of both domains.

The deficiencies in stakeholder involvement and editorial independence share a different pattern. Upon closer inspection of individual reviewer ratings, the average of both domains was brought down by low scores for singular items.

Regarding stakeholder involvement, many guidelines did not incorporate perspectives from their target population during recommendation formation. It is unclear why this may have occurred. Possible reasons include the already large time costs associated with forming CPGs coupled with the intensive resources needed to properly sample patient opinion. – Nevertheless, public opinion should be incorporated to better define topics of interest and provide valuable information on quality of life following specific treatment methods.

For editorial independence, multiple CPGs lacked statements about how funding bodies did not influence guideline contents. This represents an obvious flaw. Target users should have confidence that CPG recommendations are free from undue influence and based on evidence alone. Addressing both specific shortcomings in future iterations would therefore improve overall CPG quality.

### Unusual solitary ganglion cysts of the anterior segment of the lateral meniscus [^f3899cdf]. Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Generally, ganglion or synovial cysts have been reported to originate from numerous structures in and around the knee joint, including the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, popliteal tendon, and menisci. Nevertheless, a ganglion is not a synovial cyst and there is no synovial lining. Meniscal cysts present a subgroup of ganglion cysts that occur in association with meniscal tears. We report 2 cases of unusual meniscal cyst from the anterior segment of the lateral meniscus without any meniscal tear and discuss the possibility of their pathogenesis and treatment.

### Merkel cell carcinoma disguised as a ganglion cyst in a pianist: oncologic management and functional reconstruction [^054b3e13]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

After clear margins were established, a vascularized flap was chosen for reconstruction due to planned adjuvant radiation therapy and need for optimal function over the exposed tendons. A reverse radial forearm flap to the dorsal wrist defect was performed and a split thickness skin graft from the thigh was applied to the volar proximal forearm donor site (Fig 1). After a short period of immobilization for graft healing, he was referred to hand therapy for wrist and finger range of motion, with the goal to preserve his ability to play the piano.

Adjuvant radiation therapy was administered to the right hand and wrist. At 3-month follow-up, the patient was healing well without signs of recurrence and observation was pursued per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

At a routine plastic surgery follow-up 4 months later, a mass was palpated in the right axilla. An urgent core needle biopsy was performed and confirmed metastatic MCC. Positron emission tomography scan at that time showed right lateral chest/axillary radiolabel uptake. He underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection 2 weeks later with adjuvant radiation therapy to his right axilla per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for clinical node positive disease. Two of six dissected nodes were found to be positive for MCC. Given the patient's high-risk disease, early recurrent disease, and risk factors including history of CLL, the patient was started on pembrolizumab. He completed one year of therapy with 9 cycles. Routine positron emission tomography scans at 2 year follow up were negative for metastasis. The patient has followed-up regularly with oncology and plastic surgery without evidence of disease recurrence. Despite major soft tissue surgery on the hand and wrist as well as radiation therapy, he achieved satisfactory functional outcome and has maintained the ability to play the piano.

### Spectrum of MRI features of ganglion and synovial cysts [^7e462f19]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Besides the general risk factors for the development of intra- and periarticular cysts described for other joints, such as osteoarthritis, some other knee-specific disorders include meniscal and cruciate ligament lesions. In fact, although relatively infrequent, the knee joint is also a known location for GCs, particularly intra-articular ones. They might be found adjacent or within the cruciate ligaments, most commonly in the anterior cruciate ligament, as illustrated in Fig. 9. Intraosseous GCs typically occur in the epiphyseal-metaphyseal region of long bones, the proximal tibia being the most frequently reported location within the knee. These cysts might be large, multiloculated lesions communicating with the joint space, as the one shown in Fig. 10.

Although MRI is the gold-standard technique in characterizing cystic lesions in the knee, US is also highly accurate and provides guidance for percutaneous therapies.

### Postoperative toxic shock syndrome after excision of a ganglion cyst from the ankle [^6aaa3a64]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative toxic shock syndrome (PTSS) after orthopedic surgery is rare, but early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to minimize morbidity and potential mortality. The diagnosis should be considered in all postoperative patients presenting with fever, hypotension, and systemic illness. The treating surgeon must have not only knowledge of the clinical entity, but also an extremely high index of suspicion, because the diagnosis can be elusive with surgical wounds appearing deceptively benign. Treatment consists of antibiotics, surgical wound debridement, and, more importantly, aggressive supportive care with intravenous fluids and intensive care surveillance. To date, the literature contains relatively few case reports of PTSS after orthopedic procedures, with even fewer cases encountered after foot and ankle surgery. This report describes a patient who developed the rare complication of PTSS after an elective ganglion cyst excision from the ankle.
