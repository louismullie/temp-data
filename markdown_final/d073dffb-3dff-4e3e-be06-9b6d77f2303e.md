## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors, prognosis, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology of lupus nephritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and burden to frame the clinical context. Then, I should verify the demographic and clinical risk factors for developing LN and for poor outcomes. Next, I will examine the clinical manifestations and the role of kidney biopsy in diagnosis and prognosis. After that, I need to review prognostic indicators and long-term outcomes, including disparities. Finally, I will synthesize the pathophysiology and integrate guideline-aligned management principles that link mechanism to therapy and monitoring, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and burden to anchor the discussion. LN affects roughly 25–60% of patients with SLE, with substantial variation by age, sex, and ethnicity, and it often emerges within 5 years of SLE diagnosis. Importantly, LN can be the initial manifestation leading to SLE recognition, which underscores the need for vigilance in new-onset proteinuria or hematuria [^112WUPjF] [^116r8Ssc]. I should double-check the ESRD risk: contemporary data suggest 5–20% progress to ESRD within 10 years, with higher risks in proliferative classes and certain populations, and mortality remains elevated, particularly in younger patients and those with ESRD, so the stakes for early detection and durable remission are high [^116r8Ssc] [^115pHxF5] [^117HmVbD].

> Now, I will examine demographic and genetic risk factors for developing LN. Younger age at SLE onset, male sex, and non-White ancestry (Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native) are consistently associated with higher incidence and worse outcomes; pediatric-onset SLE carries a particularly aggressive renal phenotype and higher proliferative rates, which I need to keep in mind when assessing risk and planning therapy intensity [^112WUPjF] [^111vtQx5] [^1142w8Qo]. Hold on, I should verify the genetic contribution: a higher cumulative genetic risk score has been linked to earlier onset, organ damage, ESRD, and mortality, supporting a path from ancestry to genotype to phenotype in LN susceptibility and severity [^111vtQx5].

> Next, I should review clinical risk factors for poor renal outcomes once LN is established. Persistent proteinuria, impaired baseline eGFR, hypertension at diagnosis, frequent flares, anemia, and failure to achieve complete or partial renal response by 6–12 months all portend worse CKD and ESRD risk. I need to ensure I emphasize that early treatment response is a modifiable driver of long-term kidney survival, not just baseline severity [^112WUPjF] [^114chtLQ] [^117HmVbD]. Wait, let me verify the AKI dimension: AKI, especially stage 3, independently associates with higher risks of kidney failure and death, reinforcing the need for rapid recognition and aggressive management of nephritic crises [^116HcY1s].

> I will now examine histopathologic risk factors because biopsy features refine prognosis beyond clinical variables. Proliferative classes III/IV carry the highest risk of progression and relapse, while membranous class V, though often slower, can be complicated by nephrotic syndrome and thrombosis; high activity index (cellular crescents, endocapillary proliferation) and high chronicity index (interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy) independently predict CKD/ESRD, and tubulointerstitial lesions may carry prognostic weight comparable to glomerular class in some cohorts [^113abHz9] [^1119R79U] [^112vvDSg]. Hold on, I should verify the TMA point: thrombotic microangiopathy is variably associated with worse outcomes across studies, so I should be cautious in over-weighting it without corroborating clinical context and antiphospholipid serologies [^112vvDSg].

> Let me consider the clinical manifestations next, and I need to ensure I capture the full spectrum. LN can be silent or present with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria ranging from mild to nephrotic, red cell casts, hypertension, edema, and AKI; importantly, some patients have isolated proteinuria with normal renal function, while others have fulminant nephritic syndrome with rapidly declining GFR, so absence of overt systemic activity does not exclude active renal disease [^112WUPjF] [^111tFKsq]. I should confirm that pediatric patients often show more severe phenotypes and higher proliferative rates, which mandates a lower threshold for biopsy and aggressive immunosuppression when indicated [^1142w8Qo].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach, especially the role of kidney biopsy. I need to check guideline positions: ACR and EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommend prompt biopsy when LN is suspected, as ISN/RPS class, activity/chronicity indices, and vascular lesions directly inform prognosis and therapy; when biopsy is not feasible, nephritic features favor class III/IV-directed therapy, whereas nephrotic features favor class V-directed therapy, but I should caution that this is a surrogate and histology remains the gold standard [^1167HxwM] [^112uaPPU] [^1172Fhgb]. Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence: in remission, proteinuria should be checked every 3–6 months, and complements and anti-dsDNA at each visit, given their modest but useful value for detecting flares when interpreted in clinical context [^116g7dbA] [^111iVaDB].

> I will now examine prognostic indicators and long-term outcomes, and I should double-check that I separate static predictors from dynamic response metrics. Baseline eGFR, proteinuria magnitude, hypertension, anemia, and histologic class/activity/chronicity predict long-term kidney failure, whereas dynamic measures such as time to complete or partial response and proteinuria trajectory at 6–12 months better reflect modifiable risk and correlate with CKD/ESRD risk; failure to achieve at least a 50% proteinuria reduction by 6 months should prompt reassessment of adherence, drug exposure, and histology, and consideration of therapy escalation [^114chtLQ] [^117HmVbD] [^1122H1mn]. Hold on, I should verify the ESRD risk by class: class IV proliferative LN carries the highest 15-year ESRD risk, approaching 44% in some cohorts, which justifies aggressive induction and prolonged maintenance strategies in this subtype [^115pHxF5].

> But wait, what about disparities and access-to-care effects on prognosis. Non-White patients experience higher incidence of proliferative LN, worse blood pressure control, and higher ESRD and mortality rates even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors; pediatric patients and those with delayed recognition or inadequate initial immunosuppression also fare worse, underscoring the need for equitable, guideline-concordant care and early biopsy [^111vtQx5] [^114XDXWD] [^112WUPjF]. I should confirm that structured programs for pediatric-to-adult transition and adherence support are recommended to mitigate these disparities and improve outcomes [^111emXBW].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to connect mechanism with therapeutic targets. Central drivers include loss of tolerance with autoantibody production (anti-dsDNA, anti-nucleosome, anti-C1q), immune complex deposition with complement activation, type I interferon pathway activation, and intrarenal inflammation with B and T cell dysfunction. Emerging data also implicate local plasma cell niches and tertiary lymphoid structures within the kidney, which may explain persistent activity and the rationale for B-cell–targeted therapies [^112WUPjF] [^1127VGe3] [^112eSqR4]. Hold on, I should verify the practical implication: this mechanistic heterogeneity supports multi-agent regimens targeting different arms of the immune system, aligning with modern treat-to-target strategies that prioritize early, robust suppression and sustained maintenance to prevent nephron loss [^112eB3aC].

> I need to ensure I integrate management principles that directly modify risk and prognosis. Early recognition with routine screening for proteinuria every 6–12 months in SLE without known kidney disease, prompt biopsy when indicated, and immediate initiation of glucocorticoids while awaiting histology are foundational. Triple therapy with mycophenolate plus a calcineurin inhibitor or belimumab plus background hydroxychloroquine and RAAS blockade is now standard for class III/IV disease, with treat-to-target goals of ≥ 50% proteinuria reduction by 6 months and uPCR < 500–700 mg/g by 12 months, individualized by risk and tolerability [^114gcEyS] [^1167HxwM] [^1149fddt] [^1122H1mn]. Let me reconsider steroid strategy: guidelines endorse minimizing to ≤ 5 mg/day by 6 months if response allows, balancing infection and cardiovascular risks, and emphasize close rheumatology–nephrology collaboration and shared decision-making to sustain adherence and outcomes [^1149fddt] [^114RW2sb].

> Finally, I should double-check special situations and long-term sequelae that shape prognosis. CKD is highly prevalent in SLE even without prior LN and confers markedly higher morbidity and mortality, so aggressive risk factor modification (blood pressure, lipids, glycemia, smoking, diet) and nephroprotective strategies are essential. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in LN-related CKD, and ESRD management should favor preemptive transplantation when feasible, even without full serologic remission if no major organ involvement persists [^117JUXDz] [^11218Utk] [^114WsdnA]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: higher proliferative rates and damage accrual justify early, intensive immunosuppression and structured transition planning to preserve renal function and survival [^1142w8Qo] [^111emXBW].

Lupus nephritis (LN) is driven by **immune complex deposition** and complement activation [^113PgPEa], leading to glomerular inflammation and injury [^115yDutF]. Risk is higher in **non-White ethnicities, males, and pediatric-onset SLE** [^111vtQx5], and is strongly linked to anti-dsDNA and hypocomplementemia [^112BiLd9]. Clinically, LN presents with proteinuria, hematuria, and variable renal function, ranging from silent disease to nephritic or nephrotic syndromes [^115yDutF] [^112cx9sh]. Prognosis depends on histologic class, activity/chronicity indices, and response to therapy [^112vvDSg] [^111neCVG]; proliferative classes (III/IV) carry the highest risk of ESRD, and persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and incomplete remission predict worse outcomes [^113abHz9] [^114XDXWD]. Early, aggressive immunosuppression [^1121fRFQ] and strict risk-factor control improve renal survival [^11218Utk].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Immune complex deposition**: Circulating immune complexes (especially anti-dsDNA) deposit in glomeruli, activating complement and recruiting inflammatory cells, causing endothelial injury and capillary inflammation [^112BiLd9].

- **Local immune activation**: Intraglomerular immune complexes amplify inflammation, cytokine release, and further immune cell recruitment [^112eSqR4].

- **Complement activation**: Classical pathway activation (C3, C4) mediates tissue injury and amplifies inflammation [^112BiLd9].

- **Tubulointerstitial inflammation**: Interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis contribute to chronic kidney damage and progression to ESRD [^111uUY9P].

---

## Risk factors

### Demographic factors

- **Ethnicity**: Higher risk in Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations [^115f6SdA].

- **Sex**: Male sex is associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes [^111vtQx5].

- **Age**: Pediatric-onset SLE has higher LN prevalence and severity [^1142w8Qo].

---

### Genetic and immunological factors

Genetic and immunological factors include **HLA-DR2/DR3**, IRF5, STAT4, and APOL1 risk variants, which confer susceptibility [^notfound], and **autoantibodies**, with anti-dsDNA, anti-nucleosome, and anti-C1q strongly associating with LN activity and severity [^112BiLd9].

---

### Environmental and clinical factors

Environmental and clinical factors include **infections** — particularly Epstein-Barr virus — that can trigger flares, and **medications** such as hydralazine, procainamide, and TNF inhibitors that may precipitate SLE/LN [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Proteinuria**: Ranges from mild to nephrotic-range (> 3.5 g/day) [^112uaPPU].

- **Hematuria**: Microscopic or gross hematuria with dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts [^notfound].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Variable degrees of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease [^116HcY1s].

- **Systemic features**: Fatigue, fever, rash, and serologic activity (low C3/C4, elevated anti-dsDNA) [^111iVaDB].

---

## Prognosis

### Factors influencing prognosis

- **Histologic class**: Proliferative classes (III/IV) have the highest risk of ESRD; membranous (V) has lower ESRD risk but higher thrombotic complications [^113abHz9].

- **Activity and chronicity indices**: High activity (crescents, endocapillary proliferation) and chronicity (fibrosis, tubular atrophy) predict worse outcomes [^111uUY9P].

- **Response to therapy**: Early complete or partial remission improves renal survival; persistent proteinuria and frequent relapses worsen outcomes [^114XDXWD].

---

### Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes include **progression to ESRD** in 10–20% within 10 years, with higher risk in proliferative classes and non-White patients [^116r8Ssc], and **mortality**, with LN increasing mortality 2–3 fold, mainly from cardiovascular disease and infections [^notfound].

Histopathological risk factors

A well-recognized association links histopathological findings on kidney biopsy to the clinical course of LN, with mesangial nephritis (class II) carrying the best renal prognosis while proliferative nephritis (class III and IV) presenting with a more aggressive course and deterioration of renal function. Membranous (class V) nephritis has long been considered mild; however, it may lead to severe protein loss, nephrotic syndrome, prolonged hospitalization and eventually chronic renal damage.

High activity and chronicity indexes are independent predictors of CKD and ESRD. Considering histopathological changes individually, cellular crescents (active injury) and interstitial fibrosis (chronic damage) in the initial renal biopsy bear the highest predictive value. Extracapillary proliferation at repeated renal biopsy is an even stronger predictor of renal function deterioration, therefore requiring an aggressive treatment. Alterations of the tubulointerstitium including inflammatory infiltrate and tubular atrophy appear to also be predictors of poor prognosis, independent on class.

The histological analysis of kidney biopsy of LN patients over the last five decades showed significant decrease in chronicity indexes, probably due to a tighter surveillance of renal function in SLE patients, likely contributing to the improvement of overall renal survival.

It should be mentioned, however, that some limitations in the definition of the risk factors still remain, in particular owing to the intra- and inter-observer variability in the evaluation of the biopsy specimens, the absence of a validated cut-off point for active and chronic lesions to predict renal failure or mortality and the fluctuating course of renal involvement with a possible reversibility of some histological features.

Demographic risk factors

Renal outcome of patients with LN varies among different ethnic groups, with the best prognosis for Caucasians and the worst for Africans, whereas Asians have an intermediate prognosis. Black patients present, along with Hispanic patients, worse outcomes with increased rates of ESRD and mortality. This is probably the result of higher incidence of proliferative diffuse LN, burdened by nephritic syndrome with severe hypertension mediated by a genetic predisposition, as well as to limited access to adequate care and lower adherence to treatment. Male gender is another established demographic risk factor for worse renal outcome.

Clinical risk factors

To date, the main clinical risk factors for the development of CKD are baseline hypertension and poor control of cardiovascular risk factors during the follow-up; nephrotic range proteinuria, young age, anaemia and elevated serum creatinine at the time of biopsy; an inadequate immunosuppressive treatment at diagnosis that could lead to a lack of a complete renal remission and to repeated nephritic flares.

A multicentric study on 381 LN patients has recently shown that lack of EULAR/ERA-EDTA complete or partial renal response at 12 months and uncontrolled hypertension independently predicted CKD development.

The aforementioned risk factors, along with the histological class, are also the main contributors to the development of ESRD.

SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the kidneys in about 50% of patients. Lupus nephritis is a major risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality in SLE, and despite potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies still ends in CKD or ESRD for too many patients. This review highlights recent updates in our understanding of disease epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment in an effort to establish a framework for lupus nephritis management that is patient-specific and oriented toward maintaining long-term kidney function in patients with lupus.

Regarding medical management for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, ERA-EDTA/EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate a period of intense immunosuppressive therapy to control disease activity during active phases of LN followed by a longer period of usually less intensive therapy to consolidate response and prevent relapses.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease involving multiple body systems. Lupus nephritis (LN) is common among patients with SLE, and is associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mortality in patients with SLE. The evolution in immunosuppressive therapies and general medical care has led to prolonged survival of patients with SLE and LN, and as a result, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as an important cause of death in these patients. Previous studies have reported the strong association between SLE and atherosclerotic CVD, in which patients with lupus showed a twofold to threefold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Putative mechanisms for such escalated risk of CVD in patients with SLE include corticosteroid use, chronic systemic inflammation and increased prevalence of various traditional CVD risk factors. The pathogenic mechanisms of atherosclerotic CVD in patients with LN are even more complex. Conventional CV risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) and dyslipidaemia were reported to be increased in patients with LN as compared with patients with SLE without nephritis. Other contributing factors for atherosclerotic CVD in patients with LN include presence of renal impairment and proteinuria. Indeed, renal insufficiency and proteinuria are both well-recognised risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD, and CVD in fact is the leading cause of mortality in patients with renal failure. While various investigators have reported the prevalence of CV risk factors in patients with LN, these studies have considerable heterogeneity in the study design, patient characteristics and treatment regimens. More importantly, it remains unclear how the presence of LN will impact on risk factors and complications of CVD in patients with SLE. Based on these knowledge gaps, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the CV risk factors and CVD in patients with SLE with or without LN.

### Noninvasive biomarkers for lupus nephritis [^111hgRXN]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most severe clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Notably, the clinical manifestations of LN are not always consistent with the histopathological findings. Therefore, the diagnosis and activity monitoring of this disease are challenging and largely depend on invasive renal biopsy. Renal biopsy has side effects and is associated with the risk of bleeding and infection. There is a growing interest in the development of novel noninvasive biomarkers for LN. In this review, we summarize most of the LN biomarkers discovered so far by correlating current knowledge with future perspectives. These biomarkers fundamentally reflect the biological processes of kidney damage and repair during disease. Furthermore, this review highlights the role of urinary cell phenotype detection in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of LN and summarizes the limitations and countermeasures of this test.

### Urine protein tests in systemic lupus erythematosus: what Do they mean? [^113kTWE3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The development of lupus nephritis (LN) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Proteinuria is a key indicator of kidney involvement; detecting and monitoring proteinuria is therefore crucial as it acts as a surrogate marker for disease activity and has significant prognostic value. This review explores the general mechanisms of proteinuria and highlights the limitations of current measurement techniques. In the absence of specific urinary markers for LN disease activity, evaluating proteinuria involves considering its trajectory, amplitude of change, and the overall clinical status of the patient. Differentiating between acute disease vs proteinuria that may stem from scarring and glomerular basement membrane remodeling can be challenging. Additionally, in the absence of other signs of active disease, the time to recovery and resolution of proteinuria may be prolonged.

The following constitutes key background information on lupus nephritis:

- Definition: LN is a severe organ manifestation of the autoimmune disease SLE, characterized by inflammation of the kidneys.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of LN involves multiple pathways, including aberrant apoptosis, autoantibody production, immune complex deposition, and complement activation. These processes lead to the formation of autoantibodies that deposit in the kidney, triggering inflammation and damage to the renal tissue.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of LN in the US is estimated at 0.72 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for developing LN include young age at SLE diagnosis, male gender, ethnicity, and genetic predisposition.
- Disease course: LN is a severe organ manifestation of SLE, with clinical features that can range from asymptomatic proteinuria to manifestations associated with nephritic and nephrotic syndromes and ESRD.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of LN is severe, with up to 20% of patients progressing to ESRD.

### Redefining lupus nephritis: clinical implications of pathophysiologic subtypes [^113PgPEa]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical and immunologic manifestations, of which lupus nephritis is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. The development of nephritis in patients with SLE involves multiple pathogenic pathways including aberrant apoptosis, autoantibody production, immune complex deposition and complement activation. The 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification system for lupus nephritis was widely accepted with high intraobserver and interobserver concordance to guide therapeutic strategy and provide prognostic information. However, this classification system is not based on the underlying disease pathophysiology. Some additional lesions that contribute to disease presentation, including glomerular crescents, podocyte injury, tubulointerstitial lesions and vascular injury, should be recognized. Although outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis have improved over the past 30 years, treatment of this disease remains challenging and is best approached on the basis of the underlying pathogenesis, which is only partially represented by the various pathological phenotypes defined by the ISN/RPS classification. Here, we discuss the heterogeneous mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and how improved understanding of underlying disease mechanisms might help guide therapeutic strategies.

DISCUSSION

Kidney involvement in SLE has significant implications for the disease management and prognosis. Several authorities, including the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and American College of Rheumatology, have published recommendations for the management of LN. The recently published update of the joint EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations was based on a dedicated SLR, which covered several aspects of the disease (formed in the 15 research questions) and not just the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of its different phases. To this end, we followed an inclusive approach during article selection, in order to capture data from observational and non-controlled studies, in topics where randomised controlled studies are absent or scarce. Importantly, because this was an update of previous recommendations published in 2012, data retrieval started from the ending date of the previous SLR, although overall LoE and GoR took into account the whole body of evidence.

Kidney biopsy remains a cornerstone in the diagnosis and management of LN, because the prognostic value of histological findings cannot be replaced by any clinical or laboratory parameter. In addition to features with well-established prognostic value (histological class, activity and chronicity indices, presence of crescents), from the review of the literature it became evident that acute or chronic lesions of the tubulointerstitial space (inflammation and fibrosis/tubular atrophy, respectively) are also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Regarding features of thrombotic microangiopathy, prognostic associations are more equivocal, despite the fact that such lesions may be present in up to one in four kidney biopsies in LN. A current revision of the 2003 ISN/RPS class, which will address these issues, is currently under way. The issue of repeat kidney biopsy, performed either per protocol or during a disease flare, was explored in several observational studies; histological transition is common, often leading to changes in treatment.

### Lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease [^11218Utk]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a determinant of overall morbidity and mortality, as lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD) drives cardiovascular disease and secondary immunodeficiency. Two lines of action are required to prevent the progression of lupus nephritis-related CKD: suppression of autoimmune SLE activity, which is a risk factor for immunopathology-related irreversible kidney injury, and management of non-immune risk factors that contribute to CKD progression. As each episode or relapse of active lupus nephritis implicates CKD progression, preventing flares of lupus nephritis is a key treatment target. Non-immune risk factors of CKD mostly include causes of nephron hyperfiltration, such as obesity, hypertension, sodium- or protein-rich diets and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as pregnancy. Nephrotoxic agents and smoking also drive kidney cell loss. Intrinsic risk factors for CKD progression include poor nephron endowment because of prematurity at birth, nephropathic genetic variants, ageing, male sex and previous or concomitant kidney diseases. Care for lupus nephritis involves the control of all modifiable risk factors of CKD progression. In addition, remnant nephron overload can be reduced using early dual therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and sodium-glucose transporter-2, whereas further renoprotective drug interventions are underway. As patients with lupus nephritis are at risk of CKD progression, they would all benefit from interdisciplinary care to minimize the risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and infections.

### Prediction of prognosis and renal outcome in lupus nephritis [^111neCVG]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe manifestation of SLE, characterised by subendothelial and/or subepithelial immune complex depositions in the afflicted kidney, resulting in extensive injury and nephron loss during the acute phase and eventually chronic irreversible damage and renal function impairment if not treated effectively. The therapeutic management of LN has improved during the last decades, but the imperative need for consensual outcome measures remains. In order to design trials with success potentiality, it is important to define clinically important short-term and long-term targets of therapeutic and non-therapeutic intervention. While it is known that early response to treatment is coupled with favourable renal outcomes, early predictors of renal function impairment are lacking. The information gleaned from kidney biopsies may provide important insights in this direction. Alas, baseline clinical and histopathological information has not been shown to be informative. By contrast, accumulating evidence of pronounced discrepancies between clinical and histopathological outcomes after the initial phase of immunosuppression has prompted investigations of the potential usefulness of per-protocol repeat kidney biopsies as an integral part of treatment evaluation, including patients showing adequate clinical response. This approach appears to have merit. Hopefully, clinical, molecular or genetic markers that reliably reflect kidney histopathology and portend the long-term prognosis will be identified. Novel non-invasive imaging methods and employment of the evolving artificial intelligence in pattern recognition may also be helpful towards these goals. The molecular and cellular characterisation of SLE and LN will hopefully result in novel therapeutic modalities, maybe new taxonomy perspectives, and ultimately personalised management.

### Mediators of injury in lupus nephritis [^115d4dgQ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies and the development of immune complex glomerulonephritis. Lupus nephritis (LN) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE. As a result, defining pathogenetic mediators in LN remains a major research effort. Progression to LN in SLE is dependent on the host breaking immune tolerance and forming autoantibodies that deposit in the kidney. A variety of predisposing factors in the host must then be present for this event to result in renal pathology. In this article, the authors review recent reports that advance our understanding of LN disease mediators, from autoantibody production and immune complex deposition to end stage fibrosis.

### Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century [^111V6ocV]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite important advances, LN is still a serious risk factor for the development of ESRD and for early mortality and disability in SLE. A proper management of LN by an expert dedicated team should lead to a preserved renal function in the long term, but requires an early recognition and evaluation through renal biopsy, followed by the optimized use of available treatments. Minimization/withdrawal of GC treatment is endorsed by the updated recommendations and should be attempted after an adequate time spent in renal remission. Besides traditional immunosuppression, biological drugs targeting selected pathways as well as multitargeted therapies are under evaluation and some already provided evidence of efficacy in RCTs and clinical practice, submitting a likely widespread use in the near future. This should be coupled with a personalized approach, taking into account global patients as well as renal features, in order to overcome the current limits to a truly improved prognosis.

### Lupus nephritis [^112WUPjF]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a type of glomerulonephritis and one of the most serious complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN affects 25–60% of patients with SLE, with incidence and prevalence varying by age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. LN predominantly develops within 5years of an SLE diagnosis and, for many patients, it is the initial manifestation that leads to the recognition of SLE. In some patients, LN may develop late in the disease course, highlighting the importance of persistent awareness of its symptoms and signs. Despite an increasing understanding of disease biology and more effective treatment options, LN remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality as it can lead to irreversible kidney failure and associated complications. Risk factors for progression to kidney failure include persistent proteinuria, low glomerular filtration rate, hypertension at diagnosis and frequent disease flares. LN pathogenesis involves complex immune dysregulation, with key pathways including type I interferon signalling, calcineurin activation, and B and T cell dysfunction. Several immunomodulatory drugs are used for the management of LN, and treatment paradigms are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent regimens. Along with appropriate pharmacotherapy, multidisciplinary care tailored to the patient's individual needs, involving rheumatologists, nephrologists, social workers and other health professionals, is crucial for holistically addressing both the immune and non-immune risk factors for progressive kidney function loss and for maximizing kidney lifespan in LN.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of lupus nephritis [^114UGHqr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Renal involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we provide an update on recent discoveries in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of lupus nephritis.

Recent Findings

Localized long-lived plasma cells have been identified as playing an important role in lupus nephritis. In addition, the roles of aberrant expression of microRNAs and proinflammatory cytokines have been explored. Early diagnosis is important for effective treatment and multiple biomarkers have been identified; however, none has been yet validated for clinical use. Biomarker panels may turn out to be more accurate than each individual component. Biologic agents for the treatment of lupus nephritis are being studied, including belimumab which was recently approved for nonrenal systemic lupus erythematosus. Rituximab has not proven itself in large, placebo-controlled trials, although it is still being used in refractory cases of lupus nephritis.

Summary

Lupus nephritis is a potentially devastating complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Immune cells, cytokines, and epigenetic factors have all been recently implicated in lupus nephritis pathogenesis. These recent discoveries may enable a paradigm shift in the treatment of this complex disease, allowing the tailoring of treatment to target specific pathogenic mediators at specific points in time in the progression of disease.

### Risk of chronic kidney disease in 260 patients with lupus nephritis: analysis of a nationwide multicentre cohort with up to 35 years of follow-up [^116Jv33C]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a challenging multisystem autoimmune disease that frequently affects the kidneys. LN is one of its most serious manifestations and occurs in up to 50% of the patients. Although there has been a significant improvement in survival of patients with SLE and LN over the past decades, LN is still associated with progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death.

LN is classified based on the renal biopsy according to the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification system, which was revised in 2018. Over 50% of patients have either a Class III or Class IV proliferative LN (PLN), with 20% to 30% demonstrating membranous LN (MLN). Around 15% of patients show a mixed pattern of membranous and proliferative histologic changes.

A number of studies have investigated the long-term outcomes of patients with PLN, MLN, and some studies have compared pure PLN or pure MLN vs mixed LN. We have recently analysed a single-centre cohort of patients with LN from the UK, with up to 42 years of follow-up, and reported on long-term outcomes and differences between PLN and MLN. However, to our knowledge, there are no other studies directly comparing PLN vs MLN. A multicentre study, with a different population, would be important to confirm and validate our previous findings.

Therefore, our objectives were to compare patients with MLN and PLN regarding clinical and laboratory presentation and long-term outcomes, and to investigate predictors of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a nationwide multicentre cohort of patients with LN.

### Disease modification achievement in patients with lupus nephritis in a real-life setting: mission impossible? [^115473ac]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common serious manifestation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affecting 25%–60% of patients and jeopardising renal and patient survival. Adverse renal outcomes, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), have been associated with multiple clinical, laboratory and histological factors. Although ESRD risk has been gradually reduced over the past decades due to dramatic advances in LN treatment, a 15-year ESRD risk up to 44% has been reported in patients with its proliferative forms, especially among those from developed countries. Preserving renal function and preventing ESRD remains the primary goal in LN management.

In this context, updated guidelines for the management of LN have been released by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) in collaboration with the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) in 2019, and by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes in 2021. In addition, treat-to-target (T2T) strategy approaches have been discussed. One step forward, the concept of disease modification (DM) refers to interventions that can alter the natural course of the disease and prevent organ damage accumulation. Although DM definition has been applied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosisand other chronic non-rheumatic conditions (ie, neurodegenerativeand respiratory disorders), it has not yet been established in SLE.

Recently, a conceptual framework for the definition of DM in SLE and in LN specifically was developed by a group of lupus experts. The main considerations in defining DM in LN were the minimisation of disease activity with minimal treatment-associated toxicity and the prevention of organ damage progression (ie, ESRD). Ultimately, the significance of the definition of DM in LN is twofold, as it may both help to guide clinical practice and to improve clinical trials' endpoints by the demonstration of a drug's ability to modify the course of the disease.

Here, we aimed to assess the extent to which DM can be achieved with the use of conventional therapies in a real-world setting. In order to inform the continuous refinement of DM definition in LN and based on recently proposed preliminary criteria, we aimed to further specify some aspects of the criteria in a clinically meaningful manner, and to assess potential predictors of DM and long-term outcomes.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: still a challenge for physicians [^117MeLGr]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has a complex clinical picture, and a number of defects in the immune system have been described in patients with the disease. Most organs can be involved in SLE, and in addition to the typical major organ manifestations (e.g. from kidneys and the central nervous system), early cardiovascular disease is a major determinant of prognosis. Several important findings during the last decade have increased the understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease characteristics and the underlying autoimmune process. Amongst, these are defects in the handling of apoptotic cells, increased expression of type I interferon-regulated genes and activation of autoreactive B cells, with both the type I interferon system and the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) having key roles. In addition, a large number of genes have been identified that contribute to these abnormalities. It has also become clear that certain SLE risk genes are associated with some organ manifestations, such as STAT4 with nephritis and IRF8 with myocardial infarction. Furthermore, environmental factors that can induce SLE or trigger a disease flare have been identified. As a consequence of this increased knowledge, new treatments for SLE have been developed. The most recently approved drug for SLE is belimumab, which blocks BLyS, and several new therapies and therapeutic strategies are in the pipeline for clinical application.

RESULTS

Predictive value of baseline clinical and histologic parameters for long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis

The SLR identified that, at the time of LN diagnosis, (i) compromised kidney function, – (ii) hypertensionand (iii) increased patient age – have been associated with adverse long-term kidney outcomes. With regard to histologic features, proliferative forms of LN (histologic classes III and IV according to the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification), increasing percentage of crescents and higher National Institutes of Health histologic activity and chronicity scores have all been associated with adverse long-term kidney outcomes. These associations were confirmed in observational studies captured in the current SLR. – However, from the latter, it became evident that additional histologic features may also carry prognostic implications. Specifically, tubulointerstitial lesions, especially interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy or their combination, have been associated with increased risk of ESKD or a composite outcome, in retrospective observational studies. – In a retrospective study of 105 patients with initial renal biopsy between 1987 and 2011 and a 10-year follow-up, presence of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy in > 25% of biopsy area was associated with an almost fourfold increased risk for ESKD (HR: 3.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 12.14). Additionally, evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy may be present in 5–25% of patients with LN. Nevertheless, data from observational studies regarding its impact on prognosis are equivocal; six studies have shown association of thrombotic microangiopathy with poor long-term renal outcomes (OR ranging from 2.14 to 5.80) or worse response to treatment, – while five studies have failed to show such an association. –

### How have the clinical, laboratory, treatment features and outcomes in children with lupus nephritis progressed over the last 30 years? [^112cx9sh]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare but severe autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems due to loss of self-tolerance, development of autoantibodies against the cell structures, immune complexes and aberrant activation of the complement system. Paediatric-onset SLE has a more severe disease course and needs a more aggressive treatment strategy compared with adult-onset SLE. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common solid organ involvement in SLE that may be the initial manifestation or become manifest at any time of the disease course. Patients with LN may present with various clinical findings ranging from asymptomatic urinary abnormalities to gross haematuria, massive proteinuria and kidney failure. LN develops in 25–80% of patients with paediatric-onset SLE and is responsible for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death. Factors associated with the poor outcome and severity of LN include histopathologic classification of LN (proliferative nephritis), male gender, African/Caribbean ethnicity, hypertension, poor treatment response, renal impairment at disease onset and recurrence of LN. The mortality rate of SLE patients with and without LN is ∼7 times and 2 times higher compared with the healthy population. Corticosteroids in combination with conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) are the mainstay of the treatment in LN of childhood. In recent years, new biologic DMARDs, such as rituximab (RTX) and belimumab, have successfully been used in paediatric-onset SLE. The 5-year survival rate of LN was 50% in the 1960s and improved significantly to 80% in the 1990s. A better understanding of SLE pathogenesis, strict control of hypertension and proteinuria, and better management of cardiovascular risk factors with newly developed drugs are the leading causes of improved LN prognosis.

There are comparative data for the prognosis of adult-onset LN between 1990s and 2000s. However, data comparing the long-term prognosis and outcomes of paediatric-onset LN patients are scarce. This study aimed to compare the changes in the demographic, laboratory and treatment characteristics, prognosis, and outcomes of paediatric-onset LN patients treated in the 1990s and 2000s, over the last 30 years.

### A comprehensive and practical approach to the management of lupus nephritis in the current era [^112XjcZN]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. It is estimated that up to 60% of individuals with SLE will develop LN, which can manifest at any stage of a patient's life; however, it commonly emerges early in the course of SLE and tends to exhibit a more aggressive phenotype in men compared to women. Black and Hispanic patients are more likely to progress to kidney failure than white patients. LN is characterized by kidney inflammation and chronic parenchymal damage, leading to impaired kidney function and potential progression to kidney failure. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of LN, highlighting the importance of early recognition and treatment of LN to prevent progressive, irreversible kidney damage and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, the article discusses current and emerging therapies for LN, including traditional immunosuppressive agents, biological agents, and novel therapies targeting specific pathways involved in LN pathogenesis, to provide a practical guide for clinicians in properly diagnosing LN and determining a patient-centered treatment plan.

Lupus nephritis — proteinuria and serologic monitoring: In people with LN who have sustained complete renal response, quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months will minimize the risk of missing an LN flare that would require more aggressive treatment. For people with LN, serum complement and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody should be measured at every clinic visit (but not more frequently than monthly); while hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies have only modest sensitivity and specificity for LN activity, several studies suggest they may herald new onset LN or LN flare, changes in these levels should prompt careful clinical and laboratory assessment but should not necessarily trigger preemptive treatment in the absence of clinical manifestations, and anti-C1q antibodies are potentially useful biomarker but this antibody test may not be universally available.

### The pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [^112eSqR4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis is an immune complex GN that develops as a frequent complication of SLE. The pathogenesis of lupus nephritis involves a variety of pathogenic mechanisms. The extrarenal etiology of systemic lupus is based on multiple combinations of genetic variants that compromise those mechanisms normally assuring immune tolerance to nuclear autoantigens. This loss of tolerance becomes clinically detectable by the presence of antinuclear antibodies. In addition, nucleic acids released from netting or apoptotic neutrophils activate innate and adaptive immunity via viral nucleic acid-specific Toll-like receptors. Therefore, many clinical manifestations of systemic lupus resemble those of viral infection. In lupus, endogenous nuclear particles trigger IFN-α signaling just like viral particles during viral infection. As such, dendritic cells, T helper cells, B cells, and plasma cells all contribute to the aberrant polyclonal autoimmunity. The intrarenal etiology of lupus nephritis involves antibody binding to multiple intrarenal autoantigens rather than the deposition of circulating immune complexes. Tertiary lymphoid tissue formation and local antibody production add to intrarenal complement activation as renal immunopathology progresses. Here we provide an update on the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to lupus nephritis and provide the rationale for the latest and novel treatment strategies.

### Renal histopathology associated with kidney failure and mortality in patients with lupus nephritis: a long-term real-world data study [^111uUY9P]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lupus nephritis (LN), a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, is associated with a higher risk of kidney failure and death. The renal pathology of LN helps elucidate the severity of inflammation and the extent of irreversible damage. We aimed to identify histologic variables that correlate with risks of kidney failure and mortality.

Methods

Between 2006 and 2019, a total of 526 patients with LN were enrolled. Renal pathology was classified according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classification. Components of activity and chronicity indices were analyzed to determine which variables correlated with an increased risk of kidney failure and death, with the adjustment of potential confounders.

Results

During the follow-up period (median 7.5, IQR 3.5–10.7 years), 58 patients progressed to kidney failure and 64 died. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, tubular atrophy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.28, 95% CI 1.66–3.14) and tubulointerstitial inflammation (HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.34–7.33) predicted kidney failure. The renal outcome was even worse if tubular atrophy and tubulointerstitial inflammation coexisted (10-year kidney survival rate: 63.22%). The presence of cellular crescents was associated with an increased risk of death in male patients with LN (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.02–3.57), whereas the presence of fibrous crescents predicted death in female patients with LN (HR 5.70, 95% CI 1.61–20.25).

Conclusion

Histologic variables of renal biopsy in LN could be regarded as prognostic indicators for kidney failure and mortality.

### A nomogram predicting the histologic activity of lupus nephritis from clinical parameters [^113e7uZ6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and serious complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most patients are diagnosed with LN within 5 years after diagnosis with SLE and ≈5–20% patients with LN progress to end-stage renal disease.

The ultimate therapeutic goal of LN is to preserve renal function as much as possible and a key factor in the management of LN is to accurately determine the degree of renal histological activity. The activity index (AI) and chronicity index (CI) of the histopathological features of LN were proposed by Austin et al. and modified by the International Society of Nephrology in 2018. It is recommended that the A, C and A/C parameters in class III/IV be substituted by the AI and CI and the use of these indices is not restricted to class III/IV but is applied to all classes. In 2021, AI and CI were listed in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical guidelines for the first time, and the guidelines pointed out that clinicians need to pay more attention to potentially reversible active lesions; however, the treatment strategies for the AI still need further research. Based on previous literature on disease progression and renal pathology, LN patients with an AI > 2 have an increasing risk of poor renal outcome and are predictive of LN relapse after withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppression.

The induction treatment for LN mostly depends on pathological classification, which is then switched to maintenance treatment when complete clinical remission is achieved. However, some studies have found that clinical remission, as evaluated by proteinuria and renal function, is not consistent with renal histological remission. Moreover, the changes and transformations in the histologic classification of LN over time have been observed in ≈40–76% of patients. There is no doubt that histopathological features are critical guidance for the management of LN, but it is an invasive procedure and its indications remain controversial. Clinicians have been using a holistic assessment of abnormal clinical manifestations and specific criteria and quantitative evaluation tools for repeat kidney biopsies have been lacking until now.

In this study we constructed a nomogram for the degree of histologic activity using a series of blood and urine tests results, which helps physicians objectively evaluate histologic activity, thereby helping to make clinical decisions about performing kidney biopsy early and in a timely manner while avoiding unnecessary renal biopsies.

Abstract

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent and severe manifestation of SLE. Along the decades, the epidemiology of LN and its clinical presentation have been changing. However, even though retrospective cohort studies report a decreased mortality rate and an improvement in the disease prognosis, the percentage of patients progressing into end stage renal disease (ESRD) keeps steady despite the improvements in therapeutic strategies. Current in-use medications have been available for decades now, yet over the years, regimens for optimizing their efficacy and minimizing toxicity have been developed. Therapeutic research is now moving towards the direction of precision medicine and several new drugs, targeting selectively different pathogenetic pathways, are currently under evaluation with promising results. In this review, we address the main changes and persistent unmet needs in LN management throughout the past decades, with a focus on prognosis and upcoming treatments.

### Transition to severe phenotype in systemic lupus erythematosus initially presenting with non-severe disease: implications for the management of early disease [^114jmemr]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with protean clinical manifestations and an unpredictable course. Although prognosis has significantly improved over the years due to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments, patients with SLE still demonstrate increased mortality and morbidity compared with the general population. Patients' phenotype at disease onset may vary from mild to severe or life-threatening, with striking differences among patients from different racial backgrounds. Lupus nephritis (LN) is more common in Hispanics and African–Americans, the latter also exhibiting an up to twofold increased risk of neuropsychiatric involvement, compared with Caucasians.

Several cohort studies around the world have documented the natural history and morbidity of the disease, contributing substantially to increased awareness. More recently, emphasis has been put on the patterns of disease activity and targets of therapy, with remission and low disease activity emerging as new frontiers. Moreover, management recommendations have attempted to decrease the heterogeneity in lupus care, by providing evidence-based and expert opinion-based guidance. However, among patients who present with a certain phenotype, there is a paucity of data regarding potential changes of severity over time, that is, whether the disease will remain mild throughout its course or progress to a more severe form. Such data may have clinical and therapeutic implications for early disease.

The aim of this study was to describe the severity patterns of a Caucasian SLE cohort in a tertiary SLE referral centre, based at 'Attikon' University Hospital, Athens, Greece. We explored possible baseline prognostic factors related to a 'transition in severity' as well as cumulative damage accrual over the course of the disease. Our data suggest that, despite significant advances in therapy, transition of disease occurs in a considerable proportion of patients.

### Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of lupus nephritis patients with acute kidney injury [^116HcY1s]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in lupus nephritis (LN) and a risk factor for chronic kidney failure. Here, we aimed to assess the characteristics and prognosis of LN patients with AKI.

Methods

AKI and AKI severity stages in LN patients were defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Long-term renal outcomes and patient mortality between different stages of AKI were compared by Cox regression analysis.

Results

Of 1272 LN patients, 225 (17.69%) had AKI and 72 (5.66%) were AKI stage 3. Compared with the non-AKI group, the proportion of male patients was significantly higher in the AKI group (p = 0.002). In addition, there were markedly higher proportions of hematologic system damage, more severe renal manifestations, and higher Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group. The active and chronic lesions in renal biopsy were significantly higher in LN patients with AKI than those without AKI. During a median follow-up of 53 months, Kaplan-Meier curve showed that LN patients with AKI stage 3 had significantly poorer long-term renal outcomes (p = 0.002) and patient survival (p < 0.001) than those without AKI. Furthermore, AKI stage 3, but not stage 1 or 2 was significantly associated with adverse renal outcomes (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–6.28, p = 0.048) and all-cause mortality (HR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.18–6.61, p = 0.019) in LN patients. In patients with AKI, increased baseline serum creatinine and severe glomerular sclerosis were independent risk factors for worse renal outcomes, while higher blood pressure, increased baseline serum creatinine, and anti-Sjogren's syndrome A positivity could indicate poor survival.

Discussion

LN patients with AKI stage 3, but not stages 1 and 2, have poorer long-term renal outcomes and patient survival. Our study demonstrates the importance of early identification and management of AKI in LN patients.

### Comparison of clinical features and outcomes between patients with early and delayed lupus nephritis [^113FA5Vs]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that lupus nephritis is associated with significantly higher mortality in SLE. When we evaluated factors associated with higher mortality, age was associated with increased risk of mortality, while higher hemoglobin level was associated with lower risk of mortality independently of traditional risk factors, such as of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Old age is closely linked to increased risk of mortality in the general population. However, the association with mortality in lupus nephritis is controversial. A previous study has demonstrated that age was a predictor of death in patients with lupus nephritis, while in a recent publication by Teh et al. age was not associated with the risk of mortality. These discrepant results between the studies may be related to the different ethnic groups included and the selection of variables for the analysis. On the other hand, anemia was also reported to be an independent factor related to mortality in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and malignancies. Although the direct association between anemia and higher mortality in lupus nephritis is unclear, it could be indirectly associated with higher inflammation in lupus nephritis based on the fact that hemoglobin level could decrease in association with inflammatory burden or as a consequence of impaired renal function. Overall, it could be suggested that age and hemoglobin level should be taken into account when predicting mortality among patients with lupus nephritis.

The main strengths of the present study were the large number of included patients with Asian ethnicity and pathologically confirmed lupus nephritis for the evaluation of outcomes. However, it also has several inherent limitations. First, patient data and adverse effects of glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive agents were investigated retrospectively by reviewing the medical records. Second, the follow-up period of the included patients was relatively short. Third, we were not able to precisely assess the effect of used immunosuppressive agents on the patient prognosis. Fourth, the application of 1997 revised ACR classification criteria, which possess lower sensitivity as compared to the 2012 SLE International Collaborating Clinics criteria and the 2019 European League Again Rheumatism/ACR criteria, could have resulted in selection or classification bias. Additional investigations are necessary to comparatively assess clinical outcomes of early and delayed lupus nephritis.

### Comparison of clinical features and outcomes between patients with early and delayed lupus nephritis [^114E4S5S]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lupus nephritis is associated with increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality. We evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of patients with early and delayed lupus nephritis.

Methods

The medical records of 171 patients who met the 1997 revised classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with pathologic confirmation of lupus nephritis were reviewed. Early lupus nephritis was defined when lupus nephritis was histopathologically confirmed as the first clinical manifestation of SLE, whereas delayed lupus nephritis was defined as lupus nephritis that was identified after the diagnosis of SLE. Clinical and laboratory data, as well as kidney histopathology and medication usage were investigated. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard analysis was performed to compare the outcomes of early and delayed lupus nephritis and evaluate factors associated with ESRD and all-cause mortality.

Results

Patients with early lupus nephritis had higher disease activity (median non-renal SLE disease activity index-2000, 6.0 vs. 4.0; p < 0.001) and more frequent skin rash, oral ulcer and serositis; however, the proportion of patients with higher renal chronicity index was greater in the delayed lupus nephritis group (p = 0.007). Nevertheless, no difference was found regarding ESRD and all-cause mortality between the groups. In Cox-proportional hazard analysis, C-reactive protein level, creatinine level and chronicity index were factors associated with ESRD, while age and haemoglobin level were associated with all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

In conclusion, clinical outcomes of early and delayed lupus nephritis are not significantly different. Rigorous adherence to current treatment recommendations is essential for the treatment of lupus nephritis.

### Lupus nephritis [^116r8Ssc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a form of glomerulonephritis that constitutes one of the most severe organ manifestations of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most patients with SLE who develop LN do so within 5 years of an SLE diagnosis and, in many cases, LN is the presenting manifestation resulting in the diagnosis of SLE. Understanding of the genetic and pathogenetic basis of LN has improved substantially over the past few decades. Treatment of LN usually involves immunosuppressive therapy, typically with mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide and with glucocorticoids, although these treatments are not uniformly effective. Despite increased knowledge of disease pathogenesis and improved treatment options, LN remains a substantial cause of morbidity and death among patients with SLE. Within 10 years of an initial SLE diagnosis, 5–20% of patients with LN develop end-stage kidney disease, and the multiple comorbidities associated with immunosuppressive treatment, including infections, osteoporosis and cardiovascular and reproductive effects, remain a concern. Clearly, early and accurate diagnosis of LN and prompt initiation of therapy are of vital importance to improve outcomes in patients with SLE.

### Risk factors for subsequent lupus nephritis in patients with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective cohort study [^112btcJH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic erythematous lupus (SLE) is characterised by a breach in self-tolerance and propagation of multiple autoantibodies, presenting with heterogeneous phenotypes and a wide range of organ involvement. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most threatening vital organ involvements in patients with SLE, and those with renal involvement have a higher morbidity and mortality rate than those without LN. The percentage of LN in SLE patients differs from race to race and tends to be higher in Asian patients with SLE than in Caucasians. For those without LN initially, the time from SLE diagnosis to LN detection was often within 2 years. Tracing back to previous studies, the definition of delayed-onset LN or late-onset LN varied from more than 1 to 5 years after SLE diagnosis, and several studies reported a poorer prognosis in those with delayed-onset LN than in those with LN at SLE diagnosis.

The prevalence of juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (jSLE) among Taiwanese patients is approximately 6.3 cases per 100,000. It is known that patients with jSLE are more prone to LN than those with adult-onset SLE (aSLE), and approximately 50% of patients with jSLE have renal involvement either at the time of SLE diagnosis (TD) or during their disease courses. According to a large British cohort that enrolled 232 patients with jSLE, even up to 80% of them developed LN within 5 years of follow-ups. Based on this idea, it is crucial to know the risk factors for subsequent LN in patients with jSLE. However, few studies have mentioned this issue in patients with jSLE.

In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with subsequent LN among patients with jSLE, as those with a higher risk of developing LN may benefit from more frequent follow-up that they can have early detection and treatment for LN.

Guideline scope and recent therapeutic developments — the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) last published LN clinical practice guidelines in 2012. Since then, belimumab and voclosporin have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LN treatment, prompting a conceptual shift from induction/initial and maintenance/subsequent therapy to one of combination, ongoing therapy targeting different arms of the immune system; the document also notes that these recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each individual patient.

### Lupus nephritis management guidelines compared [^115CVD4F]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

In the past years, many (randomized) trials have been performed comparing the treatment strategies for lupus nephritis. In 2012, these data were incorporated in six different guidelines for treating lupus nephritis. These guidelines are European, American and internationally based, with one separate guideline for children. They offer information on different aspects of the management of lupus nephritis including induction and maintenance treatment of the different histological classes, adjunctive treatment, monitoring of the patient, definitions of response and relapse, indications for (repeat) renal biopsy, and additional challenges such as the presence of vascular complications, the pregnant SLE patient, treatment in children and adolescents and considerations about end-stage renal disease and transplantation. In this review, we summarize the guidelines, determine the common ground between them, highlight the differences and discuss recent literature.

Importantly, time to response is likely to influence renal prognosis. Although some studies reported that proteinuria of 0.7–0.8g/day at 12 months was the individual best predictor of long-term renal outcome in LN, it was demonstrated that the optimal cut-off varied based on baseline proteinuria values. In the Hopkins Lupus Cohort, two composite remission scores including serum creatinine and proteinuria performed better in predicting renal survival than proteinuria alone. Similarly, in 550 LN patients, 12-month proteinuria and 12-month serum creatinine were able to predict the risk of developing CKD at three years.

Prognosis, survival and outcome trends in patients with LN: past and present

LN plays a major role in defining prognosis and survival of SLE patients. Data form the last 50 years highlight a substantial decrease in mortality rate with a concomitant increase in CKD- and ESRD-free survival at 10 and 20 years. Accordingly, the number of patients achieving a complete renal remission increased from 48.5% in 1970s to 58.5% in the mid-2010s. Prior to the introduction of GC, the 5-year survival rate of patients with LN was 44% but after their routine use in combination with immunosuppressants, it improved to 80% in the 1980s and to > 90% now. These results are mainly attributable to the concept of early diagnosis and the use of more effective and early treatments along with the increased knowledge in the management of complications (i.e. infections) and comorbidities.

Nevertheless, in the last 10 years trends stabilized both in terms of ESRD and survival rates. In a retrospective study of a cohort of 325 SLE patients followed in Oslo from 1999 to 2008, the incidence rate of ESRD was 2.3 per 1000 patient-years. The cohort presented an overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.1 but the SMR significantly differed between patients who did and did not develop LN (SMR 3.8 and 1.7, respectively). The highest estimates were noted in patients aged between 16 and 39 years (SMR 13.4) and with ESRD (SMR 5.4). These data confirm that LN is a major determinant in SLE prognosis and that once ESRD has established, the disease markedly worsens.

### Comparison of clinical features and outcomes between patients with early and delayed lupus nephritis [^116snb5M]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease characterized by multiple organ injury as a result of autoantibody formation. Lupus nephritis is one of the most serious systemic complication of SLE that affects up to 60–70% of patients with SLE during their lifetime. Lupus nephritis is classified into 6 different subtypes based on the pathologic findings, with class III and class IV (proliferative) lupus nephritis being the most aggressive form. The treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis consists of induction therapy, followed by maintenance therapy to achieve remission. However, the prognosis of patients with lupus nephritis remains unfavourable even when aggressive treatment strategies are implemented, mainly because of a significantly increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality. Accordingly, the treatment guidelines for SLE recommend prudent monitoring of patients for the development of lupus nephritis. In general, lupus nephritis primarily occurs at the time of or within the first year of SLE diagnosis. On the contrary, the frequency of lupus nephritis occurrence gradually decreases with time; the onset of lupus nephritis is reported to be uncommon after 5 years from SLE diagnosis.

Most patients with SLE are treated based on the organ involved, and immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine, are the most widely used drugs for the management of SLE. A considerable number of patients who had been diagnosed with SLE before lupus nephritis (delayed lupus nephritis), may have been exposed to glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressive drugs, while most patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis as the first complication of SLE (early lupus nephritis) may be glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive drug-naive. Therefore, it is theoretically assumed that the clinical features at the time of kidney biopsy and the prognosis may differ between early and delayed lupus nephritis proportionally to the interval between the diagnosis of SLE and lupus nephritis; however, the data from the literature regarding this subject are scarce. Therefore, the objectives of this study were 1) to compare the clinical features of early and delayed lupus nephritis at the time of kidney biopsy and its prognosis and 2) to investigate factors associated with ESRD and all-cause mortality during the follow-up period.

### Lupus nephritis [^1142w8Qo]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a subset of SLE with an onset before 18 years of age. Patients with early onset SLE tend to have a greater genetic component to their disease cause, more multisystemic involvement, and a more severe disease course, which includes greater risks for developing nephritis and end-stage kidney disease. Five- and 10-year mortality is lower than in adult-onset SLE. Although patient and renal survival have improved with advances in induction and maintenance immunosuppression, accumulation of irreversible damage is common. Cardiovascular and infectious complications are frequent, as are relapses during adolescence and the transition to adulthood.

### Update on lupus nephritis: core curriculum 2020 [^111bhm5f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease that commonly affects the kidneys. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common cause of kidney injury in systemic lupus erythematosus and a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of LN is heterogeneous. Genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this heterogeneity. Despite improved understanding of the pathogenesis of LN, treatment advances have been few and risk for kidney failure remains unacceptably high. This installment in the Core Curriculum of Nephrology provides an up-to-date review of the current understanding of LN epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. Challenging issues such as the management of LN in pregnancy, timing of transplantation, and the evolving role of corticosteroid use in the management of LN are discussed. We review the currently accepted approach to care for patients with LN and highlight deficiencies that need to be addressed to better preserve long-term kidney health and improve outcomes in LN.

### Lupus nephritis: challenges and progress [^1165MkLy]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of lupus nephritis remains unsatisfactory due to insufficiently effective treatment regimens and the dearth of reliable predictors of disease onset or progression to guide individualized therapeutic decisions. This review summarizes new findings related to lupus nephritis over the last 18 months and discusses clinical needs that should be considered to advance trials of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies.

Recent Findings

Collaborative teams are addressing how to improve disease definitions and are developing predictive models for disease onset, disease response and risk of flare in individual patients. More attention is being paid to clinical trial design. Advanced technologic approaches are allowing the analysis of small amounts of human tissue and urine in unprecedented detail so as to discover new pathogenic mechanisms and identify disease biomarkers. Novel therapies continue to be tested in disease models and include new strategies to protect renal tissue from cell damage and fibrosis.

Summary

The collaborative efforts of patients, clinical and translational researchers, the pharmaceutical industry and funding sources are needed to advance therapies for lupus nephritis. Specialized clinical centers can then deliver optimal and more personalized patient care that will improve patient outcomes.

### Renal involvement in autoimmune connective tissue diseases [^112BiLd9]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

SLE depicts a remarkable complex autoimmune disease with considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and disease course. Classification of SLE was last edited by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1997 (Table 2). Earlier diagnosis, more intensive treatment regimens and diverse alternative strategies and possibilities to treat co-morbidities have contributed to improvement of prognosis. Negative predictive factors with respect to survival include male gender, positive lupus anticoagulant, glomerulonephritis and "severe" onset of SLE. The incidence is much higher in young woman and the prevalence is two- to four-fold greater in non-Caucasian populations. Genetic, environmental and hormonal factors have been identified as possible risk factors for developing SLE.

Autoantibodies are directed against various nuclear antigens, in particular against chromatin components, such as nucleosomes, histones, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNA) and ribonucleoproteins. Recently, it was suggested that the nucleosome might be the driving autoantigen in SLE. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that glomerular deposition of anti-dsDNA antibodies in lupus nephritis is mediated by nucleosomes. The kidneys are a major source of autoantibody-producing plasma cells in lupus nephritis and these differentiated plasma cells are frequently observed in patients with severe renal involvement (mainly classes III through V), potentially acting in amplifying the renal disease course. Additional autoantibodies include anti-Smith (Sm) antibodies with a high specificity for SLE, while SSA and SSB are present in other CTDs as well. Complement levels are frequently reduced in patients with active disease. Genetic complete complement deficiencies can resemble a SLE-like disease. Levels of complement C3 and C4 correlate with the overall disease activity. Patients with active lupus nephritis had significantly lower levels of C3 and C4 compared to patients with inactive lupus nephritis. Serum C3 has generally higher sensitivity than serum C4, but both tests have only modest specificity for active lupus nephritis. Assessment of the relationship between serum levels of C3 or C4 and renal flares revealed that C4 is critical for initiating a renal flare, while C3 activation is involved in the actual tissue damage. Antibodies directed against C1q were detected in all patients with active nephritis in a large cohort. Moreover, anti-C1q antibodies showed the strongest association with proteinuria among potential biomarkers and were significantly correlated with Renal Activity Score. However, contradictory to these reports, in a cohort of 126 patients, anti-C1q antibodies were not significantly associated with active lupus nephritis.

### Recent progress in the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis [^115D92ck]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The recent decades have witnessed significant progress in the treatment of lupus nephritis. Existing immunosuppressive regimens have been refined to enhance efficacy and reduce adverse effects, resulting in improvements in renal and patient survival and patients' quality of life. This review focuses on the new treatments that have emerged over the past 2 decades. The data and methodology of important clinical trials are discussed to highlight the important findings and their limitations. The role of mycophenolate mofetil as induction or maintenance immunosuppressive treatment is discussed in detail. Racial variations in prognosis and treatment response are evident. With increasing treatment options and better appreciation of patient characteristics that impact on response and tolerance, the management of lupus nephritis has become more individualized. The choice and the dosing regimen of immunosuppressive agents should take into account factors such as race, type of lupus nephritis, disease severity, renal reserve, and prior disease course, to aim for an optimal balance of benefit and risk.

### Prediction of prognosis and renal outcome in lupus nephritis [^114FEMZt]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

To summarise, the management of LN has improved during the last decades, but the imperative need for consensual outcome measures remains. In order to design trials with success potentiality, it is important to define clinically important short-term and long-term targets of therapeutic and non-therapeutic intervention. Ideally, an international task force comprising rheumatologists, nephrologists and patient advocates will soon be formed to serve this aim. The information gleaned from kidney biopsies at active renal disease and after completion of treatment may provide important insights in this direction. Moreover, novel insights of SLE and LN pathogenesis as well as insights obtained from genetic studies, transcriptomics and proteomics will have to be incorporated.

Hopefully, we will soon identify clinical, molecular or genetic markers, or combinations thereof, which reliably reflect renal histopathology and portend the long-term renal outcome. Novel non-invasive imaging methods and employment of the evolving artificial intelligence in pattern recognition may also be helpful towards these goals. Undoubtedly, the molecular and cellular characterisation of SLE and LN will result in novel therapeutic modalities, maybe new taxonomy perspectives, and ultimately personalised management of the patients.

2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) lupus nephritis guideline — scope, methods, and key treatment principles: The objective is to provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis. The Core Team developed clinical questions using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome); systematic literature reviews were completed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used, with the Voting Panel achieving a consensus ≥ 70% on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. The guideline presents 28 graded recommendations (7 strong, 21 conditional) and 13 ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the screening and management of lupus nephritis. Recommendations emphasize the unifying principle that lupus nephritis therapy is continuous and ongoing, rather than consisting of discrete induction/initial and maintenance/subsequent therapies, and specify that therapy should include pulse glucocorticoids followed by oral glucocorticoid taper and two additional immunosuppressive agents for 3–5 years for those achieving complete renal response.

### Prediction of prognosis and renal outcome in lupus nephritis [^114chtLQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most severe complications in SLE, affecting 35%–60% of the patients depending on ethnicity, sex and age of disease onset among other factors. Genetic and nephron cargo, SLE disease course and kidney toxicity, for example, drug-induced toxicity, contribute to long-term impairment of the renal function. Importantly, LN flares constitute a major cause of nephron loss, cumulatively contributing to renal function deterioration.

Current therapies for LN are not sufficiently efficacious in inducing remission or preventing new flares and not all patients show adequate treatment responses. In fact, fewer than 30% achieve complete remission within 6 months of therapy. Despite decelerating rates over the last decades, up to 20% of patients who have been afflicted by LN will ultimately develop end-stage kidney disease within the first decade of their disease course. For this reason, prediction of the long-term renal outcome at early stages of the disease is of vital importance. Thus, several studies have sought to identify early clinical features, laboratory tests and molecular mechanisms that are associated with unfavourable renal prognosis, in order to optimise the surveillance and interventions in these patients.

The targets of management of patients with LN can be divided into short-term (prevention of flares) and long-term targets (prevention of renal function impairment). Current research in the field focuses on identification of clinical, histological and molecular markers of activity, damage, treatment response and renal prognosis.

### The lupus nephritis classification: lost in translation [^117PG2MK]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The ISN/RPS lupus nephritis classification is in the process of undergoing a revision. It has lost its way and morphed from a classification based on pathophysiology of disease into a staging system based on the extent of spread and prognosis.

Recent Findings

There are multiple different pathophysiologic processes that contribute to lupus nephritis. The current classification is inadequate, as it does not highlight these differences and thus squanders the opportunity to develop targeted therapies. Its focus is on the extent of disease as opposed to the pattern of injury, which defines the disease. To delineate the cause, we must include immunofluorescent and electron microscopy, which will help define the pattern of injury.

Summary

To determine eventual targeted treatments for lupus nephritis, we must first classify the disease according to the available pathophysiologic mechanisms. In the upcoming revision, including the immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and eliminating the overemphasis on extent of disease are the first steps to categorizing the lupus nephritis classes accurately.

### Glomerulonephritis [^111tFKsq]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses several disorders that cause glomerular inflammation and injury through an interplay of immune-mediated mechanisms, host characteristics, and environmental triggers, such as infections. GN can manifest solely in the kidney or in the setting of a systemic illness, and presentation can range from chronic and relatively asymptomatic hematuria to fulminant renal failure. Classic acute GN is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension, the latter 2 of which are the consequence of sodium and water retention in the setting of renal impairment. Although presenting signs and symptoms and a compatible clinical history can suggest GN, serologic and urinary testing can further refine the differential diagnosis, and renal biopsy can be used for definitive diagnosis. Treatment of GN can include supportive care, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, immunomodulatory therapy, and renal transplant. Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying cause of GN and can vary from a self-limited course to chronic kidney disease. This review focuses on lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and postinfectious GN.

Lupus nephritis (LN) guiding principles — The goals of LN treatment are to preserve kidney function, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with chronic kidney disease, and minimize medication-related toxicities. Collaborative care from rheumatology and nephrology should be offered to people with LN whenever possible. Shared decision-making between clinicians and patients is essential as it respects patient values and preferences, leading to better adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities may impact outcomes in people with LN; equitable implementation of treatment recommendations aims to improve outcomes and alleviate health disparities. Pediatric and geriatric good practice statements are included when applicable.

Demographics and genetics

Age, sex and race/ethnicity

Age at disease onset has a significant impact on both disease presentation and prognosis. Juvenile-onset SLE patients have more frequently severe clinical manifestations such as lupus nephritis (LN) or serositis and a higher risk of flares, organ damage and treatment side effects and higher mortality rates compared with adult SLE patients. Late-onset disease (onset at age ≥ 50 years) is described in 3–18% of SLE patients with more insidious clinical presentation, but often with worse outcomes and higher mortality rates than adult- and juvenile-onset SLE, due to the increased comorbidity burden. SLE is a sexually dimorphic autoimmune disorder, with female predominance in both paediatric and adult populations, but usually with more severe disease presentation and worse outcomes among male patients.

Regarding race/ethnicity, non-white (Black, Hispanics and Asian) patients with SLE tend to develop more severe clinical phenotypes and more damage accrual than whites, explained by increased genetic risk burden in the former populations. Socio-economic factors may confound the above associations, however, after adjustment for these factors, race/ethnicity remains a major determinant of poor outcomes in SLE, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) risk and mortality. In a recent population-based study using U.S. nationwide death certificates between 2000 and 2015, SLE was among the leading causes of death in young women, especially among those ages 15–24 years and those of African American and Hispanic origin. Increased awareness of the above high-risk populations can help to improve long-term outcomes in SLE.

Genetic risk profile

An interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors is involved in SLE pathogenesis and disease presentation. The role of genetic profiling to predict disease outcomes has been investigated in several chronic diseases. Some studies have shown an association between variants of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 and renal impairment, cardiovascular events and organ damage in SLE. A few studies have also examined the relationship between the cumulative genetic risk score (defined as the weighted sum of the number of high-risk alleles) and lupus phenotypes. A recent large study of 1001 SLE patients has shown an association between a high genetic risk score and severe disease presentation and outcomes involving earlier disease onset, increased risk of first organ damage, cardiovascular events, ESRD and all-cause mortality, introducing the genetic risk score as a potential tool for prediction of disease severity and organ damage. The above findings emphasize a potential role of genetic profiling, and the genetic risk score of single genes, for predicting clinical phenotypes and outcomes in this complex disease.

### Lupus nephritis: is the kidney biopsy currently necessary in the management of lupus nephritis? [^1179DVUy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Most patients with SLE develop kidney disease related to this systemic underlying disease process. Lupus nephritis is an important cause of morbidity and even mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus nephritis has diverse morphologic manifestations with varying clinical presentations and consequences. The pathogeneses involve immune complexes, which can deposit anywhere in the kidney, and other mechanisms, including endothelial injury, podocytopathy, and tubulointerstitial injury. Treatment and prognosis accordingly range from excellent even with only observation with minimal mesangial deposits, to kidney failure despite aggressive immunosuppression in patients with severe proliferative disease. Renal biopsy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of the specific form of lupus nephritis in any patient. However, the role of the renal biopsy in prediction of outcome, treatment, and prognosis has been controversial. We will review the current classification of lupus nephritis and the value of renal biopsy in the management of these patients.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disorder characterized by the involvement of multiple organs. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage within the affected organs. It affects the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. The degree or severity of the complications mainly depends on the area affected ranging from skin to various internal organs with a variety of symptoms. Lupus nephritis (LN) denotes a common and severe manifestation of SLE and could be a major factor exerting a negative impact on long-term renal and patient survival. Renal involvement occurs in up to 60% of adult patients with SLE and is a major determinant for morbidity and mortality in these patients. Renal involvement in SLE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, which is related to both disease and treatment-related complications. SLE is a potentially severe autoimmune disorder that shows variations in incidence, prevalence, disease activity and prognosis according to race and ethnicity. LN appears to be more prevalent in certain ethnic groups such as Asians, African Americans and Hispanics.

As evidence showed that the onset of SLE and lupus flares may trigger by certain environment factors. Among these identifying the environmental risk factors associated with SLE is exposure to ultraviolet radiation, certain medication and hormonal preparations that may result in induce inflammatory response, damage cells and appear clinical symptoms by activating the innate and adaptive immune system.

Photosensitivity is well known characteristic in both cutaneous and SLE and has been observed in more than 90% of lupus erythematosus patients following ultraviolet radiation. But, sun-induced organ involvement is rarely reported in lupus erythematosus. It's believed that sunburn-induced keratinocyte necrosis/apoptosis exposed intracellular antigens as trigger for the generation of autoantibodies that finally mediated immune-complex nephritis.

In Africa, an increase in the incidence and prevalence of SLE has been observed currently. Few studies indicate that this high frequency in the African population may be related to the high sun-exposure.

Kidney involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus - lupus nephritis (LN) - is one of the most important and common clinical manifestations of this disease and occurs in 40–60% of patients. Current treatment regimens achieve a complete kidney response in only a minority of affected individuals, and 10–15% of patients with LN develop kidney failure, with its attendant morbidity and considerable prognostic implications. Moreover, the medications most often used to treat LN - corticosteroids in combination with immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs - are associated with substantial side effects. Advances in proteomics, flow cytometry and RNA sequencing have led to important new insights into immune cells, molecules and mechanistic pathways that are instrumental in the pathogenesis of LN. These insights, together with a renewed focus on the study of human LN kidney tissue, suggest new therapeutic targets that are already being tested in lupus animal models and early-phase clinical trials and, as such, are hoped to eventually lead to meaningful improvements in the care of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus-associated kidney disease.

International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 classification of lupus nephritis and 2018 revision

The last published classification of LN (Table 1) aimed at standardizing definitions and reducing interobserver variability. Six histological classes are defined by specific microscopic lesions and distribution of immune complexes (IC). Class I LN (Minimal mesangial) has a prevalence of 1% in adults and 2.3% in children and represents < 20% of all cases of nephrotic syndrome that undergo renal biopsy. Class II LN (Mesangial proliferative) accounts for 7–22% of all cases and it generally presents with isolated haematuria, low-grade proteinuria and normal renal function. It is considered mild but it is associated with the risk of further progression to focal or diffuse LN, with a cumulative incidence rate between 14.8% and 47.4%. Class III and IV LN (Focal and Diffuse LN) bear the most severe prognosis and require prompt immunosuppressive treatment. A metanalysis evaluating the prevalence of biopsy-proven LN identified class IV as the most prevalent and the one associated with the highest risk of progression to ESRD. A total of 15–30% of patents with class IV do not reach remission and 15–30% of those reaching remission will develop a relapse. Class V (Membranous) is characterized by IC deposits, occurring mostly in the subepithelium, and frequent podocyte loss. Pure Class V clinically presents with nephrotic or non-nephrotic proteinuria and normal or only slightly elevated serum creatinine and can be often found in association with proliferative forms. It carries a relatively low rate of progression to ESRD but it is accompanied by a high rate of complications secondary to the nephrotic syndrome such as hypoalbuminemia, thrombophilia, hyperlipidemia and infections. Class VI (Advanced sclerosing) is defined by90% of sclerotic glomeruli, often resulting in impaired renal function and variable amount of proteinuria.

It adds, "While we recommend prompt kidney biopsy with treatment based on histology, biopsy may not always be possible". When biopsy is not feasible, "In the absence of a kidney biopsy, those with nephritic features (eg, hematuria, hypertension, impaired kidney function) are usually best treated according to Class III/IV recommendations, and those with nephrotic features (eg, proteinuria, ≥ 3.5 g/g, hypoalbuminemia) according to Class V recommendations". It also notes, "Patient representatives shared concerns about the invasive nature of biopsy and emphasized the importance of physicians discussing the procedure's benefits and risks".

Class III/IV (± V) lupus nephritis — active, newly diagnosed or flare — uses hydroxychloroquine plus renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and triple therapy including mycophenolic acid analogs, with treatment option selection by risk factors: "Risk factors: Extra-renal manifestations and/or eGFR ≤ 45" → "Belimumab"; "No specific risk factors present Incorporate patient preferences" → "Calcineurin inhibitor OR Belimumab"; and "Risk factors: Proteinuria > 3g/d" with "Requires: eGFR > 45 and BP < 165/105" → "Calcineurin inhibitor". Response is assessed at "At least PRR in 6–12 months"; if yes, the pathway sets "Goal GC dose ≤ 5 mg/day by 6 mo". and "If CRR is achieved, continue therapy for 3–5 years" while "If PRR after 12 months, individualize therapy"; if no, "Assess adherence" and "Switch to alternate triple therapy that may include anti-CD20 agents". After switching, "At least PRR to 2nd course of therapy in 6–12 months" is reassessed; if not achieved, actions include "Assess adherence", "Consider repeat kidney biopsy to rule out other diagnoses or advanced chronicity", and "Consider anti-CD20‡, combination therapy with MPAA, belimumab and CNI, or referral to investigational therapy". A footnote states that "Treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk for potentially irreversible damage".

Lupus nephritis epidemiology and disparities — systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is described as a multi-system autoimmune disease with a prevalence of 72/100,000 persons in the United States. LN occurs in up to half of SLE patients and carries a mortality rate up to 30% at 10 years; 10–22% of people with LN will develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). African, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian ancestry increase the likelihood of LN and ESKD, and socially disadvantaged individuals in medically underserved areas have worse kidney outcomes.

### How have the clinical, laboratory, treatment features and outcomes in children with lupus nephritis progressed over the last 30 years? [^1113RCHH]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Proliferative LN, including class III and class IV, has the most aggressive course and the poorest kidney outcome compared with non-proliferative LN. In children with LN, the rates of proliferative LN are as high as 70–90%. In our cohort, 64% of the paediatric-onset SLE patients had proliferative LN, and there was no difference between the two time periods. Risk factors for the severity and outcome of LN were described as ethnicity, histopathological classification, male gender, hypertension, high disease activity, decreased kidney function at baseline, treatment response and disease relapse. Recently, Park et al. described male gender and failure to disease remission achievement in the first year of the treatment as the predictors of CKD, while Qiu et al. reported hypertension, nervous system involvement, non-compliance to the treatments, and lower GFR level at disease-onset were independent risk factors for poor disease outcome of paediatric-onset LN. Improvements in the prognosis of paediatric LN patients with effective suppression of active disease and good medication adherence during long follow-up periods were reported from large paediatric cohorts. In our study, higher disease activity and proteinuria levels at baseline were predictors of ESKD. Qiu et al. reported a 5-year ESKD-free rate of 97% in 220 paediatric LN patients followed up between 2012 and 2018. Singh et al. described that renal survival was 96%, 89% and 78% at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively, on paediatric LN patients followed up between 1991 and 2013. In our study, 10-year ESKD-free survival was 79% in group 1 and 96% in group 2. As expected, we also showed that ESKD and death were lower, and complete kidney remission was higher in group 2 compared with group 1, probably due to better management and newly developed treatments. Disease activity scores are important to decide the intensity of immunosuppressive treatment in paediatric rheumatic diseases, and we think that paediatric-onset LN who have higher disease activity at the baseline should be treated intensively to suppress disease activity earlier and prevent damage to vital organs. Treatment plans in paediatric-onset SLE are mainly based on adult trials due to the lack of randomized controlled trials in children. Treatment of class III-IV LN consists of induction and maintenance periods. In induction therapy, corticosteroids are the main treatment option, and mostly pulse corticosteroid treatment is prescribed at a dose of 15–30 mg/kg/day (max 1 g/day) for 3–5 days, followed by 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisolone (max 60 mg/day) with a gradual tapering. In the treatment of proliferative LN corticosteroids and cDMARDs are commonly used, despite their significant side effects. Many studies demonstrated no differences between CYC and MMF treatment in induction therapy in the childhood proliferative LN. All patients with paediatric-onset SLE should be prescribed HCQ. RTX is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits B cell development due to binding CD20 antigen and has recently been used as an effective treatment option during induction and/or maintenance period in patients with organ-threatening manifestations or in treatment-resistant cases. Recently, Chan et al. described the utility of RTX treatment on paediatric-onset LN patients who had life-threatening and/or did not respond to standard immunosuppressive treatments. Plasmapheresis is an invasive treatment procedure through removing immune complexes from circulation in the presence of life-threatening organ involvement in paediatric-onset SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome or vasculitis. We performed plasmapheresis in the second period in patients with LN because these patients also had severe life-threatening SLE-related organ involvement, such as concomitant neuropsychiatric involvement, alveolar haemorrhage, or thrombotic microangiopathy. Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody against soluble B lymphocyte stimulator and was successfully used in paediatric-onset SLE case series to decrease disease activity and also help tapering corticosteroids. However, we did not use belimumab treatment in our patients because it is not yet approved in paediatric-onset SLE in our country. Both RTX and belimumab succeeded in reducing daily corticosteroid dosage and provided better disease control with an acceptable safety profile in paediatric-onset SLE. Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, should be given to patients who have proteinuria and/or hypertension.

### A nomogram predicting the histologic activity of lupus nephritis from clinical parameters [^116pE6rL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Multivariate regression analysis suggested that MAP, eGFR, C3, URBC and anti-dsDNA were independent risk factors for histologic activity in LN. The anti-dsDNA titre is more suitable as a continuous variable than a dichotomous variable for developing a prediction model. But in this retrospective cohort, specific values of anti-dsDNA titres from the hospitals involved were not available before 2020. It has been reported that up to 74% of patients with SLE have elevated arterial blood pressure (BP) and are at a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events, and hypertension is one of the major risk factors for poor renal prognosis in LN. BP fluctuates considerably in patients with LN, primarily because of systemic inflammation, glucocorticoids and renal involvement. The pathophysiology of hypertension in LN includes an impaired BP–natriuresis relationship due to renal vasoconstriction, alterations in the function of renal tubular and vascular endothelial cells and activation of the renin–angiotensin system. The incidence of hypertension increases the severity of renal histologic activity and the loss of renal function. Considering the numerous factors influencing BP and its complex pathophysiological mechanisms, persistent exposure to hypertension (standard measurement) is more reliable than a single BP.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with and without lupus nephritis [^117JUXDz]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has significant clinical and therapeutic implications. This study assesses CKD prevalence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with and without lupus nephritis (LN).

Methods

This single-center, retrospective medical records review study (2014–2023) included adult SLE patients. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/24h in at least two consecutive tests, spaced ≥ 3 months apart. Statistical analyses included chi-squared tests, t-tests, multivariable regression, and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

175 SLE patients were included with a mean follow-up of 18.3 ± 14.7 years; 12 required kidney replacement therapy. CKD was diagnosed in 54.6% (89/163) of patients, including 15.7% with reduced eGFR only, 52.8% with albuminuria only, and 31.5% with both. LN was associated with a higher hazard ratio (HR = 5.4) for CKD. Nevertheless, 46.1% of CKD patients had no history of LN. CKD was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity, hospitalization rates for SLE exacerbations and infections. Cox analyses identified LN as the strongest predictor of CKD; other predictors were age and lower eGFR at diagnosis. CKD was an important predictor of mortality among patients with lupus, both in univariate and multivariable analyses (19.1% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

CKD is highly prevalent in SLE, including in patients without prior LN. CKD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study emphasizes the clinical relevance of CKD diagnosis and management in SLE patients.

### Long-term outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus: trends over time and major contributors [^115pHxF5]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis

Renal involvement in SLE has been associated with an increased risk of ESRD and a 5- to 8-fold increased risk of death compared with the general population. Several baseline characteristics have been associated with long-term prognosis in LN patients, including male gender, ethnicity, arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency and high activity and chronicity index scores. Use of the histological classification for LN management and prognosis, better understanding of the pathogenetic basis of LN and advances in immunosuppressive treatments have been largely responsible for the substantial improvement of renal survival in SLE over the past 5 decades. However, LN remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with SLE. A systematic literature review and Bayesian meta-analysis showed that ESRD risks in LN improved gradually between the 1970s and the mid-1990s but then plateaued, with a slight increase in the late 2000s. In addition, despite absolute decreases of 10% in 10 year and 15 year ESRD risks in developed countries, the 15 year risk during the 2000s was still high (22% of patients overall), especially in class IV LN (44% of patients) and in developing vs developed countries.

A recent multicentre study from Italy including 499 LN patients showed much lower ESRD risk rates in all examined time periods that corresponded to the time of LN diagnosis (1970–1985, 1986–2001 and 2002–2016). This may be explained by the predominant Caucasian population, but also by the homogeneous renal biopsies and treatments used in these centres vs the heterogeneity in the protocols and access to care among the studies from developed and developing countries included in the meta-analysis. Prompt recognition of renal involvement and early renal biopsy is essential for earlier diagnosis and a histological-based therapeutic approach and prognosis assessment. In addition, HCQ use, adjunctive treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme or angiotensin receptor inhibitors based on their antiproteinuric effect, thrombosis prevention in nephrotic syndrome and a regular assessment of renal involvement signs for prompt diagnosis of flares are also protective against damage accrual.

Risk stratification based on clinical, histological, urine and/or serum biomarkers or genetic profiles can help to identify groups at high risk and optimize prevention strategies and individualization of treatment. In addition, given the failure of several previous LN trials to fulfil their primary endpoints, a long discussion among experts supports the need for re-evaluation of treatment response tools and primary outcomes as well as patient selection according to clinical phenotypes and biologic markers.

### Response to therapy at 6 months predicts long-term renal outcome in lupus nephritis with poor kidney function [^116U2Gi8]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most common organ-threatening manifestations of SLE and resulted to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increased morbidity. With the induction therapy of corticosteroid (CS) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as first-line treatment, the renal prognosis of LN improved significantly in the past 50 years. Despite the introduction of new therapies in the last 20 years, the proportion of patients progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has not decreased, which is reported to be 10%–30% within 15 years. Accordingly, it is critical to save patients with LN at high risk of renal deterioration to improve overall prognosis. According to previous studies, baseline serum creatinine or renal function has been a traditional stratifying factor for renal prognosis, and so patients with poor baseline renal function are among the above-mentioned high-risk groups.

However, the characteristics of patients with active LN with poor renal function were largely unknown. Most of clinical trials in the past decade failed to include those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 or 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Published data from a post hoc subgroup analysis study included 32 patients (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) from the ALMS trial, showing treatment response in 6 patients (18.8%) and serious adverse events (AEs) in 16 patients (50%) within 24 weeks. But these results were limited by the small sample size and post hoc design. Moreover, a recent retrospective cohort showed that 62% of the LN-related advanced CKD did not progress over 10 years of follow-up, especially in those without active serology. Satisfying management of LN activity might benefit these patients. However, the long-term renal prognosis of these patients is still unclear due to the lack of relevant studies on treatment.
