## Question

Liver cyst follow up recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about follow-up recommendations for liver cysts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the cyst type and distinguishing simple from complex features. Then, I should verify the management approach for asymptomatic simple cysts, including whether surveillance is needed. Next, I will examine what to do when ultrasound shows atypical or complex features. After that, I need to check the approach for symptomatic simple cysts and the role of aspiration sclerotherapy versus surgery. I will then consider polycystic liver disease, hydatid disease, and mucinous cystic neoplasm, including their surveillance and treatment nuances. Finally, I should review post-procedural follow-up and synthesize a concise, practical algorithm with caveats and exceptions, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational step: classify the cyst and its imaging features, because everything downstream depends on this distinction. Simple hepatic cysts are thin-walled, fluid-filled, and typically show no internal septations, mural nodules, calcifications, or daughter cysts, whereas complex cysts demonstrate septations, mural thickening or nodularity, calcifications, heterogeneity, or daughter cysts, which raise concern for entities like hydatid disease or mucinous cystic neoplasm and warrant cross-sectional imaging rather than ultrasound alone [^112rSYjJ] [^115sKe7R] [^115V3ByZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance for simple cysts; I should verify guideline consensus. Both EASL 2022 and ACG 2024 recommend expectant management without routine surveillance for asymptomatic simple hepatic cysts, regardless of size, because malignant transformation is not a recognized risk and the natural history is indolent, so no follow-up imaging is advised in this scenario [^116dERrb] [^112oftaR] [^112rSYjJ] [^111nS37B] [^112bLhrR].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line imaging modality when a cyst is suspected. Ultrasound is the recommended initial test for characterizing hepatic cysts given its high sensitivity and specificity for simple cysts, and it is also the first modality to use if symptoms develop in a patient previously diagnosed with simple cysts, reserving CT or MRI for equivocal or complex cases [^113XLYSd] [^113uE9dt].

> I need to ensure I address the "size threshold" question explicitly. Initially, I thought larger cysts might mandate surveillance, but hold on, I should double-check. Guidelines are clear that even large asymptomatic simple cysts do not require surveillance, so size alone does not change follow-up recommendations in the absence of symptoms or atypical features [^112rSYjJ] [^111nS37B].

> Next, I should review what to do when ultrasound reveals atypical or complex features. If there are septations, mural thickening or nodularity, calcifications, heterogeneity, or daughter cysts, I should confirm that CT or MRI is recommended to further characterize the lesion and guide management, because these features increase the likelihood of non-simple pathology such as hydatid disease or mucinous cystic neoplasm [^112rSYjJ] [^115b6Het] [^115sKe7R].

> Let me consider symptomatic simple cysts now. For patients with pain, fullness, early satiety, or compressive symptoms attributable to a simple cyst, I should confirm that aspiration with sclerotherapy or surgical fenestration are acceptable options, with sclerotherapy often favored for solitary dominant cysts and fenestration for multiple or surgically accessible lesions. Both approaches have good symptomatic outcomes in appropriately selected patients [^112rSYjJ] [^111nS37B] [^116Qmcpb] [^116sVhpk] [^115UXd5S].

> But wait, what about post-procedural surveillance after sclerotherapy or fenestration; do we need routine imaging? I should verify this carefully. EASL advises against routine follow-up imaging after aspiration sclerotherapy or surgical procedures for hepatic cysts, so once treated and asymptomatic, no scheduled surveillance is recommended, though clinical follow-up for symptom recurrence is reasonable [^116qhUFx] [^112v67YV].

> Now, I will examine polycystic liver disease, and I need to ensure I separate screening from surveillance. In asymptomatic PCLD, routine imaging surveillance is not recommended; however, I should confirm that treatment decisions are symptom-driven and that somatostatin analogs like lanreotide can reduce liver volume and improve quality of life in selected patients, with liver transplantation considered for refractory, complicated disease; also, exogenous estrogen should be discontinued when feasible due to volume-promoting effects [^111YhwS6] [^112hzPN4] [^113yMxiX] [^116oo1Ex].

> Hold on, I should verify the ADPKD linkage. Patients with ADPKD should be screened for hepatic cysts with ultrasound, but routine surveillance is not advised in asymptomatic individuals. Management of liver cysts in ADPKD follows the same symptom-based principles as PCLD, with hepatology referral for complications [^1142aVYg] [^111YhwS6].

> I will now examine hydatid cysts, because the follow-up paradigm differs. For uncomplicated hydatid cysts, medical therapy with albendazole precedes any puncture or surgery to reduce recurrence risk; PAIR is a reasonable alternative when surgery is not feasible, and after successful treatment, follow-up with ultrasound for at least five years is recommended to confirm inactivity, whereas serology is not reliable for surveillance [^112xLiuG] [^111BsrLB] [^111J3BV6] [^1139VRnD].

> Let me think about mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver, since this changes surveillance entirely. MCN-L has malignant potential and requires complete surgical resection when feasible. For nonoperative candidates, surveillance imaging is advised even though an optimal interval is not defined, and changes suggesting malignant degeneration should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board. Importantly, aspiration or biopsy to distinguish MCN-L from a simple cyst is discouraged due to low sensitivity [^116ybvZF] [^113kbzHE].

> Next, I should review special contexts that can alter follow-up. In patients with cyst hemorrhage, temporary interruption of anticoagulation is recommended with resumption after 7–15 days. In pediatrics, most antenatally detected simple hepatic cysts regress or resolve and can be observed with serial ultrasound, reserving intervention for large, rapidly growing, or diagnostically uncertain lesions. And for choledochal cysts, long-term surveillance is warranted after resection due to malignancy risk, with management tailored to cyst type [^112k1FMK] [^1157TEbM] [^1147BAcm] [^114Zn6VM] [^111gN2nX].

> I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with the evidence. The practical algorithm is: classify the cyst on ultrasound; if a simple cyst is asymptomatic, no surveillance; if a simple cyst becomes symptomatic, treat with aspiration sclerotherapy or fenestration without routine post-procedural imaging; if ultrasound shows complex features, obtain CT or MRI to define pathology and guide therapy; for PCLD, avoid routine surveillance and treat based on symptoms; for hydatid disease, use medical therapy and consider PAIR or surgery with at least five years of ultrasound follow-up; for MCN-L, pursue resection when possible and consider surveillance if unresectable, all consistent with contemporary guidelines [^112rSYjJ] [^116dERrb] [^116qhUFx] [^111J3BV6] [^116ybvZF].

For liver cysts, **no routine follow-up is needed for asymptomatic simple cysts** [^116dERrb] [^112rSYjJ], as they are benign and require no surveillance [^112oftaR]. For symptomatic or complex cysts, **use ultrasound as first-line imaging** [^113XLYSd] [^113uE9dt]; if ultrasound shows atypical features, obtain CT or MRI [^112rSYjJ] [^115b6Het] and consider multidisciplinary review [^116wv33d]. After intervention (aspiration, sclerotherapy, or surgery), **no routine imaging is required** [^116qhUFx] unless symptoms recur [^112v67YV]. For polycystic liver disease, follow-up is symptom-driven [^111YhwS6] and may include periodic ultrasound or MRI; consider somatostatin analogs for symptomatic patients [^112hzPN4] [^111n13sc]. Hydatid cysts require at least 5 years of ultrasound follow-up after treatment [^111J3BV6] to confirm inactivity [^111J3BV6].

## Simple hepatic cysts

### Asymptomatic simple cysts

- **No routine follow-up**: Asymptomatic simple cysts do not require routine surveillance or intervention, regardless of size [^116dERrb] [^112rSYjJ] [^112oftaR].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients that simple cysts are benign and typically stable, requiring no further follow-up unless symptoms develop [^112bLhrR] [^113uE9dt].

---

### Symptomatic simple cysts

- **Ultrasound first-line**: Use ultrasound to confirm diagnosis and assess cyst characteristics [^113XLYSd] [^113uE9dt].
- **Intervention if symptomatic**: Consider aspiration with sclerotherapy or surgical fenestration for symptomatic cysts [^112rSYjJ] [^116Qmcpb] [^111nS37B].
- **No routine post-intervention follow-up**: Routine imaging after successful intervention is not required unless symptoms recur [^116qhUFx] [^112v67YV].

---

## Complex hepatic cysts

Complex cysts (septations, calcifications, mural nodules, or heterogeneous content) require **further evaluation** [^115sKe7R]:

- **CT or MRI**: Obtain CT or MRI to characterize complex features and guide management [^112rSYjJ] [^115b6Het].
- **Multidisciplinary review**: Discuss at a multidisciplinary tumor board for cysts with neoplastic potential [^116wv33d] [^1174eamr].
- **Surveillance**: Consider interval imaging (6–12 months) for indeterminate complex cysts [^116wv33d] [^1174eamr].

---

## Polycystic liver disease (PLD)

PLD management is **symptom-driven**, with follow-up tailored to severity and complications:

- **Symptom-driven follow-up**: Monitor with periodic ultrasound or MRI based on symptoms and complications [^notfound].
- **Medical therapy**: Consider somatostatin analogs (e.g. lanreotide) for symptomatic patients with multiple small-to-medium cysts [^112hzPN4] [^111n13sc].
- **Advanced disease**: Refer for liver transplantation evaluation in severe, refractory cases [^116oo1Ex] [^113yMxiX].

---

## Hydatid cysts

Hydatid cysts require **structured follow-up** because of the risk of recurrence:

- **Long-term surveillance**: Ultrasound follow-up for at least 5 years after treatment to confirm inactivity [^111J3BV6].
- **Serology**: Not recommended for routine follow-up due to poor correlation with cyst viability [^111J3BV6].
- **Medical therapy**: Albendazole or mebendazole before intervention to reduce recurrence risk [^112xLiuG] [^112anPn6].

---

## Follow-up recommendations

| **Cyst type** | **Follow-up recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Simple cysts (asymptomatic) | No routine follow-up [^116dERrb] [^112rSYjJ] |
| Simple cysts (symptomatic) | - Ultrasound <br/> - Intervention if symptomatic <br/> - No routine post-intervention follow-up [^113XLYSd] [^112rSYjJ] [^116qhUFx] |
| Complex cysts | - CT/MRI <br/> - Multidisciplinary review <br/> - Interval imaging (6–12 months) [^1113c2mo] [^116wv33d] |
| Polycystic liver disease | - Symptom-driven follow-up <br/> - Somatostatin analogs <br/> - Transplant evaluation if severe [^111YhwS6] [^112hzPN4] [^116oo1Ex] |
| Hydatid cysts | - Ultrasound ≥ 5 years <br/> - Medical therapy before intervention [^111J3BV6] [^112xLiuG] |

---

Follow-up for liver cysts should be **individualized** based on cyst type, symptoms, and complications. Asymptomatic simple cysts require no follow-up, whereas symptomatic or complex cysts may need intervention and periodic imaging. Hydatid cysts require prolonged surveillance, and PLD management is symptom-driven with potential medical therapy or transplantation.

Surgical interventions can be open or laparoscopic, conservative or radical. Conservative techniques include drainage, and unroofing, with or without omentoplasty. In fenestration, the cyst is opened and its content is aspirated following injection of hypertonic saline.

Radical procedures include total pericystectomy and minor or major hepatectomy. A benzimidazole agent is always administered prior to any type of surgery to sterilize the cyst and reduce the risk of anaphylactic reaction. PAIR involves puncture, aspiration of the cyst, injection of hypertonic saline and/or absolute alcohol, and re-aspiration. It is indicated for ECs 5–10 cm in diameter, in poor surgical candidates or in patients who have failed previous surgical interventions. It is best performed under continuous US or CT guidance with benzimidazole coverage. A study by Chen et al, showed a 98.7% cure rate in patients undergoing laparoscopic intervention, and 97.5% in patients receiving PAIR plus chemotherapy. Follow up is recommended initially every 6 months for the first 2 years, and then once a year, depending on the clinical setting.

### Long-term outcomes and quality of life after surgical or conservative treatment of benign simple liver cysts [^115HHXxW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Benign liver cysts are common and are often detected incidentally. Most patients do not require intervention. Occasionally, large dominant or multifocal small cysts cause symptoms as a result of rapid growth, secondary infection, intra-cystic bleeding or compression of adjacent organs.

Aim

To compare presenting symptoms and outcomes of a consecutive series of patients with benign liver cysts treated either conservatively or by surgical intervention. Long-term quality of life (QoL) was also assessed.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted. Long-term general and disease-specific quality of life was also documented.

Results

Ninety-five patients were included in the study (46 treated operatively, 49 treated conservatively). 80% were female, and the mean age of the cohort was 58 years. Those who had surgical intervention were older (62 vs 55 years, p = 0.004), were more likely to have shortness of breath at presentation (11 vs 5%, p = 0.018) and had larger cysts (12 vs 4 cm, p < 0.001) compared with those offered conservative treatment. Laparoscopic stapled excision was the most common operative procedure (70%) and the overall complication rate was 20%. At a median follow-up of 64 months, 17% (8/46) of the surgically treated patients had radiological evidence of cyst recurrence but only 9% (4/46) were symptomatic. At median follow-up of 71 months, 37% (14/38) of conservatively treated patients had unchanged or new symptoms compared to the first presentation. Furthermore, 10% (4/38) of this group had additional radiological or surgical intervention for persistent symptoms during the follow-up period. Overall, there was no difference in long-term QoL between the two groups.

Conclusion

Surgical intervention for selected patients with symptomatic benign liver cysts results in low long-term recurrence rates and excellent patient-reported outcomes and quality of life. Laparoscopic-stapled excision can be done safely and reliably in carefully selected patients.

### Simple biliary cysts of the liver can be lined by mucinous epithelium [^116MXuAt]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims & Methods

Simple biliary cysts of the liver are described to be lined by biliary epithelium and may be managed nonsurgically or by deroofing only. By contrast, its important differential diagnosis-mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN)-is at least focally lined by mucinous epithelium, has malignant potential, and therefore should be resected. Following anecdotal observations in routine diagnostic practice, the following case series was assembled to confirm whether simple biliary cysts of the liver can be lined by mucinous epithelium. Detailed clinicoradiological review, including postoperative follow-up, was also completed to assess whether the presence of mucinous epithelium had any associations, including a risk of hepatobiliary neoplasia.

Results

Histological review of 21 simple biliary cysts received as surgical specimens over a 3- year period confirmed an absence of ovarian-like stroma in all cases. The lining epithelium of seven cysts showed focal supranuclear/apical mucin, as confirmed histochemically. Cysts with mucinous epithelium were generally larger and more often showed histological evidence of previous haemorrhage than cysts without this epithelium. There were no other statistically-significant differences in clinicoradiological features between cysts with and without mucinous epithelium, including at postoperative radiological follow-up.

Conclusions

Focal mucinous epithelium can be present in at least one-third of surgically-managed, simple biliary cysts of the liver. Such epithelium may be metaplastic and should not be misinterpreted to indicate a diagnosis of MCN but, apart from this, appears to have no clinical significance. Ovarian-like stroma may therefore be the only histological feature that reliably distinguishes MCN from simple biliary cyst.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^112fTMu9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cystic liver disease has been increasingly reported in the literature, with a prevalence as high as 15–18%. Hepatic cysts are usually discovered incidentally, while their characterization and classification rely on improved imaging modalities. Complex cystic liver lesions comprise a wide variety of novel, re-introduced, and re-classified clinical entities. This spectrum of disorders ranges from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. Their clinicopathological features, prognostic factors, and oncogenic pathways are incompletely understood. Despite representing a heterogeneous group of disorders, they can have similar clinical and imaging characteristics. As a result, the diagnosis and management of complex liver cysts can become quite challenging. Furthermore, inappropriate diagnosis and management can lead to high morbidity and mortality. In this review, we aim to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Treatment strategy for patients with cystic lesions mimicking a liver tumor… [^114CVZtu]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Until recently, a hepatic resection had been considered one of the most dangerous operative procedures in general surgery. Furthermore, for patients who have nonneoplastic, nonparasitic, or nonhydatid cysts, but not those who have a symptomatic polycystic liver, either fenestration or ethanol injection is considered one of the safest and most effective treatment modalities. Both surgeons and physicians have hesitated to some extent to select hepatic resection for treating cystic lesions, even when malignancy could not always be ruled out. The diagnoses were made using ultrasonography, dynamic computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, has only been routinely available since 1990. All customary laboratory examinations including serological tests for parasites were also performed. In addition, cytological and bacteriological evaluations were performed if needed.

Our treatment strategy was as follows: an asymptomatic benign cyst was merely followed up, a symptomatic simple cyst was indicated for ethanol injection, 3 or either suspected malignant or definitely malignant cystic lesions were indicated for a hepatectomy. If a cystadenoma is suspected, then surgery must be performed immediately because biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma cannot be reliably differentiated based on the findings in the macroscopic specimen alone. In the proposed treatment strategy for such unique cystic lesions, all efforts should be focused on making an accurate diagnosis before the operation, using routine laboratory examinations including assays for tumor markers, as well as imaging modalities that include ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography.

A hepatic resection should be selected only if all else is satisfactory, whenever the aforementioned noninvasive or minimally invasive interventional techniques cannot rule out malignancy or a potential malignant lesion such as cystadenoma. An intraoperative pathological examination is thus strongly recommended, since a different type of operative procedure, including an extensive lymph node dissection, is required for cholangiocarcinoma cases. In conclusion, an accurate diagnosis of cystic lesions mimicking a tumor still remains problematic. The results of hepatectomy for such diseases, however, have been satisfactory. Hepatectomy should be indicated for cystic lesions mimicking a tumor of the liver whenever a potential malignancy cannot be completely ruled out.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^113yMxiX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

PCLD key concepts — Treatment goals for PCLD should be aimed at symptom relief and preservation of quality of life; selection among cyst aspiration with sclerotherapy, surgical cyst fenestration or resection of dominant cyst(s) should be based on cyst characteristics, underlying hepatic reserve and center expertise; liver transplantation with or without simultaneous kidney transplantation should be considered as a curative option in patients with PCLD with refractory symptoms because of significant cyst burden.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^1174dYxS]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of enhanced radiological imaging techniques has facilitated the diagnosis of cystic liver lesions. Concomitantly, the evidence base supporting the management of these diseases has matured over the last decades. As a result, comprehensive clinical guidance on the subject matter is warranted. These Clinical Practice Guidelines cover the diagnosis and management of hepatic cysts, mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver, biliary hamartomas, polycystic liver disease, Caroli disease, Caroli syndrome, biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts. On the basis of in-depth review of the relevant literature we provide recommendations to navigate clinical dilemmas followed by supporting text. The recommendations are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system and categorised as 'weak' or 'strong'. We aim to provide the best available evidence to aid the clinical decision-making process in the management of patients with cystic liver disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112hzPN4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD) — therapy and hormone guidance are specified as follows: We suggest discontinuation of exogenous estrogen use in women with PCLD (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For patients with PCLD with numerous small- to medium-sized cysts throughout the liver not amenable to surgical resection, cyst fenestration or aspiration sclerotherapy, or for patients with symptomatic ADPKD with concurrent PCLD, we recommend medical management using somatostatin analogs (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

### Laparoscopic treatment of simple hepatic cysts and polycystic liver disease [^115hW2Gs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The authors present their experience in the laparoscopic management of hepatic cysts and polycystic liver disease (PLD).

Methods

Between January 1996 and January 2002, 16 patients underwent laparoscopic liver surgery. Indications were solitary giant cysts (n = 10) and PLD (n = 6). Data were collected retrospectively.

Results

Laparoscopic fenestration was completed in 15 patients. Median operative time was 80 min. There was no deaths. Complications occurred in four patients: one patient with a solitary liver cyst experienced diarrhea, while a pleural effusion, a bleeding from the trocar-insertion site, and ascites occurred in three patients with PLD. Median follow-up was 34 months. There was one asymptomatic recurrence (11%) in one patient with a solitary cyst. Two patients with PLD had a symptomatic recurrence of a liver cyst.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic fenestration could be the preferred treatment of solitary liver cysts and PLD. Adequate selection of patients and type of cystic liver together with a meticulous surgical technique are recommended.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111BsrLB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for focal liver lesions, more specifically with respect to patients with hydatid cysts, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous treatment with a puncture, aspiration, injection of a scolicidal agent, and reaspiration with adjunct antihelminthic therapy in patients with uncomplicated hydatid cysts ineligible for surgery.

### Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113x9bXB]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance follow-up — management of nodules lacking complete hallmark features is described as follows: When computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects a nodule with some, but not all, hallmark features, the differential includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-HCC malignancy, and nonmalignant entities. Prior clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommended biopsy for all liver lesions > 1 cm initially detected by surveillance ultrasound and interpreted as indeterminate by diagnostic call-back CT and MRI. The evidence supporting this recommendation was not provided, and due to limitations of biopsy and complexities of working up suspected HCC, alternative strategies such as follow-up or alternative imaging may be preferable in individual cases.

### Predictors of treatment response following aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts: an international pooled analysis of individual patient data [^116oKigG]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, we confirm that aspiration sclerotherapy is highly effective in reducing symptoms. Therefore, we advocate that aspiration sclerotherapy should be primary treatment for patients with a symptomatic, solitary, or dominant hepatic cyst. In patients with haemorrhagic cyst fluid aspirate or a strong fluid reaccumulation following aspiration sclerotherapy, we advise increased attention. If symptoms recur, initiation of a subsequent aspiration sclerotherapy or referral for surgical treatment may be favourable.

The main strength of this study is that we pooled results of two similar studies from different countries and thereby increased the generalizability of our results. Moreover, this relatively large sample size enabled us to evaluate predictors of treatment response. Some limitations come with this study. Firstly, symptomatic change was evaluated by two different questionnaires. A detailed evaluation of specific symptoms could not be performed due to differences between these instruments. However, as both instruments assessed overall symptomatic response in a comparable standardized manner, we were able to pool results of overall clinical response and believe that possible introduced bias is limited. Secondly, due to small numbers of patients without reduction of symptoms, we grouped patients with "reduction" of symptoms and "no change" as incomplete clinical responder. As a result, we were unable to evaluate predicting variables of clinical non-responders. Furthermore, our follow-up extends over a period of six months and should ideally be validated over a longer period. However, we regard six months as sufficient as the most prominent cyst regression occurs within these first months and sustains thereafter. Moreover, cyst diameter measurements were performed by different imaging modalities and investigators between centres; this could have led to differences in outcome measurements. Finally, duration of ethanol instillation differed between centre 1 and centre 2. As this was completely co-linear to centre, we could not include this variable in our analysis. A prolonged exposure of the sclerosing agent to the cyst wall may improve efficacy of treatment. On the other hand, previous studies stated that ethanol eliminates epithelial cells within minutes. The impact of duration of sclerotherapy on treatment efficacy remains to be tested.

To conclude, aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts effectively reduces symptoms in the vast majority of patients. Chance of complete clinical response is increased in patients with higher proportional cyst reduction. We identified that a limited cyst reduction in the first month and the presence of haemorrhagic cyst fluid predict a suboptimal technical treatment response, however, these variables did not predict symptom disappearance.

### Management of incidental liver lesions on CT: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^114YMWFD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Committee on Incidental Findings presents recommendations for managing liver lesions that are incidentally detected on CT. These recommendations represent an update from the liver component of the ACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver. The Liver Subcommittee-which included five abdominal radiologists, one hepatologist, and one hepatobiliary surgeon-developed this algorithm.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cysts: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^113dKJNr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for managing pancreatic cysts that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update from the pancreatic component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Pancreas Subcommittee-which included abdominal radiologists, a gastroenterologist, and a pancreatic surgeon-developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion, and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches successively categorize pancreatic cysts based on patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an ascertainment of benignity and/or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up), or a management recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected pancreatic cysts.

### Efficacy and safety of aspiration sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts: a systematic review [^115UXd5S]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Aspiration sclerotherapy is a percutaneous procedure indicated for treatment of symptomatic simple hepatic cysts. The efficacy and safety of this procedure have been sources of debate and disagreement for years. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of aspiration sclerotherapy in a systematic review of the literature.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search was conducted of the electronic databases PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (until August 2015). Studies of proportional volume or diameter reduction after aspiration sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts were included for full-text evaluation. Case reports and case series were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

From 9357 citations, 100 were selected for full-text assessment. We included 16 studies, which included 526 patients with a total of 588 treated cysts. Overall, risk of bias was high, with 12 of 16 studies having a score of poor. Proportional cyst volume reduction ranged between 76% and 100% after a median follow-up period of 1–54 months. Change in symptoms was evaluated in 10 studies: 72–100% of patients reported symptom reduction, and 56–100% reported disappearance. Postprocedural pain occurred most frequently, at a rate of 5–90% among studies. Ethanol intoxication occurred in up to 93% of cases and was reported more frequently in studies with either high ethanol volumes (133.7–138.3 mL) or long sclerotherapy duration (120–180 minutes).

Conclusion

We found excellent results with respect to long-term efficacy and safety after aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts. Nevertheless, because of the high risk of bias in the included studies, definite conclusions regarding efficacy cannot be drawn.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sVhpk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated the efficacy of laparoscopic fenestration for symptomatic simple hepatic cysts. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist (Supplementary File 1). The study protocol was registered in the Prospero database of systematic reviews (CRD42017071305) on 10 July 2017.

Eligibility criteria

We included cohort studies and clinical trials of adult patients with one or more simple (non-parasitic, non-neoplastic) and symptomatic hepatic cysts (excluding choledochal cysts or hepatic foregut cysts), either solitary or in context of PLD, that underwent laparoscopic surgery with minimal resection of healthy liver parenchyma (e.g. fenestration, deroofing, unroofing). We included studies that assessed symptomatic relief and/or symptomatic recurrence. We excluded case reports, overlapping datasets, reviews, unpublished data and conference abstracts. We excluded studies with a mean or median follow-up < 6 months. For practical reasons, only articles in the following languages were included: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Literature search strategy

We systematically searched the electronic databases of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception to 18 July 2017, without any restrictions. The search strategy combined terms related to hepatic cysts and laparoscopic interventions. The search terms were composed in collaboration with an experienced medical librarian. Exact search terms are presented in Supplementary File 2. If no full-text article was available, the original authors were emailed in order to gain access. References of included studies were checked for additional studies missed in the primary search. All identified records were exported to citation management program EndNote X8 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for deduplication, which was performed according to a published protocol. After deduplication, all records were exported to the browser-based systematic review management program Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at). First, two investigators (LB and SE) independently screened title and abstract to determine the eligibility of each study. Second, the full-text of all included abstracts was independently assessed by the same investigators. Disagreements in both screening phases were resolved through discussion between the two investigators. Any remaining disagreement between reviewers was resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (CR, JD).

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^114hyprL]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Content of the guidelines

The ACG guideline included literature up to June 2013 on both benign and malignant liver tumours. Discussed benign entities are: hepatic haemangioma, FNH, HCA, focal regenerative hyperplasia, simple hepatic cysts, biliary cystadenomas, polycystic liver disease, and hydatid cysts. The SBH guideline did not mention a literature study timeframe; the most recent included publication dates September 2014. It includes hepatic haemangioma, FNH, HCA, simple hepatic cysts, hydatid cysts, cystadenomas, and polycystic liver disease. The EASL guideline did not mention the time frame of the literature study either but included studies published up to July 2015. It focused on hepatic haemangioma, FNH, and HCA. Nodular (or focal) regenerative hyperplasia is mentioned but referred to alternate reviews for recommendations on diagnostic features and management. It was the only guideline recommending use of a BLT multidisciplinary team consisting of a hepatologist, hepatobiliary surgeon, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, and pathologist.

Hepatic haemangioma

The ACG and SBH guidelines discouraged percutaneous needle biopsy due to bleeding risk, in contrast to the EASL guideline (table 2). Indications for surgical intervention differed slightly, as ACG guidelines included consideration of haemangiomas ≥ 10 cm, while the other guidelines only included surgery for symptomatic tumours. Follow-up recommendations were similar in ACG and EASL guidelines. The SBH guideline recommended follow-up through ultrasound (US) in large haemangiomas and in pregnant patients. The SBH guideline was the only guideline to suggest liver transplantation as option for surgical treatment.

### Treatment of uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) [^111J3BV6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Follow‐up

It is recommended that follow‐up is for at least five years with imaging (ultrasonography for accessible locations) after treatment of cystic echinococcosis or after the first observation of an inactive cyst. Serology is not recommended for the follow‐up of cystic echinococcosis since the presence (or absence) of detectable antibodies does not correlate with the presence (or absence) of echinococcal cysts or their viability (Siles‐Lucas 2017).

Description of the intervention

Two clinical management options are available for treatment of viable (active/transitional) uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis: medical treatment with antiparasitic oral medication or invasive treatment (percutaneous methods or surgery).

The watch and wait approach (monitoring over time using ultrasound surveillance) is recommended for uncomplicated CE4 and CE5 hepatic cysts (Brunetti 2010), and will not be considered in this review (Lissandrin 2018; Stojkovic 2016).

1. **Medical treatment**: benzimidazoles with or without praziquantel

Benzimidazoles (albendazole, mebendazole) and praziquantel are oral antiparasitic drugs used in people with hepatic cystic echinococcosis. Benzimidazoles may be used as monotherapy or as an adjunct to invasive intervention (peri‐interventional prophylaxis starting from days/weeks before and ending one month after intervention) as prophylaxis for secondary echinococcosis (i.e. to avoid the formation of new parasitic cysts which may derive from spillage of cyst fluid containing protoscoleces during invasive procedures on the cyst) (Brunetti 2010).

Albendazole is the most common benzimidazole drug used for pharmacological treatment of hepatic cystic echinococcosis in both adults and children (Moroni 2016; Tamarozzi 2020), and is currently recommended as the sole treatment for small CE1 and CE3a cysts (Brunetti 2010; Stojkovic 2009). Treatment may be administered for several months, requires laboratory and imaging follow‐up, and is not always available or affordable in endemic areas, with consequent variability and problems in its practical use. It is used at 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses (or 400 mg twice a day in adults) with continuous intake over the scheduled treatment period. The most common adverse effects of albendazole include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and an increase in liver enzymes; bone marrow depression and alopecia are less frequent. Adverse effects are generally mild and resolve upon treatment interruption.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111YhwS6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD) — epidemiology and management: Isolated PCLD is far less common than ADPKD with a prevalence of 1–10 per million, and because the 6 genes identified in PCLD only account for 30%–45% of the population, genetic testing is generally not recommended, though in young patients with PCLD and few renal cysts who do not meet diagnostic criteria, genetic testing might be helpful to exclude ADPKD. PCLD has a largely female predominance (> 80%), and in premenopausal women estrogen-containing OCPs led to a 5.5% higher height adjusted total liver volume over 10 years; exogenous estrogen use should be discontinued in patients with PCLD. Imaging surveillance of the cysts is not recommended in asymptomatic patients because there is no malignant potential.

- **Liver transplantation**: clinically apparent liver disease due to massive polycystic liver severely affecting the QoL, massive polycystic liver disease, and complications (severe malnutrition, hepatic venous outflow obstruction, ascites, portal hypertension, variceal hemorrhage, recurrent hepatic cyst infections) that can exclusively be treated by liver transplantation, failure of non-transplant-related interventions and contraindications for non-transplant-related interventions

- **Combined liver-kidney transplantation**: CrCl < 30 mL/min.

### Comparing breast and abdominal subspecialists' follow-up recommendations for incidental liver lesions on breast MRI [^11417vB7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Agreement between Breast and Abdominal Subspecialists

A total of 8 of the 90 cases across the three groups (8/90 = 8.9%) required consensus agreement between the abdominal radiologists. Among the 30 cases in Group One where breast subspecialists made a follow-up recommendation for an ILL, abdominal subspecialists agreed with 2 (7%). One included recommendation for correlation with a pre-scheduled same day PET-CT scan. The other was for a 1.6 cm indeterminate liver lesion in a patient with newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer, who did not undergo further imaging evaluation at the time, but received chemotherapy, and presented 1 year later with widespread metastatic disease, including liver involvement. In two cases, abdominal subspecialists recommended MRIs (1 immediately, and 1 in 3–6 months), while breast subspecialists recommended ultrasound evaluation. Of these, 1 had no follow-up of a probable hemangioma, but has continued to undergo screening mammograms, the last in 2019. The other patient, for which 3–6 month follow-up was recommended by the abdominal subspecialists, underwent the recommended ultrasound which was non-diagnostic, with subsequent MRI, revealing a probable biliary cystadenoma, last followed at 4 years (2/2019), and stable.

In the remaining 26 cases, the abdominal subspecialists recommended no follow-up as lesions were not present or were identified as benign, most commonly cysts or hemangiomas. Among the 30 cases in Group Two with ILLs for which the breast imagers did not make a follow-up recommendation, the abdominal subspecialists agreed that no follow-up recommendation was necessary in 29 (97%;) but made a recommendation for the remaining case with a 1.6 cm ILL (which has remained stable for at least 4 years). Fisher's exact test showed a significantly greater agreement proportion with breast subspecialists' recommendations when no follow-up recommendation was necessary (agreement proportion 29/30 vs. 2/30; p < 0.0001).

Among the 30 cases in Group Three where the breast subspecialist detected no liver lesions, abdominal subspecialists noted 2 lesions (agreement 93% [28/30]). One was a 4 mm cyst requiring no additional follow-up. The other was an indeterminate 1.2 cm left hepatic lesion which remained unchanged for over 2 years on repeat breast MRI.

### Antenatally-detected liver cysts: causes and characteristics, indications for intervention [^1147BAcm]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

The prevalence of antenatally-detected hepatic cysts is increasing owing to increased use of maternal ultrasonography (USS). Diagnostic precision, however, is challenging and subsequently there is no clear consensus on postnatal management. The aim of the study was to evaluate the natural history and long-term follow up of congenital simple hepatic cysts.

Methods

Single-center review of prospectively-maintained dataset collected over a 25-year period. Data are quoted as median (range).

Results

In the period 1991–2016, 31 infants presented with an antenatally-detected cyst which, on postnatal imaging, was likely confirmed as a simple parenchymal hepatic cyst. These together with a further infant who presented at 4 days without any antenatal imaging comprised the study group (n = 32). Gestational age at detection was 23 (13–38) weeks. Maximum antenatal cyst diameter was measured at 19 (4–120) mm. Only the largest required percutaneous aspiration at 35 weeks' gestation being associated with polyhydramnios. Postnatally, serial USS was performed alongside MRI/CT or liver scintigraphy if there was diagnostic doubt. Initial maximum cyst diameter was 30 (12–120) mm. Five infants came to surgical intervention and this included excision ± marsupialization (n = 4), and a cyst-jejunostomy en Roux in one child thought to have a connection with the biliary tract on intraoperative cholangiography. The mucosal lining in two cysts showed areas of squamous metaplasia, with one more showing an intact squamous lining probably more consistent with an epidermoid cyst. In the remaining cases (n = 27), all asymptomatic, serial USS showed volume maintenance (n = 16) actual volume regression (n = 4) and resolution (n = 7). Median follow-up in these cases was 42 (4–252) months.

Conclusion

This is the largest case series to date of antenatally-detected simple hepatic cysts. Most can be managed conservatively, and relative regression or resolution is likely. Surgical intervention should be reserved for those: that are large at the outset; show rapid cyst growth - these being typically exophytic in nature; wall irregularity or where there is diagnostic doubt.

### Natural history and long-term follow-up of antenatally detected liver cysts [^116n1Foo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Antenatally detected liver cysts are rare; their diagnostic accuracy is unknown, and their management is controversial. This study assessed the natural history of these lesions.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of infants with isolated intrahepatic cysts that were detected antenatally. Data are expressed as median (range).

Results

Fifteen infants presented during the period 1991–2004 with an antenatally detected liver cyst. Their gestational age at detection was 22 (18–34) weeks, and the maximum diameter of their cyst was 23 (10–120) mm. Serial scans, which were performed in 9 fetuses, showed cyst enlargement in 5 cases, diminution in 1 case, and no change in 3 cases. In utero percutaneous aspiration was required in 1 infant. Three infants underwent postnatal surgery. One fetus (postfetal intervention) had a subtotal excision of a large subcapsular cyst filling the abdominal cavity on day 2. Another infant required partial excision and marsupialization (complex cyst arising from segment IV) at 5 months, and a third infant underwent a cyst cholecystostomy at 4 months. Postnatal investigations (including hepatic scintigraphy) suggested that the remaining lesions were either simple parenchymal (n = 10) or isolated intrahepatic choledochal (ie, type V; n = 2) cysts. The median follow-up for these patients was 44 (27–167) months. Serial postnatal ultrasonography showed cyst diminution in 4 cases, an enlargement in 1 case, and no dimensional change in 7 cases.

Conclusions

Most antenatally detected liver cysts appear to be simple and of parenchymal origin and do not require fetal intervention. Their postnatal history is variable, but regression without treatment is seen in most cases.

LIVER CYSTS

Liver cysts are the most common extra-renal manifestation of ADPKD and a recent case series suggested that biliary disease is also a frequent complication in ADPKD. Liver cysts can occur at any disease stage (irrespective of marked progression of CKD) and affect women in particular. Liver cysts can contribute significantly to pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and QoL impairment. All patients with ADPKD should be assessed for polycystic liver disease, and those with liver cyst complications should be referred to a hepatologist as necessary. Liver symptoms can be assessed using the polycystic liver disease questionnaire (PLD-Q). Current guidelines suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe polycystic liver disease should avoid oestrogens, in view of the evidence that exogenous oestrogen increases liver (but not renal) volume in postmenopausal ADPKD patients.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^1162m1pZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the inherent limitations of preoperative diagnostic tools, all suspected biliary MCNs should ideally be surgically removed with negative margins. Especially in MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma, the gold standard of treatment is radical resection with a wide (> 2 cm) surgical margin. Pathological staging of invasive MCNs follows the staging of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. However, they present a notably favorable prognosis compared to other hepatic malignancies, since they exhibit less aggressive clinical behavior, with slow growth and rare metastases. In a retrospective study by Jwa et al, no tumor recurrences were observed in patients with MCNs undergoing complete surgical removal. Postoperative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in patients bearing invasive MCNs were 100%, 100%, and 75.0%, respectively. Optimal prognosis is expected only if complete (R0) resection is contemplated. Klompenhouwer et al reported a 5% recurrence rate for MCNs following resection or enucleation, and up to 100% post-fenestration. In a literature review analyzing 25 studies that included 103 patients with MCNs, the main indication to choose enucleation over liver resection was a large cyst located in a central liver portion. Data review demonstrated a 0% recurrence rate, no postoperative deaths, and no late occurring malignancies. The authors concluded that MCN enucleation is a safe and effective option for patients who cannot tolerate major hepatectomy.

Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for IPNBs. The extent of surgical resection depends on the tumor location, the degree of biliary tract involvement and patient suitability. Most patients are sufficiently treated with radical surgical resection, which includes hepatectomy with or without bile duct resection. In extreme cases with more aggressive IPNBs and positive resection margins, major hepatectomy or orthotopic liver transplantation, with or without pancreaticoduodenectomy, may be performed. IPNBs undergoing curative surgical resection present a significantly better prognosis compared to cholangiocarcinomas, with 5-year disease-free survival as high as 81%. Positive resection margins, positive lymph nodes, tumor invasion ≥ 5 mm and invasive component ≥ 10% are all associated with a poorer prognosis. Taking into account the incidence of invasiveness and metastases in patients with IPNBs, and hence the high possibility of disease recurrence, regular postoperative follow up with short-interval imaging is recommended.

Infectious cysts

Bacterial, fungal and amoebic liver abscesses and hepatic hydatid cysts are among the differential considerations for complex liver cysts.

Table 3 (continued) — management of biliary hamartomas, peribiliary cysts, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts: Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts are premalignant biliary lesions with a high risk of malignant transformation, and thus, continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection. Management and treatment of choledochal cysts is based on type of cyst and risk of malignant transformation; Type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended. In both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered. For hydatid cysts, medical therapy with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in symptomatic or active cysts to prevent recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and medical therapy alone is not recommended unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^116ybvZF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver (MCN-L) — imaging features and management — Mural calcifications have a 90% specificity for MCN-L and can be seen in up to 69% of cysts, and on MRI the presence and enhancement of septations and mural nodularity are a highly sensitive feature, nearly 100%. Complete surgical resection is the gold standard for all MCNs, whereas cyst aspiration, sclerotherapy, partial resection, or cyst fenestration are not recommended. Fluid aspiration or biopsy of MCN-L is not recommended to distinguish it from a simple hepatic cyst because of low sensitivity, and MCN-L with thick septations, fenestrations, nodularity, calcifications, or mixed solid and cystic components require prompt evaluation for complete surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, surveillance imaging should be implemented, although a specific interval cannot be recommended, and changes suggestive of malignant degeneration should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board for consideration for nonsurgical options. In the postoperative period, surveillance imaging is recommended, although there are no established guidelines regarding specific intervals.

### The natural history of the incidentally discovered small simple pancreatic cyst: long-term follow-up and clinical implications [^117ViSe9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine the natural history of small (≤ 2 cm) simple pancreatic cystic lesions.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients with long-term follow-up who were diagnosed with small (≤ 2 cm) simple pancreatic cysts on sonography or CT from 1985 to 1996. Long-term surveillance included radiographic surveillance of 5 years or longer, clinical follow-up of 8 years or longer, or response to questionnaire or telephone inquiry 8 year or longer after the original diagnosis. Cause of death was recorded for patients who died within 5–8 years of diagnosis. Patients were excluded if a history of pancreatitis or systemic cystic disease existed.

Results

Seventy-nine patients had small simple pancreatic cysts. Forty-nine (62%) had adequate radiologic, clinical, or questionnaire follow-up. Of the 22 patients with radiologic follow-up, 13 (59%) had cysts that remained unchanged or became smaller (mean size, 8 mm; mean follow-up, 9 years), and nine (41%) had cysts that enlarged, from a mean of 14 mm to a mean of 26 mm (mean follow-up, 8 years). Of the 27 patients with clinical or questionnaire follow-up (mean follow-up, 10 years), none developed symptomatic pancreatic disease. Eighteen patients (23%) died within 8 years without adequate radiologic follow-up, none of pancreas-related causes. Twelve patients (15%) were lost to follow-up.

Conclusion

Although small, incidental, simple pancreatic cysts of 2 cm or smaller may enlarge over a prolonged time, morbidity or mortality due to these small simple cysts is extremely unlikely, and observation appears to be a safe management option.

The widespread use of imaging techniques has led to an increased diagnosis of incidental liver tumours. The differential diagnosis is extremely broad since it may range from benign asymptomatic lesions to malignant neoplasms. The correct characterisation of a liver mass has become a diagnostic challenge for most clinicians. They can be divided in two major categories; cystic lesions, usually benign with excellent long-term outcome, and solid lesions, in which malignancy should be excluded. A particular population is those patients with cirrhosis, who have high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Dynamic imaging techniques have a pivotal role in the diagnostic work-up of liver tumours, allowing a confident diagnosis in most cases. If imaging is not conclusive, a biopsy should be requested to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

### Clinical treatment of echinococcosis… [^1139VRnD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Treatment options for cystic echinococcosis include chemotherapy, cyst puncture, and PAIR.
- In some cases, no treatment but a conservative "watch and wait" approach is best.
- Alveolar echinococcosis requires chemotherapy with or without surgery. Treatment indications vary with cyst characteristics, including cyst type, location, size, and complications. Surgery may be the best treatment for liver cysts that are secondarily infected, or cysts located in the brain, lungs, or kidney. Liver cysts larger than 7. 5 cm are likely to have biliary communication; surgery may be the best option for these cysts. Many abdominal cysts can be treated by injection of protoscolicidal chemical solutions into the cyst, followed by evacuation, prior to further manipulations and extirpation of cysts.

Both albendazole 10–15 mg/kg body weight per day and, as a second choice for treatment, mebendazole 40–50 mg/kg body weight per day continuously for several months have been highly effective. Additionally, chemotherapy can be very effective when used in conjunction with surgery. Albendazole has been administered to patients prior to surgery for the intended purpose of facilitating the safe surgical manipulation of the cysts by inactivating protoscolices, altering the integrity of the cyst's membranes, and reducing the turgidity of the cysts. A third treatment option, PAIR, has been shown to be effective. This option is indicated for patients with relapse after surgery, failure of chemotherapy alone, or who refuse surgery.

Drug Adult Dosage Pediatric Dosage Albendazole 400 mg orally twice a day for 1–6 months 10–15 mg/kg/day orally in two doses for 1–6 months Praziquantel may be useful preoperatively or in case of spillage of cyst contents during surgery. Oral albendazole and oral mebendazole are available for human use in the United States.

### Contemporary management of benign liver tumors [^116b3EUq]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Benign lesions of the liver represent diagnostic dilemmas, clinically and radiographically; however, certain clues can help the extensive differential diagnosis of both benign and malignant processes. Hemangiomas and simple cysts have very distinct and very specific radiographic characteristics, and if diagnosed, no further work-up is necessary. The remaining benign lesions have significant overlap, even though there are some more common characteristics to each of the entities. Still, differentiation of any particular lesion outside simple cysts or hemangioma may be difficult. It is reasonable and relatively simple, with minimal invasiveness, to perform US- or CT-guided, percutaneous core-needle biopsies. It is recommended that core biopsies be performed, because many of the benign entities have some overlapping histologic features, and if fine-needle aspirations are performed, a definitive diagnosis may be difficult to obtain. A definitive pathological diagnosis still cannot be made in some cases, even after needle biopsy. Therefore, a surgical resection or wedge resection may be necessary if a benign process cannot be definitively ruled out.

### Diagnosis and follow-up of incidental liver lesions in children [^117VQYs5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Incidental liver lesions are identified in children without underlying liver disease or increased risk of hepatic malignancy in childhood. Clinical and imaging evaluation of incidental liver lesions can be complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach. This review aims to summarize the diagnostic process and follow-up of incidental liver lesions based on review of the literature, use of state-of-the-art imaging, and our institutional experience. Age at presentation, gender, alpha fetoprotein levels, tumor size, and imaging characteristics should all be taken into consideration to optimize diagnosis process. Some lesions, such as simple liver cyst, infantile hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and focal fatty lesions, have specific imaging characteristics. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the evaluation of pediatric liver lesions. CEUS is most specific in lesions smaller than 3cm and is most useful in the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma, FNH, and focal fatty lesions. The use of hepatobiliary contrast in MRI increases specificity in the diagnosis of FNH. Recently, lesion characteristics in MRI were found to correlate with subtypes of hepatocellular adenomas and associated risk for hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Biopsy should be considered when there are no specific imaging characteristics of a benign lesion. Surveillance with imaging and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) should be performed to confirm the stability of lesions when the diagnosis cannot be determined, and whenever biopsy is not feasible.

### Biologic and clinical features of benign solid and cystic lesions of the liver [^116VFRNR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The widespread use of imaging analyses, either routinely or to evaluate symptomatic patients, has increased the detection of liver lesions (tumors and cysts) in otherwise healthy individuals. Although some of these incidentally discovered masses are malignant, most are benign and must be included in the differential diagnosis. The management of benign hepatic tumors ranges from conservative to aggressive, depending on the nature of the lesions. New imaging modalities, increased experience of radiologists, improved definition of radiologic characteristics, and a better understanding of the clinical features of these lesions have increased the accuracy of diagnoses and reduced the need for invasive diagnostic tests. These advances have led to constant adjustments in management approaches to benign hepatic lesions. We review the biologic and clinical features of some common hepatic lesions, to guide diagnosis and management strategies.

Benign liver lesions are increasingly diagnosed in daily clinical practice due to the growing use of imaging techniques for the study of the abdomen in patients who have non-specific symptoms and do not have an increased risk of hepatic malignancy. They include simple or parasitic cysts and solid benign tumors which differ widely in terms of prevalence, clinical relevance, symptoms and natural history and often lead to significant clinical problems relating to diagnosis and clinical management. Following the need to have updated guidelines on the management of benign focal liver lesions, the Scientific Societies mainly involved in their management have promoted the drafting of a new dedicated document. This document was drawn up according to the present Italian rules and methodologies necessary to produce clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic guidelines based on evidence. Here we present the first part of the guideline, concerning the characterization of focal hepatic lesions detected by ultrasound, and the diagnosis and clinical management of simple and parasitic hepatic cysts, and of polycystic liver disease.

Choledochal cysts — management and surveillance are type-specific: Patients with type I cysts should undergo complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; type II cysts can undergo simple cyst excision; type III cysts can be managed endoscopically (via sphincterotomy) or by transduodenal excision for larger cysts. Type V cysts are managed based on the extent of intrahepatic disease with options including extrahepatic cyst excision with or without partial hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy, and liver transplantation may be required when resection is not feasible. We suggest that patients with type I and IV cysts should continue to undergo surveillance even after cyst resection because of the ongoing risk of malignancy. Key concepts emphasize that management is based on cyst type and malignancy risk; type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended; and in both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered.

Hepatic cysts (HC) are sac-like structures mainly filled with liquid and showing a distinct membrane. They are usually found incidentally through imaging. A wide spectrum of imaging patterns may be observed for common and uncommon, neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. While simple hepatic cysts occur frequently and do not require any treatment or follow-up, non-typical cysts should be carefully analysed to avoid misdiagnosing a lesion that would require appropriate management. Therefore, adequate knowledge of all the relevant imaging patterns is critical to secure an accurate diagnosis. The aim of this review is to describe the imaging features of the different types of hepatic cysts.

Diagnostic algorithms

Asymptomatic patients with unknown focal liver lesions

If an unknown focal liver lesion is incidentally seen on US, the clinical setting and characteristics of the lesion should be considered first. In particular:

Cystic lesions: anechoic lesions, no walls, inner components, or septa suggesting simple hepatic cysts. If multiple and small, consider biliary hamartomas. If the walls are thick or with calcifications, abscesses, echinococcosis, or, rarely, cystic metastases are differential diagnoses. When in doubt, perform MRI.
Solid lesions: Hyperechoic: the most common entities are hemangiomas and focal steatosis, followed by FNHs, HCAs, and metastases. With no previous images or if uncertain, consider MRI or CEUS. If unenhanced MRI suggests a benign lesion, definitive characterization could be postponed. Focal steatosis follows a typical distribution pattern around the gallbladder and close to the hilum. Hypoechoic: US is not specific; consider CEUS (if single), or MRI. Contrast administration only if suspected malignancy. Regular US follow-up is needed for HCAs (> 5 cm risk of bleeding). Multiple, small hypoechoic spots suggest metastases, infections, or sarcoidosis. With periportal edema and gallbladder wall thickening, consider hepatitis. Isoechoic: FNH. Color Doppler might show the central artery and CEUS the typical spoke-wheel pattern. FNH can only be suspected on unenhanced MRI.

If necrotic/liquid components are present, consider metastases and abscess.

In the presence of fat, consider HCA or atypical FNH. In the presence of cirrhosis, siderotic content is a sign of regenerative or dysplastic nodules. Hematic nodules include hematomas or bleeding HCAs. Contrast-enhanced MRI or CT should be performed when active bleeding is suspected. Figure 13 contains a diagnostic chart for characterization of focal liver lesions in pregnancy.

### Long-term outcome after laparoscopic fenestration of simple liver cysts [^111x6Xcp]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Simple liver cysts (LCs) represent the most common benign liver disease, with a prevalence of 3–5%. Laparoscopic fenestration is considered the best treatment for symptomatic LCs, but few studies have analyzed the rate or type of recurrence during a long-term follow-up period (> 5 years).

Methods

Between January 2000 and December 2010, 47 patients underwent laparoscopic fenestration for simple LCs. The indications were symptoms for 42 patients and an uncertain diagnosis for five patients. The follow-up assessment consisted of regular patient evaluations, with results of laboratory data and liver ultrasound.

Results

Conversion to laparotomy was not necessary in any case. The postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were nil. The mean follow-up period was 67 months (range 12–142 months), and 26 patients (55.3%) had a follow-up period longer than 5 years. During the follow-up period, 40 patients (85.1%) did not present with any type of recurrence. The overall recurrence rate was 14.9% (seven patients) based on five patients (10.6%) with radiologic asymptomatic recurrences detected by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan and two patients (4.3%) with clinicoradiologic symptomatic recurrences. Both symptomatic recurrences involved LCs located in the right posterior segments.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic fenestration provided complete relief of symptoms for about 95% of patients with simple LCs. Recurrence after surgery was experienced by 14.9% of the patients, but only in 4.3% (two patients) was this recurrence symptomatic requiring a second treatment. The site of recurrence was more frequently in the right posterior segments. Laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic LCs can be considered a safe and effective procedure that can yield good long-term results.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^1113c2mo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently affecting approximately 2.5–18% of the world population, cystic liver lesions are broadly classified into simple and complex cystic lesions. Hepatic simple cysts (HSCs), making up the majority of these lesions, are benign, rarely symptomatic, tend to remain stable in size, and seldom require treatment. Complex liver cysts, on the other hand, include congenital, premalignant, neoplastic, infectious, and post-traumatic lesions. Ultrasonography (US) as the first imaging modality, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), combined with clinical and laboratory data, provide useful information regarding the diagnosis and characterization of complex cystic liver lesions. Since the majority of complex cysts require surgical management, difficulties in reaching an accurate diagnosis pose problems in their effective management, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and effective management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Treatment of hydatid liver cyst with double percutaneous aspiration and ethanol injection under ultrasound guidance: 6.5-year median follow-up analysis [^112vkrWn]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although hydatid liver cyst (HLC) is a benign disease, treatment is recommended to avoid life-threatening complications. There are several treatment options for HLC: "wait-and-watch", medical or surgical or percutaneous treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of an alternative of the traditional percutaneous PAIR procedure, called double percutaneous aspiration and ethanol injection (D-PAI).

Materials and Methods

This prospective, non-randomized study was conducted from 1988 to 2019 using DPAI procedure characterized by no reaspiration of the ethanol injected to replace the aspirated fluid and repetition of the procedure after 3–7 days.

Results

Two hundred and three patients with 290 HLCs underwent D-PAI. Two hundred and two HLC (160 patients) were univesicular cysts and 88 (43 patient) were multivesicular. Seventeen patients underwent one D-PAI session, 15 patients two sessions, and 18 up to four sessions. The follow-up ranged 0.9–21 years (median 6.5 years). On ultrasound, 188 cysts (64.8%) disappeared; 57 cysts (19.7%) became solid (inactive) and 45 (15.5%) showed a small inactive residual component. Parasitologic cure was very high. The overall response to D-PAI was higher than 90% considering also the procedures carried out after the first D-PAI at the time of recurrence. One patient died for anaphylactic shock. The hospital stay ranged 1–3 days. Smaller cysts (< 5 cm) healed sooner than larger cysts (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Long-term analysis showed that D-PAI is a safe and effective option in percutaneous treatment of viable HLC, except for CE2/CE3b in which the recurrences can be observed. This inexpensive and simple procedure can be applied everywhere and especially in developing countries.

### Comparison of society guidelines for the management and surveillance of pancreatic cysts… [^115Gic24]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Aziz H, Acher AW, Krishna SG, Cloyd JM, Pawlik TM. Comparison of Society Guidelines for the Management and Surveillance of Pancreatic Cysts: A Review. JAMA Surg. 2022; 157: 723–730. doi:
10. 1001/jamasurg.
2022. 2232. Importance The identification of incidental pancreas cystic lesions has increased in recent decades with the expanded use and improved sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging. Because the overall risk of malignancy associated with PCLs is low, yet the relative morbidity of pancreatic surgery is high, evidence-based guidelines are necessary for appropriate surveillance and management. Therefore, this article provides a review of existing guidelines regarding surveillance and management of PCLs and highlights recent advances in the diagnostic evaluation of cysts and the postresection management of mucinous lesions.

Observations There are 5 main guidelines related to the management of PCLs: the American Gastrointestinal Association guidelines, the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, the American College of Radiology recommendations, the European evidence-based guidelines, and the International Association of Pancreatology /Fukuoka guidelines. These guidelines are based on retrospective studies that do not account or control for most tumor- and patient-specific factors. These guidelines also vary in scope, recommendations for surgical resection vs surveillance, as well as duration and type of follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance PCL guidelines should be viewed within the context of the data limitations on which they are based. PCL subtype-specific guidelines on surveillance and treatment are needed.

In the future, the integration of cyst-specific genomic analysis, as well as evolutions in advanced diagnostic tools, such as cyst fluid next-generation sequencing and EUS-guided confocal laser endomicroscopy, may also better inform treatment guidelines. Owing to the current low-quality evidence on which many guidelines are based and the inherent morbidity of pancreas surgery, it is imperative that patients with PCLs are referred to institutions with advanced diagnostics and a multidisciplinary approach to patient surveillance and management.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^111gN2nX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Why and how to undertake long-term surveillance?

Follow-up after surgery serves two purposes: to monitor for development of malignancy in the remnant biliary tissue, and development of late complications, such as anastomotic strictures or formation of stones or debris. Metachronous cancer is reported to occur in 2–4 per cent of patients after resection. The prevalence of non-malignant strictures is reported to range from 2 to 17 per cent, a problem that appears to be less of an issue among patients operated in childhood. Follow-up may consist of annual liver function tests and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 measurement. Based on availability, the authors also recommend cross-sectional imaging with MRCP.

### Symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary developmental liver cysts: cross-sectional imaging findings [^115JJqN4]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Commonly encountered in the general population, in the vast majority of cases nonhereditary developmental liver cysts are asymptomatic, not associated with altered hepatic function and confidently diagnosed on imaging studies, and do not require further workup, follow-up, or treatment. However, particularly in women, simple hepatic cysts may reach large sizes and cause symptoms and signs resulting from mass effect, vascular compression, and biliary obstruction. Furthermore, although rarely compared to the incidence observed in patients with adult polycystic kidney and liver disease, sporadic hepatic cysts sometimes undergo life-threatening complications such as intracystic hemorrhage, infection, or rupture, which require prompt imaging triage and appropriate interventional, laparoscopic, or open surgical treatment. This pictorial essay reviews with examples the cross-sectional imaging findings of symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary liver cysts, aiming to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with these uncommon, challenging occurrences. Emphasis is placed on the role of MRI as a useful problem-solving modality to elucidate the complex imaging appearances resulting from intracystic bleeding and superinfection, and to differentiate complicated cysts from other hemorrhagic liver lesions and biliary cystic tumors.

For mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver, the directive is "Complete resection; if not surgical candidate then surveillance imaging". For biliary hamartoma, the figure states "No surveillance needed". For echinococcal cyst, management specifies "Anthelmintic drugs prior to surgery or cyst puncture or PAIR" with "Surveillance if not resectable".

ACG Clinical Guideline — hydatid cysts medical, percutaneous, and surgical therapy indicates that medical therapy consists of chemotherapy with anthelmintic drugs, albendazole or mebendazole, with studies indicating the former as the superior agent, and is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture to prevent risk of recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, with the risk of anaphylaxis with percutaneous drainage mitigated by initiating medical therapy first; an important change in medical therapy is that cyclical regimens are no longer recommended, and because albendazole can cause hepatic dysfunction and granulocytopenia patients should be monitored regularly with white cell counts and liver function tests; percutaneous or surgical approaches are recommended for large cysts (> 5 cm), for cysts likely to rupture, for cysts not responding to medical therapy, or for patients with contraindications to medical therapy, with puncture, aspiration, injection of scolicidal agent, and reaspiration with adjunct anthelmintic therapy an effective alternative to surgery, although this is contraindicated in biliary fistulas or cysts communicating with the biliary tree, complex multiseptated cysts, or percutaneously inaccessible cysts; surgical approaches aim for cyst removal and cavity obliteration and may range from simple cyst resection to radical cystectomy, and hepatic resection may be warranted in some instances to remove all the hydatid disease.

### A rare large symptomatic simple hepatic cyst [^112iQpQi]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A fit and well 4-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of abdominal distension, pain and vomiting with signs of non-shifting dullness on the right side of the abdomen. An abdominal CT revealed a 19 cm epigastric cyst that did not appear to connect to any solid organ and was therefore thought to represent a mesenteric cyst. However, laparotomy revealed that the cyst was arising from the liver. The cyst was resected and subsequent histology revealed a simple hepatic cyst. The patient has been well post-operation. The case represents the largest described simple hepatic cyst in the 0–16 years paediatric age group in Europe to date. We outline the epidemiology, embryology, key investigations and management options for these lesions.

Regarding specific circumstances for focal liver lesions, more specifically with respect to patients with simple hepatic cysts, evaluation, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain further evaluation with CT or MRI in patients with simple hepatic cysts with specific high-risk features seen on ultrasound (such as septations, fenestrations, calcifications, mural thickening or nodularity, heterogeneity, and presence of daughter cysts).

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111BEJPZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Simple hepatic cysts — Hepatic cysts are thin-walled structures lined by cuboidal bile duct epithelium and filled with isotonic fluid and are the result of ductal plate malformation without communication with the biliary tree. Simple hepatic cysts can be diagnosed on conventional grayscale ultrasound with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%, and they are usually asymptomatic and incidentally found unless very large; there is a female predominance although there is no established correlation with OCP use or pregnancy and cyst prevalence increases with age. For symptomatic cysts, treatment options include surgical cyst fenestration, also known as deroofing/marsupialization, or aspiration with sclerotherapy; aspiration sclerotherapy can be achieved with substances including 100% ethanol, tetracycline, or other sclerosants.

### Polycystic liver disease: experience at a teaching hospital [^112sCcMB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study describes the natural history of patients with polycystic liver disease, a rare disorder characterized by multiple hepatic cysts.

Methods

Cases were identified through review of charts from a hepatology practice, a hepatobiliary surgery practice and a retrospective chart review of inpatient charts from 1990 to 2002. All patients had greater than four simple liver cysts without infectious etiology. Medical records were reviewed for history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory data. Patients' family practitioners provided follow-up.

Results

Fifty-three cases (62.3% female, 37.7% male) were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 56.4 yr. Thirty-eight cases (71.7%) had associated polycystic kidney disease. The minority of patients were symptomatic at diagnosis (pain in 19 (36.5%), dyspnea in 5 (9.6%), and restricted mobility in 5 (9.6%) with hepatomegaly in 23 (45.1%). Follow-up information was attainable for 40 patients with a mean follow-up duration of 4.69 yr (range 0.1–15 yr). Within this subgroup, 9 patients (22.5%) had cyst bleeding, 5 (12.5%) had cyst rupture, 5 (12.5%) had cyst infection, 12 (30%) required an intervention. One patient (2.5%) developed portal hypertension, and two (5%) received a liver transplant. One patient (2.5%) died due to complications from liver cysts.

Conclusions

Most patients in this highly selected cohort were asymptomatic with normal hepatic function. Pain was the most common symptom. The natural history is variable however, with some patients developing complications including portal hypertension. Minimally invasive interventions are appropriate initially, with hepatic resection and liver transplantation reserved for those with severe symptoms or life-threatening complications.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^111Asnyv]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for polycystic liver disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend to decide on the choice of treatment based on symptoms and complications related to the presence of cysts in combination with liver phenotypes:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Symptoms|- Abdominal fullness <br/> - Lack of appetite or early satiety <br/> - Acid reflux <br/> - Nausea and vomiting <br/> - Pain in rib cage, sides, abdomen or back <br/> - Shortness of breath <br/> - Limited mobility, fatigue <br/> - Anxiety about the future <br/> - Concern or dissatisfaction with abdomen size <br/> - Problems with intercourse <br/> - Involuntary weight loss|
|Complications|- Jaundice <br/> - Hepatic venous outflow obstruction <br/> - Portal hypertension <br/> - Recurrent cyst infection <br/> - Recurrent cyst hemorrhage|
|Phenotypes|- Numerous small-to-medium-sized cysts throughout the liver <br/> - Large or strategically located cyst percutaneously accessible <br/> - Single or multiple large superficial cysts <br/> - Small-to-medium-sized cysts clustered in a few segments in the presence of some less affected liver segments <br/> - Massive PLD <br/> - Severely affecting the QoL or accompanied by recurrent complications.|

### KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline: a commentary on diagnosis and management of hepatopancreatic manifestations by the ERA working group genes&kidney [^114UTKYk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a long-awaited development and the first KDIGO guideline addressing a genetic kidney disease. The approval of tolvaptan as targeted therapy for ADPKD in 2015, marked a pivotal advancement, and galvanized towards a structured approach in research and clinical care. Considering the systemic nature of ADPKD guidance for the management of extrarenal manifestations is of special importance for nephrologists and requires interdisciplinary collaboration. In this regard, cysts in other organs, particularly the liver, are the most common extrarenal finding. While most liver cysts are incidental findings on routine imaging, both cyst infections and severe polycystic liver disease accompanying ADPKD come with a high disease burden and challenges in management. In contrast, pancreatic cysts in ADPKD are usually completely asymptomatic, but raise questions about the need for follow-up. This commentary provides an overview of the most important recommendations and practice points on hepatopancreatic cysts provided by the KDIGO guideline with the aim to contribute to implementation and to highlight remaining gaps in guidance, clinical care and research.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ZoDrn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The average interval between surgery and symptomatic recurrence was 16 months, and mean time until reintervention was 22 months. This interval should be interpreted very carefully because of the small sample size, but underscores the need for long-term follow-up when investigating cyst recurrence in future studies.

Patients with PLD may possess one or more large cysts against the background of multiple smaller cysts in surrounding liver. Symptoms in PLD may be attributed to these large cysts and it may be tempting to perform laparoscopic fenestration here. We found that this subgroup is at a high risk for complications and that long-term symptomatic relief is less well achieved. Potential causes of the elevated risk of complications are the changes in hepatic anatomy in PLD and the use of extensive fenestration, with some studies fenestrating over 30 cysts per patient. The elevated recurrence rate is probably related to the different natural history of PLD and large solitary cysts. Hepatic cysts, regardless whether they are solitary or multiple, arise as a result from inactivation of 2 alleles from PLD genes. PLD is a genetic disorder and patients have a germline mutation in one of the PLD genes and must acquire only one additional somatic mutation to develop cysts. Patients with solitary large cysts need to acquire somatic mutations on 2 PLD genes to develop the phenotype. Thus, the risk for recurrence is low in these patients. This contrasts with the situation in PLD where the liver volume increases with 1.8% every 6–12 months. As a consequence, the natural growth of PLD will rapidly overtake the potential volume-curtailing effect of laparoscopic fenestration of a single, albeit large, cyst. The implication is that the threshold for laparoscopic fenestration in PLD must be high in view of the limited long-term efficacy and higher risks.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111n13sc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Somatostatin analog therapy for PCLD — Across trials, reductions in liver cyst volume are greatest within the first 6 months of treatment and can last up to 2–4 years; in the largest randomized controlled trial, lanreotide produced a statistically significant reduction in height adjusted liver volume (HA-LV) by almost 6% with an additional 3.8% reduction 4 months after the last injection; the trial used lanreotide long-acting release 120 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks; this degree of HA-LV change correlates to approximately 140 mL of volume reduction and studies have shown symptom improvement with a decrease in liver volume of > 100 mL; treatment is overall well tolerated, with discontinuation in a small percentage of patients (< 5%) and steatorrhea-type symptoms that are usually self-limited after the first few injections.

### Differences in perceptions among radiologists, referring physicians, and patients regarding language for incidental findings reporting [^1121RuKs]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to compare radiologists', referring physicians', and patients' interpretations of expressions within radiology reports to describe findings of likely low clinical significance.

Subjects and Methods

Surveys were completed by abdominal radiologists (n = 13), physicians referring patients for abdominal CT (n = 59), and outpatients awaiting imaging (n = 51) at a large urban academic medical center. Surveys presented 10 expressions for describing an incidental 5-mm liver lesion and asked respondents to select from a list of choices their perceived likelihood that the lesion represented malignancy. Radiologists and referrers were asked supplemental questions.

Results

Compared with radiologists' concern, referrers' and patients' concerns were higher for four and seven of the 10 expressions. Only the expression "benign cyst" was associated with no concern in all groups; "most likely a cyst" and "too small to characterize" were associated with median levels of concern of 0% for radiologists, > 0% to 1% for referrers, and > 2% to 5% for patients. Expressions containing the phrase "not excluded" had the highest concern in all groups. Referrers' likelihood of ordering follow-up imaging varied widely for the expressions (e.g., "benign cyst", 2%; "cyst", 22%; "most likely a cyst", 46%; "most likely a cyst, although tumor not excluded", 75%). Overall, the preferred phrase for a 5-mm liver lesion with benign features in normal-risk patients was "cyst" among radiologists and "benign cyst" among referrers. Seventy-six percent of referring physicians thought that radiology reports should indicate whether follow-up imaging is recommended for such lesions.

Conclusion

Ambiguity in radiologists' language for incidental low-risk findings may contribute to increased patient anxiety and follow-up testing, warranting greater radiologist attention and potentially new practice or reporting strategies.

### Symptomatic nonparasitic hepatic cysts… [^1126p7GE]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

These results support our policy of performing open radical procedures in the treatment of SNHC; cystectomy is performed for primary surgery and hepatic resections for recurrences and complications. Conservative procedures have shown higher rates of recurrence and the need for further surgery. Only further technological improvements will allow a systematic and safe use of laparoscopy for radical surgery for SNHC. Consequently, intraperitoneal drainage is unadvisable when the cyst fluid is bile stained, because an intraperitoneal bile leakage would result. A cystoenteric anastomosis using a Roux-en-Y jejunal limb has been considered appropriate in these cases, 5, 7, 28, 35 but this procedure carries the danger of ascending infection and additional demanding surgery. 10, 33. An additional hepatic resection was performed on a patient with a hepatic abscess after a cystojejunostomy performed elsewhere.

More radical approaches have been advocated on the basis of experience that recurrence can be expected when part of the secreting wall is left in place. 2, 36–38 The operative strategy for the complete removal of the lesion depends on its size and location. Excision of the cyst has been propagated as the method of choice, because it preserves most of the functional liver tissue and is associated with no recurrences. 4–6, 11, 20, 36, 38, 39. Total cystectomy has been confirmed by our experience as a safe and effective procedure for superficial cysts and for lesions with a deep location. Laparoscopic cystectomy is a challenging procedure, even for surgeons with extensive open surgical experience and laparoscopic expertise. 32, 40 A major problem of laparoscopic surgery is control of bleeding; severe bleeding is inevitable when a large common boundary of the cyst with the liver parenchyma and proximity to large blood vessels are encountered.

Therefore, the laparoscopic approach to extensive and deep-seated cysts should be contraindicated. Based on our results, we recommend open cystectomy as the procedure of choice for SNHC, regardless of location. A procedure of the magnitude of hepatecomy should be restricted to the treatment of giant cysts that completely engulf the hepatic parenchyma and of complex recurrent cysts.
