## Question

A man is brought into the emergency department by police. The patient was found somnolent in the park and did not respond to questioning. The patient's past medical history is unknown, and he is poorly kempt. The patient's personal belongings include prescription medications and illicit substances such as alprazolam, diazepam, marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, acetaminophen, and a baggie containing an unknown powder. His temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 117/58 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 9/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical exam reveals pupils that do not respond to light bilaterally, and a somnolent patient who only withdraws his limbs to pain. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A. Flumazenil
B. N-acetylcysteine
C. Naloxone
D. Supportive therapy, thiamine, and dextrose

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an undifferentiated, comatose patient with suspected polydrug intoxication and severe respiratory depression, with a focus on selecting the best immediate intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about airway, breathing, and circulation stabilization. Then, I should verify which toxidrome features are present and how reliable the pupillary exam is in polydrug exposure. Next, I will examine the differential for the coma and respiratory depression and rank likely etiologies. After that, I should evaluate the pros and cons of candidate antidotes and decide whether to give naloxone. Finally, I need to ensure supportive measures and disposition plans are appropriate, including when to intubate and how to monitor for recurrence and complications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities: this patient is somnolent with respirations at 9/min and an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, so the immediate threats are hypoventilation and hypoxemia. I need to ensure airway patency and ventilatory support while simultaneously treating a reversible cause if one is identified, because opioid-induced respiratory depression is potentially rapidly reversible with naloxone and delays can lead to cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury [^112QGmLm] [^113MaVf6] [^111rU7mU].

> Wait, let me verify the pupillary findings before I jump to conclusions about an opioid toxidrome. Bilateral nonreactive pupils can reflect profound opioid toxicity, but miosis alone is not pathognomonic and the absence of a light reflex is not a reliable rule-out for opioids, particularly with polydrug exposure or hypoxia, and hypercarbia can paradoxically blunt the light reflex even when pupils are constricted, so I should not overinterpret nonreactive pupils as excluding opioids [^111y97s9] [^116xR6wQ] [^111rU7mU] [^1152E5Kp].

> Hold on, I should review the full toxidrome and the differential. The triad of CNS depression, respiratory depression, and constricted pupils strongly suggests opioid toxicity, and the history of benzodiazepines and alcohol on scene heightens the risk of mixed sedative-opioid overdose, which is common and particularly lethal due to synergistic respiratory depression, so opioids remain the most likely and immediately reversible contributor to his hypoventilation [^111rU7mU] [^111y97s9] [^116rVxWZ] [^113MaVf6].

> Let me consider alternative explanations and make sure I'm not missing them. Benzodiazepines alone typically do not cause miosis, though they can depress respirations and consciousness, and supportive care plus thiamine and dextrose is standard for undifferentiated coma but won't rapidly reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, while flumazenil is generally contraindicated in mixed overdoses due to seizure risk, and N-acetylcysteine is only relevant if there is confirmed acetaminophen toxicity with risk of hepatic injury, which I don't have evidence for here [^111GeDFM].

> I should double-check naloxone safety and strategy. Naloxone is the specific antidote for opioid-induced respiratory depression, and best practice is to use the lowest effective dose to restore adequate ventilation without precipitating severe withdrawal, with incremental dosing of 0.04–0.4 mg IV every 2–3 minutes until respiratory drive improves, because high-dose or too-rapid reversal can provoke agitation, vomiting, and leaving against medical advice, and I must be prepared to manage the airway and monitor for recurrent depression given naloxone's shorter half-life than most opioids [^111rU7mU] [^112K1c3c] [^111QKLio] [^114NviW6].

> Let me first confirm the airway plan. If the patient does not improve with naloxone or cannot protect the airway, I should proceed to endotracheal intubation, but if he awakens and ventilates adequately, I can continue close monitoring for re-sedation, as opioid durations often exceed naloxone's effect and re-dosing or an infusion may be required, especially with long-acting opioids or suspected fentanyl analogs [^112K1c3c] [^111rU7mU] [^1165Vyki].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to start with flumazenil because benzodiazepines are on scene. But hold on, I should verify that recommendation because flumazenil lowers seizure threshold in polydrug exposures and can precipitate withdrawal or seizures in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use, so it is not the best initial antidote here and naloxone remains first-line given the respiratory phenotype [^notfound].

> I need to ensure supportive care proceeds in parallel. After addressing airway and ventilation, I should obtain IV access, administer oxygen to correct hypoxemia, check bedside glucose, and consider thiamine before dextrose if malnutrition is plausible, while arranging continuous pulse oximetry and, if available, capnography to track ventilatory adequacy, and I should draw basic labs including an acetaminophen level once the patient is stabilized to screen for hidden hepatotoxic risk [^111GeDFM] [^1134QhKE].

> But wait, what if the pupils truly do not react at all? Could this be pontine pathology rather than toxidrome? I should confirm that the neurologic examination in coma has limited specificity and that polydrug intoxication commonly produces atypical or blunted brainstem reflexes, so a negative light reflex in this context does not exclude opioid toxicity, and the risk-benefit still favors a naloxone trial while I continue supportive stabilization and arrange imaging only if the course deviates from expected toxidrome resolution [^113FsECM] [^1152E5Kp].

> Final decision: administer naloxone now with low, incremental dosing while securing the airway and providing ventilatory support as needed, because opioids are the most likely and immediately reversible cause of this patient's respiratory depression and coma, and early naloxone is lifesaving. I will monitor closely for recurrence and be prepared to escalate airway management and continue supportive care, including thiamine and dextrose after appropriate evaluation, while deferring flumazenil and N-acetylcysteine unless specific indications emerge [^111rU7mU] [^112K1c3c] [^111GeDFM].

---

The best next step is **naloxone** because the patient presents with the classic opioid toxidrome: respiratory depression, altered mental status, and miosis [^111y97s9] [^111rU7mU]. Naloxone is the specific antidote for opioid overdose and should be administered immediately to reverse respiratory depression and prevent progression to hypoxic injury or cardiac arrest [^1165Vyki] [^114NviW6]. Flumazenil is not indicated due to the risk of seizures in mixed overdoses, and N-acetylcysteine is not urgent unless acetaminophen toxicity is confirmed [^notfound]. Supportive care, thiamine, and dextrose are important but should follow naloxone administration [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and toxidrome analysis

The patient presents with:

- **Respiratory depression**: 9 breaths per minute (normal 12–20).
- **Altered mental status**: Somnolent, withdraws only to pain.
- **Miosis**: Pinpoint pupils unresponsive to light [^1152E5Kp].
- **Hypoxia**: Oxygen saturation 91% on room air [^116dXS1V].

These findings constitute the **opioid toxidrome**, characterized by respiratory depression, altered mental status, and miosis [^111y97s9]. Although miosis is a hallmark of opioid toxicity, it is not pathognomonic and can be absent in certain opioids (e.g. meperidine, propoxyphene) or with co-ingestants [^111rU7mU]. The combination of respiratory depression, altered mental status, and miosis strongly suggests opioid overdose [^111y97s9].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for this presentation includes:

- **Opioid overdose**: Strongly suggested by the triad of respiratory depression, altered mental status, and miosis [^111rU7mU].
- **Benzodiazepine overdose**: Can cause respiratory depression and altered mental status but typically does not cause miosis [^113Xr72x].
- **Mixed overdose**: Combination of opioids and benzodiazepines, which can exacerbate respiratory depression [^113JPZFd].
- **Acetaminophen overdose**: Does not typically cause respiratory depression or altered mental status acutely [^111JScqC].
- **Other sedative-hypnotics**: Barbiturates or non-benzodiazepine hypnotics can cause respiratory depression and altered mental status but do not typically cause miosis [^111JScqC].

Given the clinical presentation and the presence of opioids in the patient's belongings, **opioid overdose is the most likely diagnosis** [^111y97s9].

## Management options

The following management options are considered:

| **Option** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Flumazenil | Benzodiazepine overdose | - Specific antidote for benzodiazepines <br/> - Risk of seizures in mixed overdoses <br/> - Not indicated here [^notfound] |
| N-acetylcysteine | Acetaminophen overdose | - Antidote for acetaminophen toxicity <br/> - Not indicated acutely without evidence of acetaminophen ingestion [^notfound] |
| Naloxone | Opioid overdose | - Specific antidote for opioids <br/> - Reverses respiratory depression and altered mental status [^112QGmLm] |
| Supportive care, thiamine, dextrose | General supportive care | - Important but not specific <br/> - Should follow administration of naloxone [^notfound] |

---

## Rationale for naloxone administration

Naloxone is the **specific antidote for opioid overdose** [^1165Vyki]. It competitively antagonizes opioid receptors, rapidly reversing respiratory depression, altered mental status, and miosis [^1165Vyki]. Immediate administration is critical to prevent progression to hypoxic injury, cardiac arrest, and death [^112QGmLm]. Current guidelines recommend naloxone as the first-line treatment for suspected opioid overdose with respiratory depression [^114NviW6].

---

## Risks and benefits of naloxone administration

Benefits include rapid reversal of respiratory depression, prevention of hypoxic injury, and restoration of consciousness [^1165Vyki]. Risks include precipitated withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, which may manifest as agitation, anxiety, and autonomic instability [^112K1c3c]; these are generally manageable and outweighed by the benefits of reversing life-threatening respiratory depression [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), and National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) **strongly recommend naloxone as the first-line treatment** for suspected opioid overdose with respiratory depression [^112QGmLm] [^114NviW6]. These guidelines emphasize the importance of rapid administration, supportive care, and monitoring for recurrent respiratory depression due to the shorter duration of naloxone compared to opioids [^112K1c3c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best next step in the management of this patient is to administer **naloxone** immediately. The patient's presentation is classic for opioid overdose, and naloxone is the specific antidote that will rapidly reverse respiratory depression and altered mental status. Supportive care, thiamine, and dextrose should follow naloxone administration to address potential co-ingestants and underlying medical conditions [^113TPnUf].

### Pharmacologic management of daytime sleepiness [^117WqfZF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal sleep-wake patterns are becoming increasingly pervasive in modern society. The major causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include pathologic abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia; deficiencies in quality or quantity of sleep, such as those caused by sleep apnea and poor sleep hygiene; disturbances to the body's natural circadian rhythm, such as those caused by shift work or jet lag; and drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps. Although the medications available to improve daytime wakefulness (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, pemoline, and modafinil) are effective, they are not a substitute for sleep. Finally, timely follow-up is necessary to monitor treatment adherence, response, and side effects.

### Benzodiazepine… [^114ZfqZM]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

A minority of people have paradoxical reactions after taking benzodiazepines such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for as-needed use, which is under-studied, but probably safe and effective to the extent that it involves intermittent short-term use. In an overdose, benzodiazepines can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness, but are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. Combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases significantly. Benzodiazepines are commonly used recreationally and also often taken in combination with other addictive substances, and are controlled in most countries.

Medical uses Benzodiazepines possess psycholeptic, sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, which are useful in a variety of indications such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines.

Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies. Older adults should not use benzodiazepines to treat insomnia unless other treatments have failed. When benzodiazepines are used, patients, their caretakers, and their physician should discuss the increased risk of harms, including evidence that shows twice the incidence of traffic collisions among driving patients, and falls and hip fracture for older patients. Seizures Prolonged convulsive epileptic seizures are a medical emergency that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices.

In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable. Benzodiazepines are the preferred choice in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.
- Benzodiazepines are indicated in the management of breathlessness in advanced diseases, in particular where other treatments have failed to adequately control symptoms.
- Benzodiazepines are effective as medication given a couple of hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure.

### Excessive daytime sleepiness: considerations for the psychiatrist [^114ZGNVU]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness or pathologic sleepiness is a complaint found in patients who experience somnolence at unwanted times and adversely affects their daytime function. Although psychiatric illness, chronic medical illness, or medication side effects may be causes for fatigue, insufficient sleep is the most common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness in the general population. When an individual complains of frank sleepiness, in addition to insufficient sleep, important considerations in these patients are disturbances in the normal homeostatic mechanisms that govern sleep and wakefulness. This article summarizes the clinical presentation, the differential diagnosis, commonly used diagnostic tools, and treatment options for patients complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness.

Background

Drug overdoses are a major public health issue. The emergence of new synthetic drugs is making their management more complex, combining difficulties in clinical diagnosis, in identifying the substance and in treatment. Protonitazene, an emerging synthetic drug, combines these three difficulties, even though an effective antidote exists.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with FIORICET with CODEINE can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms attributable to acute barbiturate poisoning include drowsiness, confusion, and coma; respiratory depression; hypotension; and hypovolemic shock.

Toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of: pinpoint pupils, depression of respiration, and loss of consciousness. Convulsions may occur.

In acetaminophen overdosage: dose dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post ingestion. Acute caffeine poisoning may cause insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and delirium, tachycardia, and extrasystoles.

### Why you may need a neurologist to see a comatose patient in the ICU [^1152E5Kp]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Neurologic examination is more than a coma scale

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a trauma tool and has made a major difference in communication to neurosurgeons. The GCS is not a neurologic examination. Important elements in neurologic examinations, such as spontaneous eye movements, brainstem-reflex testing, and assessment of abnormal movements and tone, are not included, and these assessments are potentially relevant. The reliability of the GCS is questionable. Alternatively, the FOUR Score provides considerably more useful information but is also not a full neurologic examination of the comatose patient. Many subtleties may swing one way or another, but initially in a comatose patient, the motor responses and brainstem reflexes can be considered together and lead to decisions on tests that narrow the probable causes of coma If any, it is crucial to identify an embolus to the basilar artery which can be removed endovascularly (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Initial thoughts on coma in the ICU. This algorithm is a simplification of clinical practice. Localization and withdrawal motor responses are most probably not associated with brainstem involvement, and therefore the dichotomy is made. Once abnormal brainstem reflexes are found, two options are likely — acute hemispheric mass or acute brainstem lesion. Bihemispheric injury is structural or physiological and further differentiated into specific locations and suggestions for tests. ABG arterial blood gas, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, CT computed tomography, CTA computed tomography angiography, EEG electroencephalogram, SAH Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Confounders are found everywhere

Evaluating coma has not become any easier. The analgosedative protocols have improved care but have not been "friendly" to neurologists. Drugs linger particularly in patients treated with targeted temperature management or in those with multiorgan failure. Neurologists can determine whether certain signs are more suggestive of new structural injury than drug-induced dysfunction. It is no exaggeration to say that most misjudgments of coma occur when there has been prior drug use or sedation.

Not all pupils are alike

Most literature compares clinical examination of pupillary reflex with quantitative pupillometry (often comparing nursing staff with a device), but ICU studies fail to describe pupil size with pupil light reflex such as mid-position pupils or, the most important localizing finding, anisocoria. We care less about very wide or pinpoint pupils. Extremely wide pupils often respond and are medication induced. Pinpoint pupils often do not respond, artifactually, and are also commonly opioid related.

### Buprenorphine [^113wRpTH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Buprenorphine sublingual tablets contain buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient's level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

5.2 Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression

Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threating respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, postmarketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuses by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)].

Use buprenorphine sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression).

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].

### Naloxone dosing in the era of synthetic opioids: applying the goldilocks principle [^111QKLio]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementing a tailored approach

The real challenge lies in applying the principle of naloxone administration effectively for non‐medically trained individuals under pressure. Striking a balance between effective overdose reversal and minimizing adverse effects is vital, yet it presents unique difficulties in community settings. Naloxone should not be the first intervention in opioid emergencies; basic first aid — such as clearing the airway, physical stimulation, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — is essential. Training for both medical and non‐medical responders, along with policy development, must prioritize this chain of care. Ignoring these steps risks disconnecting science and policy from the real‐world treatment of patients with reduced consciousness and abnormal breathing.

To enable tailored dosing, especially by non‐medical individuals, attention must be given to alerting emergency services, providing first aid and using incremental dosing. After the initial dose careful monitoring of the patient's response is needed, focusing on respiratory rate, consciousness, pupil size and heart rate. Frequent reassessment is essential, with additional doses administered as needed to reverse respiratory depression without causing severe withdrawal. Smaller doses (e.g. 0.1–0.2 mg) can be given every 2–3 minutes until the desired effect is achieved.

Given the potential for re‐sedation with the longer half‐life of many opioids compared with naloxone, ongoing monitoring of the person who overdosed is essential. This is particularly important in cases involving long‐acting opioids. Factors such as the individual's opioid tolerance, the specific opioid involved and any co‐ingested substances should be taken into account.

This approach to naloxone administration has several advantages. Gradual opioid reversal may enhance patient comfort and improve cooperation with further treatment, reducing the likelihood of patients leaving against medical advice and allowing for more comprehensive care. Minimizing severe withdrawal symptoms could lower the risk of agitation or aggression, improving safety for both patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, this method is adaptable to diverse overdose scenarios, accommodating cases requiring minimal intervention as well as severe overdoses needing higher total doses.

### Initial diagnosis and management of coma [^113aVrK2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Coma represents a true medical emergency. Drug intoxications are a leading cause of coma; however, other metabolic disturbances and traumatic brain injury are also common causes. The general emergency department approach begins with stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by a thorough physical examination to generate a limited differential diagnosis that is then refined by focused testing. Definitive treatment is ultimately disease-specific. This article presents an overview of the pathophysiology, causes, examination, and treatment of coma.

### Suvorexant (Belsomra) [^112Jss8T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is limited premarketing clinical experience with an overdosage of BELSOMRA. In clinical pharmacology studies, healthy subjects who were administered morning doses of up to 240 mg of suvorexant showed dose-dependent increases in the frequency and duration of somnolence.

General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. As in all cases of drug overdose, vital signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined. As suvorexant is highly protein-bound, hemodialysis is not expected to contribute to elimination of suvorexant.

As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. Consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.

Recommendations — clinical assessment for substance withdrawal outline required steps and timing. All individuals who are referred for immediate clinical assessment for substance withdrawal should be assessed by a qualified health care professional. The initial clinical assessment should: Identify any emergent medical or psychiatric needs; Evaluate current withdrawal signs and symptoms; Evaluate risk for severe or complicated withdrawal; Assess risk for suicide; Determine the appropriate level of care. All individuals at risk for withdrawal should be assessed for substance use disorder (SUD). If patients are unable to engage in the full clinical assessment due to intoxication or withdrawal, they should be assessed for immediate clinical needs. The full assessment should be completed once their intoxication or withdrawal symptoms have resolved.

Naloxone administration and airway management — Naloxone should be administered to those with objective signs of hypoventilation from opioid intoxication. If hypoventilation persists following the initial naloxone dose and personnel with advanced airway training are not available, repeat naloxone until reversal is seen or 10 mg is administered; do not administer additional naloxone for failure to awaken, only for failure to breathe. Personnel with advanced airway training should provide airway support for patients who are in extremis or those who do not improve with naloxone.

Background

Opioid analgesics are widely used in health care, yet have significant potential for abuse. High doses are associated with potentially fatal respiratory depression, which caused 21,314 deaths in the United States in 2011. Acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid agonist closely related to fentanyl, recently emerged as a drug of abuse linked to numerous deaths in North America.

Case Report

A 36-year-old male developed the habit of using a propylene glycol electronic cigarette filled with acetylfentanyl to aid relaxation. He purchased the drug online in a manner that appeared legal to him, which compromised his insight about the danger of the substance. He had been using the e-cigarette with increasing frequency while on medical leave, and his wife reported finding him weakly responsive on more than one occasion. At approximately 3 am, the family activated 911 for altered mental status. His presentation included respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils, hypoxemia, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. He responded to serial doses of intravenous naloxone with improvement in his mental status and respiratory condition. Due to the need for repeated dosing, he was placed on a naloxone infusion and recovered uneventfully in intensive care. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Complications from emerging drugs of abuse, like acetylfentanyl, frequently present first to emergency departments. Prompt recognition and treatment can help avoid morbidity and mortality. Acetylfentanyl can be managed effectively with naloxone, although higher than conventional dosing may be required to achieve therapeutic effect.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (Ultram ER) [^113o4Xub]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute overdosage with tramadol can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and death.

Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of tramadol by ingesting, inhaling, or injecting the crushed tablets. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when tramadol is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids.

In the treatment of tramadol overdosage, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation.

While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of ULTRAM ER could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period.

### Clinical progress note: management of the hospitalized patient who uses methamphetamine [^1113REGZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHAMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

Acute methamphetamine withdrawal (sometimes referred to as "washout") is characterized by increased sleepiness and appetite along with dysphoria, inactivity, irritability, and vivid dreams. Hypersomnia in particular can be significant and persistent, peaking at 72 h after abstinence and lasting for up to 1 week. Treatment is largely supportive by allowing patients to rest, managing acute medical issues, and providing symptom‐based treatment. Following the acute withdrawal period, many patients experience a protracted postacute withdrawal syndrome lasting up to 6 months. This period is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, dysphoria, anxiety, and cravings. Medical management of methamphetamine withdrawal has been attempted with agents such as modafinil, methylphenidate, and mirtazapine, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of these medications.

The hypersomnia associated with methamphetamine withdrawal can complicate the assessment of patients who are experiencing concurrent opioid toxicity or withdrawal. In contrast to opioid toxicity, somnolence related to methamphetamine withdrawal should not cause hypoventilation and hypercarbia. When caring for patients who use both methamphetamine and opioids, hospitalists should remain vigilant for opioid withdrawal symptoms and treat them with guideline‐recommended medications including methadone, buprenorphine, and nonopioid adjuncts.

### Multiple fentanyl overdoses-new haven, Connecticut, June 23, 2016 [^114P9rcV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Shortly after 4:00 p.m. on June 23, 2016, four patients with symptoms and signs of opioid overdose, characterized by central nervous system and respiratory depression, miosis (pinpoint pupil constriction), hypotension, and bradycardia, arrived in rapid succession at the York Street Campus (two patients) and St. Raphael Campus (two patients) EDs of Yale New Haven Hospital in downtown New Haven. Within 6 hours, seven additional patients arrived at the York Street Campus ED and one more at the St. Raphael ED; these patients included two who were pronounced dead on arrival and four critically ill patients requiring endotracheal intubation and ICU admission (Figure). The patients represented four geographic clusters (i.e. at least one other victim found in the same vehicle or parking lot, or in the same house or an adjacent house), and were transported by EMS crews responding to bystander 911 calls. All of the patients had clinical signs of opioid overdose and received at least one dose of naloxone from EMS (Table 1). Twelve patients met the case definition for suspected fentanyl exposure (i.e. clinical signs of opioid toxicity and response to naloxone, with laboratory confirmation of fentanyl or fentanyl metabolites in blood, or history of direct association with a laboratory-confirmed fentanyl exposure) (Table 1). Among the four patients admitted to the ICU, three required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure that was relatively refractory to large doses of naloxone, and one required a continuous naloxone infusion for 12 hours. Two of the three intubated patients suffered acute kidney injury and pulmonary or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, one of whom (patient K) died 3 days later from multisystem organ failure. The third patient survived with permanent cardiac injury. Other intoxicated patients who arrived at the ED with signs or symptoms of the opioid toxidrome were excluded from this analysis because of inconsistent history (e.g. patient reported using a nonfentanyl opioid) or toxicology test results that did not identify fentanyl.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114KSFp9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant withdrawal — Abrupt discontinuation or reduction in stimulant use can cause stimulant withdrawal syndrome, and many patients will experience 12 to 24 hours of somnolence and irritability — likely due to catecholamine depletion and sleep deprivation. During periods of abrupt stimulant reduction or discontinuation, clinicians should be attentive to the patient's physical and mental health signs and symptoms. The current standard of care for managing stimulant withdrawal focuses on ameliorating presenting signs and symptoms and minimizing risks. Behavioral and environmental interventions should be used to foster a calming environment.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. diagnosis of drug overdose by rapid reversal with naloxone [^116DyNWm]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to establish whether naloxone may have an awakening effect in patients who have not taken opiates, thereby clouding its use as a diagnostic manoeuvre. The clinical bottom line is that opioid antagonists are able to reverse symptoms such as altered consciousness in patients who have not taken an overdose of opiates. It is unclear in which conditions or circumstances this occurs.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^117RzUvk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Butalbital, acetaminophen, caffeine and codeine phosphate [^116g6Hpn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with codeine can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms attributable to acute barbiturate poisoning include drowsiness, confusion, and coma; respiratory depression; hypotension; and hypovolemic shock.

Toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of: pinpoint pupils, depression of respiration, and loss of consciousness. Convulsions may occur.

In acetaminophen overdosage: dose dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post ingestion. Acute caffeine poisoning may cause insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and delirium, tachycardia, and extrasystoles.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate [^114bmous]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and death. Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication.

Treatment of Overdose

In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. An opioid overdose reversal agent may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.

### A pilot study of automated pupillometry in the treatment of opioid use disorder [^113Zi1Mo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

This study enrolled 27 patients between March and December 2018. Two patients who initially consented to participate decided to withdraw when study personnel returned to obtain pupillometry measurements – both reported feeling unwell as the reason to withdraw. The remaining 25 patients completed all pupillometry measurements (see Table 1 for patient demographics). All patients reported opioid use (confirmed on urine toxicology). Additionally, 20 of 25 participants had full urine toxicology screening performed with 11 (55%) testing positive for cocaine, 7 (35%) positive for benzodiazepine, 4 (20%) positive for amphetamine, and 4 (20%) positive for barbiturate.

TABLE 1
Patient Demographics and Treatment Details

At the time of pupillometry measurement, 18 patients had already received at least 1 dose of OAT for OUD and were having their dose further titrated, while 7 patients were initiating OAT for OUD. Nineteen patients received methadone treatment (mean dose 41.3 mg, range 10–80 mg) and 6 received buprenorphine-naloxone (all at 8 mg-2 mg). The mean COWS score was 3.56 ± 3.60 predosing and 1.32 ± 3.22 60 minutes postdosing. The majority of patients had good control of their withdrawal symptoms (score < 5) at the postdosing COWS measurement, with only 2 patients continuing to score in the "mild" range (score 5–12) and 1 at the "moderate" level (score 13–24).

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^113o7Uso]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 48,000 exposures to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected ingestion of an SSRI by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of an SSRI might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of SSRI ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of immediate-release forms of SSRIs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances might require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department. This activity should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) Any patient already experiencing any symptoms other than mild effects (mild effects include vomiting, somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch], mydriasis, or diaphoresis) should be transported to an emergency department. Transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 3) Asymptomatic patients or those with mild effects (defined above) following isolated unintentional acute SSRI ingestions of up to five times an initial adult therapeutic dose (i.e., citalopram 100 mg, escitalopram 50 mg, fluoxetine 100 mg, fluvoxamine 250 mg, paroxetine 100 mg, sertraline 250 mg) can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop. For patients already on an SSRI, those with ingestion of up to five times their own single therapeutic dose can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) The poison center should consider making follow-up calls during the first 8 hours after ingestion, following its normal procedure. Consideration should be given to the time of day when home observation will take place. Observation during normal sleep hours might not reliably identify the onset of toxicity. Depending on local poison center policy, patients could be referred to an emergency department if the observation would take place during normal sleeping hours of the patient or caretaker (Grade D). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 6) The use of oral activated charcoal can be considered since the likelihood of SSRI-induced loss of consciousness or seizures is small. However, there are no data to suggest a specific clinical benefit. The routine use of out-of-hospital oral activated charcoal in patients with unintentional SSRI overdose cannot be advocated at this time (Grade C). 7) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (> 104 degrees F [> 40 degrees C]) for SSRI-induced serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C).

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (Endocet) [^115ihhyV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on ENDOCET who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see WARNINGS; Withdrawal, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].

### Diazepam… [^112L5XVK]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Medical uses Diazepam is mainly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks, and symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal. It is also used as a premedication for inducing sedation, anxiolysis, or amnesia before certain medical procedures. In 2020, it was approved for use in the United States as a nasal spray to interrupt seizure activity in people with epilepsy.
- Treatment of complications with stimulant overdoses and psychosis, such as cocaine or methamphetamine Used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning and reduces the risk of seizure-induced brain and cardiac damage.
- Preventive treatment of oxygen toxicity during hyperbaric oxygen therapy Dosages are typically determined on an individual basis, depending on the condition being treated, the severity of symptoms, the patient's body weight, and any other conditions the person may have.

The anticonvulsant effects of diazepam can help in the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to sarin, VX, or soman, lindane, chloroquine, physostigmine, or pyrethroids.
- Psychosis
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- Caution required in elderly or debilitated patients
- Coma or shock
- Abrupt discontinuation of therapy
- Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
- History of alcohol or drug dependence
- Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder causing marked fatiguability
- Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class.
- Elderly and very ill patients can experience apnea or cardiac arrest. Concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants increases this risk.

The smallest possible effective dose is generally used for this group of people. The elderly metabolise benzodiazepines much more slowly than younger adults, and are also more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Adverse effects Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, can cause anterograde amnesia, confusion, and sedation. The elderly are more prone to diazepam's confusion, amnesia, ataxia, hangover symptoms, and falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, induces tolerance, dependency, and withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam impairs short-term memory and learning new information.

Diazepam and other benzodiazepines can produce anterograde amnesia, but not retrograde amnesia, which means information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Short-term benzodiazepine use does not lead to tolerance, and the elderly are more sensitive to them. Less commonly, paradoxical reactions can occur, including nervousness, irritability, excitement, worsening of seizures, insomnia, muscle cramps, changes in libido, and in some cases, rage and violence. These adverse reactions are more likely to occur in children, the elderly, and individuals with a history of a substance use disorder, such as an alcohol use disorder, or a history of aggressive behavior. In some people, diazepam may increase the propensity toward self-harming behavior and, in extreme cases, may provoke suicidal tendencies or acts. Very rarely dystonia can occur. Diazepam may impair the ability to drive vehicles or operate machinery.

### Triazolam [^113JPZFd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Model EMS protocol relating to naloxone administration by EMS personnel [^111rU7mU]. NASEMSO (2019). High credibility.

Naloxone EMS protocol — assessment findings and precautions state that in the opioid overdose scenario, signs and symptoms include respiratory depression, decreased mental status, and miosis (pinpoint pupils) with the majority of opioids, noting that miosis is not a clinical finding in meperidine or propoxyphene overdoses. Additional assessment precautions note increased risk of respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest, hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypercarbia, and aspiration when other substances have also been taken. Pediatric considerations add that the signs and symptoms may be seen in newborns from mothers with recent or chronic opioid use, and that neonates administered naloxone for presumed intrauterine opioid exposure may be narcotic dependent and should be monitored closely for seizures.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^114f9oTw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication.

Treatment of Overdose

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require advanced life-support measures.

For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalmefene.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXAYDO, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### Opioid toxidrome following grapefruit juice consumption in the setting of methadone maintenance [^113uNS5J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Methadone is a synthetic mu-opioid receptor agonist used in the treatment of chronic pain and opioid dependence. Methadone is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes; primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6 before renal and fecal elimination. Exposure to substances like grapefruit juice, that inhibit these isoenzymes may result in increased blood levels of methadone, and thus may manifest clinically as unexpected opioid toxicity.

Case

A 51-year-old male was found unresponsive. He was hypoxic and bradypneic with pinpoint pupils. Multiple boluses followed by infusion of naloxone were required before improvement of respiratory status. Upon awakening, the patient reported participating in an opioid treatment program where he is administered 90 mg of oral methadone daily and denied any other substance use. On further questioning, he admitted to drinking grapefruit juice (estimated to be approximately 500 mL/day) every day for 3 consecutive days before presentation. The patient was discharged home after being counseled to stop drinking grapefruit juice.

Discussion

Grapefruit juice is known to be an inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Various studies demonstrate that through CYP3A4 inhibition, grapefruit juice increases serum levels of opioids, such as methadone, though no clinically significant effects have been reported.

Conclusions

Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism of methadone, raising its serum levels. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which the interaction between grapefruit juice and methadone was significant enough to cause an opioid toxidrome. It is, therefore, recommended that opioid treatment programs (OTPs) advise patients about this interaction before administering methadone.

A 4-day-old breastfed infant presented with opioid intoxication resulting from the maternal use of oxycodone after cesarean delivery. The infant was hypothermic, lethargic, and had pinpoint pupils. A dose of naloxone reversed the symptoms. This report highlights the importance of recognizing the potential effects of maternal oxycodone on the breastfed neonate in the emergency department setting.

### Intrathecal drug delivery systems survey: trends in utilization in pain practice [^1177jJuR]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In those surveyed, 84.9% of providers incorporate IDDS in their practice to some degree with 72.9% of providers performing intrathecal trials. Of those that do trials, the majority of providers perform a single shot intrathecal injection (78.3%) while 21.7% perform an indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheter for trial. The type of trial medication used and the admission status of single shot trial patients were not surveyed. Previous studies have found no superiority among trialing methods though the consensus recommendation was trials using opioids require inpatient overnight monitoring and single dose opioid trial is not considered best practice.

Interestingly, of those that perform a continuous catheter trial, 70% admit the patient to the hospital while 30% send the patient home the same day. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia published a 2016 practice guidelines for prevention, detection, and management of respiratory depression associated with neuraxial opioid administration. Though not specific for IDDS and was more reflective of perioperative neuraxial opioid use, it was recommended for patients receiving lipophilic opioids to be monitored for at least 2 hours after administration with further monitoring as indicated by patient presentation. Twenty four hour monitoring was recommended for patients who were treated with hydrophilic opioids though no differences in frequency of respiratory depression, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide, somnolence or sedation was seen when single injection morphine was compared to fentanyl or sufentanil.

### Accidental protonitazene intoxication: clinical management and detection of a novel opioid [^111UYGhM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

At the start of the treatment, an intoxication due to a more conventional opiate was suspected. In France, and more generally in Europe, the main opiates encountered are morphine and heroin, more rarely sufentanyl, oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl.

Given the high dose of naloxone required to induce awakening and the small amount reportedly inhaled by the patient's companion (a few puffs), any of these substances were unlikely.

Co-intoxication was also a possibility but was also unlikely due to the complete reversal of symptoms after naloxone was administered.

These differential diagnoses were quickly ruled out after obtaining the standard toxicological screening, which came back negative for all the drugs mentioned above.

### Hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex [^112b38xB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Hydrocodone

Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.

Hydrocodone may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Chlorpheniramine

Signs and symptoms of chlorpheniramine overdosage may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation. Central toxic effects are characterized by agitation, anxiety, delirium, disorientation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, sedation, and seizures. Severe overdosage may produce coma, medullary paralysis, and death. Peripheral toxicity includes hypertension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, vasodilation, hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, urinary retention, and diminished gastrointestinal motility. Atropine-like signs and symptoms (dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, tachycardia, hallucinations, gastrointestinal symptoms, convulsions, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias and coma) may be observed.

### Opioid toxicity with underlying tumour lysis syndrome in a patient with CMML: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^1162D2rn]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Use of strong opioids like morphine as analgesics for painful conditions in haematological malignancies is a challenging task. We report a unique case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia presenting with opioid toxicity overlapping with tumour lysis syndrome. The patient was on hydroxyurea-based chemotherapy for the primary disease. She was receiving oral morphine for abdominal pain due to splenomegaly. She was brought to the emergency in unresponsive state with pinpoint pupils. Opioid overdose leading to unconsciousness was suspected as the first diagnosis. Further workup revealed a final diagnosis of tumour lysis syndrome overlapping with opioid overdose. The patient was ventilated and started on naloxone infusion, and supportive measures for managing tumour lysis were added. The patient gradually improved and was extubated on the fifth day of ventilation. This case presents several learning points for the treating physician. Haematological malignancies have a dynamic course of disease with waxing and waning tumour burden during the course of chemotherapy. This fact should be kept in mind when prescribing strong opioids like morphine on outpatient basis to these patients. Massive tumour cell lysis during the course of chemotherapy may precipitate tumour lysis syndrome and may lead to renal dysfunction which makes the patient susceptible to morphine-related adverse effects. Pain physician should keep a watch for therapy-related adverse effects to avoid diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma associated with coexisting features of these two fatal conditions.

### Codeine phosphate and chlorpheniramine maleate (tuxarin) [^115Rnvmm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Codeine

Acute overdose with codeine is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, hypoglycemia, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.

Codeine may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Chlorpheniramine

Signs and symptoms of chlorpheniramine overdosage may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation. Central toxic effects are characterized by agitation, anxiety, delirium, disorientation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, sedation, and seizures. Severe overdosage may produce coma, medullary paralysis, and death. Peripheral toxicity includes hypertension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, vasodilation, hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, urinary retention, and diminished gastrointestinal motility. Atropine-like signs and symptoms (dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, tachycardia, hallucinations, gastrointestinal symptoms, convulsions, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias and coma) may be observed.

Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia.

Toxic psychosis, a possible class effect from overdose of sedating antihistamines, has been reported.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115cJmpD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (carbamates, nerve agents, organophosphates) exposure — assessment and severity classification describes toxicity, symptom patterns, and grading. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents are highly toxic chemical agents and can rapidly be fatal, and patients with low-dose chronic exposures may have a more delayed presentation of symptoms; antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime) are effective if administered before circulation fails. The patient may develop miosis (pinpoint pupils), bronchospasm, bradycardia, vomiting, and excessive secretions in the form of tearing, salivation, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, urination, and bronchorrhea. Penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) will cause headache, confusion, generalized muscle weakness, seizures, and lethargy or unresponsiveness. Estimated level of exposure based upon signs and symptoms is categorized as mild (miosis alone or miosis and severe rhinorrhea), mild to moderate (localized swelling, muscle fasciculations, nausea and vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath), and severe (unconsciousness, convulsions, apnea or severe respiratory distress requiring assisted ventilation, flaccid paralysis). Onset of symptoms can be immediate with an exposure to a large amount of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

### The diagnostic value of the neurological examination in coma of unknown etiology [^113FsECM]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several reasons that may explain the shortcomings of the neurological examination as a diagnostic tool in unconscious patients. Ideally, primary structural brain pathologies underlying disorders of consciousness should be clinically detectable by abnormal neurological findings. However, even in patients with unimpaired consciousness, the sensitivity of many clinical tests such as testing for meningism is well below 100%. A recent meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 46.1% for nuchal rigidity in patients with suspected meningitis. A Cochrane review indicated a sensitivity of 75.5% for the jolt accentuation of headache, which decreased to 65.3% when patients with impaired consciousness were included.

Further, significant abnormal findings in unconscious patients are also found in patients without acute brain damage and systemic disorders. Obviously, constricted pupils are caused by opioid intoxication more often than by isolated pontine damage. But maybe less obviously, the whole range of possible metabolic disorders (depending on their severity) may also cause asymmetrical neurological abnormalities that may be misleading. Moreover, neurological abnormalities may have been pre-existing and may thus falsely suggest acute structural brain damage. Not knowing a patient's detailed past medical history, which is often the case early on in an emergency, may therefore also misdirect the course of management if major decisions are mainly based on clinical findings. Neurological abnormalities are thus generally not entirely specific for acute neurological causes.

Another problem is that many patients presenting with CUE have, in fact, more than just one underlying pathology that could explain the disorder. As reported earlier, one third of patients who were managed according to the same standard operating procedure were found to have multiple coma-explaining conditions. For example, subdural hemorrhage may have led to asymmetrical motor dysfunction. However, if this clinical information alone determines further management, equally pressing and coexisting disorders such as acute hepatic failure following chronic substance abuse and now severe acute intoxication may go undetected.

Furthermore, there is a significant interobserver variability associated with neurological observations in general and specifically so in unconscious patients. Subtle abnormalities are easily missed or underestimated while certain phenomena tend to be overestimated (e.g. minimal differences in pupil size, stiffness of the neck, spontaneous eye movements) or misread (e.g. directional vs. non-directional reaction to painful stimuli).

### A pilot study of automated pupillometry in the treatment of opioid use disorder [^1133ThK4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Dosing of OAT for the treatment of OUD varies widely based on individual tolerance and relies heavily on subjective measures of withdrawal. At our institution, we are fortunate to have physicians who are board-certified in addiction medicine to provide expert care to patients with OUD and nurses who are comfortable managing this patient population. However, much of the United States is still working to establish the necessary infrastructure to address the burgeoning demand for OUD treatment, particularly outside of urban centers. – Using automated pupillometry, we report that there is a small but significant change in pupil size detected soon after OAT dosing that is associated with good control of withdrawal symptoms. With future study, we hope that this objective measure can help to train or empower additional healthcare providers to manage opioid withdrawal and improve outcomes among patients with OUD.

### Buprenorphine: a primer for emergency physicians [^114BU6yA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The recent approval of office-based treatment for opioid addiction and US Food and Drug Administration approval of buprenorphine will expand treatment options for opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial micro opioid agonist and a weak kappa antagonist. It has a high affinity for the micro receptor, with slow dissociation resulting in a long duration of action and an analgesic potency 25 to 40 times more potent than morphine. At higher doses, its agonist effects plateau and it begins to behave more like an antagonist, limiting the maximal analgesic effect and respiratory depression. This "ceiling effect" confers a high safety profile clinically, a low level of physical dependence, and only mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation after prolonged administration. Suboxone contains a mixture of buprenorphine and naloxone. The naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually and is designed to discourage intravenous use. Subutex, buprenorphine only, will also be available primarily as an initial test dose. Clinicians will be using this drug for detoxification or for maintenance of opioid addiction. Patients with recent illicit opioid use may develop a mild precipitated withdrawal syndrome with the induction of buprenorphine. Acute buprenorphine intoxication may present with some diffuse mild mental status changes, mild to minimal respiratory depression, small but not pinpoint pupils, and relatively normal vital signs. Naloxone may improve respiratory depression but will have limited effect on other symptoms. Patients with significant symptoms related to buprenorphine should be admitted to the hospital for observation because symptoms will persist for 12 to 24 hours.

### Accidental protonitazene intoxication: clinical management and detection of a novel opioid [^1163mx1J]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A portable blood analysis system (i-STAT 1, that delivers lab-quality diagnostic results in minutes) revealed a venous pH of 6.97 of hypercapnic origin (pCO2 measured at 11.9 kPa) and venous lactates of 2.9 mM, suggestive of a significant drop in ventilatory minute volume related to the clinical bradypnoea.

The toxidrome, biological results and pharmacokinetics suggested an opiate-induced coma, instead of one induced by DMT consumption. Indeed, DMT is a powerful hallucinogen with a short half-life, known to produce mydriasis, psychomotor agitation, tachycardia and hypertension, but none of these signs were present in this case.

Orotracheal intubation was delayed until a naloxone reversal test could be performed.

A total of 4 ampoules of 0.4 mg naloxone each were administered directly intravenously, 1–2 min apart from each other.

After the first and second ampoule administration, no clinical changes were observed. After the third ampoule administration, the eyeballs refocused and the pupils became intermediate and reactive. However, the patient was still in a persistent GCS 3 unresponsive coma. Once the fourth ampoule was administered, the patient suddenly awoke and was in a very agitated state, requiring five people to restrain him. The patient spontaneously returned to a calm state after a few minutes.

On suspicion of opiate intoxication reversible after naloxone, the patient was referred to intensive care.

In intensive care, the patient was initially disoriented, but returned to his normal state within a few hours without any malfunction. Against medical advice, the patient was discharged the following day and returned home.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^112QGmLm]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Toxicology emergencies — opioid overdose background notes that opioid overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, with more than 80 000 people in the United States dying of opioid overdose in 2021 and a 14% increase in the age-adjusted death rate from opioid overdose in a single year; in the same year, 1.06 million people were treated in US EDs for nonfatal opioid overdose. Most overdoses are unintentional. Opioid overdose causes central nervous system depression (sleepiness, unresponsiveness) and respiratory depression (slowed and stopped breathing), which, if untreated, progresses to cardiac arrest. Naloxone is an antidote that reverses the effect of opioid overdose, restoring consciousness and breathing; it can be administered by multiple routes, and naloxone nasal spray is available in the United States without a prescription. Because it can be difficult to reliably ascertain the presence or absence of a pulse in the first aid setting, these guidelines follow the Opioid-Associated Emergency for Lay Responders Algorithm (Figure 6).

### Loperamide hydrochloride [^113kuaBN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Consider loperamide as a possible cause of cardiac arrhythmias in patients who may have a history of opioid abuse or recent ingestion of unknown drugs and in the differential diagnosis of unstable arrhythmias, prolonged QTc or QRS intervals, and Torsades de Pointes.

If loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity is suspected, promptly discontinue the drug and initiate therapy to manage and prevent cardiac arrhythmias and serious outcomes.

In many cases of loperamide overdosage, anti-arrhythmic medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate) were ineffective in resolving the arrhythmias and preventing further episodes of Torsades de Pointes. Electrical cardioversion and overdrive pacing, and isoproterenol continuous infusion were reported to manage QTc prolongation in the setting of overdose.

Laboratory Testing

Loperamide serum concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful to guide patient management.

CNS and Respiratory Depression

Symptoms

Cases of loperamide overdose (including relative overdose due to hepatic dysfunction), may cause opioid toxic effects including CNS depression (e.g., altered mental status, stupor, coordination disorders, somnolence, miosis, muscular hypertonia, respiratory depression), hypotension, urinary retention, and paralytic ileus. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, including respiratory depression, than adults.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^116rVxWZ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Leaders in musculoskeletal care need to develop specific strategies based on burden of disease. Other nonopioid medications should be used with an intent to obtain balanced patient comfort and safety. Some data have shown that the risk of dependency increases significantly with increasing duration of use. Every effort should be made to minimize prescription length.

The main cause of death in patients using opioids is respiratory depression. This can occur with any opioid regardless of the type or formulation. This deadly complication is dose and concentration dependent with many other variables such as opioid tolerance, body mass index, respiratory disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and concomitant medications. Patients with a history of opioid use are expected to require more opioids for adequate pain relief while experiencing fewer adverse events due to tolerance. Common non–life-threatening side effects seen in approximately 10% of patients prescribed immediate-release opioids are pruritus, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and somnolence. Addiction and abuse are complications often seen by psychiatrists or psychologists. Despite early, unsubstantiated claims of improved safety with long-acting opioids, the relative abuse and addiction potential with short-acting or long-acting opioids remains a question. Some evidence suggests that there is no difference in illicit drug use, misuse, or both when comparing long-acting versus short-acting opioids, suggesting that prescribing long-acting opioids will not reduce abuse potential. A contradictory study showed less drug-seeking behavior with extended-release formulations. Benzodiazepines should not be prescribed in conjunction with opioids because the risk of overdose and death increases significantly. There is a 3.9 times risk of overdose due to respiratory depression when opioids and benzodiazepines are prescribed at the same time.

### Pupillary effects of high-dose opioid quantified with infrared pupillometry [^112f1GBy]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The pupillary light reflex is a critical component of the neurologic examination, yet whether it is present, depressed, or absent is unknown in patients with significant opioid toxicity. Although opioids produce miosis by activating the pupillary sphincter muscle, these agents may induce significant hypercarbia and hypoxia, causing pupillary constriction to be overcome via sympathetic activation. The presence of either "pinpoint pupils" or sympathetically mediated pupillary dilation might prevent light reflex assessment. This study was designed to determine whether the light reflex remains quantifiable during opioid-induced hypercarbia and hypoxia.

Methods

Ten volunteers were administered remifentanil with a gradually increasing infusion rate and intermittent boluses, until the increasing respiratory depression produced an oxyhemoglobin saturation of 85% or less with associated hypercarbia. Subjects' heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide level were continuously recorded. Arterial blood gases and pupillary measures were taken before opioid administration, at maximal desaturation, and 15 min after recovery.

Results

The opioid-induced oxygen desaturation (≤ 85%) was associated with significant hypercarbia and evidence of sympathetic activation. During maximal hypoxia and hypercarbia, the pupil displayed parasympathetic dominance (2.5 ± 0.2 mm diameter) with a robust quantifiable light reflex. The reflex amplitude was linearly related to pupil diameter.

Conclusions

Opioid administration with significant accompanying hypercarbia and hypoxia results in pupil diameters of 2 to 3 mm and a reduced but quantifiable pupillary light reflex. The authors conclude that the pupillary examination and evaluation of the light reflex remain useful for neurologic assessment during opioid toxicity.

### Meperidine hydrochloride [^113vqwrU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation:

Acute overdose with meperidine hydrochloride can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial into xication.

Accumulation of normeperidine as in chronic use or possibly following introduction of a concomitant CYP3A4 inducer presents as excitatory syndrome including hallucinations, tremors, muscle twitches, dilated pupils, hyperactive reflexes, and convulsions.

Treatment of Overdose:

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measure.

For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid overdose reversal agent such as naloxone or nalm efene.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of meperidine in Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with hydromorphone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Treatment of Overdose

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent airway and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.

Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of hydromorphone in DILAUDID INJECTION, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116dXS1V]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — Opioid poisoning/overdose assessment describes that the IN route has the benefit of no risk of needle stick to the clinician, and patients with opioid overdose from fentanyl or fentanyl analogs may rapidly exhibit chest wall rigidity and require positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), in addition to multiple and/or larger doses of naloxone, to achieve adequate ventilation. In the opioid overdose scenario, signs and symptoms include miosis (pinpoint pupils), respiratory depression, and decreased mental status, and additional assessment precautions note increased risk of respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest and hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypercarbia, and aspiration when other substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines have also been taken. Pediatric considerations state that the signs and symptoms may also be seen in newborns of mothers with recent or chronic opioid use and that neonates administered naloxone for presumed intrauterine exposure may be narcotic dependent and should be monitored closely for seizures. Context on synthetic opioids includes that in the concentration in which it is legally manufactured (3 mg/mL), an intramuscular dose of 2 mL of carfentanil will sedate an elephant, and that synthetic opioids (i.e. W-18 are 10,000 times more potent than morphine) with many not detectable by routine toxicology screening assays.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Codrix) [^116Smn3E]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from codeine or acetaminophen.

Signs and Symptoms

Codeine: Toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of: pinpoint pupils, depression of respiration, and loss of consciousness. Convulsions may occur.

Acetaminophen: In acetaminophen overdosage: dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also occur.

Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.

In adults hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses of less than 10 grams, or fatalities with less than 15 grams.

### Morphine sulfate (MS contin) [^113AqbAm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on MS CONTIN who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### Fentanyl citrate [^1165Vyki]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with fentanyl can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Treatment of Overdose

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.

Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in Fentanyl Citrate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^113MaVf6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Opioid-related medical problems — key features include that opioid intoxication can include apathy, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment, pupillary constriction, and slurred speech, with decreased body temperature leading to cold clammy skin and cyanosis; blood pressure decreases and cardiac arrhythmias can occur, and synthetic opioids can lengthen the QT interval and cause cardiac arrhythmias. In overdose the person is unresponsive to external stimuli, has small or pinpoint but reactive pupils, and respiratory depression or apnea, and death may result; survivors can have anoxic brain injury with morbidities including peripheral neuropathy, movement disorders, intellectual impairment, and personality changes. Withdrawal from opioids can cause anxiety and irritability, restlessness, aching in legs and back, increased sensitivity to pain, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps, lacrimation and rhinorrhea, yawning, pupillary dilation, chills, and sweating, and opioid withdrawal can last for months and includes depressed mood and anhedonia, irritability, labile mood, stress intolerance, insomnia, and opioid craving. Opioid use is associated with lower nutrition, and a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests are recommended; chronic opioid use issues include lowered levels of testosterone with lowered libido, impotence, and amenorrhea; chronic constipation; and sleep disturbance.

### A pilot study of automated pupillometry in the treatment of opioid use disorder [^117NaFrC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To assess for differences in pupil size and reactivity between pre- and post-dosing measurements, we first generated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, quantiles) for each pupillometry variable at each time point. Next, we used mixed linear models for each variable to evaluate the pattern of mean values over time as the primary analysis aim. Because pupillometry measurements were obtained in both eyes for each subject at each time point, side (right or left) was included as an independent variable in each model in addition to time. We treated both time and side as categorical, nominally scaled main effects. We tested for the interaction of time and side in initial models and, ruling out interaction, proceeded to fit main effects only models with time and side as factors. Based on the main effects only models, we calculated mean pupillometry values averaged over both sides. We employed a covariance structure of compound symmetry in all models and adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Tukey-Kramer procedure for post hoc contrasts of specific time points subsequent to the finding of a significant main effect of time. We set a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 throughout to determine statistical significance. We performed all analyses using SAS for Windows, version 9.4.

Materials and methods

A 44-year-old man was found unconscious outdoors and admitted to the emergency department of a neighbouring hospital. On presentation, he was comatose (Glasgow Coma Score 3) with a blood pressure of 118/71 mm Hg, a heart rate of 117 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and an SpO 2 (percutaneous oxygen saturation) of 75%. His temperature was 36.5°C. Neurological examination showed hypotonic and hyporeflexic coma with pinpoint pupils. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Arterial blood gas analysis while breathing on room air showed a pH of 7.30, a PaO 2 (arterial oxygen pressure) of 56 mm Hg, PaCO 2 (arterial carbon dioxide pressure) of 48 mm Hg, and a serum bicarbonate concentration of 26 mmol/l. Other routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Plasma lactate concentration was 2.1 mmol/l. Significant improvement in consciousness level (Glasgow Coma Score 15) without mental confusion was obtained after an intravenous bolus injection of 0.3 mg of naloxone followed by a continuous 0.3-mg/hour infusion. The patient rapidly awoke and declared that he had intentionally ingested 240 mg (3.14 mg/kg) of methadone and 2 mg of flunitrazepam to relax. The delay between ingestion and admission to the hospital was estimated to be 2.7 hours. He had a history of heroin addiction with a maintenance treatment of 70 mg/day of methadone (confirmed by a prescription from his maintenance program centre) and occasional use of 2 mg of flunitrazepam. He suffered from depression, and a recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism was treated with neomercazole. He was transferred for monitoring to our intensive care unit (ICU). The attending physicians managed the patient according to the standard treatment guidelines currently used in our department. Naloxone infusion rate was progressively adapted, aiming to keep the patient calm with a normal mental status (Glasgow Coma Score 15) and a respiratory rate of more than 12 breaths per minute. Reduction in naloxone dose was systematically attempted, and when evidence of toxicity occurred, a return to the previous dose was made. Routine toxicological screening of blood and urine, including benzodiazepines, opiates, buprenorphine, cocaine, and tetrahydrocannabinol, was negative, except for methadone. This case outcome was favourable with an uneventful 48-hour ICU stay, except for an aspiration pneumonia treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for six days. The duration of naloxone intravenous infusion was 31 hours with a cumulative dose of 9.1 mg.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^116ieFYH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Hydrocodone

Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, hypoglycemia, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.

Hydrocodone may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Guaifenesin

Overdosage with guaifenesin can cause depression of the central nervous system. While present in polypharmacy overdoses, one case of overdose with only significant levels of guaifenesin has been reported. Symptoms included slurred speech, shallow respirations, reduced heart rate with rhythm sinus bradycardia, followed by asystole.

Treatment of Overdose

Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of OBREDON together with institution of appropriate therapy. Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.

The opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone in OBREDON, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of hydrocodone from the body.

### Management of pain and agitation in trauma [^116pt8Pb]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Polytrauma patients often require medications to treat pain, treat agitation, and facilitate painful procedures. Though analgesia will be deferred in obtunded patients in profound shock, reduced-dose opioids or ketamine should be administered to unstable patients with severe pain with good mental status. Agitation commonly complicates polytrauma presentations, and is treated according to the danger it presents to patient and staff. Severe agitation can be effectively managed with dissociative-dose ketamine, which facilitates ongoing resuscitation, including CT. Severely painful procedures can be effectively facilitated by propofol or dissociative-dose ketamine, with continuous attention to ventilation and application of a step-by-step response to hypoventilation.

### Morphine sulfate (Avinza) [^113apW56]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

AVINZA OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

Acute overdosage with morphine is manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, and death.

Treatment

Primary attention should be given to re-establishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation when overdose of an extended-release formulation such as AVINZA has been ingested. Elimination or evacuation of gastric contents may be necessary in order to eliminate unabsorbed drug. Before attempting treatment by gastric emptying or activated charcoal, care should be taken to secure the airway. Pure opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Since the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of AVINZA, the patient must be carefully monitored until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. AVINZA, as with other controlled delivery preparations in overdose situations, may continue to release morphine for 36 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, and management of an overdose should be monitored accordingly. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or only brief in nature, additional antagonist should be administered as directed by the manufacturer of the product.

Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to morphine overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on AVINZA. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome.

Opioid-Tolerant Individuals: In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Use of an opioid antagonist should be reserved for cases where such treatment is clearly needed. If it is necessary to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and titrated with smaller than usual doses.

Supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation.

Cough management — opioids and centrally acting antitussives in lung cancer notes that opioids are the best cough suppressants in patients with lung cancer, and codeine is the most widely used opioid for cough suppression; in advanced stages, intractable or troublesome cough should be treated with opioid agents, and caution should be exercised in prescribing graduated doses because of the risk of respiratory depression and hypotentation; dextromethorphan has been shown to be more effective than codeine in controlling cough, codeine has an effective dose-response relationship, and cough frequency in patients with advanced cancer is reduced with hydrocodone; in a double-blind RCT of nonproductive cough in 140 adults with primary lung cancer or metastatic cancer of the lungs, levodropropizine drops (75 mg tid) vs dihydrocodeine drops (10 mg tid) both significantly reduced subjective cough severity and night awakenings, with somnolence significantly lower with levodropropizine (8% vs 32%), suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile, though it is not available for use in the United States.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114p8u2K]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Patient evaluation — stimulant intoxication and withdrawal should begin with triage for acute complications, noting that no studies were identified that evaluated strategies for diagnosing or assessing stimulant intoxication or withdrawal and that recommendations are based on other guidelines and clinical expertise. In non-acute care settings, clinicians should conduct an initial assessment to identify any acute issues and complications, and a basic assessment of vital signs and focused mental status evaluation can determine the need for urgent or emergent treatment or referral. In acute toxicologic emergencies, standard management involves responding to urgent and emergent signs and symptoms, and completion of laboratory or toxicology tests should not preclude or delay initiating supportive treatment for suspected acute stimulant intoxication or withdrawal. After urgent concerns are addressed, patients should be given or referred for a comprehensive assessment including a stimulant-focused history and physical examination with relevant collateral information when available and an assessment of non-acute complications and sequelae; the extent of exam and medical workup should be based on presenting signs and symptoms and severity, clinical testing should be based on the history and physical exam findings, and a safety assessment of risk of harm to self and others should also be conducted.

### Dextromethorphan poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^113rVyFB]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of dextromethorphan by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of dextromethorphan might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of dextromethorphan ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the ingestion of dextromethorphan alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who exhibit more than mild effects (e.g., infrequent vomiting or somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch]) after an acute dextromethorphan ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Patients who have ingested 5–7.5 mg/kg should receive poison center-initiated follow-up approximately every 2 hours for up to 4 hours after ingestion. Refer to an emergency department if more than mild symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) Patients who have ingested more than 7.5 mg/kg should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 5) If the patient is taking other medications likely to interact with dextromethorphan and cause serotonin syndrome, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, poison center-initiated follow-up every 2 hours for 8 hours is recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients who are asymptomatic and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the time of ingestion can be observed at home (Grade C). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 8) Do not use activated charcoal at home. Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested overdoses of dextromethorphan within the preceding hour. Its administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 9) For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (> 104 degrees F, > 40 degrees C) for serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C). 11) Carefully ascertain by history whether other drugs, such as acetaminophen, were involved in the incident and assess the risk for toxicity or for a drug interaction.

### Possible unusual presentation of opioid side effect in a child: a case report [^113ejRSV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain was ruled out as pain killers and a fentanyl push did not relieve them. Additionally, low cardiac output was ruled out, as the patient was hemodynamically stable with good urine output, warm extremities and normal laboratory tests including serial lactate levels. Withdrawal was ruled out, as same symptoms were present since admission to PICU, she was maintained on opioids and midazolam for a short period of 3 days, and her symptoms did not resolve after low doses of fentanyl and midazolam pushes. Opioid toxicity was ruled out as she had normal size pupils on exam, no respiratory depression or change in her level of consciousness, no nausea or vomiting, and again these symptoms were present since post operative day 1. Opioid induced neurotoxicity syndrome was also ruled out, since symptoms were neither relieved after switching morphine to fentanyl, nor after stopping all the opioids nor after adding dexmedetomidine, and maintaining good fluid balance.

Prior to performing a computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out any bleeding post bypass surgery, she was given 0.1 mg/kg naloxone dose as a trial; after which she calmed down immediately, and was able to fixate her eyes, look at her mom, recognize her, point toward her milk, drink a little and slept. She woke up calmly the following morning with no signs of agitation. She could fixate, track and interact with her surroundings. The CT scan was within normal limits. She was followed closely and was back to her normal baseline within 2 days.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112K1c3c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Patient safety considerations for naloxone in opioid poisoning/overdose: The clinical opioid reversal effect of naloxone is limited and may end within an hour whereas opioids often have a duration of 4 hours or longer, so clinicians should monitor the patient for recurrent respiratory depression and decreased mental status. Patients with altered mental status secondary to an opioid overdose may become agitated or violent following naloxone administration due to opioid withdrawal therefore the goal is to use the lowest dose as possible to avoid precipitating withdrawal, and teams should be prepared for this potential scenario and take the appropriate measures in advance to ensure and maintain scene safety. EMS clinicians should be prepared to initiate airway management before, during, and after naloxone administration and to provide appropriate airway support until the patient has adequate respiratory effort.

### Coma… [^1122JLrd]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake–sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. The person may experience respiratory and circulatory problems due to the body's inability to maintain normal bodily functions. People in a coma often require extensive medical care to maintain their health and prevent complications such as pneumonia or blood clots. Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. Comas can be the result of natural causes, or can be medically induced.

Signs and symptoms General symptoms of a person in a comatose state are:

- Inability to voluntarily open the eyes
- A nonexistent sleep–wake cycle
- Lack of response to physical or verbal stimuli
- Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light
- Abnormal, difficulty, or irregular breathing or no breathing at all when coma was caused by cardiac arrest
- Scores between 3 and 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Causes Many types of problems can cause a coma. Forty percent of comatose states result from drug poisoning. Certain drug use under certain conditions can damage or weaken the synaptic functioning in the ascending reticular activating system and keep the system from properly functioning to arouse the brain. Secondary effects of drugs, which include abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, as well as abnormal breathing and sweating, may also indirectly harm the functioning of the ARAS and lead to a coma.

Given that drug poisoning is the cause for a large portion of patients in a coma, hospitals first test all comatose patients by observing pupil size and eye movement, through the vestibular–ocular reflex. The second most common cause of coma, which makes up about 25% of cases, is lack of oxygen, generally resulting from cardiac arrest. The central nervous system requires a great deal of oxygen for its neurons. Oxygen deprivation in the brain, or. Diagnosis Although diagnosis of coma is simple, investigating the underlying cause of onset can be rather challenging. As such, after gaining stabilization of the patient's airways, breathing and circulation various diagnostic tests, such as physical examinations and imaging tools are employed to access the underlying cause of the coma.

When an unconscious person enters a hospital, the hospital utilizes a series of diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. According to Young, the following steps should be taken when dealing with a patient possibly in a coma:

- Perform a general examination and medical history check
- Make sure the patient is in an actual comatose state and is not in a locked-in state or experiencing psychogenic unresponsiveness. Patients with locked-in syndrome present with voluntary movement of their eyes, whereas patients with psychogenic comas demonstrate active resistance to passive opening of the eyelids, with the eyelids closing abruptly and completely when the lifted upper eyelid is released.
- Find the site of the brain that may be causing coma (e.g., brainstem, back of brain.

### Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen (propoxyphene and acetaminophen) [^114L7kbP]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen is a combination product containing propoxyphene and acetaminophen. Overdose of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen may present with the signs and symptoms of propoxyphene overdose, acetaminophen overdose or both. Fatalities within the first hour of overdosage are not uncommon.

In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than do package inserts.

Initial consideration should be given to the management of the CNS effects of propoxyphene overdosage. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly.

Symptoms of Propoxyphene Overdosage

The manifestations of acute overdosage with propoxyphene are those of opioid overdosage. The patient is usually somnolent but may be stuporous or comatose and convulsing. Respiratory depression is characteristic. The ventilatory rate and/or tidal volume is decreased, which results in cyanosis and hypoxia. Pupils, initially pinpoint, may become dilated as hypoxia increases. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apnea may occur. Blood pressure and heart rate are usually normal initially, but blood pressure falls and cardiac performance deteriorates, which ultimately results in pulmonary edema and circulatory collapse, unless the respiratory depression is corrected and adequate ventilation is restored promptly. Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction delay may be present. A combined respiratory-metabolic acidosis occurs owing to retained CO2(hypercapnia) and to lactic acid formed during anaerobic glycolysis. Acidosis may be severe if large amounts of salicylates have also been ingested. Death may occur.

### Alprazolam… [^113Xr72x]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Common side effects include sleepiness, depression, suppressed emotions, mild to severe decreases in motor skills, hiccups, dulling or declining of cognition, decreased alertness, dry mouth, decreased heart rate, impairment of judgment, and decreased memory formation, depending on dosage. Some of the sedation and drowsiness may improve within a few days. Alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies such as cirrhosis, severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity, allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder, where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol.

Like all central nervous system depressants, alprazolam in larger-than-normal doses can cause significant deterioration in alertness and increase drowsiness, especially in those unaccustomed to the drug's effects.
- Anterograde amnesia
- Concentration problems
- Ataxia
- Dysarthria
- Disinhibition
- Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, ataxia, and vertigo

- Hallucinations.
- Jaundice
- Seizure
- Skin rash
- Respiratory depression
- Constipation
- Suicidal ideation or suicide
- Urinary retention
- Muscle weakness In September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration required that boxed warnings for all benzodiazepine medications be updated to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

Paradoxical reactions Although unusual, the following paradoxical reactions have been shown to occur:

- Aggression
- Mania, agitation, hyperactivity, and restlessness
- Rage and hostility
- Twitches and tremor. Dependence and withdrawal The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a substantial risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the short half-life and rapid onset of action may increase the risk of misuse. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior.

In 1992, Romach and colleagues reported that dose escalation is not a characteristic of long-term alprazolam users and that the majority of long-term alprazolam users change their initial pattern of regular use to one of symptom control only when required. Some common symptoms of alprazolam discontinuation include malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Alcohol is one of the most common interactions; alcohol and alprazolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another, which can cause severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. The more alcohol and alprazolam taken, the worse the interaction. Combination of alprazolam with the herb kava can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Plants in the genus Hypericum, including St. John's wort, conversely can lower the plasma levels of alprazolam and reduce its therapeutic effect.

### Atropa belladonna and opium (belladonna and opium) [^113rykfj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with belladonna and opium suppositories can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

Treatment of Overdose

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.

The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opium overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opium overdose.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of opium in belladonna and opium suppositories, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

### Pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (pentazocine and naloxone) [^114LaXEq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

Acute overdose with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.

For pentazocine alone in single doses above 60 mg there have been reports of the occurrence of nalorphine-like psychotomimetic effects such as anxiety, nightmares, strange thoughts, and hallucinations. Somnolence, marked respiratory depression associated with hypertension and tachycardia have also resulted as have seizures, hypotension, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and paresthesias. The respiratory depression is antagonized by naloxone (see Treatment). Circulatory failure and deepening coma may occur in more severe cases, particularly in patients who have also ingested other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedative/hypnotics, or antihistamines".

Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to pentazocine overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. As pentazocine is a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, larger doses of naloxone or nalmefene may be needed to reverse the effects of an overdose.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113ZGigH]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Recommendation O-26 — buprenorphine initiation and monitoring — states that buprenorphine should be initiated when the patient shows objective signs of opioid withdrawal; the patient should be monitored for precipitated withdrawal for at least 30 minutes after the initial administration of buprenorphine, and if precipitated withdrawal occurs and a prescriber is not immediately available to assess, the patient should be transferred to a hospital. A footnote notes that buprenorphine may be initiated prior to the emergence of objective signs of withdrawal when using a low-dose buprenorphine initiation protocol.

### Found down: approach to the patient with an unknown poisoning [^113TPnUf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 30% of poison exposures reported to centers each year are either referred to or initiated within a health care facility. Among these exposures, undifferentiated poisoned patients are among the most challenging cases faced in the emergency department. Airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs) is central to the management of unknown poisoned patient. After initial stabilization, taking a systematic approach presented here may be beneficial to the clinician. This includes considering key additional history, a possible toxidrome, and data in the form of vital signs, physical examination, laboratory analysis, ECG, and imaging. After which a tailored approach to supportive care, decontamination, possible antidotes, and enhanced elimination techniques will improve outcomes.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual [^113yFfC1]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and death.

In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.

Stimulant intoxication — mild stimulant intoxication can typically be managed with behavioral and environmental interventions meant to help the patient feel calm and safe, while more severe behavioral concerns include severe agitation, psychosis, and risk of harm to self or others, which can be managed by a combination of pharmacotherapies and behavioral and environmental interventions; clinicians can consult with the Poison Center for 24/7 advice through their toll-free number (800–222–1222) or with their institution's clinical toxicology service, which may reduce the duration of hospital stay, and expert consultation may be particularly helpful when medication shortages impact the availability of recommended medications.

### A pilot study of automated pupillometry in the treatment of opioid use disorder [^116giF9D]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Average dark size pupil measurements (N = 50). Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean. An asterisk represents a significant (P < 0.05) change in mean pupil size compared to the –5 minute (baseline) measurement.

The mean bright light pupil size obtained 5 minutes before dosing was 2.96 mm (SD, 0.79 mm; range, 1.67–4.89 mm). As with dark size, no significant change from this predosing value was noted at the first postdosing measurement (5 minutes after), but a significantly decreased mean pupil size (2.71 mm; SD, 0.72 mm; range, 1.48–4.07 mm) was detected at the 15-minute postdosing measurement (P = 0.0003). The difference increased and remained statistically significant over subsequent postdosing measurements (Fig. 3). When comparing bright light pupil measurements at 5 minutes pre- and 60 minutes post-dosing, the average decrease in size was 9.5% ± 12.6 for the well-controlled patients (N = 22) and 5.7% ± 9.9 for the patients who continued to have a score ≥ 5 on COWS (N = 3); however, this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.59).

Secondary Outcomes: Changes in Pupil Reactivity

Of the remaining pupillary parameters measured – latency, constriction velocity, percent constriction from dark to bright illumination, and dilation velocity – there was no significant change in mean values when comparing measurements from 5 minutes before dosing and any postdosing time point (see Table 2 for full pupillometry results).

### CPAP in the perioperative setting: evidence of support [^113oTtEi]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Who Might Have Benefits With CPAP?

Surgical patients with OSA adherent to CPAP therapy should continue their CPAP use postoperatively. The management of patients nonadherent to CPAP or suspected OSA is more challenging. It depends on preexisting comorbidities, types and urgency of surgery, requirement of postoperative opioids, and availability of postoperative monitoring. There is a high prevalence of OSA in surgical patients, which is in contrast with the very low incidence of critical postoperative respiratory events. The diagnosis of OSA per se cannot be considered a diagnostic marker for respiratory complications. Certain pathophysiological features of OSA may enhance opioid induced ventilatory impairment resulting from respiratory compromise or suppression of the arousal response to airway obstruction. Respiratory depression may be more prominent in patients with OSA who have decreased ventilatory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia stimuli and high arousal threshold with recurrent severe hypoxemia. Patients should be informed that they have been identified as either having a high probability of OSA or as having a diagnosis of OSA with increased risk of postoperative complications. Patients, surgeons, and anesthesiologists should be jointly involved in the decision-making whether to have additional preoperative evaluations and/or consideration before surgery. In the bariatric surgical patients with a high prevalence of OSA, preparation for surgery with screening and CPAP treatment are routinely performed as part of the preoperative workup. Judgment and common sense should be used to manage patients with undiagnosed OSA or patients with OSA nonadherent to CPAP therapy. Individual evaluation is important to determine the best course of action. Referral to sleep medicine for CPAP therapy may have to be taken in the absence of overwhelming evidence from RCTs in certain groups of patients. Patients with severe OSA, COPD or overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or pulmonary hypertension would definitely benefit from further evaluation and workup. Patients who have preoperative resting hypoxemia on room air with no known cardiopulmonary cause are potential candidates for further preoperative evaluation. Patients with decreased respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia stimuli and a high arousal threshold presenting with recurrent severe hypoxemia may benefit from preoperative CPAP.
