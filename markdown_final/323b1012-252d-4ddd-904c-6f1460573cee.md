Pericardic efusión causes

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of pericardial effusion, organized by mechanism and epidemiology, with diagnostic implications and a final, prioritized summary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pathophysiology that distinguishes exudative from transudative effusions. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories and their relative frequencies in developed versus developing settings. Next, I will examine specific causes within each category, including infections, malignancy, autoimmune, iatrogenic/traumatic, metabolic, and hemodynamic drivers. After that, I should review special populations and emerging contributors like COVID-19 and immunotherapy. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic implications and synthesize a concise, prioritized list of causes with supporting data and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic framework, because misclassifying mechanism leads to errors in workup and management. Pericardial effusions arise either from increased exudation due to pericardial inflammation or from decreased reabsorption due to elevated systemic venous pressure or low oncotic states, producing transudates; this exudative versus transudative distinction guides both etiologic thinking and fluid analysis, and I should double-check that this remains the accepted paradigm in contemporary guidance, which it does [^113wL61a] [^117RHaiZ].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic split between developed and developing regions, since this strongly shapes pretest probabilities. In North America and Western Europe, approximately half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic, with postviral infections the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis dominates in endemic regions; malignancy and iatrogenic causes are also prominent in developed settings, so I need to keep these geographic patterns front-of-mind when prioritizing the differential [^1169vZRZ] [^113wL61a] [^112VeT6n].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about viruses being the leading cause everywhere. In developed settings, viral pericarditis is indeed the most common identifiable cause, with coxsackie and adenovirus frequently implicated, yet many cases are ultimately labeled idiopathic because confirmatory virologic testing is rarely pursued; in contrast, in high-incidence regions, tuberculous pericarditis is the leading cause and carries high morbidity and constriction risk, and HIV coinfection amplifies risk, so I should maintain a low threshold for TB workup in the right epidemiologic context [^1169vZRZ] [^116E1iPu] [^113H9Eez].

> Let me consider malignancy next, and I should confirm which primaries are most common. Lung and breast cancers are the predominant sources of malignant pericardial effusion, with lymphoma and leukemia also frequent; mechanisms include direct pericardial invasion, lymphatic obstruction, and treatment-related inflammation or hemorrhage, and importantly, pericardial effusion can be the first metastatic manifestation in a subset of patients, which means cytology of pericardial fluid can be pivotal for staging and prognosis [^117QFwch] [^117WMeg3] [^111nQcFq] [^115xBpdw].

> Autoimmune and inflammatory causes require careful attention, and I should verify the major associations. Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue diseases can drive exudative effusions, and in children, autoimmune etiologies account for a notable fraction of initially "idiopathic" cases that later declare themselves, reinforcing the need for a structured rheumatologic workup when the initial evaluation is unrevealing [^113wL61a] [^111sEeob].

> Iatrogenic and traumatic causes are increasingly prevalent, so I need to check the magnitude of this contribution. Cardiac surgery, electrophysiology and structural interventions, and chest trauma can all precipitate effusions, with iatrogenic etiologies comprising roughly 15–20% of cases in contemporary series; postoperative effusions are common and may be loculated, and in the setting of trauma or procedural injury, prompt drainage is prioritized when hemodynamics are threatened [^113wL61a] [^113e7oE4] [^114wqPYD].

> Metabolic and endocrine etiologies are sometimes overlooked, so let me verify the key ones. Hypothyroidism is a well-established cause of pericardial effusion via increased capillary permeability and impaired lymphatic drainage, and uremia from chronic kidney disease can also produce effusions; recognizing these metabolic drivers prevents unnecessary invasive testing when the clinical picture fits [^115XmYYx] [^113wL61a].

> Hemodynamic and congestive states can produce transudative effusions, and I should confirm the mechanism. Heart failure and pulmonary hypertension raise pericardial venous and lymphatic pressures, impairing reabsorption and leading to slow, often asymptomatic effusions that are discovered incidentally; this is a classic transudative pattern and should be distinguished from exudative causes to avoid misdirected workups [^113wL61a] [^113K2DYp].

> But wait, what about emerging contributors like COVID-19 and immune checkpoint inhibitors; I need to ensure I am not overstating their frequency. In hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, pericardial effusion is relatively common, yet overt pericarditis is infrequent and tamponade appears uncommon, suggesting myocardial injury and systemic inflammation rather than primary pericarditis as dominant drivers; similarly, immune-related pericardial effusions under PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are increasingly recognized, often steroid-responsive, and should be considered in the right oncologic context [^111WQ7i8] [^112BNjLr] [^113Svtqh] [^1174EQtL].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications, because identifying the cause hinges on a structured approach. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to confirm effusion, quantify size, and assess hemodynamic impact, while CT or CMR can characterize loculation, hemorrhage, or pericardial thickening and guide drainage; pericardiocentesis is indicated for tamponade, suspected bacterial or malignant etiologies, or persistent symptomatic moderate-to-large effusions, with extended catheter drainage reducing recurrence in malignant effusions, and cytology provides meaningful diagnostic yield for malignancy when imaging is non-diagnostic [^1169vZRZ] [^113dxueT] [^112G8BGj] [^111nNqae] [^116JqjMi].

> Hold on, I should verify the final synthesis to ensure internal consistency with the data. The most common cause overall is idiopathic, especially in developed regions, followed by viral infections when a cause is identified; malignancy is a leading specific etiology in tertiary settings, tuberculosis dominates in endemic regions, autoimmune diseases and iatrogenic or traumatic causes are important contributors, and metabolic or hemodynamic drivers round out the differential; this hierarchy aligns with contemporary cohorts and guideline summaries and should be adapted to local epidemiology and patient phenotype [^113wL61a] [^1169vZRZ] [^111nQcFq].

> Final prioritized synthesis: idiopathic or presumed viral accounts for roughly half of cases in developed countries; identifiable infectious causes are led by viruses in non-endemic regions and by tuberculosis in endemic settings; malignancy, particularly lung and breast, is a major specific cause and may be the first presentation of metastatic disease; autoimmune connective tissue diseases contribute a meaningful share; iatrogenic and traumatic etiologies are increasingly common due to procedural volume; metabolic causes such as hypothyroidism and uremia are important to recognize; hemodynamic transudates occur in heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; and emerging contributors include COVID-19 and immune checkpoint inhibitor–related effusions, all of which should be considered within a structured, imaging-guided diagnostic framework [^1169vZRZ] [^113wL61a] [^117QFwch] [^115XmYYx] [^113K2DYp] [^111WQ7i8] [^113Svtqh].

Pericardial effusion has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **idiopathic or viral pericarditis** [^1169vZRZ], **malignancy** (lung, breast, lymphoma) [^117WMeg3], and **tuberculosis** in endemic regions [^113H9Eez]. Other important etiologies include autoimmune disease, bacterial infection, iatrogenic or traumatic injury, heart failure, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and radiation [^114anxf4] [^117RHaiZ]. Rapid accumulation — especially from hemorrhage, malignancy, or trauma — can cause tamponade [^1151wVFV], whereas slow accumulation (e.g. hypothyroidism, renal failure) may be tolerated with minimal symptoms [^115XmYYx]. Evaluation should be guided by history, exam, and echocardiography [^116uZDZ5], with pericardiocentesis for tamponade or suspected infection/malignancy [^112G8BGj].

---

## Infectious causes

- **Viral infections**: Most common identifiable cause in developed countries; Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and HIV are frequent culprits [^1169vZRZ] [^116E1iPu].

- **Bacterial infections**: Tuberculosis is the leading cause globally, especially in endemic areas [^113H9Eez]; other bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) can cause purulent effusions [^notfound].

- **Fungal infections**: Histoplasmosis, Coccidioides, and Aspergillus can cause effusions, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^notfound].

---

## Malignant causes

Malignant causes include **metastatic malignancies** — lung, breast, lymphoma, and leukemia are the most common — and **primary pericardial tumors**, such as mesothelioma and sarcoma, which are rare but often present with large effusions [^117QFwch].

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory causes

Autoimmune and inflammatory causes include **systemic autoimmune diseases** — systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis — and **vasculitides**, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and polyarteritis nodosa [^notfound].

---

## Iatrogenic and traumatic causes

Iatrogenic and traumatic causes include **cardiac procedures** — percutaneous coronary intervention, pacemaker insertion, and electrophysiology procedures — and **cardiac surgery**, with postoperative effusions common after valve surgery or coronary artery bypass grafting [^114wqPYD]. Trauma from blunt or penetrating chest injury can cause hemorrhagic effusions [^notfound].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine causes

Metabolic and endocrine causes include **renal failure**, in which uremic pericarditis causes effusions, and **hypothyroidism**, in which myxedema is a classic cause of large, often chronic effusions [^115XmYYx].

---

## Hemodynamic causes

Hemodynamic causes include **heart failure**, in which elevated right-sided pressures and lymphatic congestion promote transudative effusions, and **pulmonary hypertension**, which similarly increases pericardial fluid via impaired drainage [^113K2DYp].

---

## Radiation-induced pericardial effusion

Radiation-induced pericardial effusion arises from **mediastinal radiation** for thoracic malignancies, which can cause acute or delayed pericarditis and effusion [^112ExSqK].

---

## Idiopathic causes

Idiopathic causes account for a significant proportion in whom no definitive etiology is identified despite thorough evaluation [^1169vZRZ].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Pericardial effusions result from **two main mechanisms**:

- **Increased fluid production**: Inflammation (exudative effusions) from infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease [^117RHaiZ].

- **Decreased fluid reabsorption**: Elevated systemic venous pressure (transudative effusions) from heart failure, cirrhosis, or pulmonary hypertension [^111ncxMm].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Small, slowly accumulating effusions may be asymptomatic, whereas rapid accumulation can cause **cardiac tamponade** [^117QFwch], a life-threatening emergency characterized by hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds [^notfound]. Management depends on the **etiology, size, and hemodynamic impact**: observation for small, stable effusions; pericardiocentesis for tamponade or diagnostic purposes; and surgical interventions (e.g. pericardial window) for recurrent or loculated effusions [^112G8BGj] [^114i8zH8].

---

Pericardial effusion has diverse causes, including infectious, malignant, autoimmune, iatrogenic, metabolic, hemodynamic, radiation, and idiopathic etiologies. Rapid identification of the **underlying cause** and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications such as cardiac tamponade [^115p9D9k].

### Pericardial effusions: causes, diagnosis, and management [^111qQ9VF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of a patient with a pericardial effusion can range from an incidental finding to a life-threatening emergency. Accordingly, the causes of pericardial effusions are numerous and can generally be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. For all patients with a suspected pericardial effusion, echocardiography is essential to define the location and size of an effusion. In pericardial tamponade, the hemodynamics relate to decreased pericardial compliance, ventricular interdependence, and an inspiratory decrease in the pressure gradient for left ventricular filling. Echocardiography provides insight into the pathophysiologic alterations, primarily through an assessment of chamber collapse, inferior vena cava plethora, and marked respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Once diagnosed, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with tamponade, preferably with echocardiographic guidance. With a large effusion but no tamponade, pericardiocentesis is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, though is performed if there is concern for a bacterial infection. In patients with malignancy, pericardial window is preferred given the risk for recurrence. Finally, large effusions can progress to tamponade, but can generally be followed closely until the extent of the effusion facilitates safe pericardiocentesis.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^11728aK9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases. The primary etiology of this condition could be considered when choosing therapeutic options and factors such as effusion size and its hemodynamic consequence. In most cases, small to moderate pericardial effusions can be managed with observation and anti-inflammatory medications unless the effusion develops rapidly. However, in a small proportion of patients, large effusions lead to impaired cardiac filling with hemodynamic compromise and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac tamponade. The rate at which fluid accumulates is the primary determinant of hemodynamic impact and thus guides the choice of treatment, irrespective of the effusion's size. Severe cases are typically treated with pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance. More aggressive treatments may be necessary for cases due to purulent or malignant etiologies. These cases may require a pericardial window to allow for long-term drainage of the pericardial fluid. This comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology of pericardial effusion and discusses pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options for different causes of secondary pericardial effusions.

Conclusion

Pericardial effusions are primarily categorized into inflammatory and non-inflammatory cases. This classification and the severity of the conditions determine the therapeutic plan. An essential consideration in understanding the epidemiology of the disease is the geographical region and country of residence. Not all pericardial effusions require evaluation to determine the cause. In developed countries, they are mainly categorized as idiopathic, believed to be associated with temporary viral infections. The second and third most common reasons are diagnosed diseases and malignancies. Conversely, in developing countries, tuberculosis remains the primary cause of the disease. These epidemiological factors can assist health decision-makers in approaching disease prevention and treatment. On a smaller scale, they empower physicians to make informed decisions for patient treatment when there is insufficient time to investigate the cause of pericardial effusion or when such investigation is not rationalized based on cost–benefit considerations. History, physical examination, and echocardiography constitute the main pillars of diagnosis. Treatment can range from observation to percutaneous or surgical procedures depending on the etiology and severity of fluid accumulation.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^115p9D9k]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice either as incidental finding or manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The aetiology is varied (infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related), being tuberculosis the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and all over the world, while concurrent HIV infection may have an important promoting role in this setting. Management is guided by the haemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and the aetiology whenever possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined aetiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means. A true isolated effusion may not require a specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, but large ones are at risk of progression to cardiac tamponade (up to one third). Pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, but recurrences are also common and pericardiectomy or less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered with recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion (either circumferential or loculated). The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate current knowledge on the management of pericardial effusion.

Causes and epidemiology of pericardial effusion

The etiologies of PE include almost all pathologic pericardial diseases. Inflammatory processes can cause exudative fluid accumulation by increasing the production of pericardial fluid. However, decreased reabsorption caused by enhanced systemic venous pressure can lead to transudative PE. The main causes of pericardial effusion are different among developing and developed countries. The leading cause in developing countries is still tuberculosis. However, in the developed world, the leading causes include idiopathic pericardial effusion, inflammatory causes, malignancy-related PE, and complications of surgical and percutaneous cardiac procedures. The overall leading causes of PE in the developed countries, apart from up to 50%, which are idiopathic, are infections (15–30%), cancer-related causes (10–25%), iatrogenic causes (15–20%) and autoimmune or autoinflammatory causes (5–15%). More recently, COVID-19 infection and vaccination (specifically mRNA vaccines) have become additional causes of PE. Many studies have broadly categorized PE's causes as inflammatory and noninflammatory (Table 2, Figs. 3). It is important to consider the point that in clinical practice, determining the exact cause of pericardial effusion often remains challenging, with many cases ultimately labeled as idiopathic. For instance, in a study, Abdallah R. et al. found that the most frequent etiology of large symptomatic pericardial effusion was idiopathic, accounting for 36% of cases. This highlights the importance of including idiopathic or undetermined categories in figures and tables related to pericardial effusion etiology, reflecting that the specific cause remains elusive despite thorough evaluations.

### A structured, parsimonious approach to establish the cause of moderate-to-large pericardial effusion [^116oxVL1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The workup of moderate-to-large pericardial effusion should focus on its hemodynamic impact and potential cause. A structured approach to diagnostic evaluation of pericardial effusion is needed. We retrospectively studied a contemporary cohort of 103 patients with moderate-to-large pericardial effusion hospitalized at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center from July 2009 till August 2013. Diagnosis of pericardial effusion was independently ascertained by chart review. We applied a stepwise parsimonious approach to establish the cause of pericardial effusion. In the studied cohort, the mean age was 61 years, 50% were men, and 65 patients (63%) underwent pericardial effusion drainage. Using the structured approach, the cause of the effusion was ascertained in 70 patients (68%) by noninvasive targeted testing. Malignant effusion was confirmed in 19 patients (19%). All patients with malignant effusion had either history of malignancy or suggestive noninvasive findings. In conclusion, a structured approach can help to ascertain the diagnosis in patients with moderate-to-large pericardial effusion and guide the need for pericardial drainage or sampling.

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^112yLtvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data will help clinicians to assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and the need for drainage.

Traumatic pericardial effusion

Traumatic PEs are the next cause of noninflammatory pericardial effusion. The leading cause among this group is iatrogenic PE (15–20% of overall cases). The management of traumatic pericardial effusion primarily focuses on prompt drainage to prevent cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition. While medical therapy is essential for treating underlying causes of pericardial effusion, its role in traumatic cases is limited. Treatment for pericardial effusion depends on factors such as the amount of fluid buildup, the cause of the effusion, and the presence or risk of cardiac tamponade. In cases of traumatic pericardial effusion, immediate drainage procedures like pericardiocentesis or surgical creation of a pericardial window are often necessary to relieve pressure on the heart. Medical therapies, such as anti-inflammatory medications, are more applicable in non-traumatic pericardial effusions where inflammation is the primary cause. Therefore, in the context of traumatic pericardial effusion, medical therapy serves a supportive role, with surgical intervention being the cornerstone of effective management.

Discussion

A significant pericardial effusion often requires a percutaneous drainage, not only to relieve the hemodynamic compromise but also to determine or (dis)prove the putative cause of the effusion. This can be relevant not only for patients without a known underlying disease but also for patients with a condition known to be prone to develop pericarditis or pericardial effusions. 6 Indeed, establishing an etiology, especially pericardial malignancy, metastasis, or bacterial causes, can be crucial for immediate management as well as the long‐term prognoses of these patients. Nevertheless, few contemporary data exist on the frequency of the varying conditions leading to pericardial effusions. In addition, the significant impact of these causes on outcome is often underestimated. We reported on the outcome and etiology, per standard care, of pericardial effusion requiring percutaneous pericardiocentesis in 269 consecutive patients over the span of a decade, making this study one of the largest to date. We found that in about half of the patients with known malignancy, abnormal pericardial cytology was observed, whereas for two thirds of the patients with previously nonmetastasized cancer, the effusion constituted their first metastatic site. Vice versa, one out of eight patients without a history of cancer was newly diagnosed with malignancy after pericardiocentesis. Importantly, patients with malignant pericardial effusion had significantly worse long‐term prognoses compared with patients with another or no definite diagnosis. Still, outcome appeared to be poor for all cancer patients undergoing pericardiocentesis, regardless of pericardial cytology. Finally, bacterial pericardial effusion appeared to be rare in our population.

Pericardial effusion — definition, causes, imaging goals, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) size grading: Pericardial effusion is defined by the accumulation of > 50 mL of fluid in the pericardial space. Approximately one-half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic; in North America and Western Europe, postviral infection is the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis is the most common cause in places where it is endemic. The objectives of imaging pericardial effusions are to support diagnosis, evaluate the size and location of the effusion, assess its hemodynamic impact, and inform decisions regarding drainage, if indicated, and TTE is the first-line imaging investigation. Echocardiographic size categories are: trivial (< 1.0 cm and not visualized throughout cardiac cycle), small (< 1.0 cm), moderate (1.0–1.9 cm), large (2.0–2.5 cm), and very large (> 2.5 cm). Common mimickers on echocardiography include a left pleural effusion and an epicardial fat pad that has a heterogenous echodensity, moves with the myocardium, and is often located anterior to the right ventricle.

Definitions and categorization of pericardial effusion

Pericardial effusion (PE) refers to the accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial sac, regardless of the type of accumulated fluid, and can be seen in up to 6.5% of the general population in the United States. Various indices can be used to categorize pericardial effusion (Table 1). However, this pathology is classified into two main categories based on the etiology: 1) Primary PE (Without known underlying cause): Acute inflammatory pericarditis (infectious, autoimmune), previously unknown neoplasia, or idiopathic, and 2) Secondary PE: Secondary to a known underlying disease such as acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery (pericardiotomy), trauma, known widespread or metastatic neoplasia, chest radiation, chronic kidney disease (uremia), invasive cardiac procedures (cardiac perforation), hypothyroidism, or autoimmune diseases. The echocardiographic features can differentiate mild (small) (< 10 mm), moderate (10–20 mm), and large (> 20 mm) from each other based on the effusion size (Fig. 1). Sometimes, the drainage and assessing characteristics and composition of accumulated fluid are helpful and can lead to a definite diagnosis. Moderate and severe types of PE have been more thoroughly investigated in recent years. This review focuses on the etiologies of secondary PEs, their geographic patterns, symptoms, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options (Fig. 2).

Regarding specific circumstances for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with neoplastic pericardial effusion, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing pericardial or epicardial biopsy in patients with suspected malignant pericardial disease when the diagnosis cannot be reached by multimodality imaging or cytological analysis, to confirm the diagnosis.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid and allow comprehensive characterisation of cause. Despite this advance, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic, and radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. Integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge but is facilitated by tissue doppler and colour M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### Pericardial disease and pericardial tamponade [^115ezntf]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The pericardium serves many important functions, but it is not essential for life. Pericardial heart disease comprises only pericarditis and its complications, tamponade and constriction, and congenital lesions. However, the pericardium is affected by virtually every category of disease. The critical care physician is thus likely to encounter the patient with pericardial disease in a variety of settings, either as an isolated phenomenon or as a complication of a variety of systemic disorders, trauma, or certain drugs. Echocardiography is the primary tool for diagnosing and quantifying pericardial effusions, and in the context of the clinical presentation, a thorough understanding of M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler findings can help not only to identify patients with impending tamponade, but also to suggest a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. This article reviews the pathogenesis and diagnosis of pericardial heart disease, focusing on the diagnostic utility of echocardiography, with an emphasis on those areas of greatest interest to the intensivist.

### Pericardial involvement in cancer [^1169CFMq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the monumental advances in the diagnoses and therapeutics of malignancy, several cancer patients have presented with pericardial involvement, including acute pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, and pericardial effusion. Multiple factors can contribute to acute pericarditis, including direct metastasis to the heart, pericardial hemorrhage, infections due to immunosuppression, and cancer therapies that include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation. Pericardial effusion, either due to cancer invasion or cancer treatment, is one of the most common incidental findings in cancer patients, which significantly worsens morbidity and mortality. If left untreated, pericardial effusion is known to cause complications such as pericardial tamponade. Constrictive pericarditis can be due to radiation exposure, chemotherapy, or is a sequela of a previous episode of acute pericarditis. In conclusion, early detection, prompt treatment, and understanding of pericardial diseases are necessary to help improve the quality of life of cancer patients, and we aim to summarize the knowledge of pericardial involvement in patients with cancer.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^111wFAU6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis can be caused by a wide variety of malignant or nonmalignant causes. Known etiologies include infections, neoplasia, iatrogenicity, congestive heart failure, and metabolic causes (hypothyroidism, uremia), as well as pericardial injury (eg, following myocardial infarct, thoracotomy, or trauma), radiation, connective tissue diseases, and trauma. 1, 2 Nevertheless, a substantial number of effusions are idiopathic. 3 Data on the frequency of different etiologies and, more specifically, on primary or metastasized malignancies remain scarce and vary widely among the few studied populations. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In the past 2 decades, only 5 sizeable prospective series on the etiology of pericardial effusions have been reported. Two of those series included distinct populations in which tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common, and thus the participants are not necessarily representative of other cohorts. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

Excluding malignancy or confirming pericardial involvement in patients previously diagnosed with cancer not only has important consequences for the management of patients presenting with a pericardial effusion but also affects their outcome. 1 The diagnosis or exclusion of pericardial involvement in malignancy is, to a large extent, established by pericardial cytology obtained via pericardiocentesis. The aim of this study was to examine the etiology of pericardial effusions requiring a percutaneous intervention, either because of hemodynamic compromise or for a diagnostic workup, to determine how often fluid cytology is requested in unsuspected as well as known cancer patients and to analyze the impact of these findings on patient outcome.

COVID-19 virus-associated pericardial effusion

COVID-19 caused one of the most catastrophic health crises of our era, and there was a wide range of symptoms and signs which could be seen in the presentation of the COVID-19 patients. The manifestation can be a mild fever and respiratory discomfort or much more severe, such as rapid progression toward acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Although many effective strategies have been introduced to combat the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on societies, during the last four years, several surges in the incidence of this disease have happened, and it has been a major health concern. Being well-prepared for new virus strains that might involve the population is crucial. The most vulnerable part of the population for rapid progress of the disease includes those older > 60 years, men, those with extensive lung involvement, patients with cardiac or vascular diseases, patients with a history of pericardial effusion, diabetes, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

### Pericardial tamponade, a diagnostic chameleon: from the historical perspectives to contemporary management [^114t5Arn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early postoperative pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening emergency of paramount importance to any cardiac surgeon dealing caring for either acquired or congenital heart disease. Cardiac tamponade, defined by a fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, is requiring early diagnosis and immediate action. This condition has multiple causes, including postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery. Cardiac tamponade produces an increase of the intrapericardial pressure, a compression of the heart with cardiac inflow restriction, eventually causing organ failure, shock, and cardiac arrest in extreme cases. In pericardial tamponade, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is critical, but it may take some time before noticeable signs and symptoms develop, especially if the fluid is slowly increasing. Unfortunately, the results of the physical examination are not very conclusive, even in the presence of major pericardial effusion or tamponade.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^117ACVzX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients who have chronic cardiac failure, postoperative cardiac surgery patients, or patients who have certain infectious, benign or malignant diseases. They are often diagnosed either as incidental findings or when its related to systemic or cardiac disease. The clinical spectrum of patients with pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), and the etiology. Drainage of the PE is required for cardiac tamponade, symptomatic moderate to large pericardial effusions and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures, "Pericardial Windows", are often requested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived diagnostic benefit is that it allows for determination of malignancy or infection for patients with PEs of unclear etiology through testing of the pericardial fluid and tissue. The purpose of the study is to determine the diagnostic yield of surgical drainage procedures.

### Pericardial diseases in patients with hypothyroidism [^115XmYYx]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of pericardial effusion (with an incidence of 3%-37%) and can cause cardiac tamponade in severe cases. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the epidemiology of hypothyroid-induced pericardial diseases, the mechanism through which low thyroid hormone levels affect the pericardium, the associated clinical manifestations, diagnostic tests and management options. Hypothyroidism causes pericardial effusion through increased permeability of the epicardial vessels and decreased lymphatic drainage of albumin, resulting in accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. Interestingly, autoimmunity does not seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology, and a majority of effusions are asymptomatic due to slow fluid accumulation. The diagnosis is generally made when the pericardial disease is associated with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and other secondary causes are excluded. Management consists of thyroid replacement therapy, along with pericardial drainage in case of tamponade. In conclusion, hypothyroidism-induced pericardial diseases are underdiagnosed. Initiating treatment early in the disease process and preventing complications relies on early diagnosis through systematic screening per guidelines.

### Management of acute and recurrent Pericarditis: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111PpzHp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers, resulting from a variety of stimuli triggering a stereotyped immune response, and characterized by chest pain associated often with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^111nQcFq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pericardial effusions can be caused by a variety of disorders. The frequency of the underlying diseases varies with patient population; therefore, previously reported series are not necessarily representative of other populations. Our purpose was to examine the etiology of pericardial effusions and the survival of patients requiring pericardiocentesis at a tertiary center.

Methods and Results

We performed a retrospective observational study of 269 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous pericardiocentesis at our university hospital between 2006 and 2016 and had prospective follow-up for up to 10 years. The most frequent etiologies were idiopathic (26%), malignancy (25%), and iatrogenicity (20%), whereas bacterial causes were very rare. The most frequent malignancies originated from the lung (53%) or breast (18%). A new cancer was diagnosed with malignant pericardial effusion as the presenting complaint for 9% of patients, whereas the pericardium was the first metastatic site of a known malignancy in 4% of patients. Survival was significantly poorer in malignancy-related versus non-malignancy-related effusions (P < 0.001) and in cytology-positive versus cytology-negative effusions in the overall cohort (P < 0.001). Among cancer-only patients, however, there was no significant difference in long-term survival between cytology-positive and -negative effusions.

Conclusions

In this contemporary tertiary-center cohort, pericardial effusions often represent the primary instance of a new malignancy, underscoring the importance of cytological analyses of noniatrogenic effusions in patients without known cancer, as survival is significantly worse. In cancer patients, however, the presence of pericardial malignant cytology does not appear to affect outcome significantly.

Anatomy and physiology of the pericardium and the pericardial fluid

The pericardium is a two-layered covering around the heart. The inner layer, the visceral layer, consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells, collagen, and elastin fibers in contact with the epicardial heart surface. The external layer, normally about 2 mm thick, is a fibrous parietal layer covering most of the heart. The main functions of the pericardium include fixing the heart to the mediastinum, providing efficient protection against infection, and making the surrounding part of the heart lubricated to facilitate its movement. The normal range of pericardial fluid volume is 15–50 ml. However, the accumulation of fluid more than this amount raises pressure in the pericardial sac, causing compression of the heart, particularly the right side, due to a thinner wall and lower intracardiac pressure. Venous congestion occurs when the right heart's diastolic filling is impaired. Reduced diastolic filling of the left ventricle leads to lower stroke volume. Tachycardia and enhanced contractility are the earliest compensatory responses induced by adrenergic stimulation to sustain cardiac output. However, blood pressure and cardiac output gradually fall.

### Pericardial effusion under nivolumab: case-reports and review of the literature [^114fGyEy]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade related to nivolumab remains a diagnosis of exclusion. This hypothesis relies on a series of arguments: i. temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and nivolumab initiation, ii. absence of another identified cause (heart dysfunction, auto-immune disease, infection…), iii. Rapid resolution under corticotherapy, iv. response of targeted lesions to nivolumab, and v. presence of another IrAE.

As a wide spectrum of life-threatening IrAEs may occur under immunotherapies, clinical vigilance is required with close follow-up. Banal symptoms such as dyspnea should not be neglected and should lead to cardiac examination, as they may be the only symptom announcing cardiac tamponade. Additionally, care should be taken for patients with medical history of pericardial effusion, and previous thoracic irradiation.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis have pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful. When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical because of the relative lack of randomized trials that involve patients with these conditions. A first attempt to bring together and organize current knowledge resulted in the publication of the first guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases. Nevertheless, a number of observational studies and the first randomized trials are moving the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient and, although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

Neoplastic pericardial effusion is a common and serious manifestation of advanced malignancies. Lung and breast carcinoma, haematological malignancies, and gastrointestinal cancer are the most common types of cancer involving the pericardium. Pericardial involvement in neoplasia may arise from several different pathophysiological mechanisms and may be manifested by pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, effusive-constrictive pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis. Management of these patients is a complex multidisciplinary problem, affected by clinical status and prognosis of patients.

Pericardial effusion — advanced imaging roles: Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is a second-line investigation with advantages that include further delineation of effusion size and extent, characterizing pericardial fluid based on Hounsfield units, informing secondary causes such as malignancy, and guiding drainage, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is also a second-line investigation with the additional advantage of assessing for pericardial inflammation and constriction. Multimodality protocols indicate that CCT can distinguish mimickers, detect pericardial calcification or hemorrhage, detect, size, and characterize content of pericardial effusion, identify secondary causes and mimickers, evaluate pericardial thickness, and detect pericardial inflammation; CMR sequences can detect and size pericardial effusion, distinguish mimickers, evaluate for effusive-constrictive pericarditis and transient constrictive pericarditis, assess pericardial thickness and identify adhesions, evaluate for myocardial edema, and evaluate for pericardial malignancies.

Non-inflammatory pericardial effusions

Neoplastic pericardial effusions:

Malignancies are the second leading cause of etiology-established pericardial effusion in developed countries (10–25%). The leading cause of neoplastic pericardial effusions is the spread of metastatic cells through the blood or lymphatic circulation system into the pericardium. Alternatively, inflammation involving the pericardium, radiation or chemotherapeutic therapy toxicity, or opportunistic infections following immunocompromised can result in pericardial. Pericardial effusions can be seen in up to 15–30% of patients with cancer at autopsy, while this percentage of people without cancer is roughly 4%. Lung (35%), breast (25%), and lymphoma and leukemia (15%) are the most common metastatic cancers that can cause PE, and other malignancies such as the esophagus, Kaposi's sarcoma, and melanoma are the next causes.

The clinical manifestations of neoplastic PE vary widely depending on the volume and rate of filling of the pericardium. PE can be asymptomatic when the fluid volume is minimal and is slowly accumulating. On the other hand, a high volume and rapid accumulation results in symptomatic cases such as arrhythmia, cardiovascular collapse, and death due to tamponade. Neoplastic diseases can cause cardiac pathologies with different acuities and consequences. The cardiac presentation can be rapid and fulminant such ass tamponade. Such complications need to be approached emergently as potential causes of cardiovascular collapse and death. Constrictive pericardial disease is a condition that is generally chronic, but it needs to be diagnosed, and it is usually treated with pericardiectomy. Mild and moderate pericardial effusion or pericarditis are less acute and give more time to patients and physicians to treat or control them. The treatment of pericardial effusion due to cancer includes relieving the symptoms and preventing the reaccumulating of fluid. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis is the mainstay of the treatment and, at the same time, an excellent diagnostic procedure. Pericardial effusion has significant prognostic implications for cancer patients. There is a high risk of recurrence of PE (about 90% in 90 days) if pericardiocentesis is done without prolonged pericardial drainage. In a study from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the overall recurrence rate of 11.8 ± 0.6 months after pericardiocentesis was 20%, and the mean interval to recurrence was 1.2 ± 2.1 months. However, patients with extended catheter drainage had a reduced recurrence rate of 12% compared to 52% in patients without extended drainage (p < 0.001).

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^111ncxMm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The normal pericardial sac contains up to 50 mL of fluid with anything greater being a pathologic effusion. The curvilinear pressure-volume relationship of the pericardial sac determines the hemodynamic consequences of a PE and is responsible for rapidly accumulating fluid that causes cardiac tamponade. There are numerous diseases and complications which cause PEs with the most common being idiopathic pericarditis, cancer, and hemorrhage. PE may be classified based on its onset (acute, subacute, or chronic when it has been present for greater than 3 months), distribution (circumferential or loculated), hemodynamic impact (none, cardiac tamponade, effusive-constrictive), and composition (exudates, transudate). PE is also distinguished by size as mild, moderate, and large based on echocardiographic assessment.

The pathophysiology of the development of PE has been described as resulting from any pathological process causing an inflammatory process with the possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Another mechanism for the formation of pericardial fluid may be decreased reabsorption due to increased systemic venous pressure as a result of congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension (transudate). The most common cause is often unknown as most of the PEs are idiopathic. Although the subxiphoid approach for surgical drainage has been our preferred method there are alternative approaches. The creation of a "pericardial window" can be done through a thoracotomy or video-assisted approach. The procedure is generally low risk with a low complication rate and rare mortality.

### Idiopathic pericardial effusions in children: workup and final diagnoses [^111sEeob]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric idiopathic pericardial effusions are common and often have a prolonged clinical course. We hypothesized that these effusions have no standardized diagnostic workup, and ultimately have a final etiology not initially appreciated. To test these hypotheses, a hospital system-wide retrospective (1/1/1990–10/1/2019) cohort study of pericardial effusions in children (< 18 years) was conducted. Effusions were grouped by etiology and patients receiving an initial idiopathic diagnosis were further analyzed. Effusion size, diagnostic workup, final diagnosis, and time to resolution were abstracted. In total, 42/366 effusions were initially diagnosed as idiopathic. Workup was not standardized and included up to six laboratory tests including pericardial fluid analysis and infectious, metabolic, rheumatologic and thyroid workups. Treatment course involved 1 readmission in 24%, and > 1 readmission in 12%. Resolution of effusion occurred in 83% of patients within a median of 1 admission (range 1–4). Of those effusions initially deemed idiopathic, 12/42 (29%) were later found to have an underlying etiologic diagnosis including: autoimmune (7, 58%), neoplastic (2, 16%), infectious (2, 16%), and renal (1, 8%). Children initially diagnosed with idiopathic pericardial effusions have an underlying etiologic diagnosis 29% of the time, and a standardized workup may prevent delays in definitive diagnosis and treatment.

Clinical Perspective

Pericardial effusion (PE) is defined as an accumulation of fluid within the pericardial cavity. Virtually any process that affects the pericardium can lead to an effusion.PE often occurs as an epiphenomenon in patients with pericardial, malignant, or inflammatory disease. However, PE can also occur in healthy individuals. Most PEs are not hemodynamically relevant and remain asymptomatic. The incidental finding of PE, hence, challenges the treating physicians as they have to deal with the dilemma of ordering advanced diagnostics to avoid missing a potentially relevant diagnosis but also with uncertainty and discomfort for the patient, as well as additional costs for the health care system.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Society of Echocardiography guidelines recommend 2‐dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the reference imaging modality for any suspected pericardial disease or effusion (Class of Level of Evidence, lC).TTE is a cost‐effective, widely available, and safe method that allows for a comprehensive assessment of the size, location, and hemodynamic relevance of PE. In TTE, PE appears as an echo‐free space between the 2 layers of the pericardium that persists throughout the cardiac cycle. It can be classified on the basis of various factors, including size, distribution, composition, hemodynamic impact, and time of onset. The size of PE can be categorized semiquantitatively by echocardiography into small (< 10 mm), moderate (10–20 mm), or large (> 20 mm). Clinically, the spectrum ranges from small asymptomatic PE to life‐threatening emergencies (eg, cardiac tamponade).

To date, 2 primary pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified that are responsible for the accumulation of pericardial fluid: fluid exudation resulting from pericardial inflammation and transudation caused by hemodynamic abnormalities or reduced osmotic pressure (eg, in congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension).

Data regarding the prevalence and relevance of PE in the general population are scarce, and recommendations how to deal with an incidentally identified PE are based on expert opinion. To enhance evidence in this field, the current study aimed to determine the prevalence, investigate the determinants, explore the clinical course, and assess the prognostic yield of PE in a population‐based cohort.

### Immunotherapy related pericardial effusion on chest CT [^113Svtqh]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunotherapy has become a critical class of anticancer therapy in recent years, functioning by releasing brakes on the immune system that ultimately results in immune cell activation which eliminates cancer cells. Immune related adverse events (IRAEs) are a specific type of adverse event described in patients taking checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy which results from unrestrained immune activation. Immune related pericardial effusion has been described however has not been comprehensively characterized. Here, we present the most extensive report to date detailing this adverse event.

Methods

We queried our medical record system to retrospectively identify patients on checkpoint inhibitor therapy for lung cancer who subsequently developed pericardial effusion. We analyzed the clinical and radiographic characteristics, prior therapies, treatment for the effusion, and outcomes in patients with immune related pericardial effusion and compared them to similar patients with pericardial effusion not attributable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Results

Our data demonstrate that most of these pericardial effusions were small and not clinically significant. The majority were successfully treated with steroids or resolved spontaneously. Anti-PD-1 inhibitors were the most common checkpoint inhibitor preceding pericardial effusion, and a significant number of patients who went on to develop IRAE pericardial effusion previously had treatment with carboplatin for their cancer.

Conclusions

These data suggest that IRAE pericardial effusion is not a clinically significant adverse event however it sometimes leads to permanent discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy which is not necessary.

Constrictive pericarditis phenotypes and imaging roles are outlined, noting significant pericardial inflammation, termed transient constrictive pericarditis, and that this distinction is crucial, as the former usually requires surgical radical pericardiectomy, whereas the latter may resolve spontaneously or with anti-inflammatory therapy given for 3 to 6 months. In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, it is the most common cause of constrictive pericarditis, whereas outside of this setting, the most common cause is idiopathic, followed by post-cardiac surgery and prior mediastinal radiation. Effusive constrictive pericarditis is a distinct entity defined as persistent constrictive pathophysiology after drainage of a pericardial effusion, classically diagnosed invasively by a failure of the right atrial pressure (or pericardial pressure) to decrease following pericardiocentesis and attributed to marked inflammation of the visceral pericardium, although currently it is often diagnosed based on features of constrictive pathophysiology with echocardiography that appear after pericardial effusion drainage. The primary objectives of imaging here are to identify constrictive pathophysiology and to assess the presence and severity of pericardial inflammation, with echocardiography and CMR imaging playing complementary roles, echocardiography serving as the primary and initial modality, whereas CMR offers the most comprehensive assessment of pericardial inflammation.

### Occurrence and predictors of pericardial effusion requiring invasive treatment following heart valve surgery [^114wqPYD]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pericardial effusion is a well-known complication following cardiac surgery which may cause prolonged hospitalisations, rehospitalisations, and in the most severe cases, life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Commonly, pericardial effusion develops within the first postoperative weeks and is usually diagnosed with echocardiography. Incidences of pericardial effusions in available literature vary greatly from 1% to 64%, depending on definitions, study design, observation time and surgical population studied. Opposed to other common complications following cardiac surgery such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure and infections, causes and characteristics of pericardial effusions have not been as thoroughly investigated.

Most patients, with small pericardial effusion, remain asymptomatic and effusion requires no specific intervention. When associated with symptoms or haemodynamic compromise, the effusion requires drainage either ultrasound-guided percutaneous or surgical depending on location or time from surgery. There are no proven effective medical treatments of pericardial effusions without inflammation, but, when the pericardial effusion is associated with pericarditis, management should follow that of pericarditis. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence of a beneficial effect of Colchicine in preventing recurrent pericardial effusion in pericarditis and postpericardiotomy syndrome, whereas Colchicine is not recommended in the absence of inflammation. Similarly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not indicated as a treatment and may be associated with an increased risk of side effects. Thus, there is presently no medical treatment of pericardial effusions following surgery.

In general, there is a scarcity of studies investigating factors associated with the development of pericardial effusion following heart valve surgery. A recent study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery has demonstrated how younger patients with lower surgical risk score (EuroScore), better cardiac function (measured by left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF), less coronary artery disease and higher preoperative haemoglobin values undergoing heart valve surgery are at higher risk of developing late (> 7 days) pericardial effusion. In addition, preoperative or postoperative anticoagulation, surgery other than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantation of a mechanical valve prosthesis, and blood transfusions have been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of cardiac tamponade. Nevertheless, to prevent patients from developing significant pericardial effusions and to be aware of patients at increased risk, more knowledge about factors associated with pericardial effusions is needed.

Thus, the objectives of this study were to describe the occurrence of significant pericardial effusion defined as effusion requiring intervention and to investigate characteristics associated with pericardial effusion within 3 months following heart valve surgery.

Pleural or pericardial effusions in NSCLC — staging and management: Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease, and T4 with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a; pleural or pericardial effusions are malignant in 90% to 95% of patients, so pathologic confirmation of a malignant effusion by thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended, with thoracoscopy considered if thoracentesis is inconclusive. In the absence of nonmalignant causes, an exudate or sanguineous effusion is considered malignant regardless of cytology, and if the effusion is negative for malignancy (M0), treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage; data suggest that most pleural or pericardial effusions are associated with unresectable disease in 95% of cases, and if positive for malignancy the tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) in addition to treatment as for stage IV disease.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^113cpZjm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In the present patient cohort, the underlying diagnosis of effusion was established based on pericardial fluid characteristics obtained by pericardiocentesis, using routine tests including cytology, microbiology, serology, and biochemistry, as per clinical indication. The sensitivity of pericardial fluid cytology ranges from 66.7% to 92%. This value depends heavily on the gold standard used per study (eg, follow‐up, pericardial biopsy, postmortem autopsy) but nevertheless is considered a valid and useful diagnostic tool. 9, 16, 17, 18 Variation also exists between series on what should be classified as a definite malignant effusion; some authors consider cytology‐negative fluid as constituting a malignant effusion if the patient has a known malignancy. In contrast with these analyses, we chose to limit malignant effusion to those with a proven positive cytology, as determined by a pathologist, and to classify cytology‐negative patients as idiopathic in the absence of another plausible cause, even when they had an underlying cancer. For this reason, and despite the context of a large tertiary care cohort, our number of malignant effusions is slightly lower than in other reports. Consequently, about 1 in 4 patients ultimately was categorized as having no definite underlying cause of effusion (ie, the idiopathic group); however, almost half had a known malignancy and could not be distinguished from cytology‐positive patients in terms of long‐term outcome. If we take this into account, our data are consistent with previous studies in the sense that neoplasia was the most common cause of pericardial effusion, and lung and breast cancers were the most frequent primary sites. Incidentally, because we were unable to differentiate between a chemotherapy‐related effusion and false‐negative cytology, we cannot exclude the possibility that at least some of the cytology‐negative effusions in known cancer patients were secondary to their chemotherapy.

### Malignant pericardial effusion in ovarian malignancy: a treatable oncologic emergency [^117Qtbmf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening condition that can occur, albeit rarely, in patients with ovarian cancer. Whether or not prolonged survival is possible after such an event is debatable. Our aim was to describe our experience with seven ovarian cancer patients who experienced malignant cardiac tamponade at tumor diagnosis or at recurrence.

Case Report

Six patients were treated with pericardiocentesis and one with pericardial fenestration. Survival after tamponade ranged from 3 to 72 weeks. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We suggest that when pericardial effusion occurs in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, timely diagnosis and proper management might allow palliation and prolongation of life.

### Neoplastic pericardial effusion [^115Ef3JG]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Neoplastic pericardial effusion is a serious and common clinical disorder encountered by cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, oncologists, and radiation oncologists. It may develop from direct extension or metastatic spread of the underlying malignancy, from an opportunistic infection, or from a complication of radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic toxicity. The clinical presentation varies, and the patient may be hemodynamically unstable in the setting of constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. The management depends on the patient's prognosis and varies from pericardiocentesis, sclerotherapy, and balloon pericardiotomy to cardiothoracic surgery. Patients with neoplastic pericardial effusion face a grave prognosis, as their malignancy is usually more advanced. This review article discusses the epidemiology and etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of neoplastic pericardial effusion.

Approaches are outlined as "Anatomical approaches to pericardiocentesis include subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. In an emergency, a subxiphoid or apical approach is preferred", with image guidance where "Echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and/or computed tomography may be utilized to guide the pericardiocentesis procedure", and escalation that "Surgical creation of a pericardial window is considered in select patients with recurrent large pericardial effusions and/or cardiac tamponade despite prior pericardiocentesis" and "In certain rare cases, radical pericardiectomy surgery may be indicated for recurrent pericardial effusions, even following the creation of a pericardial window, especially when there is concomitant medically refractory constrictive pericarditis or pericarditis".

### The pericardium forms as a distinct structure during heart formation [^114Vzzzf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The formation of a functional heart requires precise integration of various cell types during embryonic development. Understanding the diverse cell lineages and mechanisms that contribute to cardiogenesis is essential to uncover the origins of congenital heart disease and to unlock the heart's regenerative capacity. The developing heart incorporates myocardial, endocardial, and conduction system cells while being surrounded by the pericardium as a multi-layered mesothelial tissue. Covering the heart as the first functional organ in the body, the pericardium forms among the earliest organ-associated mesothelia. The functional, mature pericardium presents as a three-layered structure with (i) a fibrous outer layer that in mammals attaches to the sternum and diaphragm to anchor the cardiac cavity, (ii) an inner serous membrane layer that reduces friction of the constantly beating heart, and (iii) the epicardium as the innermost layer that emerges from the initial pericardium to surround the myocardial surface –. The pericardium in its entirety contributes to mitigating chronic and acute stress on the heart, maintaining cardiac pressure, facilitating immune response and tissue repair, and securing and lubricating the heart within the thorax. These pericardial functions become critical upon idiopathic or viral damage to the heart, including through the innermost, late-forming epicardium that can support signals for cardiomyocyte rearrangement and potential regeneration –. Pericardial stiffness or loss of pericardial elasticity resulting from constrictive peritoneal pressure (effusion), pericarditis, or other anomalies can impact heart function, with the potential to also influence heart development and pediatric congenital heart anomalies.

### Pericardial effusion impending tamponade: a look beyond beck's triad [^116yuahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of chronic or slowly progressing pericardial effusion with impending tamponade remains a challenge, particularly when classical physical signs are subtle or absent. A high index of suspicion should be entertained in such cases in the appropriate setting even when the clinical signs and symptoms are missing. We present two cases where the pericardial effusion was missed in the emergency department due to subtle clinical features or mistaken for a more familiar "look-a-like" presentation. A review of the literature and an analysis of various clinical parameters of published cases were performed. It is pivotal that physicians should not only be aware of the limitations of the traditional clinical signs, but also be familiar with the use of other subtle findings and the importance of other modalities that may potentially enhance the sensitivity in diagnosing chronic pericardial effusion impending tamponade.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112bpTYj]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Pericardial fluid collections

Pericardial effusion is a frequently encountered disorder. Increased venous or lymphatic pressure is the common etiology of simple pericardial effusion; however, rheumatologic diseases, infection, malignancy, and trauma may also cause pericardial effusion. Pericardial thickening could be associated with pericardial effusion. The differentiation of benign and malignant pericardial effusions by imaging could be challenging. Echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in the evaluation of pericardial effusions. However, there could be limitations in the detection of fluid due to acoustic windows and in cases of loculated fluid (Fig. 5). MRI is more sensitive than echocardiography in the detection of small collections, mostly in loculated fluid. CT may also demonstrate the extension of effusion. Post-contrast images, particularly fat-saturated T1-weighted MR images, may reveal the presence of pericardial thickening. The contents of pericardial effusion either sampled or diagnosed by imaging (i.e. hemorrhagic, serous, or pyogenic) may give clue for the etiology.

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^111WQ7i8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and Associates of Pericardial Effusion

The association of pericardial disease with infections was first reported in 1933. Since then, it was described in various viral infections, with Enteroviruses, Coxsackie, and Herpesviruses being the most common. The data on pericardial disease in other coronaviruses are scarce and based only on case reports. Our data show that in consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 infection, the prevalence of pericardial effusion was nearly 15%, but only 17 of 530 (3.2%) had pericarditis. Several recent small prospective studies in critically ill patients with COVID‐19, have described a prevalence ranging from 43% to 90% for pericardial effusion. Other publications have dealt with the prevalence and clinical impact of pericardial effusion in acute COVID‐19 infection. However, all these reports were either retrospective or based on systematic literature review, assessing only patients with clinically indicated echocardiographic examinations. Our study used a prospectively defined protocol and included unselected hospitalized patients encompassing all grades of disease severity, which can better evaluate the prevalence and clinical impact of pericardial effusion in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. Recently, Brito et alstudied the presence of pericardial inflammation in a small cohort of 54 athletes recovering from COVID‐19 infection. Although 39.5% had pericardial late enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, only 6% had associated pericardial effusion by echocardiography. The possible reasons for the lower prevalence of pericardial effusion compared with the present cohort are the younger age of patients, milder disease (all athletes were not hospitalized, and had either mild or asymptomatic disease), and performing the echocardiography at a later stage (around 28 days after COVID‐19 diagnosis).

A large retrospective trial reported a pericarditis prevalence of 1.5% in patients with COVID‐19 in the United States based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), diagnosis codes. The use of retrospective data and diagnosis codes, in contrast to the present study, may contribute to underestimation of the prevalence of pericarditis in patients with COVID‐19.

Surprisingly, the prevalence of pericarditis in patients with pericardial effusion was low, and neither CRP nor troponin‐I levels were associated with pericardial effusion. The data suggest that pericardial or myocardial inflammation does not play a major role in the cause of pericardial effusion in patients with COVID‐19 infection.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^113K2DYp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure

Approximately 12–20% of heart failure (HF) cases can be accompanied by pericardial effusions. Branches of the internal mammary arteries and the musculophrenic arteries provide arterial supply to the pericardium. Venous drainage of the pericardium is via the pericardiophrenic vein, which empties into the internal thoracic vein, the left superior intercostal vein, or directly into the left brachiocephalic vein.

Fluid can accumulate in the pericardium space due to increased venous pressure. Conditions such as HF and cirrhosis can cause congestion of venous returns, dysfunction of lymphatic drainage, and decreased fluid reabsorption, which can finally result in pericardial effusion. Since these patients experience chronic fluid accumulation in the pericardium space, they are mostly asymptomatic, and PE diagnosis occurs as an incidental finding during evaluation for other reasons.

Pulmonary hypertension

With the same mechanism, the pressure on the right ventricle will also be raised when the PAP is increased. This pathologic condition is called PAH and is one of the five groups of pulmonary hypertension. PAH can be divided into two subgroups: Idiopathic PAH, which is caused without any known specific reason, and secondary PAH, due to connective tissue disorders, HIV, and other reasons. It has been shown that echocardiographic features such as right ventricle dysfunction and moderate and severe PE presence can be associated with a higher mortality rate. PAH can be accompanied by fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, lack of appropriate drainage by the reabsorbing system, and various degrees of PEs. The treatment of PE in these cases depends on the cause of increased PE, and there is a wide inconsistency between the results of various studies. Those with primary PAH will benefit from medications that can decrease this pressure, such as sildenafil and bosentan; anti-inflammatory medications may reduce inflammation and improve rheumatologic causes. Some evidence emphasizes the better outcome of transcatheter drainage of pericardial effusion. The medical team should decide based on the patient's condition and after considering all therapeutic strategies.

### Pericardial and pleural metastases: clinical, histologic, and molecular differences [^111jexHs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pericardial and pleural cavities produce effusions with important clinical consequences. Metastases are one of the most common etiologies of both serosal effusions. However, data regarding the type of metastatic involvement of the pleura and the pericardium are lacking. This study investigated the histologic patterns of tumors involving the two cavities to better define their pathophysiology and possible consequences in molecular diagnostics.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with pericardial (n = 75) and pleural (n = 70) metastases. Patterns of metastasis were characterized as (1) tumor cells floating inside the cavity (2) as lymphatic emboli and (3) as tumor cells frankly invading underlying fibrous tissue. Molecular analysis (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ALK, HER2) was performed in 44 metastases of lung adenocarcinomas.

Results

The two serosal membranes differed significantly (p < 0.0001) in the pattern of metastasis. The pleura showed predominantly an invasive pattern (67 [95.7%]), whereas most pericardial metastases consisted of tumor cells floating inside the cavity or as lymphatic emboli (44 [58.6%]). The origin of the primary differed marginally between the two organs. Time to diagnosis of metastasis differed between the two organs, with pleural metastases presenting later than the pericardial ones. Molecular analysis failed more often in pericardial biopsy specimens and in specimens with emboli or surface involvement.

Conclusions

Although pericardium and pleura share common embryologic and histologic features and are often regarded as giving similar effusions, they differ significantly in the type of metastases involving them. This can have important consequences in histologic, cytologic, and molecular diagnostics.

### Abnormal cytology predicts poor prognosis in cancer patients with pericardial effusion [^117W3DmP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening disorder caused by varying medical conditions. Malignancy and complications of its treatment are a common cause of pericardial effusion. The natural history of pericardial effusion remains largely unknown. We investigated the association of malignancy with adverse outcomes after pericardiocentesis.

Patients and Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing pericardiocentesis at a single institution between January 1, 1999, and January 31, 2003, were included. Death was confirmed with the Social Security Death Index. Survival estimates were obtained by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was performed to determine the clinical characteristics associated with death.

Results

Two hundred nineteen patients underwent pericardiocentesis during the study period. The effusion was cancer-related in 43.8% of cases. Median survival was 59.6 weeks (95% CI, 24.3 to 94.8 weeks). During the follow-up period, 47.9% of patients died. Cancer-related pericardial effusion was associated with decreased survival (median, 15.1 weeks). Abnormal fluid cytology was further associated with poor prognosis among patients with malignancy (median survival, 7.3 v 29.7 weeks; p = 0.022). Patients with cancer-related pericardial effusion were more likely to require repeat pericardiocentesis (OR = 6.0; p = 0.001) and pericardial surgery (odds ratio [OR] OR = 5.7; P < .001). Cancer-related effusion and abnormal cytology were independent predictors of death in a multivariate model.

Conclusion

Malignancy is the most common cause of pericardial effusion in a tertiary care center. Cancer-related pericardial effusion is associated with adverse outcomes, and abnormal cytology further worsens prognosis. The poor survival among cancer patients with pericardial effusion and abnormal fluid cytology may have important implications for management.

### Outcomes of idiopathic chronic large pericardial effusion [^116hWJe8]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Aim of this paper is to evaluate the outcomes of 'idiopathic' chronic large pericardial effusions without initial evidence of pericarditis.

Methods

All consecutive cases of idiopathic chronic large pericardial effusions evaluated from 2000 to 2015 in three Italian tertiary referral centres for pericardial diseases were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. The term 'idiopathic' was applied to cases that performed a complete diagnostic evaluation to exclude a specific aetiology. A clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was performed every 3–6 months.

Results

100 patients were included (mean age 61.3 ± 14.6 years, 54 females, 44 patients were asymptomatic according to clinical evaluation) with a mean follow-up of 50 months. The baseline median size of the effusion (evaluated as the largest end-diastolic echo-free space) was 25mm (IQR 8) and decreased to a mean value of 7mm (IQR 19; p < 0.0001) with complete regression in 39 patients at the end of follow-up. There were no new aetiological diagnoses. Adverse events were respectively: cardiac tamponade in 8 patients (8.0%), pericardiocentesis in 30 patients (30.0%), pericardial window in 12 cases (12.0%) and pericardiectomy in 3 patients (3.0%). Recurrence-free survival and complications-free survival was better in patients treated without interventions (log rank p = 0.0038).

Conclusions

The evolution of 'idiopathic' chronic large pericardial effusions is usually benign with reduction of the size of the effusion in the majority of cases, and regression in about 40% of cases. The risk of cardiac tamponade is 2.2%/year and recurrence/complications survival was better in patients treated conservatively without interventions.

### Acute pericarditis: rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

In a large prospective cohort of consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 infection encompassing the entire spectrum of disease severity, pericardial effusion is common, but rarely is attributable to acute pericarditis or myocarditis. Nevertheless, it is associated with myocardial dysfunction and excess mortality. To achieve significant clinical value for risk stratification, a limited echocardiographic examination, including LVEF, TAPSE, and evaluation for presence of pericardial effusion, is sufficient.

### Isolated pericardial effusion in the human fetus: a report of three cases [^112K4qjc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the possible underlying etiologies and outcome in isolated fetal pericardial effusion.

Methods

Doppler fetal echocardiography allowed the diagnosis of pericardial effusion in three patients and revealed the etiology in two.

Results

We present the findings in three cases of isolated pericardial effusion. In the first, the pericardial effusion was a manifestation of trisomy 21 associated with a myeloproliferative disorder. In the second, the pericardial fluid collection was the first sign of an autosomal recessive disease, idiopathic infantile arterial calcification. The third case was remarkable because of the spontaneous resolution of a large pericardial fluid collection.

Conclusion

Isolated fetal pericardial effusion covers a wide spectrum of etiologies from severe genetic and chromosomal diseases to transient forms.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion (PEff) — epidemiology and prognosis indicate that asymptomatic PEff increases with age, "especially in elderly women, in whom it was > 10% in patients aged > 80 years". If metabolic causes and hypothyroidism are excluded and the effusion is stable on follow-up, "it is labeled idiopathic, and no further investigation or treatment is warranted", although "pericardiocentesis is sometimes needed to establish the etiology of a hemodynamically insignificant PEff".

### Etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric pericardial effusions [^113ejQuD]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the contemporary etiologies, treatment, and outcomes of moderate and large pericardial effusions in pediatric patients. We reviewed pediatric patients with moderate or large effusions diagnosed at Children's Hospital Boston. Effusion size was determined in offline review of echocardiograms. One hundred sixteen patients with moderate or large pericardial effusions were identified. The age range was 1 day to 17.8 years (median 8.6). The size of the pericardial effusions ranged from 0.5 to 4.7 cm (median 2.1). Neoplastic disease was present in 39% of patients, collagen vascular disease in 9%, renal disease in 8%, bacterial infection in 3%, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2%; 37% were idiopathic. Pericardial drainage procedures were performed in 47 patients (41%). Of these, 29 (63%) had recurrent effusions leading to repeat drainage in 12 (41%). Pericardial effusions resolved within 3 months in 83% of patients who underwent drainage and in 91% of patients who did not. In summary, pediatric pericardial effusions were rarely caused by bacterial infections in this study population and were more frequently idiopathic or associated with neoplastic disease. Pericardial effusions often reaccumulated after drainage. The majority of both drained and undrained effusions resolved within 3 months.

### Role of biochemical tests in the diagnosis of large pericardial effusions [^116wm5jP]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine the biochemical characteristics of large pericardial effusions in various disease states, and to assess their utility as diagnostic tools.

Setting

An academic university hospital in the Western Cape, South Africa.

Design

Consecutive, prospective case series.

Patients

One hundred ten hospital patients > 12 years old, who presented to the echocardiography department with large pericardial effusions, and 12 control subjects who underwent open-heart surgery (coronary artery bypass graft or aortic valve replacement).

Measurements

Fluid was sent for examination of biochemistry, adenosine deaminase, microbiology, hematology, and cytology. The etiology of each pericardial fluid sample was established using predetermined criteria.

Results

The biochemistry of pericardial exudates differed significantly from pericardial transudates. Light' s criteria (whereby an exudate is defined as having one or more of the following: pleural fluid/serum protein ratio > 0.5; pleural fluid/serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] ratio > 0.6; and/or pleural fluid LDH level > 200 U/L) were applied to pericardial fluids and demonstrated to be the most reliable diagnostic tool for identifying pericardial exudates. The corresponding sensitivity was 98%.

Conclusion

Although laboratory tests are a useful guideline when assessing the etiology and pathophysiology of pericardial effusions, the majority of large, clinically significant pericardial effusions result from exudative causes.

Inflammatory pericardial effusion

Infections

Viral pericardial effusions

Viruses are the leading causes of pericarditis cases, which have known etiologies, especially adenovirus and coxsackievirus, and about 60% of viral pericarditis can cause pericardial effusions. However, most of the time, effusions are small and can be treated conservatively or with colchicine plus NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and IL-1 blockers are other medical therapies. Hemorrhagic and large (hemodynamically significant) are uncommon viral causes of PE. However, they are generally classified as idiopathic since a viral diagnosis needs histologic, immunologic, and or serologic evaluation, which is not usually done unless HIV or HCV infection is suspected.

Coxsackievirus-induced pericardial effusion

Coxsackieviruses, including types A and B, can have a wide range of clinical presentations in children and adults. Although it can cause a spectrum of symptoms from simple fever, hand-foot-mouth syndrome, up to severe life-threatening encephalitis or pericarditis, in adults, it is primarily a controllable presentation with malaise or fever, which can be treated with supportive care and NSAIDs plus colchicine. In the winter and fall, these infections are more observed in men. Coxsackievirus B is cardiotropic and tends to involve the myocardium. This virus can involve myocardial cells chronically; it can cause severe myocarditis or even large pericardial effusions and tamponades because of myocarditis. Pericardial effusion due to the Coxsackie virus can also be seen in children, and there are case reports of hemorrhagic pleural effusion in them, like the adult group. Most of the time, myopericarditis, due to this virus, can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications and colchicine or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatments and steroids. However, colchicine efficacy and safety have not been approved yet in children. Massive PE and tamponade in these children are life-threatening. If needed, they should be treated aggressively with percutaneous or surgical drainage.

Pericarditis in oncologic patients — Pericardial involvement in the setting of known malignancy can occur with direct spread or hematologic or lymphatic dissemination. Most pericardial metastases are identified as part of a staging chest computed tomography or positron emission tomography–computed tomography study. Frequently, the presence of new pericardial effusion or nodularity in staging imaging studies is the first clue for pericardial malignant involvement. The presence of hemorrhagic or complex pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of pericardial metastasis in that setting.

### A contemporary look at pericardiocentesis [^112ba6Nz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous drainage is the default strategy for evacuating a pericardial effusion. A pericardiocentesis can be necessary or required in a wide variety of clinical settings ranging from urgent tamponade to relieve in iatrogenic hemorrhagic effusions in the electrophysiology or catheterization room, to planned diagnostic procedures in patients with suspected or known malignancy or infections. With the help of several procedural improvements over the past decades, echocardiography and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis has become the standard intervention for evacuating pericardial effusions, as well as an essential tool in the diagnostic work-up of an unexplained pericardial effusion. When performed by skilled physicians assisted by appropriate imaging it is a very safe procedure, and provided that an indwelling catheter is placed, it is also very effective with an acceptably low risk of recurrences. In this review, the indications and standard techniques for pericardiocentesis are discussed, as well as their consequences for patients with iatrogenic and malignant effusions.

Pericardial diseases center of excellence — indications and functions — are outlined, noting that a pericardial diseases center (PDC) offers a structured solution to complex pericardial disorders and is particularly effective in improving care and outcomes for patients with recurrent or refractory pericarditis or frequent follow‑ups while reducing emergency visits and hospitalizations. Indications for referral include recurrent, incessant or chronic pericarditis, suspected or confirmed constrictive pericarditis, large or complex pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage or window, and situations when advanced therapies such as biologics and pericardiectomy are being considered. PDCs also screen patients for clinical trials and monitor responses and adverse events of emerging treatments, and these centers should provide access to specialized resources including multimodality imaging (echocardiography, CMR, CCT), rheumatology, infectious diseases, genetics, cardiothoracic surgery consultation, and specialty pharmacies; advanced practice providers play major roles and clear communication pathways ensure timely referrals and follow‑ups.

### Metastatic involvement of the heart and pericardium: CT and MR imaging [^1127jpB3]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Metastases to the heart and pericardium are much more common than primary cardiac tumors and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Tumors that are most likely to involve the heart and pericardium include cancers of the lung and breast, melanoma, and lymphoma. Tumor may involve the heart and pericardium by one of four pathways: retrograde lymphatic extension, hematogenous spread, direct contiguous extension, or transvenous extension. Metastatic involvement of the heart and pericardium may go unrecognized until autopsy. Impairment of cardiac function occurs in approximately 30% of patients and is usually attributable to pericardial effusion. The clinical presentation includes shortness of breath, which may be out of proportion to radiographic findings in patients with pericardial effusion or may be the result of associated pleural effusion. Patients may also present with cough, anterior thoracic pain, pleuritic chest pain, or peripheral edema. The differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion in a patient with known malignancy includes malignant pericardial effusion, radiation-induced pericarditis, drug-induced pericarditis, and idiopathic pericarditis. Any disease process that causes thickening or nodularity of the pericardium or myocardium or masses within the cardiac chambers can mimic metastatic disease.

### Pericardial effusion under nivolumab: case-reports and review of the literature [^1174EQtL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor particularly used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Immune-related adverse events are frequent under immunotherapies. Cardiotoxic side effects, initially thought to be rare, are more often encountered paralleling the expanding use of immune checkpoint blockade. Among them, pericardial effusion and tamponade deserve attention as they may present with unusual symptomatology.

Case Presentation

We report three cases of pericardial effusion under nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. Two cases of early and late-onset pericardial effusion were symptomatic with tamponade and one case occurred without any symptoms. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial biopsy was performed in symptomatic pericardial effusion followed by the administration of a corticotherapy. Pericardial biopsies showed infiltration of T-lymphocytes, mostly CD4 +. Nivolumab was stopped in two cases and resumed for one patient. Pericardial effusion evolved positively in all cases with or without treatment.

Conclusions

We review the literature on pericardial effusion under nivolumab to further discuss the hallmarks of pericardial effusion under nivolumab and the management of nivolumab therapy in this situation. In conclusion, pericardial effusion as an immune-related adverse event under nivolumab appears less rare than initially thought and may require particular attention.

Evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — evaluation starts with a thorough history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests with particular attention to sedimentation rate, CRP, and troponin if myocarditis is suspected; TTE remains the first-line imaging modality for assessing suspected pericarditis, TTE findings may include pericardial effusion (without or with tamponade), pericardial thickening, features of constrictive physiology, and/or myocardial involvement, TTE can be serially used to monitor for improvement or worsening of these abnormalities, and TTE's main limitation is the inability of tissue characterization to identify and grade pericardial inflammation.

### Follow-up and treatment of idiopathic pericardial effusion… [^115W76DF]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Despite its increased frequency in diagnosis, the natural history, clinical course and management of this condition have not been well defined. Sagristà-Sauleda and colleagues performed a long-term prospective study to determine the clinical course of pericardial effusion and the need for intervention in patients with this condition. Patients were considered to have idiopathic pericardial effusion if they met all of the following criteria: the cause of pericardial effusion was undetermined after a complete medical evaluation, including examination of the pericardial fluid or tissue; the sum of the anterior and posterior echo-free spaces exceeded 20 mm at end diastole; the disease did not progress during the observation period; and the effusion persisted for more than three months. Cardiac tamponade was diagnosed if the systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg, pulsus paradoxus was present and jugular venous pressure had increased.

Patients underwent pericardiocentesis in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with subsequent chemical and bacteriologic evaluation of the pericardial fluid. If the pericardial effusion reappeared, a second pericardiocentesis was done. An anterior pericardiectomy was performed if the pericardial effusion reoccurred and lasted for more than six months. After the initial pericardiocentesis, patients were seen every three months for one year and then annually. Patients who became symptomatic were seen on an acute basis. Thirteen of the patients were initially asymptomatic, seven presented with atypical chest pain and seven were admitted to the hospital with overt cardiac tamponade. The duration of the effusions ranged from six months to 15 years. In all patients, the evaluation of pericardial fluid was normal or nondiagnostic. Follow-up ranged from 18 months to 20 years.

During follow-up, five patients underwent early pericardiectomy because of the presence of symptoms or the recurrence of a large effusion. Pericardiocentesis alone fully resolved or significantly reduced the pericardial effusion in eight patients. Ultimately, 20 of the 28 patients underwent pericardiectomy with no associated mortality. Only two patients required the procedure to treat overt tamponade. Thus, pericardiocentesis should be performed in most patients. Anterior pericardiectomy should be considered in patients with recurrence of fluid or those who develop symptoms of tamponade.

### Malignant pericardial effusion, or fluid around the heart due to cancer… [^112ExSqK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A pericardial effusion is a condition where excessive fluid accumulates in the sac around the heart, which normally has just minimal fluid present. Infection, autoimmune diseases, kidney failure, heart attack, previous radiation therapy, trauma, and cancer are the most common causes. It may not cause any symptoms if the amount of fluid is small or increasing slowly. If the fluid accumulates rapidly or in large amounts, the following symptoms may develop: Diagnosing it can be challenging and is based on symptoms, physical examination findings, and several specific tests. Chest radiography may show the heart symmetrically enlarged, particularly toward the bottom, reflecting the fluid collecting in a pattern that creates a "water bottle sign" of how the heart can look.

An electrocardiogram measures the heart's electrical activity and may show an increased heart rate, low electrical amplitude of a decreased electrical signal because it is reduced by traveling through the fluid, and sometimes an ECG pattern called electrical alternans that reflects the heart changing position as it moves within the excess fluid. The most helpful test is an echocardiogram, or ultrasonography of the heart. This will show the fluid in the sac around the heart and give an estimate of the volume and how it is affecting the heart's ability to pump. One way to be more certain if the fluid collection in the pericardial sac is from cancer is to find cancer cells in the fluid. Pericardial effusion is treated by draining the fluid and/or treating the underlying cause. Some effusions may be small or moderate, and the physician may recommend close monitoring.

But larger effusions can cause tamponade, which is when the pressure from the fluid reduces the heart's ability to pump blood forward, making it an emergency for an urgent fluid drainage. For cancer-related pericardial effusion, anticancer treatment is also recommended, which may prevent further fluid reaccumulation. Fluid drainage can be done by either pericardiocentesis or pericardial window. JAMA Patient Page: Pericardial Effusionhttps: //jamanetwork. com/journals/jama/fullarticle/206790.

### Echocardiographic interpretation of pericardial effusion… [^116eMTdT]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Echocardiography has proved to be quite useful in the detection of pericardial effusion. As little as 15 mL of fluid within the pericardial space can be detected. Specific signs of pericardial effusion, such as electrical alternans and paradoxical pulse, have become better understood by echocardiographic study. Yet, with all the benefits of echocardiography, the detection of pericardial effusion still may be quite difficult if careful attention is not given to technique. False-positive diagnosis of anterior pericardial effusion can be seen with epicardial fat pad, pericardial cyst, or foramen of Morgagni hernia. False-positive posterior pericardial effusion can be seen in large left pleural effusion, calcified mitral anulus, or excessively medial transducer angulation. New "switched-gain" circuits have helped detection of pericardial effusion by enhancement of pericardial echoes. Jacobs WR, Talano JV, Loeb HS.

### The management of malignant pericardial effusions… [^117Aw2cy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The accumulation of fluid in the potential space between serosal membranes may develop in 5% to 50% of patients with disseminated malignant disease. 1 Malignant pericardial effusion is particularly important because of its insidious clinical expression and the life-threatening potential of cardiac tamponade. Two mechanisms for the production of pericardial effusion that have been suggested are tumor implantation on serosal surfaces leading to exudation of fluid, and obstruction to lymphatic flow by mediastinal or hilar neoplastic infiltration causing transudation of fluid within the pericardial sac. 2 In the experimental model, lymph flow proceeds from the endocardial to the epicardial surface, and pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid exuding from the visceral pericardium.

Mere obstruction of the mediastinal lymphatic system draining the heart is inadequate to produce pericardial effusion, and additional ligation of the coronary sinus and the anterior coronary veins is essential.
