## Question

does isoniozid lower seizure threshold

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether isoniazid lowers the seizure threshold. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "seizure threshold" is defined clinically and what evidence would establish a drug as lowering it. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility for isoniazid's neurotoxicity. Next, I will examine clinical evidence at therapeutic doses, followed by toxic or overdose scenarios. After that, I need to review authoritative listings and guideline cautions. Finally, I will consider dose-related effects, interactions with antiseizure medications, and synthesize a risk-stratified conclusion with practical management steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. "Lowering the seizure threshold" means a medication increases susceptibility to seizures, either by provoking seizures in otherwise healthy individuals or by facilitating seizures in those with epilepsy; this can reflect a direct neurochemical effect or indirect effects such as metabolic derangements, and the concept is commonly invoked in drug interaction warnings and seizure management guidelines.

> Now, mechanistic plausibility: I need to check whether isoniazid has a credible mechanism that would lower seizure threshold. Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxine-dependent enzymes and reduces the availability of pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6 required for GABA synthesis; decreased GABAergic inhibition plausibly predisposes to seizures, and this mechanism is well-described in reviews of isoniazid neurotoxicity and is the rationale for pyridoxine as an antidote in toxicity [^117UEcRc] [^111cNAYf].

> Next, I should review therapeutic-dose clinical evidence. Wait, let me verify the label language and high-quality sources. FDA labeling lists convulsions among neurotoxic effects and advises caution in patients with seizure disorders, which implies seizure risk even outside overdose settings, and contemporary reviews of the 3 HP regimen describe seizures attributed to the isoniazid component at therapeutic exposures in immunocompetent adults, reinforcing that the risk is not solely confined to massive ingestions [^113NKgqZ] [^114pRCGn] [^113bEwGn].

> I will now examine toxic or overdose scenarios to ensure consistency. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are higher-dose contexts, but they can still inform mechanism and treatment. In isoniazid overdose, severe intractable seizures are a hallmark feature, typically alongside metabolic acidosis and CNS depression; prompt pyridoxine administration reverses seizures mechanistically, which strongly supports causality and a dose-dependent effect on seizure threshold [^11172MYV] [^1168UGE5].

> Next, I should review authoritative drug lists. I need to ensure isoniazid is indeed categorized among agents that lower seizure threshold. Multiple regulatory and clinical sources explicitly include isoniazid on lists of drugs that lower seizure threshold, aligning with its mechanistic and clinical profile [^115uaFpR].

> But wait, what about dose and susceptibility — does everyone have the same risk? Let me consider dose-related neurotoxicity and population factors. The risk appears dose-related, with neurological toxicity increasing with higher exposures and greater in slow acetylators who have higher plasma levels; WHO notes neurological toxicity that can include seizures with dose escalation, and 3 HP safety data show seizures at fixed weekly doses approximating or exceeding the usual mg/kg ceiling in lighter individuals, while HIV pediatric guidance also flags neurotoxicity including seizures as a rare but recognized risk at therapeutic doses [^114pRCGn] [^113bEwGn] [^113npTJR].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that could compound seizure risk. Isoniazid inhibits CYP2C19 and slows metabolism of phenytoin and carbamazepine, raising their serum levels and toxicity risk; clinically, phenytoin toxicity can present with encephalopathy and seizures, which could be misattributed to isoniazid alone, but the net effect is increased seizure propensity when these combinations are used without level monitoring and dose adjustment [^115dDk2B] [^112TFXSc] [^116f1sj5].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the evidence. Yes, isoniazid lowers the seizure threshold via functional pyridoxine deficiency with reduced GABA synthesis, with both mechanistic plausibility and clinical corroboration at therapeutic doses and a more pronounced, dose-dependent effect in overdose; the risk is modulated by dose, acetylator phenotype, nutritional status, and concomitant antiseizure medications that interact with isoniazid [^113bEwGn] [^11172MYV] [^113NKgqZ].

> Practically, I should confirm risk-mitigation steps. For patients with epilepsy or other seizure risk factors, use caution, monitor closely, and consider pyridoxine supplementation, especially in malnourished individuals; in suspected isoniazid overdose, treat seizures aggressively with high-dose IV pyridoxine (gram-for-gram if known, otherwise 5 g in adults or 80 mg/kg in children) plus benzodiazepines, and correct metabolic acidosis as needed; if antiseizure medications like phenytoin or carbamazepine are co-prescribed, anticipate increased concentrations and adjust doses proactively [^11172MYV] [^113bEwGn] [^116BsW6G] [^115dDk2B].

---

Isoniazid **lowers seizure threshold** by **reducing GABA** through pyridoxine inactivation [^116BsW6G], which impairs inhibitory neurotransmission and can provoke seizures, especially in overdose or with interacting drugs [^116BsW6G]. Seizures are uncommon at therapeutic doses but **risk rises with higher doses** [^116BsW6G], slow acetylation [^113bEwGn], malnutrition, or co-medications such as phenytoin or carbamazepine [^115dDk2B]. Pyridoxine is **first-line therapy** for isoniazid-induced seizures, and caution is advised in patients with seizure disorders or those on interacting medications [^113NKgqZ].

---

## Mechanism of seizure threshold lowering

Isoniazid lowers seizure threshold primarily by **inhibiting pyridoxine metabolism**, which reduces GABA synthesis and impairs inhibitory neurotransmission [^116BsW6G]. Normally, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is converted to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), a cofactor for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) [^notfound], the enzyme that synthesizes GABA. Isoniazid inactivates PLP, thereby **decreasing GABA levels** and increasing neuronal excitability [^116BsW6G].

---

## Clinical evidence of seizure risk

Seizures associated with isoniazid occur across a spectrum from therapeutic use to overdose. The **risk is dose-dependent**, increasing with higher doses or prolonged exposure [^113bEwGn].

- **Therapeutic doses**: Seizures are uncommon but documented, particularly in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders, slow acetylators, or those with nutritional deficiencies [^113bEwGn] [^113NKgqZ].
- **Overdose**: Acute ingestion of ≥ 30 mg/kg can cause severe, refractory seizures, metabolic acidosis, and coma [^116BsW6G]. Pyridoxine is the specific antidote and should be administered promptly [^116BsW6G].
- **Case reports**: Numerous cases document isoniazid-induced seizures, including status epilepticus, particularly in pediatric and overdose scenarios [^1168UGE5] [^111MHKKa].

---

## Factors influencing seizure risk

Several factors **modulate seizure risk** with isoniazid:

| **Factor** | **Influence on seizure risk** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses significantly increase risk [^116BsW6G] |
| Genetic variability (NAT2) | Slow acetylators have higher plasma levels and increased risk [^113bEwGn] |
| Nutritional status | Malnutrition, especially B6 deficiency, increases risk [^113bEwGn] |
| Concurrent medications | Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and other CYP2C19 substrates increase risk due to altered metabolism [^notfound] |
| Age | Children and elderly may be more susceptible |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given isoniazid's potential to lower seizure threshold, clinicians should:

- **Monitor patients**: Closely monitor patients with seizure disorders, malnutrition, or those receiving interacting medications [^113NKgqZ].
- **Adjust therapy**: Consider dose adjustments or alternative regimens in high-risk patients [^113bEwGn].
- **Educate patients**: Inform patients about symptoms of neurotoxicity and the importance of adherence to prescribed pyridoxine supplementation [^113bEwGn].
- **Emergency management**: In overdose, administer pyridoxine promptly (gram-for-gram matching the ingested isoniazid dose) alongside benzodiazepines for seizure control [^11172MYV] [^116BsW6G].

---

## Conclusion

Isoniazid **lowers seizure threshold** by reducing GABA synthesis via pyridoxine inactivation, which increases neuronal excitability [^113bEwGn]. Seizures are uncommon at therapeutic doses but can occur — especially with higher doses, slow acetylation, malnutrition, or interacting medications [^116BsW6G]. Clinicians should remain vigilant, monitor high-risk patients, and use pyridoxine supplementation and prompt antidotal therapy in cases of overdose or neurotoxicity [^116BsW6G].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drugs that lower seizure threshold: Concomitant use may lead to an increased risk of seizures. (7.1)
Drugs with cholinergic effects (e.g., direct or indirect cholinesterase inhibitors): Concomitant use may increase the cholinergic effects of FIRDAPSE and of those drugs and increase the risk of adverse reactions. (7.2)

7.1 Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold

The concomitant use of FIRDAPSE and drugs that lower seizure threshold may lead to an increased risk of seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The decision to administer FIRDAPSE concomitantly with drugs that lower the seizure threshold should be carefully considered in light of the severity of the associated risks.

7.2 Drugs with Cholinergic Effects

The concomitant use of FIRDAPSE and drugs with cholinergic effects (e.g., direct or indirect cholinesterase inhibitors) may increase the cholinergic effects of FIRDAPSE and of those drugs and increase the risk of adverse reactions.

Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy (PDE): Essential Clinical Features and Historical Aspects

First reported by Hunt and colleagues in 1954, PDE is frequently described as the prototypical metabolic epileptic encephalopathy that is unresponsive to antiseizure drugs, but which is generally successfully treated with a vitamin or another cofactor. These patients commonly present with medication-resistant neonatal seizures that may lead to status epilepticus and that come under control only with the addition of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) to their treatment regimen. – Concomitant improvement in the electroencephalogram (EEG) may occur as well, particularly if the patient is experiencing ongoing clinical seizures and EEG monitoring is conducted at the time of pyridoxine administration (Figure 1). The long-term treatment of these patients requires daily supplementation of large (i.e. pharmacologic, not physiologic) doses of pyridoxine. – Hence, these individuals are dependent on the vitamin; they are not deficient. Indeed, clinical pyridoxine deficiency is rare, with an incidence of 0.23 cases/100 000 person-year in US military personal; significant deficiency is associated with irritability, abdominal pain, insomnia, weakness, and difficulty with ambulation. In childhood, the most often cited example was iatrogenic pyridoxine deficiency secondary to an error in the manufacturing of infant formula, which led to an epileptic encephalopathy quite similar to the neonatal presentation of PDE. Importantly, a pyridoxine deficiency may be induced by treatment with isoniazid, and pyridoxine is the antidote for isoniazid overdose.

### Lindane [^115uaFpR]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Oils may enhance absorption of lindane, therefore, patients and caregivers applying the shampoo to others should avoid using oil treatments, or oil-based hair dressings or conditioners immediately before and after applying Lindane Shampoo.

In addition, there are many drugs that may lower the seizure threshold, and Lindane Shampoo should be prescribed with caution in patients taking these medications. Drugs that may lower the seizure threshold include, but are not limited to the following:

Antipsychotics
Antidepressants
Theophylline
Cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus capsules
Penicillins, imipenem, quinolone antibiotics
Chloroquine sulfate, pyrimethamine
Isoniazid
Meperidine
Radiographic contrast agents
Centrally active anticholinesterases
Methocarbamol

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Fertility

Although no studies have been conducted with Lindane Shampoo, numerous long-term feeding studies have been conducted in mice and rats to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the technical grade of hexachlorocyclohexane as well as the alpha, beta, gamma (lindane) and delta isomers. Both oral and topical applications have been evaluated. Increased incidences of neoplasms were not clearly related to administration of lindane. The results of mutagenicity tests in bacteria do not indicate that lindane is mutagenic. Lindane did not cause sister chromatid exchange in an in vivo assay. The number of spermatids in the testes of rats 2 weeks after oral administration of a single dose of 30 mg/kg body weight (12 times the estimated human exposure for scabies on a body surface area comparison and assuming 50% rat oral bioavailability and 10% human bioavailability) was significantly reduced compared to the control rats.

Drugs lowering seizure threshold

Polypharmacy is common in the ICU and can contribute to adverse drug effects such as seizures by lowering the seizure threshold or via drug-drug interactions that may reduce the blood concentration of an AED the patient may already be receiving (see the next section). Antibiotics, psychotropic agents, and analgesics have been all associated with seizures (Table 7).

Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion — repeated supratherapeutic ingestions need to be referred to an emergency department (ED) only if at least 10 g or 200 mg/kg (whichever is less) during a single 24-hour period, or at least 6 g or 150 mg/kg (whichever is less) per 24-hour period for the preceding 48 hours or longer, is ingested; these authors suggest that these thresholds should be decreased to 4 g or 100 mg/kg (whichever is less) for patients potentially at increased risk for acetaminophen toxicity (eg, isoniazid use, prolonged fasting).

### Clinically important drug interactions in epilepsy: interactions between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs [^112TFXSc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly prescribed for long periods, up to a lifetime, and many patients will require treatment with other agents for the management of concomitant or intercurrent conditions. When two or more drugs are prescribed together, clinically important interactions can occur. Among old-generation AEDs, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone are potent inducers of hepatic enzymes, and decrease the plasma concentration of many psychotropic, immunosuppressant, antineoplastic, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular drugs, as well as oral contraceptive steroids. Most new generation AEDs do not have clinically important enzyme inducing effects. Other drugs can affect the pharmacokinetics of AEDs; examples include the stimulation of lamotrigine metabolism by oral contraceptive steroids and the inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism by certain macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, verapamil, diltiazem, and isoniazid. Careful monitoring of clinical response is recommended whenever a drug is added or removed from a patient's AED regimen.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^11658KtY]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — suggested diagnostic work-up emphasizes urgent, parallel evaluation. The steps included in the diagnostic work-up should be completed as soon as possible and occur simultaneously and in parallel with treatment. For all patients, obtain fingerstick glucose, monitor vital signs, perform head computed tomography (CT) scan (appropriate for most cases), order laboratory test: blood glucose, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, AED levels, and initiate continuous electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring. Based on clinical presentation, consider brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture (LP), a comprehensive toxicology panel including toxins that frequently cause seizures (i.e. isoniazid, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, cocaine, sympathomimetics, alcohol, organophosphates, and cyclosporine), and other laboratory tests: liver function tests, serial troponins, type and hold, coagulation studies, arterial blood gas, AED levels, toxicology screen (urine and blood), and inborn errors of metabolism.

### Isoniazid-induced status epilepticus in a pediatric patient after inadequate pyridoxine therapy [^1168UGE5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Isoniazid (INH) is an effective treatment for tuberculosis and among the most common causes of drug-induced seizures in the United States. Isoniazid intoxication produces a characteristic clinical syndrome including seizures, metabolic acidosis, and, in severe cases, respiratory depression and coma.

Case

A 10-month-old male infant was presented after being found with his father's INH. The patient was brought to a local hospital where he had a witnessed generalized seizure and was given 650 mg pyridoxine intravenously, which was based on a 70 mg/kg recommendation. Five hours after the time of ingestion, the patient developed recurrent generalized seizures. He was given diazepam and then loaded with phenobarbital 20 mg/kg, while awaiting more pyridoxine from the pharmacy. He received an additional 2 g pyridoxine for a suspected ingestion of approximately 2.7 g INH (290 mg/kg total dose), and his seizures subsequently resolved.

Discussion

Treatment of INH toxicity must address correction of gamma-aminobutyric acid deficiency with pyridoxine replacement and management of life-threatening events. For poisonings in which the amount of INH ingested is known, pyridoxine is dosed on a gram-for-gram basis. Several reference textbooks recommend pyridoxine dosing in children to be 70 mg/kg. This was the justification for the initial pyridoxine dose administered in our case. However, after review of the referenced literature, the rationale supporting this recommendation remains unclear. Benzodiazepines should also be given with pyridoxine as they have been shown to have a synergistic effect in terminating seizures in animal models.

Conclusions

As soon as possible after INH overdose is suspected or diagnosed, pyridoxine should be administered in a dose approximately equal to the estimated amount of INH ingested regardless of the age of the patient.

### The 3 HP regimen for tuberculosis preventive treatment: safety, dosage and related concerns during its large-scale implementation in countries like India [^114pRCGn]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

The recommended standard daily dose of isoniazid for INH-susceptible tuberculosis or the daily isoniazid preventive treatment is 5 mg/kg in adults and 10–15 mg/kg in children. In case of the once-weekly isoniazid for either indication the maximum recommended dose is 15 mg/kg. In the case of drug-resistant tuberculosis where high dose-isoniazid (designated as Hh) was used earlier as a companion drug, the recommended doses were 10–15 mg/kg in adults and 15–20 mg/kg in children. So the highest recommended dose of INH recommended for either daily dosing in drug-resistant TB or weekly dosing in drug-susceptible TB or TB infection is 15 mg/kg. This translates into maximum doses of 450–600 mg across the lowest or the highest weight bands.

Table 2 shows doses of isoniazid in different indications and in extremes of weight bands (30–35 kg in lower range and > 70 kg in higher range). These range from 225 to 375 mg daily for drug-susceptible treatment, 450–600 mg daily in high-dose isoniazid treatment for drug-resistant TB, and a fixed dose of 900 mg weekly isoniazid recommended by WHO in the 3 HP regimen. age > 14 years. This dose of 900 mg is higher than the maximum recommended weight-based dose (15 mg/kg) for any subject weighing < 60 kg. In the weight band of 30–45 kg subjects, this fixed dose would translate into a weight-based dose of 20–30 mg/kg, approaching the toxic dose of 30 kg. There are reports of isoniazid causing neurological syndromes as a part of toxicity that varies with doses 2% at the dose of 5 mg/kg to about 15% at 10 mg/kg, which is dose related with toxicity that may include peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, dysarthria, confusion and even seizures. Seizures have been documented in a recipient of the 3 HP, who was an immunocompetent adult without malnutrition, and was attributed to the INH component.

### Phenytoin toxicity caused by a drug-to-drug interaction between phenytoin and antitubercular therapy [^116f1sj5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Phenytoin is one of the most used antiepileptic drugs. Isoniazid, a first-line antitubercular drug, blocks the CYP2C19 enzyme, preventing phenytoin from being metabolised. Concomitant use of phenytoin and isoniazid predisposes to phenytoin toxicity. Here, we present the case of a female in her mid-30s with a known seizure disorder on phenytoin monotherapy. She was also started on antitubercular therapy, including isoniazid, after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis recently. This led to a catastrophic sequence of events including progressive loss of balance, psychosis, nystagmus, hyperreflexia and later, stupor. Her serum phenytoin level was found to exceed 40mg/L. Her symptoms improved when phenytoin was switched to levetiracetam. Ours is the first case report of such an interaction in over 10 years and highlights the need to be extra-cautious while prescribing phenytoin and antitubercular therapy concomitantly, especially in a populations dominated by slow acetylators.

### Thoracic spine compression fracture during isoniazid-induced seizures: case report [^111MHKKa]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

We report here an 11-year-old previously healthy girl with isoniazid intoxication who sustained a seizure-induced thoracic compression fracture. The following might be the first such case reported in the medical literature. Isoniazid toxicity should be suspected in any patient who comes to the emergency department with refractory seizures and metabolic acidosis. Forceful muscle contractions during a convulsive seizure can result in vertebral compression fracture, especially in the midthoracic region. A complaint of back pain after isoniazid-induced seizures in patients raises a strong suspicion of vertebral fracture and should be evaluated radiologically.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114DhRHn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal seizure management — following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is preferred, with IV preferred to intramuscular (IM) and IM administration also effective; parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings because of risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. It is not recommended to use alpha2-adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures, beta-adrenergic antagonists can lower the seizure threshold, and phenytoin should not be used unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113Am2eX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — assessing and managing seizure risk — "Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures". They should also review concomitant medications because "medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures", and "PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold". If risk is identified, "clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication". The guideline further notes variation in practice — "The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk" — and that "Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g., levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal".

### Isoniazid [^111QMgCz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid Control of Metabolic Acidosis

Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The administration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency.

Dialysis

Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate.

Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, utilize meticulous respiratory and other intensive care to protect against hypoxia, hypotension, aspiration, pneumonitis, etc.

### Highlights from the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society 2018 [^1157hAa4]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Fred Lado, MD PhD, Aradia Fu, MD

The symposium addressed the intricate relationship between epilepsy and other medical conditions.

Dr Scott Mintzer kicked off the symposium with his talk "Epilepsy & Heart Disease: Tips for the Consultant". He identified the impacts of anticonvulsants on the cardiovascular system and the interactions between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and cardiac medications. Hepatic enzyme inducing anticonvulsants are associated with worse lipid profiles and vascular risk markers and reduce the efficacy of some cardiovascular medications, such as statins. Older anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, may even be associated with increased risk of myocardial ischemia. Dr Steven Pacia presented "Syncope and Other Seizure Mimics", where he reviewed key clinical features that distinguish seizures from syncope and other seizure mimics such as migraine, transient ischemic attacks, metabolic disorders, nonepileptic psychogenic seizures, transient global amnesia, and sleep disorders. There is a broad differential diagnosis for episodic loss of awareness. Some, such as prolonged QT syndrome, should not be missed. Dr. Andres Kanner led the discussion on "Do Psychotropic and Antibiotic Drugs Cause Seizures? A Review of the Evidence". He reviewed selection of antibiotics and psychiatric medications that would minimize seizure risk. Therapeutic doses of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants appear to be associated with reduced seizure incidence, though overdoses of these classes of medications can be associated with increased risk of seizures. Bupropion and clomipramine were the exceptions to the rule, and seizure risk was increased with these medications compared to placebo. Antibiotics may increase the risk of seizures. The mechanism by which antibiotic lower seizure threshold may be decreased GABAergic activity. Dr Page Pennell discussed the management of AEDs during pregnancy to optimize seizure control and pregnancy outcomes in her talk "Seizure Management during Pregnancy". Her presentation reviewed the teratogenic risk of AEDs (particularly high with valproate as well as older AEDs) and other pregnancy outcomes including "small for gestational age" (greatest risk associated with topiramate, phenobarbital and zonisamide, and valproate). Valproate was also associated with lower IQ in childhood and increased risk of autism. On the other hand, folate prescribed before pregnancy or at start of pregnancy was associated with higher IQ and lower risks of autism. There are changes in pharmacokinetics of AEDs during pregnancy and dose adjustments are needed to maintain seizure control. Dr Jeanne Young discussed "Anticonvulsants and the Skin Hypersensitivity". Dr Young emphasized the diversity in hypersensitivity associated with AEDs, distinguishing drug rash based on pathophysiology and clinical characteristics, and recognizing clinical features that could alert us to severe cutaneous adverse reactions. The most common type of reaction is a morbilliform rash with erythematous papules or plaques due to immune complex deposition and cell-mediated immunity. These rashes characteristically begin 7 to 10 days after starting medication and typically resolve in 2 to 3 weeks. Patients usually feel well, though they may complain of pruritis. Interestingly, in some cases it is possible to "treat through" the rash, or re-challenge later with the same medication, with the patient under close observation by dermatology. Signs characteristic of more severe drug reactions are swelling of the face, presence of pustules, bullae, or vesicles, dusky or painful lesions, mucous membrane involvement, or signs of systemic involvement. Morbilliform skin eruptions beginning later than expected along with systemic symptoms and patient feeling ill are more concerning for progressing to Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms syndrome.

### Isoniazid [^11172MYV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and Symptoms

Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings.

Treatment

Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg, can cause neurotoxicity6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion.

For the Asymptomatic Patient

Absorption of drugs from the GI tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal. Gastric emptying should also be employed in the asymptomatic patient. Safeguard the patient's airway when employing these procedures. Patients who acutely ingest greater than 80 mg/kg should be treated with intravenous pyridoxine on a gram per gram basis equal to the isoniazid dose. If an unknown amount of isoniazid is ingested, consider an initial dose of 5 grams of pyridoxine given over 30 to 60 minutes in adults or 80 mg/kg of pyridoxine in children.

For the Symptomatic Patient

Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mg/kg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be administered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabolism of phenytoin.

General

Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc.; type and cross-match blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis.

### Do not overlook acute isoniazid poisoning in children with status epilepticus [^1169cVW8]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 2-year-old girl was admitted with generalized convulsive status epilepticus. She was in a stupor and could respond only to painful stimuli. She also had severe metabolic acidosis. Although initial liver function tests were normal, they were found to be moderately high on the fifth day of admission; however, they dropped to their normal ranges on the twelfth day of admission. Initially, the patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic status epilepticus, and classic anticonvulsant agents, including diazepam, phenytoin, and then phenobarbital, were given. However, her seizures did not subside, and diazepam infusion was initiated. After initiation of diazepam infusion, the seizures were completely controlled. On the fourth day of admission, her parents said that she had accidentally received 20 tablets (a total dose of 2000 mg) of isoniazid just before admission to our hospital. Later, we injected 200 mg of pyridoxine intravenously. During follow-up, her general condition improved, and anticonvulsant agents were discontinued because an electroencephalogram was found to be norma. She was discharged from the hospital on the twelfth day of admission. At the fourth month of follow-up, she was seizure free. Because of this case, we would like to re-emphasize that acute isoniazid poisoning should also be considered in a child with unexplained status epilepticus.

### Safety and effectiveness of 3 novel all-oral shortened regimens for rifampicin-or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Kazakhstan [^114oDPkL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety

Clinically relevant AESIs were infrequent (Tables 3 and 4) and only 1 clinically relevant AESI became a severe adverse event. Peripheral neuropathy was experienced by 18 participants (3.5%), resulting in a permanent drug discontinuation in 3 participants (16.7%). Myelosuppression was the second most common AESI, experienced by 13 participants (2.5%). QTc prolongation was notably infrequent, experienced by only 2 participants (0.4%), with no permanent drug cessation. Four participants developed psychosis, all of whom were receiving the Cs-containing regimen. Additionally, the Cs-containing regimen was associated with 5 out of the 6 reported cases of seizures. While clinically relevant hepatotoxicity was only experienced by 1 participant, lower grades of hepatotoxicity that did not meet the clinically relevant threshold occurred more frequently, with 96 (18.8%) participants experiencing grade 1 hepatotoxicity and 1 participant experiencing grade 2 hepatotoxicity (0.20%). Safety analyses restricted to individuals included in effectiveness analyses were similar (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Adverse event monitoring occurred regularly (Supplementary Table 5).

### The 3 HP regimen for tuberculosis preventive treatment: safety, dosage and related concerns during its large-scale implementation in countries like India [^113bEwGn]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Isoniazid is metabolised by the N-Acetyltransferase 2 gene (NAT2). In case of persons who are slow acetylators, the potential for adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity, are higher. In a study from India, 55% of individuals were found to be slow acetylators, and their plasma isoniazid levels were found to be higher. In a recent study on patients, 58% were slow acetylators and 35% were intermediate acetylators and their median 2-h concentrations were 2–2.5 times that of the 7% who were fast acetylators. The potential for adverse events may be higher in slow acetylators in India who will have even higher INH levels with this high dose isoniazid in the 3 HP regimen. In fact, the WHO recommends a lowering of the isoniazid dosage if the population has a high prevalence of slow acetylators.
3 Isoniazid therapy and the necessity for co-administration of pyridoxine.

Isoniazid therapy can have both acute and chronic toxicity. The common forms of chronic toxicity–peripheral neuropathy (due to pyridoxine deficiency caused by isoniazid) and hepatotoxicity, have been less common with the 12 dose 3 HP regimen. On the other hand, the profile of ADRs reflect acute toxicity of isoniazid with neurological symptoms like dizziness, drowsiness, and general and cardiovascular symptoms like flu-like symptoms, hypotension, with or without features of anaphylaxis. Isoniazid also causes varied neurological manifestations as a result of the functional pyridoxine deficiency, like acute psychosis, seizures, obtundation and even coma, all of which have been show to reverse with pyridoxine in adequate doses. Dizziness has been noted as a prodrome of psychosis.

The pathophysiology of adverse drug reactions with isoniazid partially involve its effect on pyridoxine which is involved in functioning of over 60 enzymes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, including synthesis of neurotransmitters like GABA and glutamate. Isoniazid leads to pyridoxine depletion directly and by inhibiting the phosphokinase enzyme that results in its biologically active form. This has an effect on the metabolic cycle of neurotransmitters, like GABA and glutamate. Isoniazid is also a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor and can cause serotonin syndrome in the presence of other antidepressants.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^115gvK5L]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Prevent and manage secondary neurological complications

Neurological complications majorly contribute to poor outcome from TBM. Most manifestations, including raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarction, paradoxical reactions, and seizures, are a direct consequence of intracranial inflammation, emphasising the need to prioritise evaluation of more effective anti-inflammatory therapies. However, evidence-based interventions for adjunctive neurocritical care in TBM are also needed. Trials defining the management of these important complications have never been conducted. This is partly because of resource constraints in high burden settings, for example limited access to expertise for ventricular drainage, and because of substantial challenges in trial design and implementation.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111Kj87S]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Managing Mild to Moderate Withdrawal Symptoms

Many patients will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper. If patients experience challenging symptoms, the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10. If pausing or slowing the taper has not been successful, clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions (see "Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process").

Assessing and Managing Seizure Risk

Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. Clinicians should also conduct a thorough medication review, as medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold. If seizure risk is identified, clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication.

The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk. Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g. levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal who have a history of withdrawal-related seizures. In these instances, addiction medicine clinicians are particularly concerned about the phenomenon of increasing seizure severity with repeated episodes of withdrawal (i.e. kindling). However, neurologists generally do not treat seizure risk prophylactically. As such, the CGC did not come to consensus on management of seizure risk in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal. The CGC recommends that clinicians manage seizures and seizure risk according to current standards of care, which may differ across disciplines.

The goal of pharmacologic therapy for patients with epilepsy is to suppress seizures without side effects. There is growing interest in developing antiepileptogenic drugs capable of preventing the onset of seizures in patients at high risk and inducing a permanent remission of seizures in patients with epilepsy, i.e., a cure. Whether any anticonvulsant drugs in current use have antiepileptogenic properties is the subject of this overview.

### Disease modification in partial epilepsy [^114CL5XA]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

With the growth in antiepileptic drug treatment, the question arises as to what extent we are merely treating the symptom (i.e. the seizures) rather than the underlying disease process (i.e. epileptogenesis). Epileptogenicity can be considered as the process whereby structural and functional changes occur following an insult that in some cases result in epilepsy. Epileptogenicity also describes some of the changes and processes that contribute to the progression observed in some epilepsies. These processes have been modelled in animals mostly by the kindling model of epilepsy, in which repetition of subconvulsive stimuli results in a progressive epileptic state and eventually leads to spontaneous seizures. However, it is not clear that kindling has a human correlate, so models in which an initial insult (status epilepticus, hyperthermia, hypoxia, trauma) is followed by the development of lowered seizure threshold and, in some instances, spontaneous seizures have been used. These models seem to support the "second hit" hypothesis, in which there is an initial insult resulting in lowered seizure threshold, and then a later insult, the "second hit", that results in the expression of epilepsy. These models also support the concept of a latent period during which there could be targeted therapies to prevent the epileptogenic process. Although the occurrence of neuronal damage is one such target, neuronal damage is not necessary for epileptogenesis, and other mechanisms are at play. At the present time, it is not known whether targeted therapies may also affect compensatory processes, such as brain repair. Clearly, this would be a potential risk of such strategies. Epidemiological evidence and trials indicate that our present antiepileptic drugs are not effective in preventing epileptogenesis; antiepileptic drugs were, however, not designed for this purpose. Data from animal experiments suggest that treatment of non-convulsive status epilepticus following specific insults may prevent epileptogenesis. The relevance of this for the human condition remains uncertain, but non-convulsive status epilepticus is probably an under-recognized and probably under-treated condition. Perhaps one of the most salutary findings has been the observation of decreased childhood epilepsy with improved neonatal care. This highlights the importance of medical care at the time of an insult, and of prevention of the insults. This review discusses the data that support the concepts underlying epileptogenesis and the model systems that are presumed to reflect the human condition. Particular attention is paid to the potential for interrupting the processes underlying epileptogenesis.

### Exit strategy: balancing the risks and rewards of antiseizure medication withdrawal [^117DmKTo]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

From Preference to Evidence: Subjective Risk Assessment Versus Prognostic Models

While most efforts to date have quantified seizure probabilities, scarce literature informs how patients or clinicians contextualize those probabilities. Examples:

Thirty-one patients who were seizure-free at least 1 year seen at an academic center evaluated how concerning different hypothetical seizure risks might be compared to hypothetical ASM side effects or inconveniences. Inconvenience of having to take medication, occasional laboratory monitoring draws, and having a low to moderate copay were less concerning than typical post-withdrawal seizure probabilities. A 10% seizure chance in the next year was about equally concerning as weight gain or sedation side effects, whereas a 25% chance of seizure in the next year was rated as more concerning than any studied side effect, favoring continuation in many patients particularly if tolerating their ASMs well.

Seventy-six children who were at least 3 months seizure-free and their families provided what maximal seizure risk might be acceptable to discontinue ASMs. Responses varied markedly, from 0% to > 90% (median ∼40%). Interestingly, while their physicians' median risk tolerance and physicians' estimates of their patient's risk tolerance were close, physician responses were almost completely uncorrelated with patient responses within dyads.

Finally, 287 neurologists reported their maximally tolerated seizure risk in the next 2 years when considering withdrawal. Again there was wide variation ranging from near 0% to above 75%, but median responses were most conservatively 15% for adults with convulsions, up to about 30% with nonconvulsive seizures, with thresholds tending to be lower than typically used for starting ASMs in the first place.

These examples only begin to illustrate how patients and clinicians weigh the important tradeoffs and manipulate risk information. Ideally, as has been done in other conditions, we should focus more as a field on systematically studying patient preferences to align with physician practice for incorporation into care guidelines.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116QRaaG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder — seizure evaluation and workup in the emergency department (ED) specifies that when a patient presents to the ED with seizures following stimulant use, full neurological workup is not necessary if the seizures are well explained by substance use or withdrawal (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation). When the etiology of the seizures is not well explained by stimulant use, the workup and management of seizures should proceed according to usual best practices (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). The guideline clarifies that a seizure is well-explained by substance use or withdrawal when the patient is known to use medications that lower seizure threshold (eg, tramadol, bupropion) or has a history of stimulant- or other substance use-related seizure. Even if full neurological workup is waived, clinicians might still order diagnostic testing such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head to rule out other etiologies based on clinical exam findings, and additional evaluation is indicated if seizures recur despite adequate management of stimulant intoxication.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

A number of interactions between vitamins and drugs have been reported. The following are examples of these types of interactions.

Effect of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC on other drugs:

Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin (7.1)
Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin may reduce the activity of bleomycin (7.1)
Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease blood levels of levodopa and levodopa efficacy may decrease (7.1)
Phenytoin: Folic acid may decrease phenytoin blood levels and increase risk of seizure activity (7.1)
Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease response to methotrexate (7.1)

Effects of other drugs on INFUVITE PEDIATRIC:

Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements (7.2).
Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations (7.2)

7.1 Drug Interactions Affecting Co-Administered Drugs

Warfarin: Vitamin K, a component of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood levels of prothrombin/INR should be monitored to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.

Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro, thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced.

Levodopa: Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood levels of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy.

Phenytoin: Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity.

Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate therapy.

7.2 Drug Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels

Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements.

Phenytoin: Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations.

### Measure for measure: measuring the usefulness of measuring antiseizure medication levels [^116mXZZ5]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

The good advice to be cautious in interpretation of levels is often forgotten. This can lead to dangerous reductions in dose because of a "toxic" level which in fact may have been perfectly well-tolerated and necessary for seizure control. Less dangerous but still expensive and generative of side effects is the practice of raising doses because of a "subtherapeutic" level in persons who are seizure-free.

How do we select patients who need levels measured? There are 3 categories of patients: those with seizures, those with toxicity, and those who are just fine. Most patients in all 3 categories do not need levels: the course of action is clear. For those with seizures, as a check for adherence, a single level is worthless unless compared with previous levels in the same patient. For those with toxicity, identification of the culprit drug in polytherapy is also unreliable. The drug with the low serum level may be responsible. Patients who are just fine would seem to constitute a group that never needs a plasma level. But there is an exception: patients with new-onset epilepsy with infrequent seizures. In such patients, one cannot "titrate to effect" because the infrequent seizure has not yet recurred. It is then necessary to titrate to a predetermined dose or to a predetermined plasma level. A dose target may be satisfactory if there is a well-established relationship between dose and efficacy, or if serum levels are known not to reflect degree of brain binding (levetiracetam). But for most drugs, aiming for a target serum level makes more sense. I am uncomfortable with a lamotrigine level of 3 μg/mL in a patient with new-onset epilepsy, regardless of the prescribed dose. If nonadherence is ruled out, the dose should be raised. Another possible use for a level is to set a "baseline" when the patient is doing well for future reference. This is the concept of setting an "individual reference range" rather than a population reference range.

### Advancing the chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis: a consensus view [^113F226a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Antitubercular chemotherapy

General considerations

Current antitubercular chemotherapy for TBM remains based on that used in pulmonary tuberculosis and does not account for distinct disease characteristics in TBM that require specific therapeutic considerations. Use of the present regimen for TBM is not based on bespoke trials, rather on progress made in the derivation of 'short course' regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast with pulmonary tuberculosis, where overall mortality is relatively low and the treatment goal is long-term relapse-free cure, TBM therapy must reduce early mortality and longer-term neurological disability. A primary consideration for TBM treatment is to select effective antitubercular drugs that rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of disease. Drug penetration into brain tissue is key: CSF drug concentrations are often used but are an indirect and suboptimal measure of brain tissue penetration. There is limited pharmacometric evidence to support the composition, doses, or duration of the current standard of care for TBM. Other characteristics of an ideal TBM regimen include activity against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, particularly isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis, which is common but infrequently detected in TBM; a low propensity for serious adverse reactions that may lead to premature discontinuation; and comprising drugs that can be dosed in neurocritical illness and that are accessible in high burden settings.

Selection of new antitubercular drugs and regimens

Ongoing and recently completed unpublished trials are shown in Table 1. All actively recruiting phase 3 trials of antitubercular therapy are investigating high-dose rifampicin (35 mg/kg), often in combination with linezolid; several are powered to demonstrate reductions in mortality. Higher dose isoniazid is also being evaluated. Doses and composition of these experimental regimens were selected based on pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (using sputum culture conversion as the efficacy measure) and small trials in TBM showing inconsistent effects on clinical outcome. Nevertheless, these ongoing studies will provide high-quality evidence to inform treatment guidelines. Future trials should avoid repeating evaluation of these regimens (which may become standard of care and serve as a control in future trials, if successful) and take different approaches to regimen selection.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride (contrave) [^112kWbnc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Seizures

Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, can cause seizures. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The incidence of seizure in patients receiving CONTRAVE in clinical trials was approximately 0.1% vs 0% on placebo. CONTRAVE should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while being treated with CONTRAVE.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with CONTRAVE. CONTRAVE is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs. Caution should be used when prescribing CONTRAVE to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure including:

history of head trauma or prior seizure, severe stroke, arteriovenous malformation, central nervous system tumor or infection, or metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia)
excessive use of alcohol or sedatives, addiction to cocaine or stimulants, or withdrawal from sedatives
patients with diabetes treated with insulin and/or oral diabetic medications (sulfonylureas and meglitinides) that may cause hypoglycemia
concomitant administration of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, including other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids

Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Seizure: Clinical experience with bupropion suggests that the risk of seizure may be minimized by adhering to the recommended dosing recommendations [see Dosage and Administration (2)], in particular:

the total daily dose of CONTRAVE does not exceed 360 mg of the bupropion component (i.e., four tablets per day)
the daily dose is administered in divided doses (twice daily)
the dose is escalated gradually
no more than two tablets are taken at one time
coadministration of CONTRAVE with high-fat meals is avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
if a dose is missed, a patient should wait until the next scheduled dose to resume the regular dosing schedule

### Isocarboxazid (Marplan) [^111nepfj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Hypotension

Hypotension has been observed during Marplan therapy. Symptoms of postural hypotension are seen most commonly, but not exclusively, in patients with preexistent hypertension; blood pressure usually returns rapidly to pretreatment levels upon discontinuation of the drug. Dosage increases should be made more gradually in patients showing a tendency toward hypotension at the beginning of therapy. Postural hypotension may be relieved by having the patient lie down until blood pressure returns to normal. When Marplan is combined with phenothiazine derivatives or other compounds known to cause hypotension, the possibility of additive hypotensive effects should be considered.

Lower Seizure Threshold

Because Marplan lowers the convulsive threshold in some animal experiments, suitable precautions should be taken if epileptic patients are treated. Marplan appears to have varying effects in epileptic patients; while some have a decrease in frequency of seizures, others have more seizures.

Drugs that lower the seizure threshold, including MAO inhibitors, should not be used with Amipaque®(metrizamide, Sanofi Winthrop Pharmaceuticals). As with other MAO inhibitors, Marplan should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography and should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure.

Hepatotoxicity

There is a low incidence of altered liver function or jaundice in patients treated with Marplan. In the past, it was difficult to differentiate most cases of drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice from viral hepatitis although this is no longer true. Periodic liver chemistry tests should be performed during Marplan therapy; use of the drug should be discontinued at the first sign of hepatic dysfunction or jaundice.

This paper discusses the pharmacological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying drug-related seizures, defined by the occurrence of seizures at therapeutic doses, focusing primarily on medications with a direct/mechanistic basis for seizure precipitation. High-risk drugs and populations are discussed, as are diagnostic approaches and management strategies.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal seizure — pharmacotherapy: Following a withdrawal seizure, patients should be immediately treated with a medication effective at preventing another seizure; benzodiazepines are first-line and a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is preferred, while phenobarbital is an option but less preferred. Following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is preferred; if available, IV administration is preferred to intramuscular (IM), but IM administration is also effective, and parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g. Intensive Care Unit [ICU] or Cardiac/Coronary Care Unit [CCU]) because of risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. It is not recommended to use alpha2-adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures, beta-adrenergic antagonists also can lower the seizure threshold, and phenytoin should not be used unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

A number of interactions between vitamins and drugs have been reported. The following are examples of these types of interactions.

Effect of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC on other drugs:

Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin (7.1)
Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin may reduce the activity of bleomycin (7.1)
Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease blood levels of levodopa and levodopa efficacy may decrease (7.1)
Phenytoin: Folic acid may decrease phenytoin blood levels and increase risk of seizure activity (7.1)
Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease response to methotrexate (7.1)

Effects of other drugs on INFUVITE PEDIATRIC:

Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements (7.2).
Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations (7.2)

7.1 Drug Interactions Affecting Co-administered Drugs

Warfarin: Vitamin K, a component of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood levels of prothrombin/INR should be monitored to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.
Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro, thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced.
Levodopa: Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood levels of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy.
Phenytoin: Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity.
Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate therapy.

7.2 Drug Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels

Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements.
Phenytoin: Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations.

### Isoniazid [^115dDk2B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Food

Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid. Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur. Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).

Acetaminophen

A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patient's liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats1,2.

Carbamazepine

Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3.

Ketoconazole

Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88 percent after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy4.

Phenytoin

Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6.

Theophylline

A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7.

Valproate

A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5.

Clinical context — when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an antiepileptic drug (AED) should be initiated because the risk of additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases, whereas immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.

### It is not necessary to discontinue seizure threshold-lowering medications prior to myelography [^114oaXMb]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

There is no consensus on whether patients undergoing myelography should discontinue medications that could lower their seizure threshold. The purpose of this study was to document the most commonly prescribed seizure threshold-lowering medications in patients undergoing myelography and determine whether withholding such medications decreases the incidence of seizures.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study of all the myelograms obtained in 2016 at 2 affiliated hospitals. At hospital A, seizure threshold-lowering medications are discontinued before myelography, and prophylactic diazepam is given for all cervical myelograms. At hospital B, seizure threshold-lowering medications are not withheld before the procedure, and medical seizure prophylaxis is not implemented. The seizure threshold-lowering medications the patients were taking at the time of the procedure and postmyelographic seizure incidence were documented.

Results

A total of 311 patients underwent myelography during 2016. One hundred eleven patients (36%) were on at least 1 seizure threshold-lowering medication, and 30 (10%) were on at least 2. The most common medications were duloxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, and trazodone. The most common tricyclic antidepressant was amitriptyline. Three patients across both sites had a controlled seizure disorder and were on antiepileptics. None of the patients at either hospital had seizures during or within 3 hours following any of the myelograms during the study period.

Conclusions

Continuing seizure threshold-lowering medications during myelography does not increase the risk of seizures. Screening for and withholding seizure threshold-lowering medications are not indicated for routine myelography.

### Drug concentration thresholds predictive of therapy failure and death in children with tuberculosis: bread crumb trails in random forests [^117GgBwG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Concentration Thresholds Associated With Poor Outcome

Next we used boosted CART models that included only ranked variables from Table 4 to identify drug concentration thresholds predictive of poor outcomes including failure of therapy. Figure 3 shows that when all 143 children were included, pyrazinamide peak < 38.10 mg/L was identified as the main predictor for the composite poor outcome, followed by rifampin AUC 0–24 in those with pyrazinamide peak ≥ 38.10 mg/L and rifampin peak in those below the pyrazinamide threshold. The relative risk of poor outcomes below these peak concentration thresholds was 3.64 (95% CI, 2.28–5.83). Figure 3 shows that there was significant concentration-dependent antagonism driven by isoniazid. In children with pyrazinamide peak ≤ 38.10 and rifampin peak ≤ 6.20 mg/L, isoniazid AUC 0–24 > 31.80 mg/L × h led to significantly higher proportions of children with poor outcomes (6/6 [100%] vs 19/57 [33%] with isoniazid < 31.80 mg/L), which is a risk ratio for failure of 3.00 (95% CI, 2.08–4.33).

Figure 3.
Classification and regression tree (CART)–derived predictors of combined poor outcomes in all 143 children. CART tree from the optimal model for all children with combined poor outcomes (failure of therapy or death). Terminal nodes are shaped as sharp-edged rectangles; intermediate daughter nodes have rounded edges. Nodes shaded in light gray indicate antagonism where higher drug concentration led to higher proportions with poorer outcomes than lower drug concentrations. Abbreviations: AUC, area under the concentration-time curve; INH, isoniazid; PZA, pyrazinamide; RIF, rifampin.

Figure 4 shows results for the 134 children remaining after excluding 9 children who died (ie, therapy failure alone). The primary node was still pyrazinamide peak < 38.10 mg/L. However, the daughter node threshold of rifampin peak was 3.01 mg/L. The isoniazid concentration–dependent antagonism was still evident among those with lower pyrazinamide peaks, this time at isoniazid peak concentration > 4.77 mg/L.

### Preclinical testing strategies for epilepsy therapy development [^112CujWi]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute (Provoked) Seizure Models Versus Epilepsy Models

It is widely accepted that a variety of pathological conditions and toxic exposures can produce seizures in almost all healthy mammals and many nonmammalian species. Seizures, therefore, are a common "fail state" of nervous systems. Indeed, this vulnerability has been a mainstay of ASM development, as current preclinical drug testing relies on the large selection of acute seizure models in rodents. Acutely evoked seizures generated by normal brains, however, are mechanistically different from spontaneous seizures generated by epileptic brains. While the success of ASMs at controlling seizures in many patients with epilepsy indicates the presence of some common underlying mechanisms, the failure of these drugs to show AEG effects in clinical trials – highlights the limitations of acute seizure models. The development of AEG and DMTs for epilepsy, therefore, requires testing in animal models of epilepsy.

Perioperative seizures and electrocorticography — identification and acute management. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) monitoring can help in identification of epileptogenic foci, and in patients with a history of epilepsy it is recommended that antiepileptic medications be administered in the perioperative setting. Anesthetic drugs that lower the seizure threshold should be avoided, and rapidly irrigating the surgical field with cold saline is also a helpful measure to halt acute intraoperative seizures. The treatment of seizures also plays an important role in lowering ICP.

### Promethazine (promethazine hydrochloride) [^111qAtzn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

CNS Depression

Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central-nervous-system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore such agents should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine HCl (see PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients and Drug Interactions).

Respiratory Depression

Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression.

Use of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea) should be avoided.

Lower Seizure Threshold

Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold.

Bone-Marrow Depression

Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with bone-marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when Promethazine HCl Oral Solution has been used in association with other known marrow-toxic agents.

### Management of HIV-associated tuberculosis in resource-limited settings: a state-of-the-art review [^111Ai3L2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and ART are recommended for all patients with HIV-associated MDR-TB regardless of CD4 count and the timing of ART initiation is similar as for drug-susceptible TB. Many of the second-line MDR-TB drugs are poorly tolerated and drug discontinuation rates are high as a result of adverse effects. MDR-TB may be a risk factor for TB IRIS in view of slow mycobacterial antigen clearance. Nutritional depletion and co-morbid conditions may further undermine outcomes.

Adverse events are frequent in HIV-infected patients receiving MDR treatment, the most common being gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hypothyroidism, deafness, psychiatric symptoms and hypokalemia. In up to 40% of patients these adverse events are severe. This relates to the inherent toxicity associated with MDR drugs; it does not appear that HIV-infected patients experience a higher incidence of adverse events than HIV-uninfected patients, nor that coadministration with ART increases toxicity.

Antiretroviral drugs do share common toxicities with second-line antituberculosis drugs, however (Table 7). Some of the most challenging of these are neuropsychiatric side effects. EFV causes inattention, vivid dreams and dizziness in up to 50% of patients, but in a minority these can be severe with mood disturbance or psychosis. Cycloserine (or terizidone) is a well recognized cause of psychosis, seizures and other CNS side effects although several other drugs such as the quinolones, ethionamide and high dose isoniazid can also cause CNS side effects. If patients develop severe CNS side effects it may be necessary to withdraw all possible culprit drugs with careful sequential reintroduction once resolved. Cycloserine should probably be regarded as the most likely culprit for psychosis and seizures. Antipsychotic or antidepressant medications may be required. EFV should not be routinely avoided because the majority of MDR-TB patients tolerate it well.

### Step climb dosing guidance from simulation studies on lamotrigine concentration changes during pregnancy [^1169muKN]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study by Barry et aladds to previous simulation reported by Pa et al, which evaluated a single scenario of LTG dose increase regimen (25, 50, and 25 mg per dose for each subsequent trimester) from a preconception dose of 150 mg twice daily (thus, 175 mg, 225 mg, and 250 mg twice daily) and assuming equal clearance rate changes for all simulated pregnancies, as sufficient dose increments to maintain the target LTG serum concentrations. Barry and colleagues simulate, at individual and population levels, various LTG dose adjustment regimens (no-change, double-dose, 25 mg every 2 weeks, 25 mg every 4 weeks, 50 mg every 4 weeks, 100 mg every 4 weeks) to LTG-exposed pregnancies from the 2 known subpopulations of clearance (high and low change) starting from different preconception daily doses (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg). Threshold for efficacy risk was set at 65% lower than preconception LTG serum concentrations and threshold for toxicity was set as twice the preconception concentrations.

All 24 dose adjustment scenarios predicted lower than 65% preconception concentration (and risk of seizures) at 3 to 26 weeks' gestation in the high change group, whereas this was observed only in the no-change regimen in the low change group, late in the pregnancy. With LTG dose unchanged in the high clearance change group, 65% lower than preconception LTG levels are expected as early as 6 to 8 weeks, with risk of seizures of 7% to 100% depending on preconception dose. For this subpopulation, the regimen of 100 mg increase every 4 weeks showed the least risk of loss of efficacy. For the low clearance change group, whereas the no-change regimen was considered the best regimen to avoid toxicity, this same regimen predicted a concentration below 65% by 33 weeks of pregnancy, thus potentially increasing risk of loss of efficacy in the third trimester.

### Antiepileptic drug treatment after an unprovoked first seizure: a decision analysis [^112RUzVz]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in adult patients undergoing immediate vs deferred antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment after a first unprovoked seizure.

Methods

We constructed a simulated clinical trial (Markov decision model) to compare immediate vs deferred AED treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in adults. Three base cases were considered, representing patients with varying degrees of seizure recurrence risk and effect of seizures on quality of life (QOL). Cohort simulation was performed to determine which treatment strategy would maximize the patient's expected QALYs. Sensitivity analyses were guided by clinical data to define decision thresholds across plausible measurement ranges, including seizure recurrence rate, effect of seizure recurrence on QOL, and efficacy of AEDs.

Results

For patients with a moderate risk of recurrent seizures (52.0% over 10 years after first seizure), immediate AED treatment maximized QALYs compared to deferred treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that for the preferred choice to change to deferred AED treatment, key clinical measures needed to reach implausible values were 10-year seizure recurrence rate ≤ 38.0%, QOL reduction with recurrent seizures ≤ 0.06, and efficacy of AEDs on lowering seizure recurrence rate ≤ 16.3%.

Conclusion

Our model determined that immediate AED treatment is preferable to deferred treatment in adult first-seizure patients over a wide and clinically relevant range of variables. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the 10-year seizure recurrence rate that justifies AED treatment (38.0%) is substantially lower than the 60% threshold used in the current definition of epilepsy.

### Neurological pictures. trigeminalepsy [^114MVaJQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Comment

Reflex epilepsies, characterised by seizures that are provoked by specific stimuli, are rare conditions that may be underdiagnosed and, thus, may mislead to other diagnoses. Indeed, our patient had been suffering from sensorial seizures which mimicked trigeminal neuralgia for 20 years.

Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are widely used to treat neuropathic pain; nevertheless, tricyclic antidepressants may lower seizure threshold, which initially impaired our patient's quality of life. Conversely, benzodiazepines characteristically raise seizure threshold, thus reducing seizure frequency. Otherwise, alcohol withdrawal syndrome lowers seizure threshold and increases pain sensitivity, which led to abuse from alcohol and benzodiazepine consumption to relieve her seizures.

To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in English-language literature that considers epilepsy as a differential diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. Despite controversies on the term migralepsy, we have entitled our case as trigeminalepsy to claim that refractory trigeminal pain, or any rebel idiopathic neuralgia localised elsewhere, may be electable for a simple EEG to rule out atypical epilepsy.

Bupropion may lower the seizure threshold, so naltrexone-bupropion ER should be avoided in epilepsy and used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or other risk factors.

Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drug–antiretroviral interactions — clinical risks — Potential interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are complex and extensive, with greatest concern for P450 system enzyme induction by older-generation AEDs (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) which might be expected to lower the effective dose of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). AED–ARV interactions that raise drug levels may increase toxicity risk, ARVs that reduce AED levels could lead to loss of therapeutic AED effects including seizure control, and AEDs that decrease ARV levels may result in virologic failure with immunologic decline, clinical disease progression, and development of ARV resistance. In low- and middle-income countries where first-line AED availability is limited to phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phenytoin and ARV options may also be limited, there is substantial risk for clinically important drug interactions.

5.4 Central Nervous System Effects

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, psychotic reactions progressing to suicidal ideations/thoughts, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. As with all fluoroquinolones, use ciprofloxacin with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If seizures occur, discontinue ciprofloxacin, and institute appropriate care [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis.

Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, psychotic reactions progressing to suicidal ideations/thoughts, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving CIPRO to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care.

Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (pscudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. CIPRO, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. As with all fluoroquinolones, use CIPRO with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If seizures occur, discontinue CIPRO and institute appropriate care [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5	Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid CIPRO in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Association of cognitive enhancers and incident seizure risk in dementia: a population-based study [^114NH371]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dementia is a broad-spectrum disease characterized by neurological abnormalities and disturbances in various behaviors and psychological functions. Comorbidity between dementia and seizure is more common than expected, and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a two- to six-fold increased risk of developing seizure and epilepsy compared with healthy individuals. Although seizures were previously known to occur primarily in the late stages of dementia, they have also been observed in the prodromal or early stages. Growing evidence suggests that the neuronal hyperexcitability that occurs in seizures may contribute to neuropathological burden and that prolonged or recurring seizures may cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment.

The WHO Adverse Drug Reaction database has reported that cholinesterase inhibitors, often prescribed to patients with AD and related dementias, may lower the seizure threshold and provoke seizures. However, the findings have been inconsistent. In a small, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial, donepezil was not associated with increased seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy and memory complaints, whereas another open-label study demonstrated a tendency for increased seizure in individuals taking donepezil. Memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-Daspartate receptor antagonist, has also demonstrated to have both pro- and anticonvulsant effects in animal models, but previous human studies have shown that memantine has a relatively lower seizure risk than donepezil. In particular, a clinical study showed that administration of memantine to patients with seizures not only improved cognition but also reduced the frequency of seizures.

Surprisingly few systematic studies have addressed seizure risk in the older individuals taking cholinesterase inhibitors. Previous studies examining whether cholinesterase inhibitors induce seizures have failed to consider confounding medications and had limited sample sizes. The association between seizures and cholinesterase inhibitor use remains unclear. Although monoclonal antibodies direct against amyloid for the treatment of AD have been recently introduced, their effectiveness and safety have not been sufficiently verified, and it is estimated that the conventional cognitive enhancers such as cholinesterase inhibitors will be widely used as they are now. Therefore, studies on the safety of cognitive enhancers in patients with dementia have sufficient clinical significance. In this study, we investigated whether the use of cholinesterase inhibitors lead to increased risk of seizure compared to memantine and examined the effects of drug types and treatment duration on seizure threshold, adjusting for comorbidity and concomitant exposure to other drugs in a large, population-based cohort in South Korea.

Cyclosporine A (CSA) other toxicities and laboratory monitoring: The most common cutaneous side effect of CSA is hypertrichosis, occurring in about 6% of patients, and headache occurs in 15% of patients treated with CSA, paresthesia in 7%, and musculoskeletal pain in 5%. Rare incidences of pseudotumor cerebri in young patients taking concomitant tetracyclines for acne have been noted, and other neurologic side effects include tremor, asthenia, and fatigue; psychiatric side effects have also been reported. Patients with a history of seizures should be made aware that CSA can lower the seizure threshold. Pulmonary and respiratory symptoms including cough, rhinitis, and dyspnea occur in about 5% of patients, and gastrointestinal side effects include abdominal pain, which may resolve after a few days, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. As hypomagnesemia and hyperuricemia may occur, magnesium and uric acid levels should be monitored at regular intervals.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^112rtL4p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse events

All five included studies reported serious adverse events (SAEs) that were fatal or life‐threatening, or required hospitalization or a change in treatment regimen. Gillespie 2014 reported that a total of 349 SAEs occurred in 173 participants, with 246 events occurring during the treatment period and 103 during follow‐up. Serious adverse events occurred in 62 of 655 (9%) in the isoniazid group and in 52 of 636 (8%) in the ethambutol group, compared with 59 of 639 (9%) in the control group. The incidence of adverse events, including seizures, clinically significant cardiac toxicity, hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia, and peripheral neuropathy, did not significantly differ. Jawahar 2013 noted only two SAEs ‐ a case of jaundice in a person on the six‐month regimen and QTc prolongation in a person on the moxifloxacin‐ATT regimen. Jindani 2014 reported 12 SAEs among 11 participants on the four‐month ATT regimen, four of which were considered possibly or probably related to study medicines. In the control arm, 16 events were reported among 12 participants, with six possibly or probably related to treatment. Velayutham 2014 reported QTc prolongation in five participants in the moxifloxacin group and in one on standard ATT, but all cases were reversible. Other SAEs included hepatitis (12 in the moxifloxacin arm and 2 in the control arm) and seizures (four in the moxifloxacin arm and two in the control arm).

The meta‐analysis did not show significant differences between treatment regimens in the incidence of SAEs among 3548 participants in the four trials (Analysis 1.9).

Introductions: HAGMA is a commonly encountered acid-base disorder in clinic practice. Multiple mnemonics were proposed to cover the common underlying causes – "GOLDMARK(1)", "KUSMALE", "KARMEL" and, of course, "MUDPILES". The "I" in "MUDPILES" represents some rare causes of HAGMA including "I"ron, "I"soniazid and "I"nborn errors of metabolism. We present a rare case of HAGMA secondary to isoniazid (INH) overdose.

Methods: A 41 year old male was intubated for status epilepticus. He had a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis (pTB) and had been treated with a course of rifampicin, INH and ethambutol since 6 months ago.

Results: Arterial blood gas in the Emergency Department showed severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis; pH 6.76, pCO2 80, pO2 62, HCO3 11, BE -24. The initial anion gap was 26. Physical examination was unremarkable except for fever and hypotension. Neurological examination did not reveal any lateralising signs. CT scan of the brain was normal. Mild renal impairment, and lactate acidosis resolved rapidly with initial fluid resuscitation. Serum and urine toxicology for commonly encountered drugs were also negative. Patient regained orientation on day 3 of intubation and was promptly extubated. Further history revealed that he had consumed a bottle of isoniazid tablets after an altercation with his wife the same night.

Conclusions: Tuberculosis is endemic is South East Asia. INH is one of the four drugs used in the treatment of this disease. Side effects of isoniazid range from mild hepatotoxicity to the potentially fatal INH hepatitis. HAGMA refractory to conventional therapy is one of the hallmarks of INH toxicity. Though it is one of the rare causes of HAGMA, prompt diagnosis and treatment with high dose pyridoxine (2) reduces mortality and morbidity.

Seizure management during vasodilator stress — Serious adverse effects can be effectively aborted with IV administration of aminophylline, with the exception of seizures, and IV lorazepam should be the first-line intervention for seizures; methylxanthine use is not recommended for reversal of adenosine or regadenoson effects under these circumstances because of concern for possible lowering of the seizure threshold and potential risk of exacerbating seizures, based on limited evidence and the preponderance of expert opinion.

### Kcnq2 / kv7.2 controls the threshold and bi-hemispheric symmetry of cortical spreading depolarization [^112uru6t]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Kcnq2/K v 7.2 regulates seizure/spreading depolarization transition

Seizures in Kcnq2 mice reliably triggered spreading depolarization expression 97% (34/35 events) of the time, and at very short latency, sometimes even commencing during the seizure. This is in sharp contrast to K v 1.1-KO mice, in which only 5% (9/175) of seizures were associated with spreading depolarization, with a significantly longer postictal latency. The severity of the seizure itself is unlikely to explain these differences, as seizure duration was longer in K v 1.1-KO mice and should create an even larger extracellular potassium surge and tissue hypoxia. Instead, the conversion of uncoupled seizure/spreading depolarization to a tightly coupled Kcnq2-cKO-like spreading depolarization phenotype by acute pharmacological inhibition (Fig. 3) indicates the presence of a functional Kcnq2/K v 7.2 activity-dependent threshold mechanism. While the threshold is multifactorial and state-dependent, our study suggests that reducing K v 7.2 current lowers the threshold for seizure to spreading depolarization transition. In addition to the spreading depolarization threshold, changes in tissue metabolism, astrocytic extracellular homeostasis, and synaptic network functions during chronic epileptic conditions may also modulate the spreading depolarization phenotype.

Although they were rare, the presence of seizure-independent isolated spontaneous spreading depolarization events in awake K v 1.1 KO mice has not been previously reported (Fig. 2C). The triggering mechanism of these isolated events is not known, but may reflect focal changes in cortical hyperexcitationor vascular insufficiency, since cerebral autoregulation may be impaired in some forms of epilepsy.

### Clobazam monotherapy for focal or generalized seizures [^112Xt7oz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 10, 2014. There is a need to expand monotherapy options available to a clinician for the treatment of new focal or generalized seizures. A Cochrane systematic review for clobazam monotherapy is expected to define its place in the treatment of new-onset or untreated seizures and highlight gaps in evidence.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, tolerability and safety of clobazam as monotherapy in people with new-onset focal or generalized seizures.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 19 March 2018: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946-), BIOSIS Previews (1969-), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing clobazam monotherapy versus placebo or other anti-seizure medication in people with two or more unprovoked seizures or single acute symptomatic seizure requiring short-term continuous anti-seizure medication, were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcome measure was time on allocated treatment (retention time), reflecting both efficacy and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included short- and long-term effectiveness measures, tolerability, quality of life, and tolerance measures. Two authors independently extracted the data.

Main Results

We identified three trials fulfilling the review criteria, which included 206 participants. None of the identified studies reported the preselected primary outcome measure. A meta-analysis was not possible. Lack of detail regarding allocation concealment and a high risk of performance and detection bias in two studies prompted us to downgrade the quality of evidence (by using the GRADE approach) for some of our results due to risk of bias. Regarding retention at 12 months, we detected no evidence of a statistically significant difference between clobazam and carbamazepine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.12; low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence that clobazam led to better retention compared with phenytoin (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.90). We could not determine whether participants receiving clobazam were found to be less likely to discontinue it due to adverse effects as compared to phenytoin (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.65, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no advantage for clobazam over carbamazepine for retention at 12 months in drug-naive children and a slight advantage of clobazam over phenytoin for retention at six months in adolescents and adults with neurocysticercosis in a single clinical trial each. At present, the available evidence is insufficient to inform clinical practice.

### Felbamate [^112dsHL9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants. Felbamate is effective in mice and rats in the maximal electroshock test, the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol seizure test, and the subcutaneous picrotoxin seizure test. Felbamate also exhibits anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by intracerebroventricular administration of glutamate in rats and N-methyl-D, L-aspartic acid in mice. Protection against maximal electroshock-induced seizures suggests that felbamate may reduce seizure spread, an effect possibly predictive of efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic or partial seizures. Protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures suggests that felbamate may increase seizure threshold, an effect considered to be predictive of potential efficacy in absence seizures.

Receptor-binding studies in vitro indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However, felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. Felbamate is not effective in protecting chick embryo retina tissue against the neurotoxic effects of the excitatory amino acid agonists NMDA, kainate, or quisqualate in vitro.

The monocarbamate, p-hydroxy, and 2-hydroxy metabolites were inactive in the maximal electroshock-induced seizure test in mice. The monocarbamate and p-hydroxy metabolites had only weak (0.2 to 0.6) activity compared with felbamate in the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol seizure test. These metabolites did not contribute significantly to the anticonvulsant action of felbamate.

### Clinical and experimental insight into pathophysiology, comorbidity and therapy of absence seizures [^116Pmg5k]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of the hypothesis linking natural sleep spindles (a spontaneous transient oscillation) and SWD of absence seizure (but see), currently proposed mechanisms of sleep spindle termination might apply to SWD, though spindles are driven by a thalamic pacemaker with critical cortical modulation whereas absence seizures require the contribution of many different neuronal populations in cortico-thalamo-cortical and basal ganglia networks. Thus, increased intracellular Ca 2+ leading to thalamocortical neuron depolarization, desynchronization of the cortical output to the thalamus and progressive hyperpolarization of NRT neurons coupled with a marked drop in their firing just a few cycles before spindle termination, that have been suggested as potential mechanisms for spindle termination, might also be involved in controlling the duration of SWD. Notably, the latter mechanism has been shown to be predetermined by the state of the network at the start of the spindle oscillation in normal (i.e. non-epileptic) rats.

Finally, the slowing of the rhythmic activity in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons towards the end of partial (focal) seizures has been suggested to involve a progressive increase in synchrony among participating neurons and to play a role in seizure termination. As a slowing of the SWD frequency is observed within many absence seizure (Fig. 1A) it could be that an increased synchronization of cortical excitatory and inhibitory networks in the CIN may also be critical for absence seizure termination.

Mechanism of absence seizure pharmaco-resistance

If we want to prevent the adverse effects of polytherapy, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying pharmaco-resistant absence seizures. As these seizures are genetically determined, a key goal would be to increase efforts in investigating differences in genetic abnormalities between responders and non-responders to currently available anti-absence medications in large cohorts. For experimental research, the priority would be to develop animal models that are insensitive to ethosuximide and valproate. Such a development may be guided by the findings in humans that (i) a more negative treatment outcome, independently of the initial treatment (with either ethosuximide, valproic acid or lamotrigine), occurs for absence seizure without face/limb motor automatisms; (ii) ethosuximide responders have decreased parietal cortex connectivity for ictal low frequency EEG components whereas non-responders have increased frontal cortex connectivity for high frequencies; and (iii) a CACNA1H polymorphism (P640L) is more commonly expressed in children non-responding to ethosuximide monotherapy.

Other AEDs and antiepileptogenesis — trial priorities: Animal models inform selection for late seizure prophylaxis, and "phenytoin and carbamazepine, the drugs used in four out of the five late seizure studies classified as class I or class II, do not appear to be antiepileptogenic in animal models and may actually exhibit some proepileptogenic properties". Trials of phenobarbital and valproate "showed a trend toward a higher rate of late seizures", with wide CIs, therefore "other AEDs with demonstrated antiepileptogenic properties and mechanisms of action should be tested in randomized controlled trials of post-traumatic seizure prophylaxis".

Antiepileptic Drug Treatment After an Unprovoked First Seizure: A Decision Analysis Bao EL, Chao LY, Ni P, et al. Neurology. 2018;91(15):e1429-e1439. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000006319 Objective: To compare the expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in adult patients undergoing immediate versus deferred antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment after a first unprovoked seizure.

Methods

We constructed a simulated clinical trial (Markov decision model) to compare immediate versus deferred AED treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in adults. Three base cases were considered, representing patients with varying degrees of seizure recurrence risk and effect of seizures on quality of life (QOL). Cohort simulation was performed to determine which treatment strategy would maximize the patient's expected QALYs. Sensitivity analyses were guided by clinical data to define decision thresholds across plausible measurement ranges, including seizure recurrence rate, effect of seizure recurrence on QOL, and efficacy of AEDs.

Results

For patients with a moderate risk of recurrent seizures (52.0% over 10 years after first seizure), immediate AED treatment maximized QALYs compared to deferred treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that for the preferred choice to change to deferred AED treatment, key clinical measures needed to reach implausible values were 10-year seizure recurrence rate ≤ 38.0%, QOL reduction with recurrent seizures ≤ 0.06, and efficacy of AEDs on lowering seizure recurrence rate ≤ 16.3%.

Conclusion

Our model determined that immediate AED treatment is preferable to deferred treatment in adult first-seizure patients over a wide and clinically relevant range of variables. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the 10-year seizure recurrence rate that justifies AED treatment (38.0%) is substantially lower than the 60% threshold used in the current definition of epilepsy.

### Extracorporeal treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^116Xi9gz]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical indications

Coma i. In patients presenting with coma due to EG poisoning, we recommend ECTR (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
Seizures i. In patients presenting with EG poisoning and seizures, we recommend ECTR (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)
Kidney Impairment i. In patients presenting with EG poisoning and CKD (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m. 2), we suggest ECTR (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) ii. In patients presenting with EG poisoning and AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3), we recommend ECTR (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)

Rationale: AKI is correlated with mortality and kidney impairment reduces endogenous elimination of EG, which is pertinent once antidotal therapy is started, as elimination of EG and metabolites are dependent on functional kidneys. The presence of kidney impairment lowers the EG concentration thresholds for initiating ECTR. Coma and seizures are associated with a poor prognosis and become a clinical justification for ECTR. Mild inebriation may be due to EG early after ingestion and is not an indication for ECTR.

Other clinical manifestations are not recommendations for ECTR; respiratory failure and pulmonary edema would occur after already stated indications for ECTR. Cranial nerve defects may occur long after exposure despite repeated ECTR.

Special populations

The workgroup proposed that these recommendations remain applicable for other populations. A lower EG threshold concentration for ECTR may be applicable in children being treated with ethanol, to minimize adverse effects of ethanol. In pregnancy, ethanol is potentially teratogenic and fomepizole is classed Category C. Although fomepizole was used without complication in the second and third trimesters, there may be a preference for lower ECTR threshold to reduce the exposure to these antidotes in the pregnant patient, although ECTR also carries risks in this population. These considerations were discussed with a patient representative who endorsed the recommendations.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver.

Nervous System Reactions

Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics) and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in "slow inactivators".

Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment and toxic psychosis.

Cerebellar syndrome, which may include abnormal motor coordination manifesting as gait, trunk, and limb ataxia, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysarthria, or nystagmus, have been reported in post marketing case reports (see WARNINGS).

Hepatic Reactions

See boxed warning. Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT; SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symptoms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progressive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age.

Gastrointestinal Reactions

Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and pancreatitis.

Hematologic Reactions

Agranulocytosis; hemolytic, sideroblastic or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia; and eosinophilia.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, vasculitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia syndrome (DRESS) (see WARNINGS).

### Dextromethorphan hydrobromide and promethazine hydrochloride [^112sMqzw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING

PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FATAL RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION.

POSTMARKETING CASES OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, INCLUDING FATALITIES, HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH USE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE. A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHT-BASED DOSES OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE HAVE RESULTED IN RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN THESE PATIENTS.

CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ADMINISTERING PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER AND CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER DRUGS WITH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSANT EFFECTS BE AVOIDED.

Dextromethorphan

Administration of dextromethorphan may be accompanied by histamine release and should be used with caution in atopic children.

CNS Depression

Promethazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central-nervous-system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore such agents should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine HCl (see and). PRECAUTIONS-Information for Patients Drug Interactions

Respiratory Depression

Promethazine may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression.

Use of Promethazine in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea) should be avoided.

Lower Seizure Threshold

Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold.

Bone-Marrow Depression

Promethazine should be used with caution in patients with bone-marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when promethazine HCl has been used in association with other known marrow-toxic agents.

### Epilepsy benchmarks area III: improved treatment options for controlling seizures and epilepsy-related conditions without side effects [^114KiavH]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus remains a clinical challenge, with a subset of patients proving refractory to multiple treatmentsdespite the development and approval of new antiseizure medications (ASMs). The persistent seizures associated with this condition focus attention on how little we understand about the processes of seizure initiation, maintenance, and termination. Thus, insight into mechanisms that maintain hypersynchronous firing for prolonged durations in the face of adaptive changes, exhaustion of energy stores, and mounting inflammatory cascades may allow improved treatments that can stop ongoing seizures and status epilepticus. Although a variety of processes are considered relevant to status epilepticus, - we still lack a clear assessment of the relative contributions of each one. New mechanism-based targets would improve our ability to effectively terminate status epilepticus.

An impressive amount of electrophysiological analysis of mechanisms that can lead to hypersynchronous firing has been performed either in vivo in adult animals or ex vivo in brain slices from rodents that range in age from adolescence to young adulthood. There is a growing opportunity to complement animal tissue work with acute and organotypic human brain slices obtained following surgical resection, as well as in vivo recordings from depth electrode–implanted patients. However, there is a stark lack of information in some areas, for example, related to features of the neonatal brain that contribute to hypersynchronous activity, apart from changes in chloride (Cl −) gradients that render GABAergic transmission excitatory. Early-life seizures are an important therapeutic target because many epileptic encephalopathies become apparent early in life. In particular, understanding the mechanisms underlying hypersynchronous firing in neonatal brain could lead to the development of therapies that are more effective for neonatal seizures as opposed to simply modifying the dosing of drugs that showed a positive signal in clinical trials in adults with epilepsy. Strategies could involve use of repurposed drugs, specific combinations of therapies, or the development of new therapies, noting, however, the substantial hurdles for bringing to market drugs for a pediatric population. Although the first uncontrolled trial of the repurposed drug bumetanide did not show efficacy, this finding was controversial, and the results of a subsequent blinded controlled trial of bumetanide is reported to be more promising. To this end, new genetic models of ultrarare variants in genes capable of producing seizures and hyperexcitability may provide new models of mechanisms underlying development of an epileptic focus in neonatal animals. Indeed, multiple animal models of genetic epilepsies show seizure activity at an early age, providing an opportunity to study epilepsy in the developing brain.

### Practice parameter: antiepileptic drug prophylaxis in severe traumatic brain injury: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^114sYT8v]. Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Definition and timing of early seizures — arbitrariness of the 7-day cutoff and research needs: "The distinction between early and late post-traumatic seizures at 7 days after injury is widely used but arbitrary", and "early seizures do not appear to be an independent predictive factor for the occurrence of late seizures". Because "the highest rate of late seizures is present within the first few weeks after injury, and some have classified early seizures as those occurring within 1 month if the acute injury is complicated by a protracted illness", additional data are needed, as "data on posttraumatic seizure timing are needed to allow for identification of the point after which the occurrence of a seizure does predict future seizures", so "studies of AED prophylaxis for early seizures could then evaluate a longer duration of prophylaxis, if appropriate".

### Promethazine hydrochloride and dextromethorphan hydrobromide oral solution [^116YMpu7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING:

PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FATAL RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION.

POSTMARKETING CASES OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, INCLUDING FATALITIES, HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH USE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE. A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHT-BASED DOSES OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE HAVE RESULTED IN RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN THESE PATIENTS.

CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ADMINISTERING PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER AND CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER DRUGS WITH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSANT EFFECTS BE AVOIDED.

Dextromethorphan:

Administration of dextromethorphan may be accompanied by histamine release and should be used with caution in atopic children.

Promethazine:

CNS Depression: Promethazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine HCl (see PRECAUTIONS - and).

Respiratory Depression: Promethazine may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression.

Use of promethazine in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea) should be avoided.

Lower Seizure Threshold: Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold.

Bone Marrow Depression: Promethazine should be used with caution in patients with bone marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when promethazine HCl has been used in association with other known marrow toxic agents.

### Isoniazid overdose: recognition and management… [^116BsW6G]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Most physicians are aware of the use of liver function tests to detect hepatotoxicity in patients with tuberculosis who are being treated with isoniazid. However, physicians may not be aware that the acute ingestion of as little as 1. 5 g of this drug can be toxic. In doses of 30 mg per kg or more, isoniazid often produces seizures. If large quantities of the drug are taken intentionally or accidentally, recurrent seizures, profound metabolic acidosis, coma and even death can occur.

1. Pyridoxine is a necessary cofactor for production of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Pyridoxine must be activated to produce GABA. Isoniazid combines with pyridoxine and renders the pyridoxine inactive, resulting in a depletion of GABA in the brain. This reduction in GABA levels increases the susceptibility to seizures. Thus, the neurotoxic effects of isoniazid are specifically counteracted by the administration of pyridoxine.
6.

Management of Isoniazid Toxicity Control of Life-Threatening Events A secure airway should be established and maintained if the patient is having seizures, is comatose or is unresponsive. Intravenous access should be obtained, and fluids should be administered. Diazepam, 5 to 10 mg administered intravenously, is the initial approach to seizure control, with the dose repeated as necessary. Diazepam has been found to be more effective in controlling isoniazid-induced seizures than anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or barbiturates. 7 The acidosis associated with isoniazid toxicity appears to be lactic acidosis secondary to the seizure activity. Therefore, as the seizures are controlled, the acidosis usually decreases in severity. Since sodium bicarbonate may assist in correcting severe cases of acidosis, its administration should be considered if the pH is less than 7.

1.

A good starting dose is 1 to 3 mEq per kg, with frequent monitoring of blood gases to guide further bicarbonate administration.

### Evaluation… [^113NQ5Le]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute Management Prehospital and emergent management should focus on stabilizing the patient. Most febrile seizures are self-limited and end before patients arrive at the hospital. However, seizures lasting longer than five minutes are unlikely to stop on their own, and a benzodiazepine should be administered to break the seizure. 19 A 2018 Cochrane review concluded that intravenous lorazepam and diazepam have similar rates of seizure cessation and respiratory depression. When intravenous access is unavailable, buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam is acceptable. The Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intranasal benzodiazepines.
33. Prevention Multiple pharmacologic interventions have been studied to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures. However, potential benefits must be weighed against potential risks.

A Cochrane review showed that intermittent diazepam significantly reduced recurrent febrile seizures for up to 48 months compared with placebo or no treatment. Continuous phenobarbital reduced recurrent febrile seizures compared with placebo at 6, 12, and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 months. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are postulated to decrease the risk of febrile seizure by attenuating the effect of the fever as a trigger for the seizure. A Cochrane review found no benefit of antipyretics for decreasing the risk of febrile seizures. 42 However, a recent Japanese unblinded randomized trial of 423 children with febrile seizure found that rectal acetaminophen given every six hours for 24 hours significantly reduced the likelihood of short-term recurrence compared with no antipyretics.
43.

It has been suspected that zinc plays a role in febrile seizures because blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of zinc are significantly lower in children who have had a febrile seizure compared with an afebrile seizure. However, the Cochrane review found no benefit of continuous zinc sulfate supplementation for preventing febrile seizures. 42 Anticipatory Guidance Anticipatory guidance for parents should focus on reassurance, emphasizing the benign nature of febrile seizures and the overall excellent prognosis, even if the seizures recur.

### Lithium carbonate and convulsive disorders… [^1111aHC7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The safety of lithium carbonate, now in widespread use for treatment of manic-depressive disorders, has been questioned because of reports that it lowers the seizure threshold in patients prone to convulsive disorders. Seventeen state hospital patients were studied. Fifteen were severe epileptics, poorly controlled clinically with standard anticonvulsants and one had been well controlled; one patient had an abnormal electroencephalogram with no clinical history of seizure activity. All were administered lithium carbonate for a six-week period. EEGs were obtained prior to the study and twice weekly during the study. Serum lithium ion levels were determined prior to each EEG during the study period and maintained between 0. 6 and

1. 25 mEq/liter. There was only one instance of increased clinical seizure activity, while ten of the 16 seizure patients showed a clear reduction of seizure frequency. EEG changes paralleled clinical findings with one exception.

Status epilepticus was not encountered and only one patient had more seizures during the lithium carbonate treatment period than during the baseline period. Erwin CW, Gerber CJ, Morrison SD, James JF. Lithium Carbonate and Convulsive Disorders. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1973; 28: 646–648.
