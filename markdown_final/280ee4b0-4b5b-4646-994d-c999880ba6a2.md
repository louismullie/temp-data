## Question

what is the mechanism of more incidence of worse diastolic heart failure in COPD patients in regards to thoracic changes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how thoracic changes in COPD increase the incidence and worsen the severity of diastolic heart failure (HFpEF phenotype). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about static and dynamic lung hyperinflation and thoracic cage remodeling and how they alter intrathoracic/pleural pressures and cardiopulmonary interactions. Then, I should verify evidence for mechanical cardiac compression and small-chamber phenotypes in COPD. Next, I will review pulmonary venous return, LV preload, and diastolic filling indices. After that, I need to consider pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular remodeling, and ventricular interdependence as links to LV diastolic dysfunction. I should also examine exacerbation-related dynamic hyperinflation, cachexia-related cardiac atrophy, and their clinical consequences. Finally, I will integrate therapeutic and diagnostic implications, ensuring the mechanistic chain is internally consistent and supported by data.

> Let me first confirm the thoracic substrate in COPD. Hyperinflation from emphysema and airway collapse flattens the diaphragm, alters chest wall geometry, and shifts pleural pressure dynamics, placing the respiratory pump at a mechanical disadvantage and compressing intrathoracic vasculature and mediastinal structures, which in turn impedes venous return and reduces cardiac filling volumes [^113unvHy]. Wait, I should be precise here: I initially said "increased intrathoracic pressure", but more accurately, chronic hyperinflation renders pleural pressure less negative at end expiration and during tidal breathing, thereby reducing transmural filling pressures and venous return; the net effect is impaired preload despite variable absolute pressure references [^113unvHy]. I need to check structural thoracic correlates as well; radiographic studies show altered rib cage dimensions and diaphragmatic geometry at high lung volumes in obstructive disease, consistent with the mechanical scenario I'm describing [^114DsVyC].

> I will now examine whether there is direct evidence of mechanical cardiac "underfilling" and reduced chamber sizes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking multimodality data. Echocardiography and MRI in COPD demonstrate progressively smaller right and left cardiac chambers with increasing hyperinflation, and these changes correlate most strongly with static hyperinflation metrics, particularly the inspiratory capacity to total lung capacity ratio, suggesting an extrinsic volume constraint and preload limitation rather than primary myocardial failure [^116rf8b8] [^112xaHBW]. Let me verify internal consistency: cohorts with severe hyperinflation often show a small-heart phenotype with low RA, RV, LA, and LV volumes, which reinforces a mechanically driven limitation in diastolic filling [^116rf8b8].

> Next, I should review pulmonary venous return as a determinant of LV preload. The MESA COPD study used contrast CMR to show that total pulmonary vein cross-sectional area is smaller in COPD and inversely related to emphysema burden, consistent with upstream microvascular rarefaction and venous "bottleneck", producing low LV preload and underfilling of the left-sided chambers [^113unvHy]. Let me think about whether this aligns with echocardiographic diastolic indices in COPD; path models linking airway obstruction and hyperinflation to impaired LV diastolic filling further support a preload-limited physiology rather than intrinsic LV relaxation abnormality alone, although both can coexist in older multimorbid patients [^115Ev56v]. I should confirm that editorials and phenotype papers echo this venous-preload concept in COPD endophenotypes, which they do [^115QoX1B].

> But wait, what if the problem is mostly dynamic rather than static. During exertion and exacerbations, dynamic hyperinflation acutely raises end-expiratory lung volume and reduces venous return, amplifying diastolic compromise and precipitating HF decompensation or atrial arrhythmias; this temporal coupling has been highlighted in cardiovascular event clustering around exacerbations and in discussions of diagnostic confusion between COPD flare and acute HF [^114vn5oW] [^115ueNPt] [^116Q63TD]. I should double-check that this mechanism complements, rather than replaces, the static hyperinflation picture; indeed, the dynamic component likely superimposes on the chronic structural constraint to further depress LV preload during stress [^114vn5oW].

> I will now examine pulmonary hypertension and RV remodeling as upstream contributors. Hypoxic vasoconstriction, vascular pruning, endothelial dysfunction, and dynamic hyperinflation elevate pulmonary vascular resistance, promoting RV hypertrophy and dilation, which even in early disease without resting PH can alter RV structure and function and set the stage for interventricular interaction [^1163rrDZ] [^115iifem]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline-based echo surveillance of PH and RV function is relevant here, because identifying PH and RV strain refines the hemodynamic interpretation of diastolic abnormalities on the left side [^112wuZTY] [^115EicHG].

> Ventricular interdependence is the bridge to LV diastolic dysfunction in this setting. With RV pressure or volume loading, the septum shifts leftward within the constrained pericardium, reducing LV compliance and early diastolic filling, yielding the classic echo pattern of reduced E, augmented A, and low E/A ratio, which has been demonstrated in COPD even when pulmonary artery pressures are normal at rest, indicating that mechanical thoracic factors and interdependence are sufficient, while acknowledging that rising PAP further worsens filling and correlates with E/A [^113mZuS2] [^116pSYUh] [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied complete independence from pulmonary pressures, but I should clarify that although LV diastolic dysfunction is detectable in COPD with normal PAP, PAP severity still tracks with worsening diastolic indices, so PH acts as an amplifier rather than an obligatory trigger [^113mZuS2].

> Let me consider extracardiac systemic modifiers that can magnify the small-heart, low-preload phenotype. Severe COPD is often accompanied by cachexia and skeletal muscle loss, and emerging data suggest concomitant reductions in LV mass and potential cardiac atrophy, which would further reduce chamber size and compliance, compounding diastolic dysfunction beyond purely extrinsic compression or venous limitations [^115QoX1B]. I should confirm the biologic plausibility; systemic inflammation and neurohumoral activation in COPD are well described and linked to catabolism and adverse cardiovascular remodeling, which fits this observation [^1139Unsd] [^117PAD6h].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype and outcomes that fall out of this physiology. Patients with COPD often demonstrate a HFpEF-like profile with preserved EF, smaller LV volumes, concentric remodeling, and lower stroke volume, and when COPD coexists with HFpEF, symptoms, quality of life, hospitalization rates, and cardiovascular mortality are worse even after adjustment for RV size, indicating disease interaction beyond right-sided changes alone [^115nxvEt] [^112mVBUQ] [^113cQY1Z]. Hold on, I should verify whether impaired LV filling in COPD associates with mortality; recent COPD cohort work suggests that HFpEF features in COPD are common and portend higher all-cause mortality, highlighting a potentially treatable trait [^116dMrgU].

> I need to ensure there is interventional support for the mechanism. A randomized, double-blind crossover MRI study showed that pharmacologic lung deflation increased RV end-diastolic volume and also increased LV end-diastolic and LA volumes, improved LA reservoir-pump function, and enhanced pulmonary artery pulsatility without altering intrinsic myocardial function, which directly supports the concept that reducing hyperinflation improves biventricular filling through mechanical pathways [^114ZfttH]. Let me also check complementary pathways; multidisciplinary assessments for lung volume reduction procedures in appropriately selected hyperinflated emphysema patients can deliver both respiratory and cardiovascular benefits by relieving thoracic constraints, aligning with the observed cardiac improvements after lung deflation [^115Avxaz] [^113unvHy].

> Before concluding, I should confirm diagnostic guardrails because misclassification is common. During "exacerbations", natriuretic peptides often rise due to biventricular strain and comorbid cardiac disease, and careful echocardiography with attention to LV diastolic indices, RV size/function, septal motion, and estimated pulmonary pressures, complemented by clinical context, helps disentangle HFpEF flare from COPD-driven dyspnea, which is crucial for targeted therapy in this overlapping population [^113TGHxa] [^112wuZTY] [^112xaHBW] [^112sRm8g]. I should double-check that this approach matches real-world challenges; indeed, studies highlight frequent under-recognition of HF in COPD in acute settings, reinforcing the need for systematic cardiac evaluation when symptoms escalate [^116Q63TD].

> Integrating all of this, the mechanistic cascade is coherent: emphysema-driven static and dynamic hyperinflation remodel the thoracic cage and pleural pressure milieu, causing extrinsic cardiac compression and pulmonary microvascular-pruning with smaller pulmonary veins, thereby lowering LV preload and impairing diastolic filling; concurrent RV loading from pulmonary vascular disease shifts the septum and reduces LV compliance via ventricular interdependence; systemic catabolism and cachexia may shrink LV mass further, culminating in a HFpEF phenotype with small LV volumes, preserved EF, and poor hemodynamic reserve, a picture that is at least partially reversible with lung deflation therapies that restore filling volumes and reduce cardiopulmonary constraint [^116rf8b8] [^116BtE2k] [^113mZuS2] [^114ZfttH].

COPD increases the incidence and severity of diastolic heart failure (HFpEF) through **thoracic hyperinflation** and **ventricular interdependence** [^115EicHG]. Hyperinflation elevates intrathoracic pressure [^113unvHy], compresses pulmonary veins [^116BtE2k], and reduces venous return, causing **LV underfilling** [^114ZfttH] and impaired relaxation. RV enlargement from pulmonary hypertension [^1163rrDZ] shifts the septum leftward, further restricting LV filling and increasing diastolic pressures [^113mZuS2]. These mechanical effects are amplified by hypoxia [^1163rrDZ], hypercapnia, and systemic inflammation [^1139Unsd], leading to higher HFpEF prevalence [^112KPCYs] and **worse outcomes** in COPD [^113cQY1Z].

---

## Thoracic structural changes in COPD

COPD causes profound thoracic remodeling — characterized by **hyperinflation** and **altered chest wall mechanics** — that directly affects cardiac function.

- **Lung hyperinflation**: Air trapping increases residual volume and functional residual capacity, elevating intrathoracic pressure [^113unvHy] and reducing venous return [^114ZfttH].

- **Diaphragmatic flattening**: Hyperinflation flattens the diaphragm [^113unvHy], increasing intrathoracic pressure and impairing venous return.

- **Chest wall remodeling**: Barrel chest and altered mechanics further increase intrathoracic pressure and reduce venous return.

---

## Mechanisms linking thoracic changes to diastolic heart failure

### Reduced venous return and left ventricular underfilling

Hyperinflation and elevated intrathoracic pressure [^113unvHy] compress pulmonary veins [^116BtE2k], reducing venous return and causing **LV underfilling**. This results in smaller LV volumes [^116rf8b8], impaired relaxation, and higher diastolic pressures. Mechanistically, **pulmonary vein compression** reduces LV preload by decreasing pulmonary vein cross-sectional area [^116BtE2k], while **increased LV wall stress** from elevated intrathoracic pressure raises transmural LV pressure, promoting hypertrophy and stiffness.

---

### Ventricular interdependence and septal shift

Pulmonary hypertension–related **right ventricular enlargement** (hypertrophy/dilation) [^113mZuS2] produces a leftward **septal shift** that restricts LV filling, reduces compliance, and increases LV diastolic pressure, worsening HFpEF [^115EicHG].

---

### Hypoxia, hypercapnia, and systemic inflammation

COPD-related hypoxia and hypercapnia increase pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload [^1163rrDZ], reducing LV filling, while **systemic inflammation** promotes myocardial fibrosis and stiffness, worsening diastolic dysfunction [^116pSYUh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies show a **strong link** between COPD-related thoracic changes and diastolic heart failure [^112xaHBW].

- **Increased prevalence of HFpEF**: COPD patients have higher HFpEF prevalence [^116dMrgU] due to hyperinflation and reduced venous return [^114ZfttH].

- **Worse clinical outcomes**: COPD with HFpEF has higher mortality, hospitalizations [^113cQY1Z], and worse quality of life than HFpEF alone.

- **Echocardiographic evidence**: COPD shows impaired LV filling [^115Ev56v], reduced volumes, and increased diastolic pressures [^113mZuS2].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing this link is **essential for management** [^1126Svoi].

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Use echocardiography [^112xaHBW] and biomarkers (NT-proBNP) [^113TGHxa] to detect diastolic dysfunction in COPD.

- **Targeted therapies**: Treat hyperinflation (bronchodilators, lung volume reduction) [^114ZfttH] [^115Avxaz], pulmonary hypertension [^1163rrDZ], and systemic inflammation [^1139Unsd] to improve diastolic function.

- **Integrated care**: Coordinate respiratory and cardiovascular care [^114yQZ19] to optimize outcomes [^116pSYUh].

---

COPD-related thoracic changes — especially hyperinflation and RV enlargement — drive **diastolic dysfunction** via reduced venous return [^114ZfttH], septal shift [^115EicHG], and increased LV stiffness, all worsened by hypoxia and inflammation. Addressing these mechanisms can **improve outcomes** in COPD with HFpEF [^116bKMxZ].

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Insights from PARAGON-HF [^113cQY1Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is not well understood. We examined outcomes in patients with HFpEF, according to COPD status, in the PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor With Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Global Outcomes in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial. The primary outcome was a composite of first and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death.

Out of 4791 patients, 670 (14%) had COPD. Patients with COPD were more likely to be men (58% versus 47%; P < 0.001) and had worse New York Heart Association functional class (class III/IV 24% versus 19%), poorer Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Scores (69 versus 76; P < 0.001), and a more frequent history of heart failure hospitalization (54% versus 47%; P < 0.001). The decrement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Scores with COPD was greater than for other common comorbidities.

Patients with COPD had echocardiographic signs of right ventricular enlargement, higher serum creatinine levels (100 μmol/L versus 96 μmol/L), and a greater neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (2.7 versus 2.5) than those without COPD. After multivariable adjustment, COPD was associated with worse outcomes: the adjusted rate ratio for the primary outcome was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.25–1.83), for total heart failure hospitalization 1.54 (95% CI, 1.24–1.90), and for cardiovascular death the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.42.

### Impaired left ventricular filling in COPD and emphysema: Is it the heart or the lungs? The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis COPD study [^116BtE2k]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

COPD and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction overlap clinically, and impaired left ventricular (LV) filling is commonly reported in COPD. The mechanism underlying these observations is uncertain, but may include upstream pulmonary dysfunction causing low LV preload or intrinsic LV dysfunction causing high LV preload. The objective of this study is to determine if COPD and emphysema are associated with reduced pulmonary vein dimensions suggestive of low LV preload.

- **Methods**: The population-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study recruited smokers aged 50 to 79 years who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease. COPD was defined by spirometry. Percent emphysema was defined as regions < -910 Hounsfield units on full-lung CT scan. Ostial pulmonary vein cross-sectional area was measured by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance and expressed as the sum of all pulmonary vein areas. Linear regression was used to adjust for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body size, and smoking.

- **Results**: Among 165 participants, the mean (± SD) total pulmonary vein area was 558 ± 159 mm² in patients with COPD and 623 ± 145 mm² in control subjects. Total pulmonary vein area was smaller in patients with COPD (-57 mm²; 95% CI, -106 to -7 mm²; p = 0.03) and inversely associated with percent emphysema (P < .001) in fully adjusted models. Significant decrements in total pulmonary vein area were observed among participants with COPD alone, COPD with emphysema on CT scan, and emphysema without spirometrically defined COPD.

- **Conclusions**: Pulmonary vein dimensions are reduced in COPD and emphysema, suggesting low LV preload.

### Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction: To the heart of the matter [^113unvHy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive and irreversible airflow limitation. It is associated with a number of comorbidities, particularly heart failure, and they share risk factors, notably exposure to cigarette smoke and aging. Furthermore, it is appreciated that patients with coexisting COPD and heart failure experience disproportionately worse outcomes. The suggested pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their association, although not fully understood, include systemic inflammation, COPD exacerbations, pulmonary hypertension, and lung hyperinflation.

Severe emphysema with hyperinflation is the end stage of the COPD spectrum, with substantial loss of terminal bronchioles and destruction of the elastic scaffold maintaining patency of airways and facilitating passive recoil. The respiratory pump is mechanically disadvantaged by splinting of the diaphragm, malalignment of the thoracic cage, and chest wall asynchrony. Intrathoracic pressure is increased, and the vasculature is compressed, which, in addition to parenchymal loss, contributes to pulmonary hypertension. The increased intrathoracic pressure also impedes venous return, and the cardiac chamber sizes are reduced, leading to impaired left ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output.

### Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with COPD in the presence and absence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure [^113mZuS2]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Increased right ventricular afterload leads to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction due to ventricular interdependence. Increased right ventricular afterload is frequently present in patients with COPD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether left ventricular diastolic dysfunction could be detected in COPD patients with normal or elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).

- **Methods**: Twenty-two patients with COPD and 22 matched control subjects underwent pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and other causes of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (e.g. coronary artery disease) were excluded in all patients and control subjects. PAP was measured invasively in 13 patients with COPD.

- **Results**: The maximal atrial filling velocity was increased, and the early filling velocity was decreased in patients with COPD compared to control subjects. The early flow velocity peak/late flow velocity peak (E/A) ratio was markedly decreased in patients with COPD compared to control subjects (0.79 ± 0.035 vs. 1.38 ± 0.069, respectively; p < 0.0001), indicating the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The atrial contribution to total left diastolic filling was increased in patients with COPD. This was also observed in COPD patients with normal PAP, as ascertained using a right heart catheter. The atrial contribution to total left diastolic filling was further increased in COPD patients with elevated PAP. PAP correlated with the E/A ratio (r = -0.85; p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is present in COPD patients regardless of their PAP status.

### Characterization and mortality risk of impaired left ventricular filling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112KPCYs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The high frequency of patients with features of HFpEF in this COPD cohort can be mainly attributed to shared risk factors and etiologies, such as aging, smoking, and further cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia. However, COPD has also been shown to be an independent risk factor for some cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, and the diagnosis of COPD in patients with heart failure was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Nonetheless, cohort studies investigating the prevalence of HFpEF and other cardiac dysfunction patterns in patients with COPD based on objective assessments of cardiac structure, function, and biomarkers are scarce.

In our cohort, almost one-third of the patients showed structural heart changes suggestive of HFpEF, such as LV hypertrophy or left atrial enlargement, of whom nearly half had more classical HFpEF features, with left ventricular stress indicated by elevated serum levels of NT-proBNP. A further key finding of this study is that patients with COPD and HFpEF features have a higher rate of all-cause mortality than patients with COPD and no cardiac dysfunction. As we report that having HFpEF features is a frequent comorbidity in patients with COPD, we suggest that HFpEF in COPD might be a treatable trait, and its management has the potential to decrease mortality in this subgroup of patients with COPD.

### Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and exertional ventilatory inefficiency in COPD [^113YyoEU]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is highly prevalent in COPD, and conflicting results have emerged regarding the consequences on exercise capacity in the 6MWT. We sought to examine ventilatory efficiency and variability metrics as the primary endpoint and aerobic capacity (V'O2) as the secondary endpoint.

Forty subjects were included and submitted to comprehensive lung function tests, detailed pulsed-Doppler echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Four subjects were excluded due to concomitant cardiac disease, and two were excluded due to COPD exacerbation.

Seventeen COPD/LVDD+ and seventeen COPD/LVDD- individuals were closely matched for baseline characteristics. Throughout the exercise, there was no difference between groups for primary (V'E/V'CO2 slope and V'E/V'CO2 nadir, p > 0.05 for both) or secondary endpoints (V'O2peak %pred, p > 0.05). Ventilatory variability remained unchanged. However, following a very well age- and sex-matched subgroup analysis, five moderate and three mild COPD/LVDD+ subjects with elevated left ventricular filling pressure (E/e' > 13, n = 8) presented a downward-shifted V'E/V'CO2 slope (25.7 ± 5.1 vs. 33.4 ± 7.1, p = 0.031) and V'E/V'CO2 nadir reduction (29.7 ± 3.9 vs. 36.3 ± 7.2, p = 0.042), besides significantly better V'O2peak %pred (92.1 ± 21.6% vs. 75.8 ± 13.1%, p = 0.045) compared to 8 COPD/LVDD- controls. Ventilatory variability remained once again unchanged.

COPD with LVDD overlap is not associated with worse exercise tolerance and/or wasted ventilation in excess compared to COPD without LVDD.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subpopulations and phenotyping [^117LHzA7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all approach. Diagnosis relies on meeting the physiological criteria of fixed obstruction in forced expiratory flows. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief with limited effect on overall prognosis. However, patients with COPD present distinct features leading to very different disease evolutions. In this review, we highlight distinct subgroups of COPD characterized by unique pathophysiological derangements, response to treatment, and disease progression. Identifying these subgroups is likely to lead to the discovery of much-needed disease-modifying therapeutic approaches.

- **Precision approach**: We argue for a precision approach that integrates multiple dimensions — clinical, physiological, imaging, and endotyping — to advance the field in treating this disease.

### The challenges of defining early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population [^1173MH5g]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a significant global health burden and is projected to become the third-leading cause of mortality by 2030. Established COPD is highly heterogeneous and lacks disease-modifying treatments. A clearer understanding of the condition is often hindered by the high rate of comorbidities that patients typically exhibit at the point of diagnosis. It is evident that there are various subpopulations at risk for accelerated disease progression. The mechanisms underpinning these varying trajectories leading to the development of COPD are highly complex but are significantly influenced by early life exposures. Additionally, it is now understood that at the point of diagnosis, individuals with COPD have been symptomatic for at least five years, highlighting the critical need for early detection and efficacious interventions.

At the time of writing, most COPD studies examining the concept of early COPD have included populations with mean ages older than 60 years. As Martinez and colleagues highlight in a recent review, these studies, therefore, inform on late "mild disease" as opposed to "early disease". Although the initial events responsible for the ultimate development of pathology cannot currently be described, this expert group proposed an operational definition for early COPD based on surrogate endpoints. This encompasses lung pathology unequivocally associated with subsequent accelerated lung function decline, leading to objectively confirmed incompletely reversible airflow obstruction.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Insights from PARAGON-HF [^115nxvEt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the left side of the heart are more complex. Right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation may cause a leftward shift of the interventricular septum, reducing left ventricular cavity size, compliance, and stroke volume. Conversely, severe COPD may lead to a reduced pulmonary vein cross-sectional area, reduced left ventricular filling and volumes, and a reduction in cardiac output. It has been suggested that COPD may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy as a result of increased residual volume, negative inspiratory pleural pressure, increased left ventricular transmural pressure and wall stress. We found that patients with COPD had a thicker left ventricular posterior wall. Notably, left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in patients with COPD and those without, and there was also a lack of difference in NT-proBNP levels between patients with and without COPD.

We found that right ventricular size was an independent predictor of the composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, consistent with other studies in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, those prior studies had not linked right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction to COPD. Moreover, COPD remained an independent predictor of worse outcomes even after including indices of right ventricular size in the multivariable model; that is, the excess risk related to COPD was not explained by right ventricular impairment.

Using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), we found patients with COPD to have markedly worse symptoms and health-related quality of life than participants without COPD. This was also reported in previous studies.

### Impact of comorbidities on the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114yQZ19]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently exists alongside other chronic diseases. Comorbidities can have a significant influence on the course of COPD, affecting disease-related symptoms and increasing morbidity and mortality in patients. Studies indicate that management of comorbid COPD can be improved by engaging in a multidisciplinary team-based approach. A collaborative effort from different disease specialists and health care professionals, together with disease self-management and management programs, could improve the outcomes of patients with comorbid COPD.

### B-type natriuretic peptides in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^116jCsQ3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Causes of natriuretic peptide elevation in patients with and without COPD:

Myocardial stretch in either ventricle due to volume or pressure overload increases NP levels. Causes include heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection, right ventricular failure, pulmonary emboli, acute coronary syndromes, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. Advancing age and renal dysfunction are also associated with elevated NT-proBNP concentrations. Many of these factors are present in stable COPD and common non-infective precipitants of exacerbation. The presence and extent of each factor vary significantly from patient to patient and are largely independent of COPD severity or acute right ventricular dysfunction. Thus, NP levels are higher during acute exacerbation or chronic decompensation (cor pulmonale) than in stable disease and exhibit significant variability with skewed distributions.

By systematically searching and aggregating individual studies, our review highlights several new and consistent observations that suggest NP release is multifactorial with a limited direct relationship to COPD. First, NP levels are increased even in some patients with mild COPD without arterial hypoxemia, severe pulmonary hypertension, or right ventricular dysfunction. Second, levels are stable or exhibit only a minor gradient with increasing COPD severity. Third, the magnitude of the correlation coefficients (r) suggests only approximately 25% to 50% of the variance (r²) in NP is attributable to any single variable. Moreover, the correlation between left and right ventricular functions is complex.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and its comorbidities [^114VfBnv]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

While chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is still characterized and diagnosed by lung function measurements, there is increasing evidence that the chronic diseases frequently developing alongside COPD, in response to common risk factors such as smoking, aging, and obesity, may significantly contribute to its clinical manifestations and severity. Considering that both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments of COPD, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, are primarily symptomatic, it is reasonable to hope that a more comprehensive management of COPD, which considers its comorbidities, may improve treatment response and reduce mortality in COPD patients.

Thus, as comorbidities are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, it is crucial to search for their coexistence in COPD and all chronic diseases, possibly by adopting diagnosis recommendations for single diseases. This implies that while careful cardiovascular, metabolic, and endocrinologic examinations should be increasingly used in assessing patients with COPD, lung function measurements may become useful in patients with chronic cardiovascular, metabolic, and endocrinologic diseases. There is increasing evidence that active treatment of comorbidities, for example through the use of statins and beta-blockers, may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD. This suggests an urgent need for randomized clinical trials that will hopefully provide evidence for more comprehensive clinical guidelines for these patients.

### Mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A pathophysiologic review [^1163rrDZ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and is often complicated by the development of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). The presence of PHT in COPD subjects is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and use of health-care resources. Thus, significant efforts have been made to treat PHT in COPD patients to achieve improved clinical outcomes but with only minimal success.

There is renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms contributing to PHT in COPD as the basis for exploring new therapeutic strategies. This study reviews the evidence supporting the postulated mechanisms contributing to PHT in COPD. Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in the development of COPD-associated PHT. However, other mechanisms are also likely involved in the pathogenesis of increased pulmonary vascular resistance in this cohort, including acidemia, dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation, parenchymal destruction, pulmonary vascular remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. These mechanisms are interdependent, modulated by genetic factors, and may be confounded by comorbidities such as sleep-disordered breathing, left heart failure, and pulmonary thromboembolism.

Despite significant research in recent decades, there is surprisingly little evidence of a causal relationship between many of these factors and the development of COPD-associated PHT. The pathogenesis of PHT in COPD is complex and multifaceted. Ultimately, as we obtain better information on COPD phenotypes, we may be able to more precisely account for the varied pathologies.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an inappropriate or excessive inflammatory response of the lungs to respiratory pollutants, mainly tobacco smoking. Recently, in addition to the typical pulmonary pathology of COPD, such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, several effects occurring outside the lungs have been described, known as the systemic effects of COPD. These effects are clinically relevant because they modify and can aid in the classification and management of the disease.

The current review discusses the systemic effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically:

- **Systemic inflammation**: The mechanisms and clinical implications are examined, and research areas needing further exploration are identified.

- **Nutritional abnormalities and weight loss**: This section covers potential mechanisms and their clinical relevance, as well as highlighting additional research areas.

- **Skeletal muscle dysfunction**: An analysis of the mechanisms involved and their implications is provided, along with suggestions for future research directions.

- **Other potential systemic effects**: Various other systemic effects are discussed with a focus on potential mechanisms and implications.

For each area, the potential mechanisms and clinical implications are discussed, and areas requiring further research are highlighted.

### Heightened long-term cardiovascular risks after exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114vn5oW]. Heart (2024). Low credibility.

There are several plausible explanations for the increased risk of heart failure (HF) decompensation following an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airway infection and inflammation can directly inhibit myocardial contraction, while hypoxia increases pulmonary artery pressure and right heart strain. Concurrently, dynamic hyperinflation and increased thoracic pressure may compromise ventricular filling, leading to diastolic dysfunction and potentially HF decompensation in the short and longer term.

Regarding cardiac arrhythmias, the biventricular impairment of preload, afterload, and contractility not only reduces cardiac output but also increases atrial strain. Hypercapnia, acidosis, and sympathetic activation increase automaticity and exacerbate these atrial hemodynamic effects to precipitate atrial fibrillation. Drug prescribing patterns may further compound these pathophysiological disturbances. For instance, beta-blockers may be discontinued following an exacerbation of COPD due to unfounded concerns regarding respiratory side effects.

The considerable elevation in the risk of HF decompensation during the exacerbating period (1–7 days) may be partially explained by misclassification, where HF decompensation is initially misdiagnosed as an exacerbation before the correct diagnosis is made, because symptoms, signs, and radiological findings overlap. Airflow obstruction is common in decompensated HF due to interstitial and alveolar edema compressing airways along with bronchial hyper-responsiveness. In a multinational study, only one-third of patients with COPD had HF correctly identified in the emergency setting.

### Lung deflation and cardiovascular structure and function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A randomized controlled trial [^114ZfttH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develop increased cardiovascular morbidity alongside structural alterations.

- **Objectives**: Through a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, the effect of lung deflation on cardiovascular structure and function was investigated using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Methods**: Forty-five hyperinflated COPD patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 7 to 14 days of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 μg or placebo, with a 7-day minimum washout period. The primary outcome measured was the change from baseline in right ventricular end-diastolic volume index versus placebo.

- **Measurements and main results**: A 5.8 ml/m² (95% confidence interval, 2.74–8.91; P < 0.001) increase in the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and a 429 mL (P < 0.001) reduction in residual volume were observed with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared to placebo. Left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial end-systolic volumes increased by 3.63 ml/m² (P = 0.002) and 2.33 ml/m² (P = 0.002), respectively. Post hoc analysis showed an increase in right ventricular stroke volume by 4.87 ml/m² (P = 0.003); however, the right ventricular ejection fraction remained unchanged. Left ventricular adaptation was similar, with left atrial ejection fraction improving by +3.17% (P < 0.001). Intrinsic myocardial function was unchanged. Pulmonary artery pulsatility increased in two of three locations (main +2.9%, P = 0.001; left +2.67%, P = 0.030). The safety profile of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol was similar to that of placebo.

### Is it the heart or the lung? Sometimes it is both [^116Q63TD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations have been recently redefined as "an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsen over ≤ 14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways". Though much has been understood about the pathogenesis and impact of exacerbations, our definition of an exacerbation remains subjective and reliant on patient‐reported symptoms. Our attempts to find objective, readily measurable markers to diagnose an exacerbation, "a lung troponin", have been unsuccessful at the time of writing.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Dransfield and colleagues have extended previous observations of increased cardiovascular events following a COPD exacerbation by examining the adverse events reported in the course of a large clinical trial of prevention of exacerbations of COPD with different combinations of inhaled long‐acting bronchodilators and corticosteroids. The increased odds of having a cardiovascular event are remarkable, especially for hospitalized (severe) episodes. However, the numbers for the cardiovascular events that occur during the exacerbation have to be carefully interpreted. The dyspnea of an exacerbation often turns out to be related to congestive heart failure, a cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiac ischemia. Absence of objective markers of an exacerbation contributes to this diagnostic confusion.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115iAHYK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

The GOLD 2025 guidelines offer a comprehensive approach to the classification and risk stratification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly concerning severity assessment. They recommend using the GOLD ABE tool, which assesses severity based on the level of dyspnea and exacerbation history:

- **Group A**: This group is characterized by 0–1 moderate exacerbations not leading to hospital admission, a modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale of 0–1, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score. Patients with mMRC ≥ 2 or a CAT score ≥ 10 are classified in this category as well.

- **Group E**: This group comprises individuals with ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations or at least one exacerbation leading to hospital admission, regardless of the mMRC or CAT scores.

### Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beyond the lungs [^1126Svoi]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term that covers many clinical subtypes with clearly different pulmonary and extra-pulmonary characteristics, but with persistent airflow limitation in common. This insight has led to the development of a more personalized approach in bronchodilator therapy, prevention of exacerbations, and advanced treatments, such as non-invasive ventilation and lung volume reduction techniques. However, systemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD also contribute to different clinical phenotypes and warrant an individualized approach as part of integrated disease management.

Alterations in body weight and composition, ranging from cachexia to obesity, demand specific management. Psychological symptoms are highly prevalent, necessitating thorough diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, prevention of exacerbations requires interventions beyond the lungs, including treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and management of dyspnea and anxiety. In this review, we discuss the management of COPD beyond the respiratory system and propose treatment strategies based on the latest research and best practices.

### Pulmonary diseases and the heart [^115EicHG]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

The complex nature of interactions between the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems is becoming increasingly appreciated. Pulmonary vascular abnormalities are frequently present in patients with respiratory disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, neuromuscular or chest wall disorders, and disorders of ventilatory control, including sleep apnea syndromes and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension, classified as group III in the World Health Organization classification scheme for pulmonary hypertension, may result in severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by lung disease, also known as cor pulmonale. The development of cor pulmonale is generally associated with a poorer prognosis and increased death.

Systemic manifestations of lung disease, particularly obstructive disorders, are also particularly relevant because they are associated with increased cardiac death and impaired health status. This article will discuss the most common pulmonary diseases and disorders of ventilatory control that cause pulmonary vascular abnormalities and cor pulmonale, with particular concentration on how treatment of these diseases may affect the heart.

In addition, the complex nature of cardiac and lung disease will also be explored, particularly with respect to the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular death, which is currently a very active focus of research.

### Thoracic dimensions at maximum lung inflation in normal subjects and in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases [^114DsVyC]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

To compare the distribution of lung volume at total lung capacity (TLC) among adult men and women known to have normal lung function or chronic obstructive disease or restrictive lung disease (RLD), a five-year retrospective study was conducted.

- **Setting**: Review of available clinical pulmonary function testing (PFT) reports and chest radiographs.

- **Patients**: The study included 64 patients with normal PFT and chest radiograph findings (normal subjects), 26 patients with severe COPD and increased TLC (COPD group), 29 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and increased TLC (CF group), and 19 patients with RLD with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis and reduced TLC (RLD group).

- **Measurements**: Average posteroanterior rib cage diameter (PAave), average lateral rib cage diameter (LAave), and average vertical height of the diaphragm (HDIave) were measured using radiography. Normal prediction equations were generated based on stature, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex as independent variables and then used in between-group comparisons.

Results indicated that PAave correlated positively with BMI and age but not with height, while LAave correlated positively with BMI and height but not with age. HDIave correlated positively with height and age but negatively with BMI. In terms of gender differences, PAave and LAave were smaller and HDIave was greater in women than men of the same stature. In the COPD group and in male CF group patients, BMI was low, and only HDIave was greater than in sex-, age-, and height-matched normal subjects. However, in female CF group patients, only the rib cage diameters were greater than normal.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1133kK1g]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a detailed medical history in patients with known or suspected COPD, including:

- **Exposures**: Smoking, occupational exposures, and environmental exposures (household/outdoor).

- **Past medical history**: Early life events (such as prematurity, low birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking exposure during infancy), asthma, allergy, sinusitis, or nasal polyps, respiratory infections in childhood, HIV, and tuberculosis.

- **Family history**: COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases.

- **Pattern of symptom development**: COPD typically develops in adult life, and most patients are conscious of increased breathlessness, more frequent or prolonged "winter colds", and some social restriction for a number of years before seeking medical help.

- **Exacerbations**: History of exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for a respiratory disorder.

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety and depression, and malignancies.

- **Impact on patient's life**: Limitation of activity, missed work and economic impact, effect on well-being, effect on family routines, and effect on sexual activity, as well as feelings of depression or anxiety.

- **Social factors**: Availability of social and family support.

### Decreasing cardiac chamber sizes and associated heart dysfunction in COPD: Role of hyperinflation [^116rf8b8]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the role of abnormal lung function in heart size and heart dysfunction in patients with COPD. We studied the relationship of lung function with heart size and heart dysfunction and associated consequences for 6-min walk distance (6MWD) in patients with COPD of different severities.

- **Methods**: In 138 patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] I-IV), we measured the size of all cardiac chambers, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (relaxation and filling), and global right ventricular dysfunction (Tei-index) by echocardiography. We also measured lung function (spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusion capacity) and 6MWD.

- **Results**: The size of all cardiac chambers decreased with increasing GOLD stage. Overall, moderate relationships existed between variables of lung function and cardiac chamber sizes. Static hyperinflation (inspiratory-to-total lung capacity ratio [IC/TLC], functional residual capacity, and residual volume) showed stronger associations with cardiac chamber sizes than airway obstruction or diffusion capacity. IC/TLC correlated best with cardiac chamber sizes and was an independent predictor of cardiac chamber sizes after adjustment for body surface area. Patients with an IC/TLC ≤ 0.25 exhibited more pronounced changes. An impaired left ventricular diastolic filling pattern was independently associated with a reduced 6MWD.

- **Conclusions**: An increasing rate of COPD severity is linked to decreasing cardiac chamber sizes and associated heart dysfunction.

### Echocardiographic endophenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A step toward personalized medicine [^115QoX1B]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), regardless of severity, is strongly associated with decreased pulmonary microvascular blood flow, likely because of smoking-induced endothelial injury in the distal pulmonary vasculature. This reduction in microvascular blood flow could lead to diminished pulmonary venous return, underfilling of the left atrium and left ventricle, decreased cardiac output, and subsequent reductions in right ventricular (RV) filling. Supporting this hypothesis, findings from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD study demonstrated that increasing COPD severity correlates with reductions in RV end-diastolic volume and stroke volume.

Interestingly, in this cohort, patients with small left ventricles also had lower body mass index and skeletal muscle mass index than those with normal cardiac function or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), raising concerns about cachexia. Severe COPD is frequently associated with cachexia and muscle wasting, which could result in cardiac atrophy and decreased left ventricular (LV) mass. This suggests that small LV size in these patients may partly result from cardiac atrophy driven by COPD-related cachexia. Furthermore, the observed worse RV function in patients with COPD with small left ventricles than in those with normal cardiac function or HFpEF hints at a systemic phenomenon affecting all cardiac chambers. Unfortunately, the present study lacks detailed quantitative assessments of RV and right atrial size and function to validate this hypothesis.

Pulmonary hypertension, a well-recognized complication of COPD, could also contribute to LV underfilling from reduced preload.

### Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in individuals with heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177p6Se]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has many causes, which can be broadly split into five categories: idiopathic (Group I), left cardiac disease (Group II), lung disease (Group III), pulmonary artery obstruction (Group IV), and hematological/systemic disorders (Group V). Of these, heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of PH. Heart failure is the inability of the heart to adequately pump blood and meet the metabolic demands of the body. It is classified into three distinct groups, each with differing levels of ejection fraction (preserved, mid-range, and reduced). The immense prevalence, mortality, and public health burden have even been described as a "global pandemic", with reported prevalence rates ranging between 3.9 and 16 per 1000 people.

PH is a poor prognostic indicator in HF and is associated with an increased 5-year mortality rate, independent of HF severity and other comorbidities. These poor outcomes can be largely attributed to the lack of specific treatments available for Group II PH, in comparison to other PH subtypes.

Although the disease mechanisms linking HF and PH are well documented in the literature, little work has been done to establish the epidemiological relationship between the two pathologies in patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the literature investigating the co-existence of these two pathologies, with a focus on the prevalence of PH in individuals with HF. The aims of this review are to investigate the overall prevalence of PH among individuals with HF and to estimate how this varies across different populations and study characteristics, including the…

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111jGieZ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating and treating concomitant chronic diseases that frequently occur in patients with COPD. These include CVD, skeletal muscle dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression, anxiety, and lung cancer, as they influence health status, hospitalizations, and mortality independently of the severity of airflow obstruction due to COPD.

### Characterization and mortality risk of impaired left ventricular filling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116dMrgU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease are among the leading causes of global mortality and disability. Both diseases frequently coexist, leading to poor outcomes and worsened survival. A well-established instance is the interaction between COPD and cardiac dysfunction, namely heart failure, as both conditions share risk factors and clinical features, such as aging, acute hospitalization, and disease progression. Although heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is believed to be a frequent cooccurring cardiac condition in COPD, left ventricular dysfunction might also arise as a disease-related cardiac manifestation in patients with COPD and hyperinflation. Imaging studies have indicated a close association of lung hyperinflation or emphysema with the reduction of end-diastolic left ventricular volume and the ensuing decline in cardiac output. Likewise, airflow limitation and lung hyperinflation were linked to decreased left ventricular filling and cardiac chamber size, measured by echocardiography, in patients with COPD.

A further disease-related aspect is the reduction in pulmonary blood flow of emphysematous lung regions and the subsequent left ventricular underfilling. Reduced left ventricular filling in patients with COPD and hyperinflation is a treatable trait, as lung deflation with either pharmacological or bronchoscopic lung volume reduction improves cardiac function; this is indicated by an increase in the left ventricle (LV) size.

### Heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The challenges facing physicians and health services [^112gxuds]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pulmonary disease is common in patients with heart failure due to shared risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Both diseases are characterized by adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling and chronic systemic inflammation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The cornerstones of therapy, beta-blockers and beta-agonists, have pharmacological properties that are diametrically opposed. Each disease can exacerbate the other, greatly increasing hospitalizations and associated healthcare costs. Such multimorbidity poses a key challenge for healthcare systems oriented towards the treatment of individual diseases. Early identification and treatment of cardiopulmonary disease may alleviate this burden; however, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies require further validation in patients with both conditions.

### Recent advances in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis: from disease mechanisms to precision medicine [^112Uyfwa]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an often severely disabling chronic lung disease with a high prevalence of over 250 million cases worldwide. It is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and is predicted to be the third by 2020. In the most recent definition by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is defined as "a common, preventable, and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory systems and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". This exposure can be quite variable, with smoking being the main risk factor in high-income countries and indoor cooking and occupational exposures representing important risk factors in low-income countries.

The definition and staging by GOLD is rather uniform, as defined by lung function, symptoms, and exacerbation history, despite COPD being a heterogeneous disease in its pathological manifestations in patients. It has long been recognized that inflammation is a central hallmark of COPD, playing a role in the pathological changes in all different lung compartments. Alongside toxic exposures, genetic predisposition is an important risk factor for COPD. COPD represents a complex disease in which genetic abnormalities, in combination with the type and duration of exposures, determine the clinical phenotype. The development of novel 2D and 3D in vitro and ex vivo models, as well as animal models that accurately recapitulate the main features, highlights the complexity of the disease.

### Lung volume reduction: Apex treatments and the ecology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care [^115Avxaz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence COPD guideline update outlines a stepwise system approach to evaluation for LVR. At the end of pulmonary rehabilitation, patients' condition and their pharmacotherapy should have been optimized as far as is possible. If at that point they are still limited by breathlessness, the plausibility of LVR should be considered in all individuals. In the absence of obvious contraindications such as frailty or multimorbidity, a respiratory assessment including computed tomography thorax and lung function testing should be performed. Where emphysema and significant hyperinflation are identified, suggesting LVR is a possibility, a review by an LVR multidisciplinary team, able to assess technical suitability and weigh different options to establish whether any LVR approach is likely to be beneficial, should be considered. Obviously, to get to this final point, the healthcare system requires breathless patients with COPD actually to be offered and be able to access pulmonary rehabilitation, receive smoking cessation support, and have appropriate pharmacotherapy.

### Comorbidities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116CwTWb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Defining the nature of the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic conditions is of primary importance to improve the health status of COPD patients through the optimal care of comorbidities. We aimed to provide a reasoned guide to understand, recognize, and treat comorbidity of COPD with the perspective of shifting from comorbidity to multimorbidity.

- **Recent findings**: Select comorbidities, such as atherosclerotic disease, depression, chronic kidney disease, cognitive impairment, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, lung cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, heart failure, sarcopenia, aortic aneurysm, arrhythmias, and pulmonary embolism, are highly prevalent among older COPD patients. Several concerns may affect the management of COPD patients with comorbidity, such as the use of β-blockers in patients with COPD and cardiovascular diseases or concerns about the cardiovascular safety of inhaled COPD drugs.

- **Summary**: Evidence suggests that systemic inflammation may be the link between COPD and comorbidities, but this issue is still debated. Whatever the mechanism underlying comorbidities in COPD may be, it has an important clinical, prognostic, and therapeutic impact. Nevertheless, clinical practice guidelines do not take into account comorbidities in their recommendations. Additionally, clinical trials investigating COPD treatment in the context of multimorbidity and considering geriatric outcomes are also distinctly lacking.

### Right ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without pulmonary hypertension [^115iifem]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate right ventricular (RV) function and structure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without pulmonary hypertension (PH). There is little knowledge of RV function and remodeling in COPD without PH.

Thirty-four controls and 98 patients with COPD were included. The study patients were divided into two groups by right heart catheterization: no PH (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] < 25 mm Hg) and PH (mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg). The echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging variables of RV isovolumic acceleration, peak systolic strain, and RV myocardial performance index were measured at the basal free wall. RV wall thickness and RV internal dimension were measured in the RV outflow tract.

The increases in RV wall thickness and RV dimension were more evident when comparing controls with the no PH group (3.5 ± 0.5 mm to 5.5 ± 1.0 mm [p < 0.01] and 1.5 cm ± 0.2 to 2.0 ± 0.5 cm [p < 0.01]) than comparing the no PH group with the PH group (5.5 ± 1.0 mm to 6.6 ± 1.1 mm [p < 0.01] and 2.0 cm ± 0.5 to 2.1 ± 0.3 cm [p = NS]), respectively. Similarly, RV isovolumic acceleration, performance index, and strain deteriorated significantly when comparing controls with the no PH group and comparing the no PH group with the PH group (p < 0.01). Significant correlations were observed between mPAP and RV isovolumic acceleration, performance index, strain, and RV wall thickness (p < 0.01). RV impairment and increased RV wall thickness and RV dimensions were present even at slight elevations.

### Lung function and cardiovascular disease: A link [^112YLZju]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The relationship between lung and heart diseases has long been recognized, with necropsy studies demonstrating silent myocardial infarctions or coronary artery calcification in patients with advanced emphysema as the cause of death. Improvements in non-invasive techniques and epidemiologic approaches have established that lung and cardiovascular diseases frequently coexist in mid and late life. Even among those without diagnosed lung disease, lower than expected forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and their ratio each portend a greater risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and for incident cardiovascular diseases, including left heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Greater longitudinal declines in these spirometric measures are further associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

While obstructive ventilatory patterns are more common, restrictive ventilatory patterns seem to demonstrate an independent and more robust association with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure. These subclinical alterations in pulmonary function also relate to subclinical abnormalities of cardiac structure and function. Although the biologic pathways linking pulmonary and cardiovascular dysfunction are not clear, chronic systemic inflammation appears to be one important underlying pathophysiologic link. Despite the growing evidence of lung dysfunction as a cardiovascular risk factor, spirometric evaluation is still underutilized in clinical practice, particularly among cardiac patients, and optimal strategies have yet to be fully implemented.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Insights from PARADIGM-HF [^11426x2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The quest to improve outcomes for patients with heart failure (HF) has recently focused not only on the underlying disease but also on the associated comorbidities. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in prevalence, has few effective therapies, and is predicted to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. Up to one‐third of unselected patients with stable HF have concurrent COPD, largely because of the shared risk factor of smoking. Cumulative smoking exposure has been associated with incident HF and ventricular remodeling, but the effect of COPD as an independent contributor to HF outcomes is less well understood.

One potential contributor to the higher rates of death and hospitalization in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have COPD, compared with patients with HFrEF who do not have COPD, is the underuse of beta‐blockers due to perceived or actual intolerance of these drugs in people with COPD. This highlights the importance of alternative therapies in these particularly high‐risk patients with the combination of HFrEF and COPD. A recent therapeutic advance in HFrEF has been the introduction of neprilysin inhibition (used in conjunction with an angiotensin receptor blocker). However, the potential effects of neprilysin inhibition in HFrEF patients with COPD, especially those with concomitant pulmonary hypertension, are uncertain, with conflicting experimental and other data. Mice genetically deficient in neprilysin develop exaggerated pulmonary vascular remodeling in response to chronic hypoxia.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically concerning other pharmacological agents, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend not using statins for the prevention of exacerbations in patients with COPD who are at increased risk of exacerbation and who do not have indications for statin therapy. However, it is recognized that statins may have positive effects on some outcomes in patients with COPD who are receiving statins for cardiovascular and metabolic indications.

With regard to medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically in the context of palliative care, the 2011 Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of acupuncture, acupressure, distractive auditory stimuli (music), relaxation, handheld fans, counseling and support programs, and psychotherapy for patients with advanced COPD.

### Airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation in COPD are linked to an impaired left ventricular diastolic filling [^115Ev56v]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases are thought to be linked through various factors. We aimed to assess the relationship between airway obstruction, lung hyperinflation, and diastolic filling in COPD.

The study population was a subset of the COPD cohort COSYCONET. Echocardiographic parameters included the left atrial diameter (LA), early (E) and late (A) transmitral flow, mitral annulus velocity (e'), E wave deceleration time (E[dt]), and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT). We quantified the effect of various predictors including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) on the echocardiographic parameters by multiple linear regression and integrated the relationships into a path analysis model.

A total of 615 COPD patients were included (mean FEV1 52.6% predicted). In addition to influences of age, BMI and blood pressure, ITGV was positively related to e'-septal and negatively to LA, FEV1 positively to E(dt) (p < 0.05 each). The effect of predictors was most pronounced for LA, e'-septal, and E(dt), and less for E/A, IVRT, and E/e'. Path analysis was used to take into account the additional relationships between the echocardiographic parameters themselves, demonstrating that their associations with the predictors were maintained and robust.

Airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation were significantly associated with cardiac diastolic filling in patients with COPD, suggesting a decreased preload rather than an inherently impaired myocardial relaxation itself.

### Echocardiographic endophenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A step toward personalized medicine [^111wtPfa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are two of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The complexity of these diseases is highlighted by the significant overlap in their patient populations; more than one-third of individuals hospitalized for heart failure exacerbations also have COPD, and the inverse is similarly true. This intersection not only complicates clinical diagnosis but also blurs the lines in management strategies. The echocardiographic findings that characterize both conditions — often with shared markers such as impaired left ventricular (LV) filling — further add to the challenge, potentially leading to mismanagement, prolonged hospital stays, and ultimately poorer patient outcomes.

In recent years, the medical community has turned its attention to phenotypic recognition within these disease frameworks, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment approaches. This is particularly pertinent in the heterogeneous syndrome of HFpEF, in which emerging research highlights previously unrecognized echocardiographic patterns that suggest distinct pathophysiologic subtypes. By identifying these unique phenotypes, researchers are beginning to challenge long-standing assumptions about disease mechanisms, which may open the door to novel drug targets and therapeutic interventions capable of significantly enhancing patient outcomes.

In this issue of the Journal, Abdo and colleagues present an insightful examination of the echocardiographic profiles of 1,752 patients with COPD, drawn from the multi-center study, highlighting key findings and their potential implications for personalized medicine.

### Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Thoracic Society position statement on pulmonary hypertension [^112wuZTY]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to echocardiography, the CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining baseline and follow-up echocardiograms in patients with pulmonary hypertension to measure systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, right atrial size, tricuspid regurgitation severity, and the presence and severity of pericardial effusion. Indices of right ventricular systolic function should be assessed using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, S', or RV index of myocardial performance. In centers with suitable equipment and expertise, free wall strain should be evaluated using 2D speckle tracking.

### Neurohumoral activation as a link to systemic manifestations of chronic lung disease [^117PAD6h]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

COPD is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Treatment of COPD improves lung function but is unlikely to slow the steady downhill course of the disease or reduce mortality. In COPD, numerous abnormalities can be found outside the lung, including systemic inflammation, cachexia, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Thus, COPD has been called a systemic disease. Convincing data demonstrate that COPD causes neurohumoral activation. By precedents derived from chronic heart failure and other diseases characterized by neurohumoral activation, we propose that the negative consequences of neurohumoral activation — namely inflammation, cachexia, effects on ventilation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction — give rise to a self-perpetuating cycle that contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD, which may involve respiratory muscle dysfunction as well as systemic inflammation. This concept may further help explain the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. Currently, little is known about the effect of treatments directed at neurohumoral activation and COPD. As this aspect of COPD becomes better understood, new insights may direct novel therapeutic approaches.

### Right ventricular diastolic function and exercise capacity in COPD [^113RrdpY]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Decreased exercise capacity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is incompletely explained by pulmonary pathologic and physiologic abnormalities. We evaluated the extent to which right ventricular diastolic function (RVDF) is associated with exercise capacity in COPD.

- **Methods**: Fifty-one patients with COPD were evaluated by echocardiography, spirometry, and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). RVDF was assessed using four echocardiographic parameters: 1) the ratio of tricuspid valve (TV) early (E) and late (A) inflow velocities (TV E/A), 2) TV early tissue Doppler velocity (TV e'), 3) TV deceleration time (DT), and 4) the ratio of TV E and e' velocities (TV E/e'). Multiple linear regression was used to examine the extent to which these parameters were associated with 6MWT distance. All models adjusted for age, sex, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC, resting heart rate, and use of supplemental O2 during 6MWT. A regression model was calculated for each of the four markers of RVDF.

- **Results**: Forty-seven percent of the sample had GOLD stage III or IV COPD. All 51 subjects had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, mean = 71.7%, SD = 7.8%). A higher TV E/A ratio was associated with increased 6MWT distance (p = 0.001). TV e', TV DT, and TV E/e' did not have a statistically significant association with 6MWT distance in regression models.

- **Conclusions**: In a cohort with moderate to severe COPD and normal LVEF, TV E/A was associated with 6MWT distance after adjusting for relevant demographic and medical covariates. RV diastolic dysfunction may independently contribute to decreased exercise capacity in COPD.

### Cardiac dysfunction during exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115ueNPt]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease often coexist, and acute cardiac events frequently occur during COPD exacerbations. Even when cardiac complications are not clinically apparent, biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction is often noted during exacerbations and portends a poor prognosis. Diagnosis of cardiac disease in COPD can be difficult and necessitates a high degree of clinical suspicion. However, the additional strain of an exacerbation could be a pivotal moment during which previously unsuspected cardiac dysfunction is exposed.

In this review, we present evidence about cardiac involvement in exacerbations of COPD and discuss diagnostic challenges and treatment opportunities.

### FEV predicts cardiac status and outcome in chronic heart failure [^116SCiQv]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

COPD is an established predictor of clinical outcome in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). However, little evidence is available about the predictive value of FEV₁ in chronic HF.

- **Research question**: Is pulmonary function related to the progression of chronic HF?

- **Study design and methods**: The MyoVasc study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04064450) is a prospective cohort study of HF. Information on pulmonary and cardiac functional and structural status was obtained by body plethysmography and echocardiography. The primary study end point was worsening of HF.

- **Results**: Overall, 2,998 participants (age range, 35–84 years) with available FEV₁ data were eligible for analysis. Linear multivariate regression analysis revealed an independent relationship of FEV₁ (per -1 SD) with deteriorated systolic and diastolic left ventricle (LV) function as well as LV hypertrophy under adjustment of age, sex, height, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and clinical profile (LV ejection fraction: β-estimate, -1.63% [95% CI, -2.00% to -1.26%]; E/E' ratio: β-estimate, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.64–0.99]; and LV mass/height²⋅⁷: β-estimate, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.07–2.10]; *P* < .001 for all). During a median follow-up time of 2.6 years (interquartile range, 1.1–4.1 years), worsening of HF occurred in 235 individuals. In the Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex, height, CVRF, and clinical profile, pulmonary function (FEV₁ per -1 SD) was an independent predictor of worsening of HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.27–1.63]; *P* < .001).

### A research agenda to improve outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116pSYUh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

There is growing recognition of the importance of multimorbidity. This represents a shift in clinical medicine and patient care — treating the whole patient rather than individual diseases in isolation. COPD and cardiovascular diseases are intertwined in many complex ways, including the following:

- **Shared risk factors**: Both COPD and cardiovascular diseases share smoking as a significant risk factor. Smoking activates the same underlying inflammatory pathways (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6, CRP) and aging pathways (such as telomere shortening and cellular senescence) in COPD and cardiovascular disease. Smoking leads to acute inflammation, oxidative stress, protein imbalance, elastin degradation, hypoxia or hypercapnia, endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenicity, atherosclerosis, and arterial stiffness, resulting in direct damage to both lung and heart tissue.

- **Interconnected organs**: The lungs and heart are interconnected anatomically and physiologically, as the pulmonary vasculature is situated between the ventricles, resulting in closely tied structure and function. It is well established that hypoxemia induces vasoconstriction in the arteries in the lung, leading to chronic pulmonary hypertension (type 3) and right heart failure. As the right heart chamber and muscle enlarge, there is ventricular interdependence, leading to the obstruction of left ventricular filling and poor cardiac output. This causes pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary congestion, which worsen respiratory failure. This interconnection between the lung and heart is cyclical and reciprocal.

A more recent example is preliminary evidence showing that certain cardiovascular parameters (such as oxygen) are significant in the management and outcomes of these intertwined diseases.

### Biomarkers of right ventricular-pulmonary coupling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116FY3rD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Stockley and colleagues, authors of the state-of-the-art review on biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are to be commended for identifying the need for a strategic change in approach to COPD biomarkers. It should be highlighted that a concomitant focus on biomarkers of right ventricular (RV)–pulmonary coupling is essential for the comprehensive assessment and management of this systemic disease.

Prognostically significant alterations in RV shape and function have been described across the spectrum of COPD. However, COPD is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and RV–pulmonary interactions are variable. For instance, cor pulmonale is a well-known phenotype of RV dilation and failure in some patients with COPD, whereas cor pulmonale parvus (i.e. lower RV volumes without significant alterations in RV mass and ejection fraction) has been described in contemporary COPD.

Washko and colleagues, in a recent publication in this journal, demonstrated eloquently that COPD subphenotyping using computed tomography measures of distal pulmonary arterial vascular morphology correlated with RV phenotype. Right intraventricular and right and left interventricular dyssynchrony, as assessed by strain echocardiography, have been associated with COPD and have been shown to improve with pulmonary rehabilitation. In patients with COPD and a pulmonary vascular phenotype associated with more severe pulmonary hypertension, biomarkers of RV–pulmonary arterial coupling would be important. The significance and need for bedside biomarkers of RV–pulmonary arterial coupling remain crucial for improving patient outcomes.

### Extrapulmonary effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115FEpfe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although airflow obstruction is the most obvious and most studied manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it should not be overlooked that COPD, particularly in its later stages, is associated with many extrapulmonary features. These contribute to the morbidity, reduced quality of life, and possibly, mortality of this disease. This review examines the literature on skeletal muscle dysfunction, osteoporosis, and weight loss in COPD, with particular attention to possible approaches to their management. Patients with COPD may also experience other extrapulmonary effects, such as hormonal abnormalities, which could potentially be corrected. However, less is known about these effects. Consequently, COPD should be regarded as a systemic disorder, and its systemic manifestations should not be overlooked in the overall care of the patient, as there are significant ways in which they can be addressed.

### Outcomes and markers in the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111CzAHb]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly variable, reflecting the interaction of a complex range of pathological changes, including both pulmonary and systemic effects. The consequences of COPD experienced by the patient (i.e. its outcomes) include symptoms, weight loss, exercise intolerance, exacerbations, health-related quality of life, health resource use, and death. No single measure can reflect the variety of pathological effects or adequately describe the nature or severity of COPD.

Currently, there are few validated markers for assessing COPD and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. The forced expiratory volume in one second has been used as a global marker of COPD, but it does not fully reflect the burden of COPD on patients. New markers are needed to better characterize the full clinical spectrum of the disease and to guide the development and assessment of new and more effective therapies. This article considers the distinction between outcomes and markers, the various ways in which markers are used, and the need for new markers in the management of COPD.

The process of marker selection and validation is reviewed, and potential new biological, physiological, and symptomatic markers for COPD are assessed.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Insights from PARAGON-HF [^116bKMxZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The PARAGON-HF study highlights the significant impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on patients suffering from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Results indicate that patients with both HFpEF and COPD experience worse outcomes, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in this population. Considering these findings could improve patient care and lead to better management strategies for those with coexisting HFpEF and COPD.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in patients with coexistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure [^112sRm8g]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (CHF) are common conditions. The prevalence of COPD ranges from 20% to 30% in patients with CHF. The diagnosis of CHF can remain unsuspected in patients with COPD because shortness of breath is attributed to COPD. Measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels helps to uncover unsuspected CHF in patients with COPD and clinical deterioration. Noninvasive assessment of cardiac function may be preferable to BNP to uncover unsuspected left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with stable COPD.

Patients with COPD or CHF develop skeletal muscle alterations that are strikingly similar. Functional intolerance correlates with severity of skeletal muscle alterations but not with severity of pulmonary or cardiac impairment in COPD and CHF, respectively. Improvement of pulmonary or cardiac function does not translate into relief of functional intolerance in patients with COPD or CHF unless skeletal muscle alterations concomitantly regress.

The mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle alterations are incompletely understood in COPD and in CHF. Disuse and low-level systemic inflammation leading to protein synthesis/degradation imbalance are likely to contribute. The presence of COPD impacts on the treatment of CHF, as COPD is still viewed as a contraindication to beta-blockade. Therefore, COPD often deprives patients with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction of the most beneficial pharmacologic intervention. A large body of data indicates that patients with COPD tolerate well selective beta-blocka.

### Traditional and advanced echocardiographic evaluation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The forgotten relation [^112xaHBW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant preventable and treatable clinical disorder defined by a persistent, typically progressive airflow obstruction. This disease has a substantial negative impact on mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, the complex interaction between the heart and lungs is often underestimated, necessitating more attention to improve clinical outcomes and prognosis. COPD significantly impacts ventricular function, right and left chamber architecture, tricuspid valve functionality, and pulmonary blood vessels. Accordingly, more emphasis should be placed on their diagnosis since cardiac alterations may occur very early before COPD progresses and generates pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Echocardiography enables a quick, noninvasive, portable, and accurate assessment of such changes. Recent advancements in imaging technology have improved the characterization of the heart chambers and made it possible to investigate the association between certain cardiac function indexes and clinical and functional aspects of COPD. This review aims to describe the intricate relation between COPD and heart changes and provides basic and advanced echocardiographic methods to detect early right ventricular and left ventricular morphologic alterations, as well as early systolic and diastolic dysfunction.

In addition, it is crucial to comprehend the clinical and prognostic significance of functional tricuspid regurgitation in COPD and PH, alongside currently available transcatheter therapeutic approaches for its treatment.

### B-type natriuretic peptides in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^113TGHxa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Natriuretic peptides are often increased in patients with COPD, reflecting three complex interwoven aspects of the cardiopulmonary continuum: left heart systolic and diastolic dysfunction; pulmonary vascular and right heart remodelling; and global cardiovascular risk and comorbidities. The additional peptide elevation during exacerbations is likely a marker of both acute strain and varying degrees of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, effectively serving as a stress test and harbinger of future adverse events in some patients. The balance of these pathophysiologic abnormalities within populations is unclear. The goal is to untangle this heterogeneity, identify individuals at greatest risk, and facilitate targeted interventions. Strategies integrating NP with additional variables, biomarkers, and imaging require further investigation.

### Cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in the elderly with impaired cardiac and pulmonary function: The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [^1158iAZm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The causes of heart failure in the elderly are complex, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is just one of them. A prior publication from the Cardiovascular Health Study suggests that subclinical contractile dysfunction and diastolic filling abnormalities are predictors of future heart failure, supporting the importance of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in this cohort. It would have been valuable if we had information on diastolic function. However, given that the echocardiography was performed 20 years ago, many of the diastolic parameters, such as those from tissue Doppler imaging, are not available for this cohort. Therefore, we focused on LVSD, a condition with significant morbidity and mortality risk supported by a large number of clinical as well as epidemiological studies. This provides a valid point of reference for risk estimation, making the relative risk of impaired pulmonary function (IPF) more important and clinically relevant. Given the comparable relative risk of IPF and LVSD for heart failure and mortality, the joint risk of LVSD and IPF would, in fact, be greater if we had data on both systolic and diastolic dysfunction at baseline. Hence, we have likely underestimated the true risk.

Among the elderly with both LVSD and IPF, the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality was increased by about three-fold compared to those without either condition. Nonetheless, the mechanism of added risk of LVSD and IPF is yet to be elucidated. The conventional cardiovascular risk factors are not likely the explanation for the added risk, as their prevalence was comparable among the subgroups. However, pulmonary hypertension was not fully explored in this context.

### Mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction in heart failure [^114YGBwz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Diastolic dysfunction can arise from various causes, including valvular heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and pericardial effusion. Other potential contributing factors are dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Additionally, conditions such as constrictive pericarditis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, and diabetes mellitus have been implicated in its development.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112mVBUQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often coexists with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); however, its impact on cardiovascular structure and function in HFpEF is incompletely understood. We aimed to compare cardiovascular phenotypes in patients with COPD, HFpEF, or both. We studied 159 subjects with COPD alone (n = 48), HFpEF alone (n = 79), and HFpEF + COPD (n = 32). We used MRI and arterial tonometry to assess cardiac structure and function, thoracic aortic stiffness, and measures of body composition.

Relative to participants with COPD only, those with HFpEF with or without COPD exhibited a greater prevalence of female sex and obesity, whereas those with HFpEF + COPD were more often African-American. Compared to the other groups, participants with HFpEF and COPD demonstrated a more concentric left ventricular (LV) geometry (LV wall-cavity ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3; p = 0.003), a greater LV mass (67.4, 95% CI: 60.7–74.2; p = 0.03), and LV extracellular volume (49.4, 95% CI: 40.9–57.9; p = 0.002). Patients with comorbid HFpEF + COPD also exhibited greater thoracic aortic stiffness assessed by pulse-wave velocity (11.3, 95% CI: 8.7–14.0 m/s; p = 0.004) and pulsatile load imposed by the ascending aorta as measured by aortic characteristic impedance (139 dsc; 95% CI = 111–166; p = 0.005).

Participants with HFpEF, with or without COPD, exhibited greater abdominal and pericardial fat, without difference in thoracic skeletal muscle size. In conclusion, individuals with comorbid HFpEF and COPD have a greater degree of systemic large artery stiffening, LV remodeling, and LV fibro.
