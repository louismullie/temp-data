## Question

A 60-year-old man on long-term hydralazine develops arthralgias, pleuritic chest pain, positive ANA, and anti-histone antibodies. Rheumatology documents a primary diagnosis of drug-induced lupus. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing the lupus condition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a case of hydralazine-induced lupus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis and its classification. Then, I should verify the ICD-10-CM coding options within the M32 family and identify the specific subcode for drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus. Next, I will check whether any alternative M32 subcodes would be more appropriate or if there are exclusions to consider. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting information and state the correct code with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. The presentation of arthralgias, pleuritic chest pain, positive ANA, and anti-histone antibodies in the setting of long-term hydralazine use is classic for drug-induced lupus erythematosus, which is a recognized iatrogenic syndrome distinct from idiopathic SLE, typically resolving after withdrawal of the offending agent [^27c0beef] [^110a9ce1].

> Now, I need to verify the ICD-10-CM coding structure. The M32 category covers systemic lupus erythematosus, and within that category, M32.0 is explicitly designated for drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus, which matches this scenario precisely [^4b8d8665].

> Wait, let me verify the subcode alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a better fit. M32.1 denotes SLE with organ or systemic involvement, M32.8 covers other forms of SLE, and M32.9 is SLE unspecified; none of these capture the iatrogenic, drug-related etiology, so they would be inappropriate for drug-induced lupus even though they belong to the broader SLE category [^4b8d8665].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any studies or coding practices exclude M32.0 from SLE cohorts, which might imply a different convention. Several large epidemiologic and claims-based studies explicitly exclude M32.0 when defining SLE cohorts to avoid mixing drug-induced cases with idiopathic SLE, reinforcing that M32.0 is the correct code for drug-induced lupus and that it is treated as a separate category in research definitions [^110a9ce1] [^196700a5] [^aee8f8a3] [^4b8d8665].

> I should double-check that there isn't a different ICD-10-CM code outside M32 that could apply. There is no separate ICD-10-CM code for "drug-induced lupus" outside of M32.0, and authoritative summaries of ICD-10-CM coding for SLE consistently map drug-induced cases to M32.0, confirming that M32.0 is the standard billing code for this diagnosis [^110a9ce1].

> Putting this together, the correct ICD-10-CM code for hydralazine-induced lupus in this patient is M32.0, with the clinical rationale documented to support the drug-induced etiology and the expectation of resolution with drug withdrawal, which aligns with both clinical teaching and coding conventions used in research and practice [^27c0beef] [^110a9ce1] [^196700a5].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for drug-induced lupus from hydralazine is **M32.0** (Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus). This code applies when lupus-like features are temporally linked to a medication and resolve after withdrawal, which fits hydralazine-associated lupus with arthralgias, pleuritic chest pain, positive ANA, and anti-histone antibodies [^27c0beef] [^64f3bf57]. Use **M32.0** for billing and document the causal drug to support medical necessity and accurate coding.

---

## Clinical features of hydralazine-induced lupus

Hydralazine-induced lupus presents with **clinical and serologic features** that mirror idiopathic SLE but are typically milder and resolve after drug withdrawal:

- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Arthralgias and myalgias are common, often accompanied by serositis (pleurisy or pericarditis) [^27c0beef].
- **Laboratory findings**: Positive ANA, particularly anti-histone antibodies, are characteristic of drug-induced lupus [^27c0beef].
- **Renal involvement**: Unlike idiopathic SLE, renal involvement is rare in hydralazine-induced lupus [^49203bcf].
- **Resolution**: Symptoms typically resolve within weeks to months after discontinuation of hydralazine [^64f3bf57].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for drug-induced lupus

The ICD-10-CM code for drug-induced lupus is **M32.0** (Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus). This code is used when lupus-like symptoms are temporally associated with medication use and resolve after withdrawal of the offending drug [^notfound].

---

## Documentation requirements

Accurate coding of drug-induced lupus requires **thorough documentation** of the following:

- **Temporal relationship**: Clear documentation of the onset of symptoms after starting hydralazine.
- **Clinical features**: Documentation of arthralgias, pleuritic chest pain, positive ANA, and anti-histone antibodies.
- **Resolution**: Documentation of symptom improvement after discontinuation of hydralazine.
- **Causative medication**: Explicit mention of hydralazine as the suspected causative agent.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Using the correct ICD-10-CM code (M32.0) for hydralazine-induced lupus has **important clinical implications**:

- **Treatment guidance**: Accurate coding ensures appropriate management, including discontinuation of hydralazine and consideration of alternative antihypertensive therapy.
- **Prognosis**: Drug-induced lupus generally has a favorable prognosis compared to idiopathic SLE, with symptoms resolving after drug withdrawal [^64f3bf57].
- **Research and epidemiology**: Accurate coding contributes to better understanding of drug-induced lupus incidence and outcomes.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The correct ICD-10-CM code for hydralazine-induced lupus is **M32.0** (Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus). Accurate documentation of the temporal relationship, clinical features, and resolution of symptoms after drug withdrawal is essential for proper coding and management. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for drug-induced lupus in patients presenting with lupus-like symptoms while on hydralazine therapy and promptly discontinue the offending agent to facilitate symptom resolution [^27c0beef].

### Prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics and spatial distribution of systemic lupus erythematosus in France: a nationwide study using health claims data with insights into hydroxychloroquine prescription patterns [^fbb03617]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Also, it is reassuring that a large proportion of identified patients with SLE were treated with hydroxychloroquine, which might constitute an external validity criterion for case identification. As discussed above, 74.9% of all patients with SLE and even 86.7% of those within the 20–24 age class had received a prescription of hydroxychloroquine. The latter percentage might be a reasonable guide to our algorithm's specificity.

Due to the large proportion (60.5%) of SLE cases identified only through ICD-10 coding at 3-digit level, all M32 codes (including M32.0 for drug-induced lupus) were pooled for the identification of inpatients with SLE. Drug-induced lupus is usually distinguished from classic SLE because rapid recovery usually follows the discontinuation of the offending drug. However, drug-induced lupus accounted for only a small proportion (2.6%) of the inpatients in our study, and their exclusion from the analysis did not significantly change our prevalence estimates (the distribution of the various SLE codes is shown in online supplemental table 1).

In contrast, it is also possible that we may have underestimated the prevalence of SLE. Indeed, people with mild cases of SLE treated on an outpatient basis might not warrant (or might not have requested) LTD status. An ICD-10 code is only attributed to inpatients or outpatients with LTD status.

The present study's strengths included its analysis of data on almost all of the 67 million people residing in France in 2020 and the computation of prevalence values as a function of the country's main demographic and territorial characteristics, using the same identification algorithms.

### Rural-urban disparities in hospitalisation for myocardial infarction in systemic lupus erythematosus in the USA [^110a9ce1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and the study population

Our analysis used the 2016–2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to determine all patients hospitalised with lupus. The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient database in the USA. It covers 97% of the US population, containing a 20% stratified sample of all discharges from US community hospitals, excluding rehabilitation and long-term acute care hospitals in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The NIS provides de-identified information on hospitalisations, including patient demographics, admission status, discharge diagnoses, procedures, outcomes and hospital charges. To maintain the coding system consistency, we limited our study to 2016 onwards, since the US healthcare system and the NIS switched from International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 to ICD-10 coding in the third quarter of 2015. The 2020 NIS represented a COVID-impacted year, so we excluded 2020 as well, limiting our analysis from 2016 to 2019. We identified all patients over the age of 18 with a diagnosis of SLE, using the ICD-10-CM Code M32* in any position, after excluding ICD-10 M32.0 (Drug-Induced SLE).

Predictor of interest: rural versus urban residence

Rural versus urban residence was defined using the PL_NCHS variable in the NIS, which is a six-category urban–rural classification scheme for US counties developed by the National Center for Health Statistics, especially for use in healthcare research. Rural residence was defined as the last two levels of the variable, level 5 = micropolitan counties or level 6 = not metropolitan or micropolitan counties; urban residence was defined as the top four levels consisting of counties in the metro area with populations 50 000 to ≥ 1 million. This variable is a validated variable that has been used in population-based studies. While this label may sound like hospital location/teaching status variable, patient rural/urban status represents the location the patient lives, regardless of the designation of the hospital.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Comorbidity and healthcare utilisation in persons with incident systemic lupus erythematosus followed for 3 years after diagnosis: analysis of a claims data cohort [^196700a5]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Definition of SLE diagnosis in claims data

A cohort of persons with incident SLE diagnosis was created using data from a large nationwide statutory health insurance fund (BARMER). In Germany, around 90% of the population are insured in one of the statutory health insurance companies. The other 10% are insured in private health insurance companies. The BARMER data cover around 11% of the German population from all areas of Germany and are representative of the German population in terms of socioeconomic status. There are more women older than 50 than in the general population and less men younger than 50. Insurance fees between the different German statutory health insurances differ only marginally.

Individuals aged ≥ 18 years were identified based on SLE diagnosis (M32.1: SLE with organ or systemic involvement; M32.8: other forms of SLE; M32.9: SLE, unspecified), according to the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). To identify incident cases, two outpatient or one inpatient diagnosis was required to be present in 2016, 2017 and 2018 but not in the 2 previous years (2014 and 2015). This cohort was analysed in the year prior to diagnosis (2015), the index year (2016) and for 2 consecutive years (2017 and 2018). Persons with SLE diagnoses recorded in 2014 and 2015 and persons who were not continuously insured from 2014 to 2018 or did not have an SLE diagnosis in at least two quarters in 2017 and/or 2018 were excluded (see flow chart in figure 1). Persons with drug-induced SLE (M32.0; n = 83 in 2016) were also excluded from the analysis. To reduce misclassification related to sporadic diagnoses, we selected a stricter requirement of at least two ICD-10 diagnoses in each of the years from 2016 until 2018 than usually performed.

Flow chart.

We performed a sensitivity analysis of the diagnosis validation. We further analysed the accuracy of identifying patients with SLE in the claims database following the validation algorithm of Schwarting et al, which includes primary diagnosis in hospital, outpatient diagnosis by a specialised physician, performance of laboratory ANA tests, antimalarial or immunosuppressive medication, or organ involvement in any of the years 2016, 2017 or 2018.

Introduction: Data is lacking regarding modern real-world practices and disease outcomes of individuals with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) and lupus nephritis, especially across multiple centers. However, researchers also lack approaches to identify end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with cSLE utilizing claims-based algorithms.

Objectives: To determine optimal definitions that can be used to identify patients with cSLE, lupus nephritis, and ESKD using a large, real-world administrative claims database.

Methods: We utilized administrative claims data from IBM MarketScan Commercial and 8-State Medicaid Databases from 2006–2020. We adapted previously validated definitions to identify patients with cSLE: 1) ≥ 3 ambulatory or inpatient claims with ICD-9 code 710.0 or ICD-10-CM code M32.* (excluding M32.0 for drug-induced lupus) with at least 30 days between each code; 2) codes restricted to provider type pediatric rheumatology, rheumatology, pediatric nephrology, nephrology, dermatology, or acute care hospital; and 3) age ≥ 5 and < 18 years at the time of the first SLE code. To define incident diagnoses, we selected patients with: 1) at least 182 days between insurance enrollment and the first SLE code; and 2) no evidence of prior anti-malarial or immunosuppressive use more than 182 days before the first SLE code. We then adapted previously validated definitions to select the subgroup of cSLE patients with evidence of lupus nephritis using ≥ 2 ambulatory or inpatient claims with ICD-9 codes 580.*-586.*, 791.0 or ICD-10-CM codes M32.14, M32.15 with at least 30 days between each code. Finally, we defined presence of ESKD using: 1) procedure and diagnosis codes for dialysis from any encounter; 2) procedure and diagnosis codes for kidney transplant from any encounter; or 3) ≥ 3 claims with diagnosis codes for ESKD from any encounter type. We considered each ESKD criteria separately and as a composite if any of the 3 criteria were met. We calculated the frequency of patients meeting each of these criteria.

### Hospitalisation for systemic lupus erythematosus associates with an increased risk of mortality in Australian patients from 1980 to 2014: a longitudinal, population-level, data linkage, cohort study [^0b273131]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This whole-of-population cohort study used data linked by the Western Australian Data Linkage System, which uses probabilistic matching (99.7% accuracy) to identify individuals across administrative health datasets. The Western Australian Rheumatic Disease Epidemiological Registry (WARDER) includes all private and public hospital separations (emergency department presentations, inpatient episodes, including same-day interventions and admissions, as well as cancer notifications and death notifications) statewide for over 200 000 patients with rheumatic disease conditions and another 200 000 non-exposed general population comparators (free from the conditions defined in online supplemental table 1). The WARDER comprises information linked from the Hospital Morbidity Data Collection (HMDC, from 1970), WA Cancer Registry (from 1982) and the Death Register (from 1969) and the Emergency Department Data Collection (from 2002). Since the 1970s, the HMDC has recorded the primary and (up to 20) co-diagnoses and the primary and (up to 10) secondary procedure codes for each hospital-level in-patient separation using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) 9th, ICD 10th revisionor the Australian Classification of Health Interventions codes. The linkage of the WARDER dataset was done on 1 February 2017.

Within participants of the WARDER, aged 0–80 years, hospitalisations for SLE were identified in the HMDC between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2013 by ICD-9-CM: 695.4 and 710.0, and ICD-10-AM: M32.0, M32.1, M32.8, M32.9, L93.0, L93.1 and L93.2. In 2013, Ward reported that administrative data were valid in the identification of rare diseases and suitable for producing epidemiological estimates. In addition, in administrative or claims data, having at least one ICD-9-CM code of SLE (ICD-9: 694.4 and 710) had a positive predictive value of 70%–96%. Internationally, 89% to 93% of patients with SLE meeting classification criteria are hospitalised during their disease course. Given that the HMDC captures same-day drug infusions (although not the specific drug types) and procedures, at a minimum our cohort would represent patients with SLE with moderate-to-severe disease.

### Real-world oral glucocorticoid use in SLE: a nation-wide population-based study using the French medico-administrative (SNDS) claim database [^4b8d8665]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with SLE

Patients with SLE were identified in the SNDS database by at least one of the following criteria: (1) a LTD recorded for the ICD-10 code M32 and/or (2) at least one hospitalisation identified between 2008 and 2019 with the following three-digit ICD-10 codes as a primary or a secondary diagnosis: M32.1 (SLE with organ or system involvement), M32.8 (other forms of SLE) and M32.9 (SLE, unspecified).

The following patients were secondarily excluded from the selected population: (1) patients with a drug-induced SLE (ICD-10 code M32.0) identified as a cause for LTD and/or recorded during at least one acute care hospitalisation between 2008 and 2019, (2) patients identified only through an ICD-10 code during a hospital stay and presenting with another systemic autoimmune disease identified as a cause for LTD and/or recorded during at least one acute care hospitalisation between 2008 and 2019 (inflammatory polyarthropathies (ICD-10 codes M05–M14) or systemic connective tissue disorders, except Sicca syndrome (Sjögren) (ICD-10 codes: M30, M31, M32.0, M33, M34 and M36)) or patients deceased before 1 January 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics included gender and age on 1 January 2020. The date of SLE diagnosis was defined as the date of the first record of SLE as a hospital primary or associated diagnosis or as the date of initiation of the SLE LTD status, whichever occurred first. Specific additional coverage for subjects with a low income was used as a proxy for a low socioeconomic status (CMU-c).

### Risks of mortality and severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outcomes in patients with or without systemic lupus erythematosus [^742dce8c]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

We queried the Optum deidentified COVID-19 electronic health record (EHR) data set to conduct this study. This includes data from more than 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics across the USA with data specific to patients who were tested for COVID-19 in both inpatient and ambulatory settings. Available data include demographic variables, diagnostic/procedure codes, prescription claims, hospitalisations and mortality. We followed The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

Cohort selection

We identified all patients ≥ 18 years of age who were tested for COVID-19 by International Classification of Diseases (ICD, both ICD-9 and ICD-10) diagnosis codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding system codes (HCPCS), Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes and laboratory test name with a subsequent positive result from either PCR, antigen test or serological confirmation (online supplemental table A1). We used the earliest specimen collection, test or result data as our COVID-19 diagnosis (index) date. We included patients who had a positive result or diagnostic code (whichever was earliest) for COVID-19 between 1/1/2020 and 31/12/2020 to capture outcomes prior to the COVID-19 vaccinations being widely available.

For our SLE cohort, we included patients who had two SLE claims (ICD-10 M32.x (excluding M32.0)) within 1 year before COVID-19 diagnosis and had a prescription or a HCPCS claim of a SLE drug (steroids, biologics, immunosuppressants or antimalarials) within 1 year before or 1 year after the lupus diagnosis date and before the COVID-19 diagnosis date. Our general cohort excluded patients who had one or more claims of SLE within 1 year before the COVID-19 diagnosis.

We exactly matched controls with patients with SLE 10 to 1 by age, sex, race and ethnicity and COVID-19 diagnosis month.

Outcomes

Outcomes included all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospitalisation and ICU stays excluding ventilation within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. We identified the outcomes using HCPCS or ICD-10 procedure codes and other definitions (online supplemental table A1). All-cause mortality was assessed from health electronic records and the Social Security Administration Death Master File.

### Development and evaluation of a register-based organ damage index in systemic lupus erythematosus: a nationwide, population-based study from Sweden [^a24659d4]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Construction of RBODI

We used information on clinical outpatient or inpatient diagnoses and procedures from the National Patient Register, as well as dispensed medications from the Prescribed Drug Register to estimate organ damage accrual, by leveraging register-based codes from healthcare interactions into SDI items. These different systems allowed us to use medical diagnoses (ICD-10), medical and surgical procedures (retrieved from KVÅ and DRG codes, respectively) and dispensed medications (ATC) to identify SDI items. Considering that these codes are provided by practitioners from all specialties, we developed the translation in collaboration with physicians from the cardiology, gastroenterology, internal medicine, neurology, ophthalmology, pulmonology, psychiatry and rheumatology departments, including several physicians experienced in the care of patients with SLE. Several diagnoses included as SDI items have been previously validated in Sweden; in these instances, the validated definitions were adopted (references appended in online supplemental table S1). For diagnoses lacking prior validation, expert opinion guided the formulation of the definitions. We followed the principles in the SDI scoring system, using the same weighting system, and scored damage occurring since SLE diagnosis by requiring each RBODI item to occur since the date of the first SLE-coded visit for every individual. We incorporated the 6-month criterion by either using codes indicative of chronicity (eg, N18.5: chronic kidney disease, stage 5), or requiring the presence of two or more codes with a minimum interval of 6 months between registrations (eg, L97: ulcer of lower limb, not elsewhere classified). As repeated administrative codes for the same diagnosis do not necessarily reflect repeated episodes for such diagnosis, we refrained from scoring repeated SDI items, except for myocardial infarction (ICD-10 code I22: subsequent myocardial infarction).

### Persistence of the "hydralazine syndrome"… [^3926e56e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The prolonged administration of hydralazine hydrochloride, an antipressor drug, has been found capable of inducing a syndrome that resembles rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. In the past it was assumed that, when administration of the drug was discontinued, the "hydralazine syndrome" would disappear permanently. The follow-up study of 11 cases here reported showed that some of the symptoms and findings persisted for years after administration of the drug had been stopped. In four patients the increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate persisted longer than three years; in two it was associated with continued rheumatic pain, and in the other two it was associated with an unchanging hepatosplenomegaly.

### Real-world treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilisation and costs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with belimumab: a retrospective analysis of claims data in the USA [^245c5e86]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample selection

Selected patients were 18–64 years of age on the index date, with ≥ 1 inpatient claim or outpatient claim with a diagnosis of SLE (ICD-9-CM: 710.0; ICD-10-CM: M32) from 1 September 2010 to 31 December 2015, and evidence of intravenous belimumab treatment from 9 March 2011 to 31 December 2015 (belimumab received Food and Drug Administration approval in March 2011). Where possible, belimumab was identified using product-specific NDC and HCPCS codes. As belimumab was not issued product-specific HCPCS codes until 1 July 2011, this study also relied on an algorithm to identify belimumab administration from 9 March 2011 to 1 July 2011 (online supplementary table 1).

Evidence of belimumab treatment included an outpatient prescription claim with an NDC for belimumab (NDC 49401-101-01, 49401-102-01) from 9 March 2011 to 31 December 2015; an outpatient medical claim with an HCPCS code for belimumab (HCPCS Q2044, J0490) from 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2015; or an outpatient medical claim with a CPT code for monoclonal antibody/chemotherapy administration from 9 March 2011 to 1 July 2011. To ensure that the CPT code was for the administration of belimumab and not the administration of a different agent, the patient must also have had an inpatient or outpatient claim for a diagnosis of SLE and no inpatient or outpatient claim for a diagnosis of cancer and no outpatient claim containing an HCPCS code for rituximab administration (HCPCS J9310) on the same date. Participants were required to have ≥ 6 months of continuous enrolment with medical and prescription drug coverage prior to the index date (preindex period) and ≥ 3 months of continuous enrolment with medical and prescription drug coverage following the index date.

As per US prescribing information, belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis. Therefore, this analysis excluded patients with evidence of severe active lupus nephritis during the study period (online supplementary information: sample selection; and online supplementary tables 1 and 2) This was defined by a previously validated billing code algorithm.

### Drug-specific risk and characteristics of lupus and vasculitis-like events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNFi: results from BSRBR-RA [^1a08172a]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Case definition and verification of AEs

We used all relevant MedDRA codes and free text searches within the AE reported fields (see online supplementary table S4) to identify potential cases. All possible reported events of either LLE or VLE were reviewed in detail using information provided to the register. The types of LLE events described in previous literature from France, USA and Spain have been heterogeneous ranging from dsDNA-positive patients with cutaneous lupus to fewer 'full blown' lupus meeting ACR classification criteria. It has been argued that LLE associated with TNFi therapy is a distinct syndrome compared to SLE. Since classification criteria for drug-induced lupus does not currently exist, the Dubois' guidelines for drug-induced lupus were usedto provide a more sensitive definition. The full guidelines are outlined in online supplementary table S1. Briefly, this includes continuous treatment with a lupus-inducing drug for ≥ 1 month, common or multisystem presenting symptoms consistent with lupus, laboratory profile consistent with lupus and improvement of symptoms following drug cessation. Patients were classified as having an LLE if clinically identified as such and ≥ 2 criteria were met. Following verification (performed by MJ), LLE cases were additionally classified according to standard SLE classification criteria (1997 ACRand 2012 SLICC criteria) for descriptive purposes only. A single set of classification criteria could not be applied due to the heterogeneous characteristics of vasculitis events, ranging from cutaneous to multisystem manifestations. Therefore, such reports were flagged as such by the reporting physician; verification was performed clinically following additional requests for clinical information where necessary.

Statistical analysis

Patients with a physician diagnosis of RA, who had at least one clinician-completed follow-up form by 31 May 2015, were included. The primary outcome was the first verified LLE or first verified VLE per participant following the start of TNFi drug (or registration for the nbDMARD cohort). For the LLE analysis, patients with known SLE overlap recorded at baseline were excluded. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had known systemic vasculitis at baseline. Events were attributed to TNFi if they occurred when the patient was receiving TNFi or within 90 days of the first missed dose. Follow-up time was censored at event of interest, death, drug stop date (plus 90 days) or last physician follow-up, whichever came first. Only time on a first TNFi was included to best attribute any drug-specific risk. In the nbDMARD cohort, follow-up time was censored if the patient switched to a biological drug.

### Association of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug selection with hospitalised infection among youth with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^2a756177]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure and outcome definitions

The primary exposure was the first DMARD received for cSLE after initial diagnosis other than hydroxychloroquine (ie, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine or methotrexate). These DMARDs were selected based on their inclusion in treatment guidelines for LN induction therapy (cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil), and non-renal lupus (mycophenolate, azathioprine and methotrexate), as well as data showing that these were the most commonly used DMARDs for cSLE. Dates of initiation and discontinuation were extracted manually by chart review to include both hospital-administered and outpatient prescription doses. The observation period was truncated at 1 year or discontinuation of the first DMARD received.

Our primary outcome was occurrence of a hospitalised infection within 1 year of starting first DMARD for cSLE. Infections occurring during the initial hospitalisation for cSLE diagnosis were excluded. Hospitalised infections were defined by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for infection using PHIS data. As previously published, a list of codes for serious infection was generated via literature review and based on clinical experience, and then reviewed to remove any codes that could overlap with non-infectious SLE manifestations (ie, pyuria, fever), were unlikely to be severe enough to be the reason for hospitalisation or described postinfectious complications rather than an acute infection. For infections classified as bacterial, receiving an antibiotic during the same hospital encounter as recorded in PHIS was also required.

### Validating claims-based algorithms for a systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis in Medicare data for informed use of the lupus index: a tool for geospatial research [^42d24b6a]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we describe the performance of different ICD-10-based algorithms for classifying SLE and LN in a well-described South Carolina Medicare cohort to mimic the performance that might be expected in the national Lupus Index Medicare population. As expected, we report that more ICD codes increased specificity while reducing the sensitivity for classification of SLE. We also demonstrate that a single LN code does not maximise sensitivity but provides robust specificity.

Other studies have described the performance of ICD-9 and ICD-10 algorithms for SLE and LN classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use ICD-10 code algorithms alone to classify Medicare patients with SLE and LN in the rheumatology office setting. Barnado et al evaluated algorithms using both ICD-9 codes and either laboratory testing (positive ANA) or medication (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) ever use) variables. In this study, a similar algorithm of two ICD-9 codes resulted in a validated PPV of 65% with a sensitivity of 86%. Addition of positive ANA testing and DMARD ever use and exclusion of diagnosis codes for systemic sclerosis or dermatomyositis improved the PPV to 91% in a validation cohort. This type of algorithm provides superior PPV at the expense of sensitivity. It also requires laboratory and medication data that are not available in the Lupus Index. In addition, the use of medications or lab tests in the algorithm may result in a cohort that excludes patients with disease who are receiving either lower quality care or have less access to subspecialty care, limiting the ability to conduct health disparities research.

### Association between drug use and subsequent diagnosis of lupus erythematosus [^5e8e8af3]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

It has been estimated that up to 30% of all subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) cases and up to 15% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases are drug induced. Based on numerous case reports and several epidemiologic studies, more than 100 drugs from more than 10 drug classes are suspected to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus.

Objective

To examine the association between drug use and a subsequent diagnosis of CLE or SLE based on a systematic screening process of the drugs in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system in a nationwide setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A matched case-control study was conducted using all incident cases of CLE and SLE registered in the Danish National Patient Register between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2017. Patients with CLE and patients with SLE were matched (1:10) on age and sex, with individuals from the general population serving as controls.

Exposures

To select which drugs to examine for an association with CLE or SLE, a screening process of all drugs was performed, including drugs filled at pharmacies and drugs administered in hospitals.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the association between exposures to certain drugs and the subsequent diagnosis of CLE or SLE.

Results

In all, 3148 patients with CLE (n = 1298; 1022 women [78.7%]; median age at diagnosis, 50.5 years [interquartile range, 39.4–62.2 years]) or SLE (n = 1850; 1537 women [83.1%]; median age at diagnosis, 45.0 years [interquartile range, 33.6–56.4 years]) and 31 480 controls (25 590 women [81.3%]; median age, 47.5 years [interquartile range, 35.9–59.5 years]) were found. Many significant associations between drug use and a subsequent diagnosis of CLE and SLE were observed. Many associations were likely due to protopathic bias. However, new plausible causal associations were observed between CLE or SLE and some drugs, including fexofenadine hydrochloride (SLE: OR, 2.61 [95% CI, 1.80–3.80]; CLE: OR, 5.05 [95% CI, 3.51–7.26]), levothyroxine sodium (SLE: OR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.97–3.07]; CLE: OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.96–1.75]), metoclopramide hydrochloride (SLE: OR, 3.38 [95% CI, 2.47–4.64]; CLE: OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.85–2.54]), and metronidazole hydrochloride (SLE: OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.09–2.27]; CLE: OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.25–2.97]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study's findings suggest that physicians should be cognizant about whether a new case of CLE or SLE could be drug induced. Furthermore, the results highlight that the reported associations in the published literature may be due to publication or protopathic bias.

Study design and patient selection

Eligible patients from the linked IBM MarketScan and GE EMR dataset were adults ≥ 18 years old with evidence of newly diagnosed SLE from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014 (selection window). The first observed SLE diagnosis during the selection window was characterised as the index date. A confirmed SLE diagnosis was defined as having ≥ 1 inpatient SLE diagnosis or ≥ 2 outpatient SLE diagnosis codes (including index diagnosis) that were ≥ 60 days apart (ICD-9-CM: 710.0x, ICD-10-CM: M32.9) in EMR records or claims in any position; and record of prescribed SLE-related medications within 6 months before and after the index date. Patients were further required to have continuous enrolment in a health plan for at least 12 months before index (baseline period) and 12 months after index (post-diagnosis or follow-up period). Patients with an SLE or lupus nephritis diagnosis during the 12 months prior to index and patients with incomplete or missing data in the linked dataset were excluded.

Figure 1 provides details of the study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and attrition of the study population.

### Proton pump inhibitor-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^a418ba49]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In total 727 medical records were scrutinized and 429 patients were confirmed with CLE. In 121 patients a drug was potentially inducing or aggravating lupus erythematosus, and 24 patients with a definite, probable or possible causal relationship between prescribed PPIs and CLE were identified (Fig. 1). A report of five of these patients was published in 2008, and they were therefore not included in this study. The 19 patients represented cases of de novo PPI-induced SCLE, PPI-induced SCLE in patients with a previous history of CLE, and PPI-induced SCLE in patients with coexisting systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PPI-induced SCLE with targetoid lesions was also seen. The patient data are presented in Table 1, with cases listed in order of ADR probability score, with the highest probability score at the top.

### Drug-induced rheumatic syndromes [^64f3bf57]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Rheumatic syndromes related to drug therapies have been described for decades. The introduction of many new therapeutic agents in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in such reported associations. By definition, drug-induced syndromes are temporally related to starting a drug, and the symptoms and signs generally regress with its discontinuation. The classic and still most common cases resemble systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Some newer agents appear related to myositis or vasculitis. The origins of most of these syndromes remain obscure.

### Hospitalised infections and rituximab administration among children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus from 2009 to 2021 [^8b03068c]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Children and adolescents ages 2–21 years with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 or ICD-10 code for SLE (710.0, M32*) and who received at least one dose of rituximab during admission to a Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS)-participating hospital from 2009 to 2021 were included. PHIS is a national administrative database with in-hospital billing data from over 50 free-standing children's hospitals in the USA. These data include patient demographic data obtained from hospitals using standardised categories and payor types, discharge diagnosis codes, charges for intensive care unit (ICU) level of care (ICU 'Flag') and pharmacy administration data for drugs received during an inpatient or observation hospitalisation encounter.

Lupus organ involvement and disease severity were assessed using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for lupus nephritis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), seizure, stroke and pulmonary haemorrhage at any time prior to first rituximab dose, and ICU admission during index hospitalisation for first rituximab dose. Infections were defined by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes during an inpatient or observation encounter and were based on review of the literature. Codes that may have represented a manifestation of lupus itself (eg, undifferentiated fever) or were likely to represent a non-serious infection incidentally coded during hospitalisation for another indication were removed. Final codes included in the infection definition are listed in online supplemental table 1. In addition to a serious infection code, antibiotic use during the hospitalisation was also required for bacterial infections.

### Immunosuppressant use and hospitalisations in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus admitted to a tertiary academic medical centre [^a5cfd00b]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Data source and population

Data were derived from a comprehensive chart review of all SLE hospitalisations at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Medical Center in 2005 and 2013. The UCSD Medical Center is an academic training centre that offers primary through tertiary medical care to a wide spectrum of socioeconomic and ethnic/racial groups. San Diego County serves as its primary referral base. According to the US Census Bureau, the population of San Diego County was approximately 2.8 million in 2005and 3.2 million in 2013. The medical centre's ambulatory care offices served an estimated cohort of 490 patients with SLE.

Patients with SLE were identified by querying the UCSD hospitalisation databases for records containing one or more billing codes for SLE (710.0 of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9-CM). For the year 2005, billing codes were available through an inpatient electronic database, and physician notes and other clinical variables were available through paper charts; after 2010, UCSD adopted the electronic medical record system EPIC, so data were derived from queries and review of comprehensive electronic health records. The medical centre maintains historical data to monitor all cause hospitalisation rates and patient insurance use.

The year 2013 was chosen as the end date of the study so that ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes would be used at both time points. During our project planning stages, ICD-10-CM implementation was planned to be required by 1 October 2014 (this was later delayed by lawmakers to 1 October 2015). Patients who were identified by a treating rheumatologist as not meeting at least 4 of the 11 diagnostic criteria for the 1997 update of the 1982 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Revised Criteria for Classification of SLE were excluded, as were patients less than age 18.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes for the analyses were (1) all-cause hospitalisations, derived from the hospital electronic database; (2) in-hospital mortality, derived from chart review; and (3) prescription information, derived from chart review.

### Identification and assessment of classification criteria attributes for systemic lupus erythematosus in a regional medical record data network [^5a40a557]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Healthcare utilisation

The total number of emergency room, inpatient and outpatient visits was extracted for each patient at participating sites over the study period.

Classification of SLE features

Each of the three classification criteria used in this study has specific conditions that need to be met to classify an individual with SLE. The 1997 ACR criteria definition requires that an individual displays four or more total positive criteria. The 2012 SLICC has two pathways by which someone may be classified as having SLE. The first requires that the patient is identified with four or more total criteria with at least one positive criterion derived from two general domains. The first domain consists of clinical manifestations and the second of laboratory procedures known to be associated with SLE. The second pathway includes individuals with a positive antinuclear antibody and SLE nephritis confirmed by renal biopsy. We excluded the second pathway for SLICC algorithm classification in this work given that we were unable to obtain pathology narratives from CAPriCORN. Finally, the 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria set defines SLE with an entry requirement of a positive ANA and a subsequent point-based system, where each criterion contributes points to a patient's total score. Any patient with a positive ANA and a score of 10 or more is considered SLE. A summary of the individual criteria included in each set is included in online supplemental table 1.

EHR implementation of classification criteria sets

The identification of individual attributes and classification of SLE by each criteria set were previously translated into EHR data by expert identification of structured data elements representing diagnosis codes, laboratory measurements, procedures and medication orders related to criteria domains. Many of these domains also include exclusion conditions to maximise the possibility of identifying a domain that is attributable to SLE and likely contributed to the high specificity observed when implemented at a single site. For example, an inclusion condition for the EHR implementation of the leucopenia domain — a component of the 2012 SLICC criteria — is a blood lymphocyte count below 1.5 K/µL. However, one exclusion condition is a diagnosis of drug-induced neutropenia, which would indicate an instance of leucopenia attributed to a cause other than SLE. Our previous work reporting on the single-site implementation of these algorithms describes a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion conditions for each criteria domain.

Care fragmentation

Care fragmentation was defined as having one or more encounters of any kind at two or more institutions within CAPriCORN during the study period. We were able to identify patients with care fragmentation in the dataset due to the privacy-preserving record linkage hashing algorithm that links patients across sites.

### Immunosuppressant use and hospitalisations in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus admitted to a tertiary academic medical centre [^fb251b8e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 183 hospitalisations in individuals with SLE in 2005 and 87 hospitalisations in 2013 (figure 1). Five patients in 2005 and one patient in 2013 had an ICD-9-CM code for SLE but did not fulfil the ACR criteria; most of these patients were subsequently diagnosed with a different autoimmune condition and all were excluded from the analysis. The final sample included 178 hospitalisations in individuals with SLE in 2005 and 86 hospitalisations in 2013. Patient characteristics are listed in table 1.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of patient chart identification. ICD-9-CM, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification.

Table 1
Characteristics of hospitalised individuals with SLE in 2005 and 2013

All-cause hospitalisations at our institution rose over the 9 years from 21 333 in 2005 to 25 999 in 2013. SLE admissions accounted for 0.83% of total admissions in 2005 as compared with 0.33% of total admissions in 2013. The average age of all admitted patients to UCSD in 2013 was 52 years. The percentage of admitted patients at UCSD in California's Medicaid programme was 28.3% in both 2005 and 2013.

Seven patients (7.6% of patients with SLE and 3.9% of SLE admissions) died during their hospitalisation in 2005. Four of the seven deaths were due to overwhelming infection. The other deaths were due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, cancer and a gastrointestinal bleed. The mean and median ages of deceased patients were 44 and 48, respectively. No patients died in 2013. Of the 261 admissions between 2010 and 2013, six admissions resulted in death, leading to a mortality rate of 2.3% of SLE admissions.

Corticosteroid use decreased over the measured time period (table 2). Hydroxychloroquine use increased. Within the cohort of patients admitted with infections, the percentage of oral glucocorticoid use dropped from 2005 to 2013 (70% to 55%) while the percentage of hydroxychloroquine (23% to 59%) and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (5.5% to 15%) use more than doubled. Similarly, within the cohort of patients admitted for non-infectious illness, oral glucocorticoid use decreased from 2005 to 2013 (62% to 46%) while hydroxychloroquine (30% to 51%)%) and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (3.6% to 12%) use increased.

### Higher mortality risk from gynaecological neoplasms and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: an observational study from the Spanish national registry [^1ee1b524]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population

We selected hospital admissions, from 2016 to 2019, for patients with a diagnosis within the ICD-10, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code M32 (SLE) at any position in the diagnostic list. Patients who presented drug-related SLE (ICD-10 code M32.0), or secondary Sjögren's syndrome (ICD-10 code M35.0), were excluded since both conditions might impact the neoplasm-related risk in the population with SLE.

In parallel, all the in-hospital deaths attributable to neoplasms (from ICD-10-CM code C.00 to D.49) in the same period were retrieved from the SNHDD, and were used as the control group to compare with the patients with SLE. Neoplasm-related deaths were classified as follows: malign neoplasms, including solid organ malign neoplasms (C00-C80), haematological malign neoplasms (C81-C96), in situ neoplasms (D00-D09), benign solid organ neoplasms (SON) (D10–D36 and D3A) and unknown or non-specified behaviour neoplasms (D37–D49), in turn also including SON and haematological neoplasms (HN). Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), based on their worse prognosis and mortality rate, were considered malign HN. Finally, the main SON and HN lineages, and subsequent subclassifications, such as gastrointestinal, lung, breast, gynaecological, urological, together with lymphoma, leukaemia or MDS, among others, were considered and analysed separately.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages while continuous variables were presented as mean and SD. The significance of differences between the two groups was determined by the χ² test or Student's t-test, as appropriate. To determine the impact of SLE on the risk of dying from each neoplasm group and lineage, we performed a binary logistic regression analysis, considering age of female sex, tobacco and alcohol consumption (according to ICD-10 CM codes F17 or Z72.0 and F10, K70 or I42.6, respectively) for each neoplasm group and lineage. For all the analyses, a significance level of 0.05 was set. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS V.26.0 (IBM, Spain).

### Epidemiology of patients with moderate-to-severe SLE in Sweden [^3574159a]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A major differentiating factor with our study was the use of nationwide registers to attempt to identify moderate-to-severe SLE patients in Sweden over time. Few register studies have reported survival by disease severity. While it has been previously demonstrated that patients with SLE have poorer survival than population comparators retrieved from healthcare registers, these results indicate that most of the burden of poorer survival is in patients with moderate-to-severe disease, supporting previous research indicating that higher disease activity is associated with mortality. The definition of disease severity included ICD-10 codes for comorbidities that were a priori determined to be associated with severe SLE, which themselves may be associated with an increased mortality risk. Despite this, the risk of potential bias in the study findings is considered to be low as this study aims to describe the survival in SLE patients by their clinical presentation of severity and not to determine the specific causes of mortality. Therefore, any excess in the prevalence of these diagnoses in SLE patients compared with the comparator population further highlights the burden of SLE on mortality. It is also of note that the classification of severity of comorbidities is based on expert estimations in a previous study, and we have not evaluated the impact of different classifications for these diagnoses. The disease severity algorithm is also somewhat informed by treatments received; however, due to a lack of available data on hospital medications, assumptions were made on treatments given in the hospital setting. For example, patients receiving intravenous administration of a drug during a secondary care visit for SLE are assumed to have severe disease, assuming this would be rituximab, cyclophosphamide or biological treatments more commonly given for severe disease, though the data set used does not explicitly allow for this to be evaluated. There is therefore the risk of some misclassification. For example, a patient with higher disease activity treated with a subcutaneously injected medicine and with only low dose glucocorticoids and/or hydroxychloroquine may be classified as having mild disease if no other moderate or severe criteria are present, or if a drug for a non-SLE related condition is administered intravenously during a secondary care visit for SLE, then these patients would be classified as severe. The usage of procedure codes to record drug administration in Sweden has also not been evaluated, and therefore the number of severe cases may have been underestimated. While the algorithms were evaluated by the authors for their applicability to the Swedish setting, it must be highlighted that the data quality in the registers with respect to appropriate coding was not evaluated. In addition, the ICD-10 codes used to define comorbidities associated with moderate or severe disease were not validated through records review, and therefore, may be subject to misclassification, though it was not an objective of this study to validate the severity algorithm used, but rather apply it on a Swedish data set.

### Changes in the incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus between 1990 and 2020: an observational study using the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) [^3c043733]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Case ascertainment algorithm

An algorithm (see figure 1) was developed to optimise our ability to identify true SLE cases within the database. Various strategies for SLE case identification within the CPRD have been used. These encompass the presence of a single SLE Read codeto algorithmic approaches requiring additional evidence for confirmation of an SLE diagnosis. Other studies of rheumatic diseases have highlighted that diagnostic Read codes alone may be insufficient to accurately identify true cases within the CPRD. Typically diagnostic Read codes are assigned to patient records by primary care clinical teams following confirmation of a diagnosis, that is, after review by a rheumatologist. However, coding errors can occur, emphasising the benefit of incorporating additional evidence for true case identification. To date, no studies reporting external validation of SLE cases have been reported. For this study, we adapted the algorithm presented by Nightingale et al in 2017, as outlined below.

Figure 1
SLE case ascertainment algorithm. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

SLE Read codes

Potential SLE Read codes were identified from the CPRD dictionary and from review of code lists reported in previous CPRD studies. Code lists were reviewed independently by two rheumatologists (JE and SS) and those with agreement retained. Codes relating to limited cutaneous lupus, tuberculoid lupus and lupus anticoagulant were excluded. Codes for subacute cutaneous lupus were kept; in our experience, many patients with systemic lupus will have this manifestation, compared with more specific cutaneous involvement such as discoid lupus.

Confirmatory evidence

We searched for clinical and immunological features suggestive of SLE, for example, pericarditis diagnostic codes, anti-nuclear antibody codes) based on the 2019 EULAR-ACR classification criteria. Immunosuppressants were amended to include SLE-related medications, which are now more widely used (addition of Leflunomide, Mycophenolate Mofetil, Rituximab and Tacrolimus and Belimumab). In recognition of recent efforts to minimise cumulative glucocorticoid exposure in the management of SLE, we removed evidence of ≥ 3 months continuous oral glucocorticoids but incorporated repeat glucocorticoid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory prescriptions combined with multiple SLE Read codes, or multiple EULAR-ACR criteria. The entire patient record was reviewed for confirmatory evidence. Test data (eg, white cell count) had inclusion thresholds set based on unit types and expected normal values. The full algorithm used is shown in figure 1.

The list of Read codes for SLE and confirmatory evidence, used in this study, are available via the University of Bath Research Data Archive or by contacting the corresponding author.

### Association of patient copayment and medication adherence in systemic lupus erythematosus [^de790068]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample selection

We conducted a retrospective analysis of health claims data using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (hereafter Clinformatics). Clinformatics is a large US database composed of inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, pharmacy and laboratory health claims. Medical claims include International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10); Current Procedural Terminology codes; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System procedure codes and site of service codes. The database includes commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees and is geographically diverse across the USA. We followed the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data Statement for Pharmacoepidemiology checklist.

We identified individuals aged ≥ 18 years from 1 July 2010 through 31 December 2019, with a diagnosis of SLE and continuous enrolment of at least 180 days (figure 1). We excluded 2020 and 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected access to care and medications for individuals with SLE. Diagnosis of SLE was defined as two claims containing SLE-specific ICD-9/10 codes between 30 and 365 days apart. All ICD-9 and ICD-10 administrative codes used are listed in online supplemental table 1. In order to be eligible for study inclusion, participants had to be prescribed at least one medication (hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate) or a concomitant of hydroxychloroquine with one immunosuppressant (combination therapy). We specified at least 90 days of dual medication claims to identify combination therapy. The index date was the date of first medication fill. The follow-up period for each medication class spanned the date of first medication claim through either medication discontinuation or end of continuous enrolment, whichever occurred first (figure 2). Discontinuation of medication was defined as 60 or more days without medication and without a subsequent claim. In cases of medication switch (discontinuation and start of a different class), the new medication started would have its adherence assessed separately from the first medication used. There was no established limit for number of medication switch per person. As long as each new medication switched did not meet exclusion criteria (eg, had at least 90 days of medication claim), they were included in the analysis. Individuals were excluded from the cohort if: (a) less than 180 days of continuous enrolment prior to or less than 90 days of continuous enrolment after the index date; (b) no medication data or less than 90 days of medication claims; (c) missing or unknown sex.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### SLE: reconciling heterogeneity [^be8ead8e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Stakeholders' purposes

How different stakeholders use the name SLE and which definition they use depends on the purpose for which they assign the name (table 1).

Table 1
Types and purposes of SLE definitions used by different stakeholders. The types of definitions, illness models, modes of diagnosis and time considerations are described in the text

The purpose for which payers and administrators use the name SLE is to guide reimbursement and regulatory policy. Epidemiologists do so to identify disparities among populations that may identify the exogenous and endogenous factors that drive the illness and that demarcate boundaries by which clinical and basic science researchers can study mechanisms, causes, treatments and outcomes. Office physicians use the name SLE to anchor prognoses, justify interventions and enhance patients' confidence (and their own). Patients use it to understand their options and their futures. Editors of medical journals use it to flag articles for readers' attention.

Payers, administrators, clinical researchers and some basic science researchers mostly select the separate illness model and the exclusive, binary and time-limited definition of SLE. Physicians, patients and other basic researchers choose the inclusive, scalar and time-variable definition and linear illness model. Journal editors consider the definition and disease models irrelevant if the published report can be indexed and identified by a keyword. A result of this choice is that literature and internet searches on SLE yield studies of patients and animals defined in many different ways, with little attention to distinctions among the definitions.

Until recently American physicians used common language diagnosis names in medical charts, biasing recorded diagnoses towards the exclusive definition. Quality monitors did not challenge common language diagnoses, payers reimbursed expenses and patients with ambiguous diagnoses usually did not participate in studies of SLE. New administrative rules require American physicians to use International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code numbers that disregard the uncertainty of lupus spectrum illness. Because when diagnoses are ambiguous payers often refuse to reimburse costs of SLE-relevant tests and medications, American physicians now assign the ICD code for typical SLE to patients they previously diagnosed with UCTD, overlap or other lupus spectrum disease, and these patients may now participate in studies that select patients by ICD code.

### Mortality, causes of death and influence of medication use in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus vs matched controls [^50c1dc60]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection of SLE patients and control subjects

Two separate cohorts were created for the present study (Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online). For both cohorts, adult SLE patients were identified using CPRD READ codes for SLE at any time during the period of valid CPRD data collection (i.e. from January 1987 to March 2012; Supplementary Material, available at Rheumatology online). For the full CPRD cohort, the index date was defined as the date of first SLE record, and patients were followed up from this date. For the CPRD-ONS cohort, the follow - up time for death was restricted to the period of valid ONS data linkage only (i.e. from January 1998 to March 2012); hence, if the first SLE record was before the period of ONS data overlap, follow-up started at the first day of valid ONS linked data and was set as the index date. Patients without valid ONS linked data were excluded from this CPRD-ONS cohort. The full CPRD cohort was used for the main analyses. For analyses concerning the underlying cause of death, we used the restricted CPRD-ONS cohort.

Each SLE patient was matched by year of birth (in increments of 1 year, to a maximum of 5 years), sex and practice to up to six control patients (without a history of SLE, including non-specific codes for SLE, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome). Referent subjects were assigned the same index date as their matched patients with SLE.

The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) and by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) for Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency database research (ISAC protocol number 14_116R). The CPRD Group has obtained ethical approval by the MREC for all purely observational research using anonymised CPRD data, i.e. studies which do not include patient involvement.

### Declining incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus in Norway 1999–2017: data from a population cohort identified by international classification of diseases, 10th revision code and verified by classification [^d38b1c30]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to provide complete, robust data on annual systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) incidence rates over nearly two decades from the Southeast Norway area (2.9 million inhabitants) and assess accuracy of SLE-specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for SLE diagnosis.

Methods

From administrative databases, we identified all cases International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coded as SLE during 1999 through 2017 in Southeast Norway. We manually reviewed the chart of every case ICD-10 coded as SLE to either confirm or reject SLE diagnosis. Using SLE classification criteria, we classified all cases with confirmed SLE. We estimated annual incidence rates of classified SLE, and subsets, defined by age at diagnosis, sex, and parental country of birth. The chi-square test was applied for linear time-trend analyses of incidence.

Results

Among the 3,488 cases ICD-10 coded as SLE, chart reviews confirmed SLE diagnosis in 1,558 (45%), of which 797 had new-onset disease during 1999 through 2017. Annual SLE incidence rates fell during 1999 to 2017. The fall was most pronounced in female persons 50 to 59years old at diagnosis, in whom incidence fell from 3.4 to 1.1 per 100,000 persons (P trend < 0.001). Concurrent ecological data from the study area showed a 74% reduction in prescriptions of menopausal hormone treatment. Accuracy of ICD-10 codes for incident SLE diagnosis was acceptable in juveniles and young adults (up to 20years) but otherwise low.

Conclusion

In a presumably complete population-based cohort, we identified decreasing incidence of SLE, especially among female persons 50 to 59years old. Although reasons for declining incidence are not clear, ecological data indicate a possible role of environmental factors, for example, menopausal hormone treatments.

### Developing electronic health record algorithms that accurately identify patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^6c82f465]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To study systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the electronic health record (EHR), we must accurately identify patients with SLE. Our objective was to develop and validate novel EHR algorithms that use International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), Clinical Modification codes, laboratory testing, and medications to identify SLE patients.

Methods

We used Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative, a de-identified version of the EHR, with 2.5 million subjects. We selected all individuals with at least 1 SLE ICD-9 code (710.0), yielding 5,959 individuals. To create a training set, 200 subjects were randomly selected for chart review. A subject was defined as a case if diagnosed with SLE by a rheumatologist, nephrologist, or dermatologist. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and sensitivity were calculated for combinations of code counts of the SLE ICD-9 code, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), ever use of medications, and a keyword of "lupus" in the problem list. The algorithms with the highest PPV were each internally validated using a random set of 100 individuals from the remaining 5,759 subjects.

Results

The algorithm with the highest PPV at 95% in the training set and 91% in the validation set was 3 or more counts of the SLE ICD-9 code, ANA positive (≥ 1:40), and ever use of both disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and steroids, while excluding individuals with systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis ICD-9 codes.

Conclusion

We developed and validated the first EHR algorithm that incorporates laboratory values and medications with the SLE ICD-9 code to identify patients with SLE accurately.

### Hydralazine syndrome, an "experiment of nature"… [^49203bcf]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A decade ago, when hydralazine was used first in the treatment of hypertension, a significant number of patients developed a peculiar reaction that was later identified as the "hydralazine syndrome. " The initial symptoms closely mimicked rheumatoid arthritis. The fully developed reaction mimicked the clinical picture of systemic lupus erythematosus, except for one or possibly two notable differences. The difference that is most apparent is the absence of renal involvement in the hydralazine syndrome in man. This lack of renal disease is, however, based purely on negative urine findings, in contrast to the positive findings at one stage or another in more than 60% of patients with SLE. There is not enough evidence to rule out the occurrence of renal involvement with finality in this reaction to hydralazine. Renal lesions have been produced by administration of hydralazine in dogs. Also, renal biopsies have revealed that histological changes of SLE may.

### Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a real-world analysis of a large representative US administrative claims database, 2020–2021 [^b3fa137b]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, we considered a COVID-19 diagnosis code in any position (primary or secondary) on an inpatient claim to be evidence of severe disease. Some patients identified as having severe COVID-19 may have had a primary inpatient diagnosis of another condition but were also treated for COVID-19 during the same admission. Such patients may be considered as being hospitalised 'with COVID-19' rather than 'for COVID-19'.

Third, our classification of patients' vaccination status was limited to patients who had a medical or pharmacy claim for a COVID-19 vaccine or vaccine administration. An unknown number of patients with SLE are likely to have received a vaccine in a setting that did not generate an insurance claim (eg, mass vaccination site). Therefore, vaccination may offer even greater protection against progression to severe COVID-19 than observed in this study, since vaccinated patients are likely to have been classified as unvaccinated in this analysis. The same can be said regarding number of vaccines received, as our methods were unable to determine how many vaccines a patient received, and the vaccine series could have been incomplete for some, prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Identification of patients who used various SLE medications was also limited to those with medical or pharmacy claims for those treatments; patients were assumed to take the medications as prescribed, though that cannot be confirmed, and medication dosage, including corticosteroid dose, could not be reliably assessed using claims data. We also limited our assessment of immunosuppressive agents to those more commonly used among patients with SLE. In addition, because race data are not available for Commercial and Medicare patients, race was not included in the multivariable models. There may be differences in variables not available or not controlled for in adjusted analyses (eg, race, socioeconomic status) between patients with SLE with and without severe COVID-19 that may contribute to the observed results. Finally, these results may not be generalisable to patients with SLE with insurance types other than those included in this study.

### Drug-induced lupus: traditional and new concepts [^27c0beef]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Drug-induced lupus (DIL) includes a spectrum of drug-induced reactions often characterised by a clinical phenotype similar to that of idiopathic systemic lupus eruthematosus (SLE) but usually lacking major SLE complications. Different drugs may be associated with distinct clinical and serological profiles, and early recognition is crucial. Drugs traditionally associated with DIL include procainamide, hydralazine, quinidine and others, but strong associations with newer agents, such as TNF α (TNFα) inhibitors, are increasingly recognised. The pathogenic mechanisms explaining how drugs that have heterogeneous chemical structure and function lead to autoimmunity are only partially understood. However, it is likely that traditional DIL-associated agents can boost innate immune responses, particularly neutrophil responses, with neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and exposure of autoantigens. Research in the field of DIL is evolving and may provide interesting models for the study of autoimmunity.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus in Crohn's disease: drug-induced or idiopathic? [^886d4e94]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder, affecting predominantly young females. It is characterized by skin lesions, polyarthritis, multiorgan involvement, hematologic disorders, and typical autoantibodies. There have been some case reports of coexisting idiopathic SLE and Crohn's disease (CD) reported in current literature. However, drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) also represents a possible complication of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment for CD, and may lead to a serious diagnostic dilemma.

### Prevalence and incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus in Thailand based on national health data [^e55aa08f]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

A retrospective cohort study was conducted following the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines.

Study period

Between 2017 and 2020.

Study participants

Patients aged 18 years and above with a primary diagnosis of SLE, as identified by the ICD-10 codes M32. In routine clinical practice, this code is generally applied to patients who meet established classification criteria (the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised SLE classification criteria, either the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria or the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/ACR SLE classification criteria). However, in this study, we could not validate each case definition against these criteria due to the lack of clinical detail in the administrative database.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Eligible participants were adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with at least two separate healthcare encounters coded with a primary diagnosis of SLE (ICD-10 code M32) between 2017 and 2020. To reduce the risk of misclassification due to coding error or one-time miscoding, we applied a repeated-encounter criterion in the main analysis: patients were required to have at least two separate healthcare visits with a diagnosis code of M32 during the study period. This 'repeated encounters' approach has been previously used in administrative database studies to increase diagnostic specificity in the absence of access to clinical or laboratory data.

Exclusion criteria included individuals aged under 18 years and those with missing demographic data (age or sex). No additional exclusion criteria were applied.

Systemic lupus erythematosus guideline discussion — In this guideline, we recommend HCQ, limiting glucocorticoid exposure, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing medication toxicity for all people with SLE. Many recommendations are conditional and do not specify one particular immunosuppressive agent, or even one class of agent, and the guideline strongly emphasizes the role of shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Routine assessment of medication adherence is suggested.

Data source and incidence analysis of AZA leukopenia in the retrospective cohort study

To assess the historical incidence rate of AZA‐related leukopenia, we gathered data between 2012 and 2017 from the multiple medical centers in Taiwan, which included 6,364 patients who have taken AZA, with or without AZA‐related leukopenia. The detailed design is shown in Figure S1. The exclusion criteria included (1) patients with hematological malignancies (e.g. leukemia), (2) patients treated with chemotherapy and G‐CSF before taking AZA, (3) patients who were treated with cyclosporine (CsA), methotrexate (MTX), or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) concomitantly with AZA treatment, (4) patients with sepsis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) prior to AZA treatment, and (5) patients receiving AZA treatment for < 2 weeks. The diagnosis codes for the above diseases are from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM; Figure S1), which were collected using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system codes of the World Health Organization.

Because there is no ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM code for the definition of AZA‐related leukopenia, we further analyzed laboratory data to identify leukopenia, which was considered AZA‐induced if it occurred within 6 months of starting treatment. Leukopenia was graded according to white blood cell (WBC) counts as follows: grade 1, 3,000–4,000 cells/μL; grade 2, 2,000–3,000 cells/μL; grade 3, 1,000–2,000 cells/μL; and grade 4, < 1,000 cells/μL. We estimated the annual incidence of AZA‐related leukopenia in multiple medical centers in Taiwan as the annual number of toxicity cases caused by AZA divided by the annual number of new AZA users, defined as individuals who had not received the drug in the past 3 years according to the database.

### The influence of immunosuppressants on the non-melanoma skin cancer among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and primary Sjögren's syndrome: a nationwide retrospective case-control study in Taiwan [^3eb0f792]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the influence of corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine on the association with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).

Methods

This nationwide retrospective case-control study retrieved data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 1995–2013. Cases with newly-diagnosed NMSC (n = 19,603) and controls without NMSC were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to age, sex, and reference date. SLE, pSS, NMSC, and co-morbidities were determined by ICD-9-CM code. Cumulative drug exposures were defined by cumulative dosages or total defined daily dose (TDDD) of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code of medicines. The analysis used conditional logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, residential area, occupation, and co-morbidities. Case-control studies cannot infer the causality.

Results

Compared to patients without SLE or pSS, the patients with SLE had significantly higher associations with NMSC (cases/controls: n = 23/10, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–5.01), particularly those using corticosteroids with a cumulative dosage > 5g (cases/controls: n = 17/5, AOR = 2.96, 95%CI 1.06–8.23); and those using hydroxychloroquine with a cumulative dosage > 100 TDDD (cases/controls: n = 18/6, AOR = 2.7, 95%CI 1.04–6.98). The patients with pSS had significantly higher associations with NMSC (cases/controls: n = 28/11, AOR = 2.56, 95%CI 1.25–5.23), particularly those using hydroxychloroquine with a cumulative dosage > 100TDDD (cases/controls: n = 20/4, AOR = 5.41, 95%CI 1.82–16.11), and those using corticosteroids with a cumulative dosage > 1g (cases/controls: n = 13/3, AOR = 4.92, 95%CI 1.37–17.61).

Conclusions

The patients with SLE or pSS had significantly increased associations with NMSC, especially those receiving higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. Four Mayo Clinic physicians have advanced the opinion that systemic lupus erythematosus is the end stage of a process, probably genetically conditioned, which may remain latent until induced by drugs or other provocative agents. D. Alarcon-Segovia, MD, reported to the annual meeting of the American Rheumatism Association in San Francisco in June on the results of a study of 50 patients exhibiting hydralazine syndrome. This syndrome which, when fully developed, is indistinguishable from systemic LE, sometimes appears in patients undergoing treatment for hypertension with hydralazine hydrochloride. "Although data on the history and subsequent course of patients with this syndrome is limited, it has been assumed that it occurs in the absence of antecedent LE and that it is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, " Alarcon-Segovia said.

### Developing and validating methods to assemble systemic lupus erythematosus births in the electronic health record [^dfeabeda]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Electronic health records (EHRs) represent powerful tools to study rare diseases. Our objective was to develop and validate EHR algorithms to identify systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) births across centers.

Methods

We developed algorithms in a training set using an EHR with over 3 million subjects and validated the algorithms at 2 other centers. Subjects at all 3 centers were selected using ≥ 1 code for SLE International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or SLE International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and ≥ 1 ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM delivery code. A subject was a case if diagnosed with SLE by a rheumatologist and had a birth documented. We tested algorithms using SLE ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM codes, antimalarial use, a positive antinuclear antibody ≥ 1:160, and ever checked double-stranded DNA or complement, using both rule-based and machine learning methods. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and sensitivities were calculated. We assessed the impact of case definition, coding provider, and subject race on algorithm performance.

Results

Algorithms performed similarly across all 3 centers. Increasing the number of SLE codes, adding clinical data, and having a rheumatologist use the SLE code all increased the likelihood of identifying true SLE patients. All the algorithms had higher PPVs in African American versus White SLE births. Using machine learning methods, the total number of SLE codes and an SLE code from a rheumatologist were the most important variables in the model for SLE case status.

Conclusion

We developed and validated algorithms that use multiple types of data to identify SLE births in the EHR. Algorithms performed better in African American mothers than in White mothers.

### Drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in previously diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus patients: a case series [^12d63f9e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Physicians should suspect DI-SCLE in patients with pre-existing diagnoses of SLE when presented with the development of a new rash and a history of taking a medication known to cause DI-SCLE. Physicians should take a detailed medication history and trial cessation of drugs to treat a new lupus-appearing rash in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of SLE. There is a limited role for antibody testing and biopsies, although they can potentially support the diagnosis. Physicians should proceed with caution and be acutely aware of DI-SCLE when starting patients with SLE on drugs that have been reported to induce DI-SCLE. Moreover, these patients may have potentially increased susceptibility to DI-SCLE. Further studies are needed to determine whether patients with SLE are more susceptible to DI-SCLE compared with the general population.

Materials and methods

Data source

In 1995, the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) programme was introduced, covering more than 99% of its 23 million inhabitants. Administrative claims data are kept within the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), including demographic information, diagnosis and the cost of medical services provided. For confidentiality, the NHIRD removes all traceable personal identifiers. The clinical diagnosis of NHIRD is made by using the diagnostic codes of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Researchers may request data on no more than 10% of the patients in the NHIRD. Thus, the National Health Research Institute has produced subsets of data. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 (LHID2010) includes the initial administrative claims data for one million randomly selected beneficiaries from the NHIRD from 2010. The age, gender and average insured payroll of the LHID2010 and NHIRD are not significantly different. The LHID2010 has been used for stroke-related studies.

Patients and methods

Data sources

This retrospective cohort study used data from the IBM MarketScan commercial database linked to the General Electric Centricity EMR (GE EMR) database from January 2004 to December 2015. The IBM MarketScan commercial database includes fully integrated and de-identified patient-level healthcare claims data from large employers, health plans, and government and public organisations and includes private sector health data from approximately 350 payers, and > 20 billion service records. The GE EMR database contains patient-level clinical data, including demographics, insurance information, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 medical diagnoses from > 38 million patients across the USA.

The study dataset was constructed using a patented and proprietary encryption algorithm developed by IQVIA to link patient data from the IBM MarketScan and GE EMR. Patient data were de-identified across data suppliers using the encryption algorithm, followed by deterministic matching based on patient-level information. Each patient was then assigned a unique and persistent IQVIA patient ID with linkage across various databases.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and gouty arthritis: an uncommon association [^1a8a4c09]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the frequency of gouty arthritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and elucidate the clinical factors that predispose to this occurrence.

Methods

A chart review of in-patients (1989–2001) and out-patients (1999–2001) with ICD9 billing codes for gouty arthritis/tophaceous gout and SLE was performed. Twenty-six patients were identified. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatism criteria for SLE and crystal-proven gout or a self-limited inflammatory arthritis felt to be crystal-induced (i.e. definite gout) were included.

Results

Ten patients were identified. Their mean age was 46.5 yr; 80% were African-American and 70% were women. Nine of the ten had lupus nephritis and four had undergone renal transplantation. An acute worsening of renal function unrelated to lupus activity preceded almost all gout flares. Lupus activity at the time of the first gout attack as measured by the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) was low. Eight patients were on prednisone (mean dose 8 mg/day) for their SLE at the time the attack of gout occurred.

Conclusions

Gouty arthritis is uncommon in SLE; it occurs primarily in patients with long-standing SLE and nephritis. Worsening renal function usually preceded gout attacks, but SLE disease activity was minimal. Crystal-induced arthritis should be included in the differential diagnosis of a lupus patient presenting with acute inflammatory arthritis because the long-term treatment of the two conditions differs substantially.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus; stroke and myocardial infarction risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^25b04ff5]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Myocardial infarction

MI was reported in 12 studies: six studies evaluated fatal/non-fatal eventsand six studies evaluated non-fatal events. Four studies were not included in the meta-analysis: two because they reported data only for a subpopulation, one because it only reported data on lupus nephritis (LN)and one owing to population overlap with another study. Of the eight studies included, all but one had low risk of bias(online supplemental table S5).

MI was identified by ICD-8, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in 8 of 12 studies. The codes used were similar in all studies that reported them and are listed in online supplemental table S6. In the remaining studies, a combination of WHO criteria, hospital data, Biobank database based on ICD-10 codes or autopsy evidence confirmed identification. One study did not report how MI was identified.

SLE was associated with an increased risk of MI, with a pooled RR of 2.99 (95% CI 2.34 to 3.82; I² for heterogeneity 85.7%; df = 7; p ≤ 0.001) (figure 2E).

### Mortality and causes of death in systemic lupus erythematosus in new zealand: a population-based study [^6f027e3b]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We first identified the SLE cases between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2021 using the ICD-10 code 'M32' from the National Minimum Dataset (NMDS) and the Mortality Collection (coded death records) and using the key words 'systemic lupus erythematosus' from the Death Certificates (uncoded death records). The first date in the NMDS for an inpatient event with an ICD-10 code of 'M32' or the first date from the National Non-admitted Patient Collection (NNAPC) for an outpatient event in the Rheumatology department or Renal Service, whichever date was earlier, was considered as the date of first identification of SLE. The NMDS records inpatient and day patient discharges from all public hospitals and over 90% of private hospitals. The NNAPC includes event-based purchase units that relate to medical and surgical outpatient events and emergency department events from both public and private hospitals. The Mortality Collection and Death Certificates contain information about all deaths (including date and cause of deaths) registered in New Zealand, and the Death Certificates collect more up-to-date death records not yet included in the Mortality Collection. The NMDS and the NNAPC started collecting data from 2005, and the NNAPC does not include ICD codes. These datasets were linked together through their National Health Index (NHI) number. NHI is a unique identifier assigned to every person who uses health and disability services in New Zealand. It can accurately identify people and link them with the right health records.

### Unusual toxicities with TNF inhibition: heart failure and drug-induced lupus [^b81842e6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Serious and unexpected adverse events, such as heart failure and drug-induced lupus, have been reported in patients receiving TNF inhibitor therapy. These events generally are easily recognizable, although they cannot be predicted nor avoided, other than by drug avoidance altogether Many patients have great benefit from anti-TNF therapies. Their intelligent use requires a firm understanding of these rare toxicities, so as to minimize the morbidity associated with their uncommon occurrence.

### Validating claims-based algorithms for a systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis in Medicare data for informed use of the lupus index: a tool for geospatial research [^f8538363]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

SLE algorithm performance

The performance of algorithms was evaluated in the combined registry and chart review groups. The overall receiving operator characteristics curve was good for the algorithms that did and did not require a 30-day separation between codes (0.877 (0.838–0.917, p < 0.001) vs 0.881 (0.842–0.921, p < 0.001), respectively). The curves were matching except at the two-diagnosis code cut point for both algorithms. The specificity was numerically but not significantly greater at two diagnosis codes if the codes were separated by 30 days or more (0.768 vs 0.761). As expected, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms varied by the number of codes used as a threshold (figure 2). Sensitivity and specificity in both algorithms were greater than 0.8 with three diagnosis codes (table 2). Of note, algorithm performance differed by race. Specificity was lower in black patients when lower numbers of ICD-10 codes were used. Conversely, specificity was lower in white patients when higher numbers of codes were used (online supplemental table 2).

Figure 2
ROC curves for ICD-10 code algorithms to predict physician-confirmed cases of SLE. The sensitivity and specificity of between one and four ICD-10 codes in predicting SLE were determined for time-agnostic (solid line) and time-restricted (0, 30, 60 and 90 days apart) ICD-10 codes (dashed line).

Performance of ICD-10 code algorithms for SLE

SLE algorithm characteristics in a national Medicare population

The algorithm performance is expected to be different in a well-validated local population compared with a less well-validated national population. Therefore, we compared the percentage of patients classified as having lupus in each algorithm within the national and local populations. The reduction in percentage of patients classified as SLE from one to two ICD-10 codes was greater in the national than the well-validated population, as expected (35% vs 15%, respectively). However, the reduction in the percentage of patients classified as SLE when increasing the number of codes above two reduced similarly between the two groups (online supplemental table 3). Sensitivity and specificity could be determined in the national cohort without validation.

### Development and validation of a risk scoring system to identify patients with lupus nephritis in electronic health record data [^4d2ac468]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We chose to develop a scoring system rather than a binary system (diagnosis present vs absent) to permit a more granular assessment of LN diagnosis. This approach allows investigators to apply definitions according to the use case and the degree of accuracy required for the intended task. Such an approach permits adjustment of the threshold for classification based on clinical or operational needs. The scoring systems outline which data elements are required for high accuracy and highlight where more limited data might compromise accuracy. Moreover, the scoring systems provide transparency, allowing users to directly observe how different variables are weighted, making the model more interpretable and clinically relevant.

Investigators may choose to apply these scoring systems separately or together based on their needs. For example, whether for research or clinical work, if high sensitivity is desired and at least some LN codes are available, investigators may choose to use LN-Code first to identify patients with LN; this may then be followed by the application of LN-No Code to identify any additional patients who do not have codes for LN to increase sensitivity. In another use case, an investigator may be interested in applying a system with very high specificity; in this case, using LN-Code alone may be preferred.

### Cardiovascular complications of systemic lupus erythematosus: impact of risk factors and therapeutic efficacy-a tertiary centre experience in an appalachian state [^750db47f]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient population

Through search of the University of Kentucky Health System (UKHS) database, including inpatient and outpatient medical records for the years 2004 through 2020, we identified 308 patients having diagnosis codes of ICD-9 (710-Connective tissue disease, unspecified) or (Lupus erythematosus 695.4) or ICD-10 (M32 Systemic lupus erythematosus) or (L93 Lupus erythematosus). Among these patients, only those who received treatment with hydroxychloroquine and/or had two or more visits with University of Kentucky Rheumatology Clinic were selected for further study. The hydroxychloroquine treatment criteria was added to capture newly added UKHS patients who had previously received outpatient rheumatology treatment outside of that system. Since some relevant individuals might not have been captured if treatment with hydroxychloroquine had been contraindicated, we elected to expand the search by including individuals who were provided at least one follow-up visit with the UKHS Rheumatology Clinic as a more reliable indicator of a true diagnosis of systemic autoimmunity. All patients included in this study fulfill the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria by reviewing documentation in medical records.

We screened the 308 UKHS patients with lupus for atherosclerosis (ICD-9 440.2, ICD-10 I70), coronary artery disease (ICD-9 414.01, ICD-10 I20-I25, I00-I99) and peripheral arterial disease (ICD-9 443.9, ICD-10 I73.9), which identified 20 patients as our cases group of patients with lupus having cardiovascular complications. Three of the UKHS patients with lupus that had not exhibited any cardiovascular complications were matched with each member of the cases group by birth year ± 5 years as controls to increase the power of the study. The codes encompassed events occurring within the University of Kentucky or historically, particularly when events occurred in external systems. Follow-up post lupus diagnosis ranged between 1 year and 41 years, as earliest diagnosis was 1979 and latest was 2019.

Case definition

Other musculoskeletal disorders is a heterogeneous category of conditions that remain after the five musculoskeletal disorders defined in the GBD (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain, and gout) and the long-term sequelae of injuries have been separated out. Prevalence data for these conditions come from population-based health surveys and from insurance claims records for the following International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes (appendix p 8): systemic lupus erythematosus/ lupus erythematosus (ICD-9 710.0 or ICD-10 L93), infectious arthropathies (ICD-9 711 or ICD-10 M00–M02), inflammatory polyarthropathies (ICD-9 712–713 or 446, ICD-10 M03, M06-M09 or M11–M13), other joint disorders (ICD-9 716–719 or ICD-10 M20–M25), systemic connective tissue disorders (ICD-9 710.1–710.9 or ICD-10 M30–M36), deforming dorsopathies (ICD-9 737 or 416.1, or ICD-10 M40–M43 or I27.1), spondylopathies (ICD-9 720 or ICD-10 M45–M46), disorders of muscles (ICD-9 725 or ICD-10 M61–M63), disorders of the synovium and tendons (ICD-9 726–728 or ICD-10 M65–M68), other soft tissue disorders (ICD-9 729, ICD-10 M70–M73 or M75–M79), disorders of bone density and structure (ICD-9 733.0–733.2 or ICD-10 M80–M85), osteomyelitis (ICD-9 730.1–730.3 or 730.7–730.9 or ICD-10 M86), other osteopathies (ICD-9 733.3–733.9 or ICD-10 M87–M90), chondropathies (ICD-9 732 or ICD-10 M91–M94), and other disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (ICD-9 734–736 or 738–739, ICD-10 M95 or M99).

### Immunomodulatory medication use in newly diagnosed youth with systemic lupus erythematosus [^3e7bb7f6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine glucocorticoid-sparing immunomodulatory medication use in youth with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during their first year of care.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims for 2000 to 2013 from Clinformatics DataMart for youth ages 10–24 years with an incident diagnosis of SLE (≥ 3 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for SLE [710.0], each > 30 days apart). We determined the proportion of subjects filling a prescription for immunomodulatory medications within 12 months of the first SLE code (index date). We used multivariable regression to examine associations between demographic/disease factors and time to prescription fill in the first year, and also between prescription fill at any time after the index date.

Results

We identified 532 youth with an incident SLE diagnosis, of which 413 (78%) had a glucocorticoid-sparing immunomodulatory prescription fill in the first year. Prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and immunosuppressants were filled in the first year by 366 youth (69%) and by 182 (34%), respectively. Those with adult-onset (versus childhood-onset) disease were less likely to fill an immunomodulatory medication by 12 months. No other statistically significant associations were found, although there was increasing likelihood of immunomodulatory medication fills with each subsequent calendar year.

Conclusion

Among youth with newly diagnosed SLE, hydroxychloroquine use is prevalent although not universal, and prescription immunosuppressant use is notably low during the first year of care. Further research is needed to identify factors contributing to suboptimal immunomodulatory medication use during the first year of care.

Measurements

We defined ED treat‐and‐release visits for neurological symptoms as those with a primary ICD‐10‐CM discharge diagnosis code for any neurological issue (eg, headache, numbness, dizziness, or altered mental status). ED visits in which a cerebrovascular condition was diagnosed were defined using well‐established ICD‐10‐CM codes.ED treat‐and‐release visits for a nonneurological symptom were defined as those with a primary ICD‐10‐CM discharge diagnosis code for any nonneurological issue (eg, chest pain, vomiting).

We used ICD‐10‐CM codes recorded at the time of PRES/RCVS hospitalization to measure the following vascular comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, renal failure, and prior stroke. We also used ICD‐10‐CM codes recorded at the time of PRES/RCVS hospitalization to measure the following comorbidities and triggers previously associated with PRES/RCVS: primary headache disorder, substance‐use disorder, drug poisoning, psychiatric illness, lupus, rheumatological disorders, cancer, and pregnancy/puerperium.

To explore the impact of probable misdiagnosis on patients' outcomes, we determined the frequency of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using highly reliable ICD‐10‐CM diagnostic codes recorded at the PRES/RCVS hospitalization. We also calculated length of stay for PRES/RCVS hospitalization and recorded discharge disposition.

We used data from the American Hospital Association to determine each facility's bed size, teaching status, and availability of neurological services.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1d246ad3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

### Characterisation of systemic lupus erythematosus associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a pharmacovigilance study using FAERS database [^634a5137]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The association was further confirmed through aROR analysis accounting for sex, age and concomitant medications. Notably, most ICI regimens involved combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, carboplatin, pemetrexed) and PPIs. PPIs have been increasingly reported to induce SCLE, and chemotherapy drugs represent the most common medication class associated with SCLE, particularly in female patients. An update to drug-induced lupus erythematosus classification systems has accordingly incorporated both PPI-related and chemotherapy-related SCLE. After rigorous adjustment for these potential confounding factors, the positive signals for ICI-associated SLE remain significant and warrant particular clinical attention.

The most frequently reported clinical spectrum in our analysis involved subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, consistent with prior case reports and reviews. Several other variants of ICI-induced cutaneous lupus have been reported, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus, chronic/acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and SLE rash. Of particular note, ICI-induced cutaneous lupus showed no associated mortality in our study. This observation aligns with the established favourable prognosis associated with ICI-induced cutaneous immune reactions. Cutaneous adverse reactions are common with ICIs, and due to the immune mechanism of ICIs, there are also a variety of rheumatological adverse reactions with cutaneous manifestations, such as lupus erythematosus. While cutaneous SLEs are manageable, early recognition and adequate management are critical to optimise outcomes. We also found other types of ICI-induced lupus that were rarely reported in the literature, such as SLE, lupus nephritis, antinuclear antibody positive and antinuclear antibody increased, with reported deaths that warrant concern.

### Adverse pregnancy outcomes in adolescents and young women with systemic lupus erythematosus: a national estimate [^00df7ed2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Data source

We studied the 2000–2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest all-payer, inpatient care database in the United States, containing demographic and clinical information obtained from hospital discharge abstracts. Available yearly since 1988, each year of the NIS contains data on approximately 8 million hospital stays from about 1000 hospitals, sampled to approximate a 20% stratified sample of U.S. community hospitals. Hospitals are divided into strata based on U.S. region, urban/rural location, teaching status, bed size and ownership. Sampling probabilities are proportional to the number of hospitals in each stratum. No unique patient identifiers are contained in the NIS, as the unit of analysis is individual hospitalization, rather than patient. Information available for each hospitalization includes general hospital characteristics as well as patient information such as age, gender, race, quartile of median income based on patient ZIP code, and discharge diagnoses/procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Discharge diagnoses include one primary and up to 24 secondary discharge diagnoses as well as up to 15 procedural codes.

Study population

We identified unique pregnancies among individuals with and without SLE age 14–21 years. We chose to include individuals up to age 21 because previous survey data demonstrates that nearly half of pediatric rheumatologists follow patients until age 21 or older. Hospitalizations of patients with SLE were identified with ICD-9 code 710.0. The youngest, pregnant patient with SLE was 14 years of age at time of delivery, so analysis was restricted to hospitalizations of pregnant women aged 14 or older. Hospitalizations of pregnant women aged 14–21 were included. Unique pregnancies were identified for analysis by including only those hospitalizations in which ICD-9 diagnosis or procedural codes specified delivery, live born, spontaneous or induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy or intrauterine death. ICD-9 codes for these conditions were identified using HCUP Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) and incorporated for inclusion/exclusion using ICD9x for STATA 13.0 software.

### Usage of drugs for cardiovascular diseases is increased in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients already before diagnosis of SLE [^6e991596]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are considered as a high-risk population for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To explore whether their risk is increased already in preclinical episodes of the disease, we have studied the usage of CVD drugs in incident SLE cases five years before diagnosis of SLE compared to the population controls.

Methods

Adult SLE incident patients (age ≥ 18 years) from 2004 through 2014 were identified from a nationwide register. The date of granted reimbursement for SLE medication was defined as the date of diagnosis (index day). For each patient, three population controls were matched for age, sex and residence on the index day. The patients and controls were linked to the drug purchase register. All purchases of CVD drugs (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) - codes of C01-C04, C07-C09) and separately C10 were recorded in half-year periods over five years before the index day.

Results

A total of 653 SLE patients (mean age 45.7 ± 15.9 years, 83% females) and 1924 population controls were found. Over five years before the index day, the proportion of SLE patients with purchased CVD drugs (46.7%) was greater compared to the controls (28.5%) (p < 0.001). The relative risk for purchases started to increase more steeply during the last half-year period before SLE diagnosis. There was no significant difference in lipid-modifying agents between groups.

Conclusions

Our finding that among SLE patients the use of CVD drugs was more common compared to their control population suggests increased CVD risk already before the diagnosis of SLE.

### Clozapine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus [^7f6ba56a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of classic clozapine-induced systemic lupus erythematosus that also developed on rechallenge.

Case Summary

A 32-year-old white woman diagnosed with schizophrenia presented in 1996 with clinical characteristics and laboratory markers consistent with drug-induced lupus (DIL). Clozapine, started 1 year prior, was withdrawn, with complete biological and clinical remission within 3 months. In 2004, 1 week after rechallenge with clozapine for uncontrolled schizophrenia, the patient developed clinical and biological signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of DIL. Again, discontinuation of clozapine was followed by full remission within 2–3 months.

Discussion

DIL was first described more than 50 years ago, with multiple drugs implicated in the causation. Clozapine-induced lupus was reported recently, but does not meet the usual criteria for a diagnosis of DIL. We report a classic case of clozapine-induced lupus that, according to the Naranjo probability scale, demonstrates a highly probable relationship between DIL and clozapine.

Conclusions

DIL demands a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Although clozapine has an extensive safety profile, DIL must be considered as one of its serious adverse effects.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus in Crohn's disease: drug-induced or idiopathic? [^8803d494]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Coexistence of Crohn's disease (CD) and idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is very rare. On the other hand, drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) due to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is a relatively more common entity. DILE due to anti-TNF agents and idiopathic SLE share common serologic and epidemiologic characteristics making the differentiation between those two entities difficult. We present a case of a 35-year-old woman with CD who developed SLE after treatment with adalimumab and denosumab and persisting symptoms eight months after discontinuation of those agents.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data sources.

In this population-based study, we used prospectively collected national registry data. The Danish Civil Registration System was established in 1968; it assigns a central person registration number, issued by law, at birth, or upon immigration to all persons residing in Denmark, and contains continuously updated information regarding vital status. The following registries were linked using central person registration numbers.

The Danish National Patient Registry contains International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes of diagnoses and procedures recorded by physicians during discharges from inpatient wards (since 1977), emergency wards (since 1995), and outpatient hospital clinics (since 1995). The data are organized as patient "contacts", wherein inpatient and emergency care contacts always contain only 1 visit and include a start and end date. However, individual outpatient contacts are initially assigned a start date and may contain 1 or several follow-up visits under the same primary diagnosis. For each patient care contact, ≤ 20 diagnoses can be registered, including a primary diagnosis and any secondary, optional diagnoses. ICD, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) codes were used from 1977 until 1993, followed by ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes since 1994.

The Danish National Prescription Registry was established in 1995 and contains all prescription dispensing data from Danish community pharmacies. The Income Statistics Registry and the Population's Education Registry contain data concerning the occupational status (affiliation to the labor market) and educational status, respectively, of Danish residents.

### Analysis of cardiovascular complications during delivery admissions among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 2004–2019 [^71f81983]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications. However, data on acute cardiovascular complications during delivery admissions remain limited.

Objective

To investigate whether SLE is associated with an increased risk of acute peripartum cardiovascular complications during delivery hospitalization among individuals giving birth.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the National Inpatient Sample (2004–2019) by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to identify delivery hospitalizations among birthing individuals with a diagnosis of SLE. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to report an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between SLE and acute peripartum cardiovascular complications. Data were analyzed from May 1 through September 1, 2022.

Exposure

Diagnosed SLE.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary study end points were preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Secondary end points included ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, acute kidney injury (AKI), venous thromboembolism (VTE), length of stay, and cost of hospitalization.

Results

A total of 63 115 002 weighted delivery hospitalizations (median [IQR] age, 28 [24–32] years; all were female patients) were identified, of which 77 560 hospitalizations (0.1%) were among individuals with SLE and 63 037 442 hospitalizations (99.9%) were among those without SLE. After adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, comorbidities, insurance, and income level, SLE remained an independent risk factor associated with peripartum cardiovascular complications, including preeclampsia (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.12; 95% CI, 2.07–2.17), peripartum cardiomyopathy (aOR, 4.42; 95% CI, 3.79–5.13), heart failure (aOR, 4.06; 95% CI, 3.61–4.57), cardiac arrhythmias (aOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.94–2.21), AKI (aOR, 7.66; 95% CI, 7.06–8.32), stroke (aOR, 4.83; 95% CI, 4.18–5.57), and VTE (aOR, 6.90; 95% CI, 6.11–7.80). For resource use, median (IQR) length of stay (3 [2–4] days vs 2 [2–3] days; P < .001) and cost of hospitalization ($4953 [$3305-$7517] vs $3722 [$2606-$5400]; P < .001) were higher for deliveries among individuals with SLE.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that SLE was associated with increased risk of complications, including preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmias, AKI, stroke, and VTE during delivery hospitalization and an increased length and cost of hospitalization.
