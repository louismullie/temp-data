## Question

popping in knees and shoulders during high intensity workouts continue or not

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether they should continue high-intensity workouts when their knees and shoulders are "popping" during exercise, and what the safest, evidence-based course of action is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "popping" could represent clinically and how to distinguish benign crepitus from pathologic clicking or instability. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate stopping and when imaging or evaluation is indicated. Next, I will review injury patterns in high-intensity training to contextualize risk. After that, I need to consider joint-specific issues like patellofemoral pain and rotator cuff tendinopathy that can present with popping. Finally, I will outline a decision framework and practical modifications to reduce load and protect the joints while maintaining fitness, with clear thresholds for escalation or cessation of training.

> Let me first confirm what "popping" can mean. Popping or crepitus without pain, swelling, locking, or instability is often benign and can reflect normal tendon or cartilage movement, gas bubble release, or mild joint laxity, whereas popping with pain, swelling, catching, locking, or giving way suggests intra-articular pathology such as meniscal or labral tears, osteochondritis dissecans, patellofemoral maltracking, rotator cuff or biceps pathology, or instability patterns that warrant evaluation and may be aggravated by high-intensity loading [^113kfek2] [^1163jvjL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify red flags that require stopping and prompt assessment: acute trauma with a pop followed by pain or swelling, mechanical symptoms like locking or catching, recurrent subluxation or dislocation, pain that escalates with activity and persists beyond 24 hours, or systemic features such as fever or malaise. These findings justify cessation of high-intensity training and imaging or specialist referral, with AAOS guidance supporting radiographs for knee symptoms including popping, locking, or giving way, and clinical judgment guiding shoulder evaluation when instability or mechanical symptoms are present [^113kfek2] [^1163jvjL] [^116sgG41].

> Next, I should review injury patterns in high-intensity training to frame risk. High-intensity functional training and CrossFit carry meaningful risks of overuse and traumatic injuries, with shoulders and knees among the most commonly affected sites; improper form and exacerbation of prior injuries are frequent causes, and supervision reduces injury rates, which matters when symptoms like popping emerge [^11581YCt] [^113BWGEq]. Weightlifting and powerlifting also show predilection for knee and shoulder injuries, often related to load, depth, and technique under fatigue, reinforcing the need to reassess form and progression when new symptoms appear [^114E1cKo].

> I will now examine knee-specific considerations. Patellofemoral pain is common and often worsens with loaded squats, stairs, or prolonged sitting; popping can accompany maltracking, and management is load-modified and tissue-irritability guided, with progression from pain-reducing strategies to strengthening as irritability declines. Importantly, high-intensity strength training has not shown superiority over low-intensity programs for pain or function in knee osteoarthritis, so escalating load in the presence of symptoms may not be beneficial and could worsen tissue irritation [^1164X9Ct] [^114aUEbP] [^113c4zrx]. But wait, what if the pop reflects meniscal or osteochondral pathology? In that case, continuing high-impact or deep-flexion loading risks progression, so I should confirm the absence of mechanical symptoms and persistent effusion before allowing load progression [^113kfek2] [^1163jvjL].

> For the shoulder, I need to check for rotator cuff–related pain and instability patterns. Popping with pain, weakness, or apprehension suggests rotator cuff tendinopathy, labral pathology, or instability; current guidelines emphasize supervised, load-graded rehabilitation rather than pushing through symptoms, and they note uncertainty about superiority of high-load versus low-load programs, so continuing high-intensity overhead or ballistic work without a clear diagnosis risks exacerbation. Case-based evidence also shows that high-intensity training can unmask or worsen occult shoulder pathology, reinforcing caution when new popping or pain emerges [^112dJBxq] [^113uqXfj] [^113Hg8hS].

> Let me consider the broader load-management context. Poor load management is a major driver of injury in sport, and rapid increases in volume, intensity, or complexity without adequate recovery heighten risk. When new symptoms like popping appear, I should verify whether there has been a recent spike in training load, inadequate warm-up, or technique breakdown under fatigue, and then scale back to the prior symptom-free baseline while addressing modifiable factors [^116zd1UR].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical decision framework. If the popping is painless, not accompanied by swelling, locking, or instability, and does not alter function, it is reasonable to continue with heightened awareness and form emphasis while avoiding provocative end-range positions. If the popping is new and accompanied by pain, swelling, catching, or giving way, I should stop high-intensity training, apply ice and activity modification, and seek evaluation. If symptoms persist beyond 1–2 weeks or worsen, I should obtain imaging and clinician assessment before resuming load [^113kfek2] [^1163jvjL] [^116sgG41].

> I should double-check modifications that reduce joint stress while preserving fitness. For the knee, reducing squat depth, moderating load, emphasizing hip-dominant patterns, and incorporating closed-chain quadriceps and gluteal strengthening can offload the patellofemoral joint. For the shoulder, prioritizing scapular stabilization, avoiding high-repetition overhead work at end range, and progressing load under supervision can mitigate impingement and rotator cuff stress. These strategies align with rehabilitation principles and injury-prevention frameworks for high-intensity training contexts [^116fjPCk] [^11581YCt] [^113BWGEq].

> Hold on, I should verify progression principles. When symptoms resolve and mechanics are corrected, a graded return using the 10% rule for load or volume increases, with at least 48–72 hours between heavy sessions, allows tissue adaptation while minimizing recurrence. Supervision during technical lifts and periodic form checks further reduce risk during this transition [^114Udfb7] [^116zd1UR].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan is individualized: painless popping without mechanical symptoms can proceed with caution and form focus, whereas painful popping or mechanical symptoms should halt high-intensity training and prompt evaluation. Given the lack of benefit of high-intensity over low-intensity programs for knee osteoarthritis and the uncertainty around high-load superiority for rotator cuff tendinopathy, escalating intensity in the face of new symptoms is not justified; prioritize diagnosis, load modification, and supervised rehabilitation before returning to full-intensity training [^113c4zrx] [^113uqXfj] [^112dJBxq].

Popping in the knees and shoulders during high-intensity workouts is **common and often benign** [^116sgG41], especially if there is no pain, swelling, or instability [^notfound]. If popping is painless, you can **continue training** with attention to form, warm-up, and gradual load progression [^114Udfb7]. If popping is painful or accompanied by swelling, locking, or instability, **stop and seek evaluation** to rule out injury or pathology [^113kfek2]. Persistent or worsening symptoms warrant imaging or specialist referral [^1163jvjL].

## Clinical significance of popping in knees and shoulders

Popping, or crepitus, is common in joints and can be **physiological (benign)** or **pathological (indicative of underlying issues)** [^116sgG41]. Benign popping is typically painless, occurs without swelling or instability, and does not limit function. Pathological popping is often accompanied by pain, swelling, instability, or functional impairment, suggesting underlying structural abnormalities [^113kfek2].

## Potential causes of popping during high-intensity workouts

| **Joint** | **Common causes of popping** |
|-|-|
| Knee | - Gas bubble release (cavitation) [^notfound] <br/> - Ligament or tendon movement over bony prominences <br/> - Patellofemoral maltracking <br/> - Meniscal tears <br/> - Cartilage degeneration (osteoarthritis) <br/> - Synovial plicae [^notfound] |
| Shoulder | - Gas bubble release (cavitation) <br/> - Rotator cuff tendinopathy <br/> - Labral tears <br/> - Biceps tendon subluxation <br/> - Glenohumeral instability <br/> - Acromioclavicular joint degeneration |

## Risks associated with continuing high-intensity workouts with popping

Continuing high-intensity workouts with popping can pose **risks**, particularly if the popping is pathological:

- **Progression of underlying pathology**: Persistent popping with underlying structural abnormalities (e.g. meniscal tears, rotator cuff tendinopathy) can worsen with continued high-intensity training, leading to chronic pain, instability, or functional impairment [^11581YCt].

- **Acute injury**: High-intensity workouts can precipitate acute injuries, such as ligament sprains, tendon ruptures, or dislocations, especially if underlying instability or weakness is present [^113BWGEq].

- **Chronic pain and disability**: Continued training despite pathological popping can lead to chronic pain, reduced range of motion, and long-term disability, significantly impacting quality of life and athletic performance [^1152hrmA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized assessment and management** of popping during high-intensity workouts:

- **Pain-free popping**: If popping is painless, not accompanied by swelling or instability, and does not limit function, it is generally considered benign. Individuals can continue their workouts with attention to proper form, warm-up, and gradual progression of intensity [^114Udfb7].

- **Painful popping or accompanying symptoms**: If popping is accompanied by pain, swelling, instability, or functional impairment, it is advisable to stop the activity and seek medical evaluation. Imaging (MRI, ultrasound) may be necessary to identify underlying pathology [^113kfek2].

- **Preventive strategies**: Incorporating proper warm-up, flexibility exercises, strength training, and load management can reduce the risk of injury and minimize popping [^112DF37j].

---

## Factors influencing decision to continue or stop workouts

Several factors should be considered when deciding whether to continue high-intensity workouts with popping:

- **Presence of pain**: Pain is a critical indicator of underlying pathology. Painful popping warrants cessation of activity and medical evaluation [^notfound].

- **Swelling or instability**: Swelling, instability, or functional impairment accompanying popping indicates underlying structural abnormalities and necessitates medical assessment [^113kfek2].

- **Frequency and intensity of popping**: Frequent or intense popping, even if painless, may indicate underlying instability or structural abnormalities and should be monitored closely [^notfound].

- **Individual risk factors**: Age, previous injuries, joint hypermobility, and underlying conditions (e.g. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis) increase the risk of injury and may influence the decision to continue or stop workouts [^116A6mGS].

---

## Practical recommendations for individuals experiencing popping

Based on current evidence and clinical guidelines, the following **practical recommendations** are suggested:

- **Assess symptoms**: Differentiate between painless, benign popping and painful popping accompanied by swelling, instability, or functional impairment [^116sgG41].

- **Modify activity**: If popping is painful or accompanied by other symptoms, reduce intensity, modify exercises, or temporarily stop the activity until evaluated by a healthcare professional [^114oKANN].

- **Strengthening and flexibility**: Incorporate targeted strengthening and flexibility exercises to address muscle imbalances, improve joint stability, and reduce popping [^111RDthY].

- **Warm-up and cool-down**: Ensure adequate warm-up before workouts and cool-down afterward to prepare the joints and reduce the risk of injury [^112AcN9G].

- **Seek medical evaluation**: Persistent or worsening popping, especially with pain or instability, warrants medical evaluation and possible imaging studies (MRI, ultrasound) to identify underlying pathology [^113kfek2].

---

## Conclusion

Popping in the knees and shoulders during high-intensity workouts is common and often benign, especially if painless and not accompanied by other symptoms. However, if popping is painful or accompanied by swelling, instability, or functional impairment, it may indicate underlying pathology and warrants **medical evaluation**. Individuals should assess their symptoms, modify activities as needed, and seek professional guidance to ensure safe and effective training.

Physical health and ageing

Many participants mentioned the effects ageing had on their ability to exercise at their desired levels. I can't do near what I did as a college kid… I'm not even running anymore (59-year-old woman). Regarding ageing, Body wise — just aches and pains. You go running one day, and suddenly, your hamstring hurts, and it lasts for three months (49-year-old woman) and Can I still go at the same rate? No. My knees hurt daily (52-year-old woman).

Many noted the effects of sport-related physical stressors and injury on top of normal ageing. One participant injured her shoulder in practice and told the coach she was fine. In retrospect, I wish I would have addressed it sooner because now I could be sleeping, and my shoulders will pop out in and out and I wake up and my shoulders are sore (41-year-old woman). At times, participants expressed changes from injury as bothersome, but they did not let it stop them: I really don't perceive my injuries as anything other than a nuisance. I still keep moving (59-year-old woman).

Some participants thought they were better in some aspects of health presently than in college. One former athlete felt she was physically fit with more endurance in college from playing soccer, but overall, just with the diet, things that are different, that I'm healthier in that respect now than I was back then (47-year-old woman). A former volleyball player mentioned she ran in college to stay in shape. Still, her workouts are now more well-rounded, with her lifting weights and participating in balance exercises like yoga.

Participants also commented on their health compared with that of their former teammates. There's probably only 5 or 10 of us and I'm one of them, that looks like they could still play. Everybody else is kind of either really limping, big and fat (62-year-old man). Contrastingly, None of us want to be the one that's not staying in shape, right? And so, I look at them, and I'm like, 'wow, you inspire me'. Most of us are in better shape ('body type wise') now (52-year-old woman).

Incidence and prevalence of injuries

Little has been reported regarding the incidence and prevalence of injuries sustained secondarily to participation in an ECPs. Moreover, what constitutes an injury during ECPs has not been clearly defined and each article defines injury differently. A common concept of injury among authors that have assessed the incidence and prevalence of injuries caused by ECPs is any physical complaint that was sustained during ECPs training that results in a participant being unable to take part fully in ECPs training (eg, a time loss definition) or modification of normal training activities in duration, intensity or mode. In addition to the definition of injury, another difficulty found in the literature to establish a correct relationship between the practice of ECPs and injuries is the lack of information regarding the population studied, that is, the practice of ECPs by athletes/competitors or only by individuals whose goal is improving physical fitness and health. We emphasise the need of providing the correct description of samples in further studies, mainly because ECPs are increasingly being used by practitioners, whose goal is physical fitness and health, and athletes/competitors.

The first important conclusion about injuries in ECPs was described by Grier et al and was related to the types of injuries. Injuries in ECPs ranged from overuse injuries (stress fractures and reactions, tendonitis, shin splints and general musculoskeletal pain from repetitive microtraumas) and traumatic injuries (resulting from sudden force or forces applied to the body). The most frequent injuries caused by ECPs reported by the authors studied were those located in: shoulders; the spine, especially in the lumbar region; arms and elbows; hands and wrists; knees; hips and thighs; ankles; necks and chests and feet (figure 1). Hak et al affirm that the higher prevalence of shoulder injuries can be explained by their frequent submission to hyperflexion, internal rotation and abduction, placing the shoulders in a position of risk. Although the incidence of injuries is higher in the locomotor system, other injuries have been reported, such as retinal detachment and carotid dissection. Tibana et al have also pointed out the risk of exacerbated inflammatory response after ECPs.

Work, fitness, and environment modification — activities that increase pain (work-related or fitness) should be assessed and modified by altering movement or alignment or reducing intensity; in femoroacetabular impingement, flexibility routines may need to limit aggressive end-range flexion or internal rotation stretches, and feasible environmental changes to decrease repetitive shear forces should be made, such as using a higher seat position during cycling to keep the hips higher than the knees and avoid excessive hip flexion.

Qualitative Interview

Participant 1 recounted his history of playing contact sports, resulting in frequent pain, particularly in his shoulder. He disclosed having undergone four surgical interventions on his shoulder, referring to it as "a lifetime sentence" of pain. Despite this, he clarified that he did not consider himself to have chronic pain, explaining, "I've put myself in situations where I feel temporary pain, but I have no chronic pain". During his space training program, he sustained a knee injury unrelated to the training but endured "intense pain" during several SpaceX simulations.

Upon exposure to microgravity, Participant 1 described experiencing lower back pain and headaches. Although the low-back pain subsided after two to three days on the International Space Station (ISS), he continued to experience a "higher than normal number of headaches". He also noted feelings of "nausea, disorientation, and general discomfort", which gradually improved over two to three days. Remarkably, he expressed relief at the absence of shoulder pain throughout the seventeen days in space, stating, "I did not notice any shoulder pain at all for the seventeen days that I was in space. That was great!"

However, upon his return to Earth, he reported that the pain in his shoulder had returned "back to where it was before". Additionally, he mentioned experiencing muscle soreness and stiffness, particularly in his calves, immediately upon return, likening it to having had an intense calf workout. He further described low back pain, which he characterized as "spasming", although seven days after his return to Earth (R+7), he reported that the muscle soreness and low back pain had mostly subsided, remarking, "my muscles are getting used to carrying my body around in 1G".

Participant 1 also shared his pain management strategies during spaceflight. He explained how he had to develop his own technique for donning the space suit due to his shoulder pain. To manage low back pain and headaches during his initial days on-orbit, he self-administered ibuprofen (400mg every four to six hours). Upon returning to Earth, he used Robaxacet to treat his low back pain, and all three of these strategies proved successful in managing his pain.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Levofloxacin (lee" voe flox' a sin) Tablets USP

What is the most important information I should know about levofloxacin tablets? Levofloxacin tablets, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death.

If you have any of the following serious side effects while you take levofloxacin tablets, you should stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away. 1. Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).

Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take levofloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Some tendon problems include:
pain
swelling
tears and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take levofloxacin tablets are higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take levofloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Avoid exercise and using the affected area.
The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking levofloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days of taking levofloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after people have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking levofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight

### Common orthopaedic injuries in crossFit athletes [^113BWGEq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

CrossFit is a high-intensity exercise program that has gained popularity over the past few decades. CrossFit combines movements from Olympic weight lifting, gymnastics, powerlifting, and high-intensity interval training. As CrossFit continues to expand, knowledge of the associated orthopaedic injuries to aid providers in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention will be increasingly important. The most common CrossFit injuries occur in the shoulder (25% of all injuries), spine (14%), and knee (13%). Male athletes are markedly more likely to experience injuries than female athletes, and injuries occur markedly less when there is supervised coaching of the athletes. The most common causes of injury in CrossFit include improper form and exacerbation of a prior injury. The purpose of this article was to review the literature to aid clinicians in identifying and treating common orthopaedic injuries in CrossFit athletes. Understanding the injury patterns, treatment, and prevention options is important for a successful recovery and return to sport.

### High-intensity versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis [^115ydiJu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise or physical activity is recommended for improving pain and functional status in people with knee or hip osteoarthritis. These are complex interventions whose effectiveness depends on one or more components that are often poorly identified. It has been suggested that health benefits may be greater with high-intensity rather than low-intensity exercise or physical activity.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of high- versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise programs in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; issue 06, 2014), MEDLINE (194 8 to June 2014), EMBASE (198 0 to June 2014), CINAHL (1982 to June 2014), PEDro (1929 to June 2014), SCOPUS (to June 2014) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Registry Platform (to June 2014) for articles, without a language restriction. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, trials, and reference lists and contacted researchers and experts in the ﬁeld to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of people with knee or hip osteoarthritis that compared high- versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise programs between the experimental and control group. High-intensity physical activity or exercise programs training had to refer to an increase in the overall amount of training time (frequency, duration, number of sessions) or the amount of work (strength, number of repetitions) or effort/energy expenditure (exertion, heart rate, effort).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data on trial details. We contacted authors for additional information if necessary. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included reports for six studies of 656 participants that compared high- and low-intensity exercise programs; five studies exclusively recruited people with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (620 participants), and one study exclusively recruited people with hip or knee osteoarthritis (36 participants). The majority of the participants were females (70%). No studies evaluated physical activity programs. We found the overall quality of evidence to be low to very low due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision (small number of studies, large confidence intervals) for the major outcomes using the GRADE approach. Most of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias for several domains, and we judged five of the six studies to be at high risk for performance, detection, and attrition bias. Low-quality evidence indicated reduced pain on a 20-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale (mean difference (MD) -0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.63 to -0.04; 4% absolute reduction, 95% CI -8% to 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 14 to 22) and improved physical function on the 68-point WOMAC disability subscale (MD -2.65, 95% CI -5.29 to -0.01; 4% absolute reduction; NNTB 10, 95% CI 8 to 13) immediately at the end of the exercise programs (from 8 to 24 weeks). However, these results are unlikely to be of clinical importance. These small improvements did not continue at longer-term follow-up (up to 40 weeks after the end of the intervention). We are uncertain of the effect on quality of life, as only one study reported this outcome (0 to 200 scale; MD 4.3, 95% CI -6.5 to 15.2; 2% absolute reduction; very low level of evidence). Our subgroup analyses provided uncertain evidence as to whether increased exercise time (duration, number of sessions) and level of resistance (strength or effort) have an impact on the exercise program effects. Three studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. The number of dropouts was small. Only one study systematically monitored adverse effects, but four studies reported some adverse effects related to knee pain associated with an exercise program. We are uncertain as to whether high intensity increases the number of adverse effects (Peto odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.81; - 2% absolute risk reduction; very low level of evidence). None of the included studies reported serious adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-quality to low-quality evidence for no important clinical benefit of high-intensity compared to low-intensity exercise programs in improving pain and physical function in the short term. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of different types of intensity of exercise programs. We are uncertain as to whether higher-intensity exercise programs may induce more harmful effects than those of lower intensity; this must be evaluated by further studies. Withdrawals due to adverse events were poorly monitored and not reported systematically in each group. We downgraded the evidence to low or very low because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The small number of studies comparing high- and low-intensity exercise programs in osteoarthritis underscores the need for more studies investigating the dose-response relationship in exercise programs. In particular, further studies are needed to establish the minimal intensity of exercise programs needed for clinical effect and the highest intensity patients can tolerate. Larger studies should comply with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist and systematically report harms data to evaluate the potential impact of highest intensities of exercise programs in people with joint damage.

Limitations

A limitation of this study was that we could not calculate the athlete exposure. It is important to analyse the athlete exposure separately according to the diagnoses, as noted in the study by Zacharyto determine the cause of the injury. However, athlete exposure was substituted by the injury rate per 100 registered athletes based on the report of Mountjoy in this study. In the future, athlete exposure should be calculated and detailed analysis must be conducted. In this study, it was also impossible to establish a control group. The reason for this was that all the subjects in this study were national team swimmers, and could not be distinguished between swimmers. Therefore, in this study, we set up two groups before and after implementation of the prevention project.

Furthermore, we could not calculate the compliance rate of training interventions. During this intervention period, the physiotherapists supervised swimmer's exercise techniques at major international competitions and national training camps every day, so that swimmers were familiar with the proper exercise techniques and understood the importance of the exercises. In particular, knee, shoulder and lower back injuries increased from 2012 to 2015, which may be related to the change of training such as high-intensity training and weight training, but the causal relationship is unknown.

In the future, we would like to survey the incidence of injuries based on athlete exposure and type of training and investigate the effect of injury prevention intervention for the shoulder and knee joints, because the incidence of shoulder and knee joint injuries was found to be increasing as per an injury surveillance study.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterised by muscle necrosis followed by the release of intracellular muscle contents into the circulation. When rhabdomyolysis occurs due to exercise, it is termed 'exertional rhabdomyolysis'. Exertional rhabdomyolysis occurs in response to non-familiar and/or excessive, prolonged or repetitive exercises, with eccentric characteristics.

Nowadays, with the rapid expansion of ECPs, reports of rhabdomyolysis have also increased (table 2). Pearcey et al reported the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in an athlete who, after 3 months without training, initiated the practice of high-intensity sports in a sudden and intense manner. According to the authors, the athlete's subjective notion of myalgia was impaired due to intense motivation and the use of pre-workout supplement. Meyer et al emphasised the seriousness of rhabdomyolysis and reported its occurrence in a previously healthy 31-year-old woman. Despite being a regular practitioner who performed exercises four times a week, she exhibited the syndrome after the first CrossFit training. The authors also argued that myoglobinuria and myalgia were not mandatory findings, given that only 50% of the cases exhibited the characteristic exacerbated muscular pain. This is why the main diagnostic criterion is based on laboratory quantification of creatine kinase (CK). Additionally, in a study conducted with a greater number of cases, Lozowska et al reported six events of rhabdomyolysis associated with CrossFit practice. Previously healthy patients — some of them with considerable experience with the modality and no family history — had exhibited manifestations such as exacerbated myalgia after the first 24 hours of training, especially in the muscular regions which were more vigorously demanded during the exercise. Half of them had good physical fitness before the event, having practised the modality from months to years. It should be noted that the onset of clinical manifestations does not occur immediately after physical exertion, as reported by Larsen et al, who found that signs and symptoms had only appeared 3 days after the training that had given rise to the condition. Recently, Tibana et al described an instance of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis, caused by an ECPs competition, in a 35-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and soreness, which began 1 day after she had completed 2 days of an ECPs competition composed of five workouts. Interestingly, although she had more than 5 years of experience in ECPs, during the competition, one workout consisted of 60 repetitions of glutes-hamstring developer (unaccustomed exercise) that precipitated the rhabdomyolysis.

### Pain in persons with postpolio syndrome: frequency, intensity, and impact [^115exzBj]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the frequency, intensity, and impact of pain in persons with postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS).

Design

Retrospective, cross-sectional survey.

Setting

Community-based survey.

Participants

Convenience sample of people with PPS.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Overall intensity and duration of pain, pain sites, pain interference, pain treatments, and relief provided by pain treatments.

Results

A total of 91% (n = 57) of the study participants (N = 63) reported pain. The most frequently reported pain sites were the shoulders, lower back, legs, and hips. Participants reported pain intensity to be the greatest in the knees, legs, wrists, lower back, and head. Pain interfered most with sleep and with activities requiring a high level of musculoskeletal involvement. Respondents also reported pain problems that were more severe than those of the general population and than those of a sample of people with multiple sclerosis. Many treatments had been tried previously for pain, but continued use of treatments was reported by relatively few participants at the time of the survey.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that pain is a persistent and common problem in persons with PPS, highlighting the need for effective and accessible pain treatments for this population.

Medication Guide

Medication Guide

Ciprofloxacin (sip"roe flox'a sin) Tablets, USP

for oral use

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking ciprofloxacin tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin tablets?

Ciprofloxacin tablets, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicine, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death.

If you get any of the following serious side effects while you take ciprofloxacin tablets, you should stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).
Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take ciprofloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include:
Pain
Swelling
tears and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, thumb, or other tendon sites.
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take ciprofloxacin tablets is higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take ciprofloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking ciprofloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days of taking ciprofloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after people have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight
The tendon problems may be permanent.
Changes in sensation and possible nerve damage (Peripheral Neuropathy). Damage to the nerves in arms, hands, legs, or feet can happen in people who take fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and talk to your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in your arms, hands, legs, or feet:

Knee Pain and/or Involvement of the Flexor and Extensor Muscles

In the last two decades, the incidence of knee pain has increased by approximately 65%. At the present time, affects around 25% of the adult population and warrants nearly 4 million visits to primary care physicians each year. The assessment of knee pain requires careful consideration of the patient's medical history and physical examination. The medical history can provide vital insights into the site and duration of the discomfort, recent traumatic events, and prior medical and/or surgical procedures. The physical examination can identify potential lymphovascular involvement, deformities, asymmetry, signs of acute inflammation, and limitation of Range Of Motion (R.O.M). Laboratory tests may be utilized to confirm a specific diagnosis when the initial medical history and physical examination provide clues but fail to establish a definitive diagnosis. In contrast, radiographic imaging is most appropriate in cases of acute traumatic pain or chronic knee pain.

Symptoms and Signs

Knee pain can arise in various ways, including acute or chronic forms, occuring only during motion or even at rest, and with or without functional impairments such as weakness, instability, stiffness, inability to fully extend the knee, or difficulty walking. Manifestations of acute inflammation include warmth to the touch, redness, and swelling. Additionally, popping or creaking sounds may be audible.

Possible Differential Diagnoses

Acute trauma or its consequences, acute sprains, direct or indirect muscle injury, pes anserine tendinopathy, Baker's cyst, overuse/overload pathology (including degenerative meniscopathy, early OA, and DOMS in athletes) and phlebo-lymphological pathology can all contribute to knee pain.

Conditions That Warrant Consideration

Beyond the aforementioned factors, body weight, posture modifications, axis deviations, and biomechanical changes are additional conditions worth considering when addressing knee pain.

### Effect of high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training in people with poststroke gait dysfunction: a Randomized clinical trial [^112M54F5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

High‐Intensity Interval Training

In the first 4 weeks of HIIT training (ie, weeks 5–8), only HIIT workout #1 was prescribed (3 sessions/week). Thereafter, workout #1 was reduced to 1 session/week, and workout #2 was carried out 2 sessions/week. HIIT Workout #1: Participants were prescribed 30 seconds of maximal safe intensity alternating with 60 seconds of active recovery(~30%–40% of peak HR attained on the CPET or rating of perceived exertion of 10–12 [" light "]) (Table S1). Starting with 3 HIIT intervals, an increasing number of intervals was prescribed so that after 4 weeks, all 15 HIIT intervals were completed. HIIT Workout # 2: Four weeks after Workout #1 was initiated, intervals of 2 minutes of maximal safe intensity alternating with 3 minutes of active recovery were prescribed. Each HIIT workout was approximately 20 to 22 minutes with additional 5‐minute warm‐up and cool‐down periods. The first high‐intensity interval of each workout included a gradual ramp‐up to target intensity. To determine HIIT intensity, the treadmill speed was ramped up every 5 seconds until a maximal tolerable safe speed was attained (terminated when drifting to the distal end of the treadmill or gait instability). Following a brief rest and starting at the previously determined maximal speed, the incline gradually increased until a maximal tolerable grade was reached. The ability to sustain this intensity at shorter and longer intervals was then assessed, and the speed/grade was adjusted as necessary. A combination of the following also guided the intensity: rating of perceived exertion of ≥ 17 (very hard); the workload or HR that occurred at ≥ 91% ofon the CPET; and the HR/workload above the. The treadmill speed and incline were reassessed every 3 weeks and then readjusted based on the results of the 12‐week CPET.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^115y272t]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Isokinetic dynamometry in strength assessment — Isokinetic strength testing requires specialized and relatively expensive dynamometers and quantifies force production capacity at a predetermined velocity throughout the range of motion; compared with isoinertial testing limited by a biomechanical "sticking point", isokinetic testing is better at assessing strength through the full range of motion, although the same-velocity condition violates the kinetics of most athletic movements; an advantage is the ability to specifically assess eccentric contractions, and because eccentric strength is important for decelerations, assessing both concentric and eccentric strength may provide more in-depth information for training individualization; given equipment cost and procedures, testing is usually confined to laboratories but may be utilized in highly professional team sport settings, with movements such as leg press, knee extension, knee flexion, and elbow/shoulder movements commonly assessed.

### Evaluation of rehabilitation exercise effects by using gradation-based skeletal muscle echo intensity in older individuals: a one-group before-and-after trial [^115xNka3]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Rehabilitation exercise program

As part of the rehabilitation program, participants performed rehabilitation exercises once or twice a week for 6 months. The exercise program consisted of resistance and endurance exercises under the supervision of a physical therapist (T.S.). This program was similarly performed in previous studies. Each session comprised of a warm-up (20 min), resistance tube, grasping a resistance ball with hands and catching a small ball using the toes (20 min), massage by a physical therapist (20 min), resistance exercise (20 min), endurance exercise (20 min), and a cool down (20 min), and was completed within 2.5 h, including a break. On each exercise day, participants performed resistance exercise programs using a hydraulic-resistance machine (Well-Round; Mizuno, Tokyo, Japan). Participants performed resistance exercises, such as hip adduction/abduction, knee extension/flexion, leg press, seated row, back extension/abdominal crunch, back twist, chest press, and shoulder press. Three or four resistance exercises were selected by the physical therapist considering the participant's physical condition. Basically, we selected the programs based on the balance of upper and lower body parts to avoid excessive fatigue. Participants were instructed to move through the full range of motion for each resistance exercise movement as quickly as possible. Exercise intensity was basically set to approximately 30–50% of each participant's maximum effort (same as 10–12 on the Borg scale) as previously performed. Each resistance exercise program continued for 5 min, with 2 min of rest between programs. After the short break, participants randomly performed endurance exercises on a recumbent stepper or recumbent cycle machine (NuStep, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The workload was selectable from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest); it was set as high as possible and continued for 10 min. All participants started with the lowest load (dial 1) in both resistance and endurance exercises in the first class, and the intensity was determined. The intensity of resistance and endurance exercises was set according to individuals' exercise capacity level, and it was flexibly changed according to the participant's physical condition on the day of the exercise. In some situations, such as when participants were not feeling well and/or had some pain, a physical therapist changed the exercise menu, volume, and intensity accordingly.

Closed-chain exercise protocols are used extensively in rehabilitation of knee injuries and are increasingly used in rehabilitation of shoulder injuries. They are felt to be preferable to other exercise programs in that they simulate normal physiologic and biomechanical functions, create little shear stress across injured or healing joints, and reproduce proprioceptive stimuli. Because of these advantages, they may be used early in rehabilitation and have been integral parts of "accelerated" rehabilitation programs. The authors review the important components of a closed-chain rehabilitation program and provide examples of specific exercises that are used for rehabilitation of knee and shoulder injuries.

### "I' D rather do that (knee control) than be injured and not able to play": a qualitative study on youth floorball players' and coaches' perspectives of how to overcome barriers for injury prevention exercise programme use [^114atrsv]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tailoring of the preventive training to the team

Players and coaches discussed alternatives to tailor the preventive training to the team, such as to adjust the time when Knee Control is performed during training and the location to minimise the barrier of limited access to the court. Some players and coaches described that they had solved the issue of limited training time on the court by performing the preventive training outdoors or in a corridor next to the court before the court time started. Others described that they had longer training sessions and did preventive training on the court, sometimes at the end of the training.

Players and coaches gave examples of how to adapt and progress the preventive training to facilitate programme use; for example, performing the exercises for a set duration instead of counting repetitions, and players also described that they changed to another exercise to avoid pain or when they were unable to do an exercise due to injury. Players and coaches offered other examples of how to adapt and progress the preventive training by starting early, progressing gradually, keeping it simple, and choosing exercises that fit the team. Players and coaches wished to make the preventive training more fun by adding joyful components to facilitate programme use; for example, using a floorball stick and ball, adding competitive elements, and varying the exercises.

"If it works, you are outdoors, but in almost all training halls there is at least a small corridor where there is room for everyone. There are variations of these exercises where you don't need as much space. So, we are always warmed up when our training time starts and have finished these exercises and can continue with regular floorball when we get access to the court". (Group 8, coach 2)

"When we do partner exercises and things like that, you can compete a bit too and make it fun that way. It can certainly be boring, but you can make it fun too, by competing". (Group 5, player 4)

"I prefer the stick because it's always with me and it's associated with floorball. You have the stick for practice, and you have it for matches. So, we do squats with a stick, lunges with a stick, side bends, all that stuff". (Group 7, coach 4)

### Instability of the proximal tibiofibular joint [^112oebL3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Injury to the proximal tibiofibular joint is typically seen in athletes whose sports require violent twisting motions of the flexed knee. Instability of this joint may be in the anterolateral, posteromedial, or superior directions. With acute injury, patients usually complain of pain and a prominence in the lateral aspect of the knee. A closed reduction should be attempted in patients with acute dislocation. If this is unsuccessful, open reduction and stabilization of the joint with repair of the injured capsule and ligaments can be done. Patients with chronic dislocation or subluxation report lateral knee pain and instability with popping and catching, which may be confused with lateral meniscal injury. Symptoms of subluxation may be treated nonsurgically with physical therapies such as activity modification, supportive straps, and knee strengthening. For patients with chronic pain or instability, surgical options include arthrodesis, fibular head resection, and proximal tibiofibular joint capsule reconstruction.

### Risk factors for exertional rhabdomyolysis with renal stress [^117QHapr]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present findings confirm that sustained high-intensity physical activity is a crucial risk factor for the development of exertional rhabdomyolysis. All the patients reported that they continued with their high-intensity exercise despite significant muscular pain. Therefore, failure to identify individual physical performance limits — both at an individual and supervisory level — appears to play an important role. However, at an early stage, it may be difficult to distinguish between ordinary training soreness and pathological muscle pain of rhabdomyolysis before it is too late. Typically, rhabdomyolysis occurs in healthy people when exposed to unaccustomed exercise, as was the case for these new recruits.

### Overuse injuries and burnout in youth sports: a position statement from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine [^114g7ZJC]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Training workload — overuse injury in youth has been shown to be related to higher workloads, including training volume and intensity. Limiting weekly and yearly participation time, limits on sport-specific repetitive movements (eg, pitch count limits), and scheduled rest periods are recommended. (B) Such modifications need to be individualized based upon the sport and the athlete's age, growth rate, readiness, and injury history. (C) Careful monitoring of training workload during the adolescent growth spurt is recommended, as injury risk seems to be greater during this phase. (B) The apparent increased risk may be related to a number of factors including diminished size-adjusted bone mineral density, asynchronous growth patterns, relative weakness of growth cartilage, and physeal vascular susceptibility.

### The accumulation of performance fatigue and perceptual responses across consecutive high-intensity interval and constant-load cycling sessions [^11791yMA]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In numerous sport and occupational settings, individuals often need to perform multiple exercise sessions in 1 d or across consecutive days, yet performance and perceptual responses to such exercise paradigms are unclear.

Purpose

This study investigated performance fatigue and perceptual responses to repeated, consecutive sessions of high-intensity interval (HIIT) and constant-work rate (CWR) cycling bouts performed within 24 h.

Methods

Seventeen healthy adults (nine females, aged 25 ± 6 yr) exercised in the morning, same afternoon, and following morning. Sessions consisted of work- and duration-matched HIIT (2 min at 80% peak power output (PPO) interspersed by 2 min at 25% PPO) and CWR cycling (38 min at 54% PPO). A time-to-task failure (TTF) trial at 80% PPO was completed followed by both morning sessions. Neuromuscular assessments, including isometric knee extension maximal voluntary contraction coupled with superimposed and potentiated (Q tw) twitches, elicited via electrical stimuli to the femoral nerve, were performed before and after workouts, and after the TTF. Blood lactate and perceptual responses were also measured.

Results

TTF trials were longer following CWR than HIIT (P < 0.001). Across consecutive sessions, voluntary activation remained depressed, and this was accompanied by progressive impairments in cycling TTF following CWR (P = 0.006). Conversely, maximal voluntary contraction and Q tw returned to baseline values by the beginning of each HIIT and CWR session. Perceived effort and dyspnea were higher in HIIT but were not exacerbated across sessions.

Conclusions

Although declined voluntary and evoked force-generating capacities did not persist in this study, consecutive exercise could compromise the recovery of voluntary activation and endurance performance.

### Effects of controlled supramaximal high-intensity interval training on muscle capacities and physical functions for older adults: analysis of secondary outcomes from the ume å HIT study-a randomised controlled trial [^1131SCrH]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Muscle capacities

Leg power

Maximal leg extensor muscle power was assessed with the Nottingham Power Rig. Participants were seated with pelvic support against the backrest. They were instructed to push as fast as possible with a single leg against a moving plate over 16.5 cm. The instructor provided verbal encouragement at initiation of the movement. At the end of the movement, the leg was almost fully extended. Power was inferred from angular velocity and inertia of a flywheel. Out of at least five successive trials, the trial with the largest power of each leg was noted (W). The results of the right and left leg were averaged. For participants with complete values for only one leg at baseline or follow-up, the single value was used.

Hand grip strength

Maximal isometric hand grip strength was assessed using a Jamar hand dynamometer (Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL). Participants were seated with the shoulder in an anatomical neutral position, elbow at 90 degrees, and wrist in a semiprone position. Participants were allowed a series of warm up trials, followed by two maximal trials for each hand. The participants were instructed to gradually increase force up to maximum force and hold this contraction for four to five seconds. The instructor provided verbal encouragement during the contraction. The participants were alternating between hands and there was a 1-minute rest period between trials. The best values in Newton for the left and right hand were averaged and then divided by body weight (N/kg). For participants with complete values only for one hand at baseline or follow-up, the single value was used.

### Effect of high-intensity strength training on knee pain and knee joint compressive forces among adults with knee osteoarthritis: the START randomized clinical trial [^113c4zrx]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thigh muscle weakness is associated with knee discomfort and osteoarthritis disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of high-intensity strength training in patients with knee osteoarthritis or whether it may worsen knee symptoms.

Objective

To determine whether high-intensity strength training reduces knee pain and knee joint compressive forces more than low-intensity strength training and more than attention control in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted at a university research center in North Carolina that included 377 community-dwelling adults (≥ 50 years) with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 20 to 45 and with knee pain and radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Enrollment occurred between July 2012 and February 2016, and follow-up was completed September 2017.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to high-intensity strength training (n = 127), low-intensity strength training (n = 126), or attention control (n = 124).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes at the 18-month follow-up were Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain (0 best-20 worst; minimally clinically important difference [MCID, 2]) and knee joint compressive force, defined as the maximal tibiofemoral contact force exerted along the long axis of the tibia during walking (MCID, unknown).

Results

Among 377 randomized participants (mean age, 65 years; 151 women [40%]), 320 (85%) completed the trial. Mean adjusted (sex, baseline BMI, baseline outcome values) WOMAC pain scores at the 18-month follow-up were not statistically significantly different between the high-intensity group and the control group (5.1 vs 4.9; adjusted difference, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1; P = 0.61) or between the high-intensity and low-intensity groups (5.1 vs 4.4; adjusted difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.6; P = 0.08). Mean knee joint compressive forces were not statistically significantly different between the high-intensity group and the control group (2453 N vs 2512 N; adjusted difference, -58; 95% CI, -282 to 165 N; P = 0.61), or between the high-intensity and low-intensity groups (2453 N vs 2475 N; adjusted difference, -21; 95% CI, -235 to 193 N; P = 0.85). There were 87 nonserious adverse events (high-intensity, 53; low-intensity, 30; control, 4) and 13 serious adverse events unrelated to the study (high-intensity, 5; low-intensity, 3; control, 5).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with knee osteoarthritis, high-intensity strength training compared with low-intensity strength training or an attention control did not significantly reduce knee pain or knee joint compressive forces at 18 months. The findings do not support the use of high-intensity strength training over low-intensity strength training or an attention control in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

### Osteoarthritis: rapid evidence review [^111DRtqP]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) should be suspected in patients with pain in the fingers, shoulders, hips, knees, or ankles, especially if they are older than 40 years. Patients older than 50 years who have joint pain, minimal morning stiffness, and functional impairment likely have OA. Radiography can confirm the diagnosis and may be helpful before surgical referral, but findings generally do not correlate well with symptoms. Exercise, physical therapy, knee taping, and tai chi are beneficial for knee OA. Medical therapy provides modest benefits in pain reduction and functional improvement; however, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, and other opioids have significant potential harms. Joint replacement may be considered for patients with moderate to severe pain and radiographically confirmed OA. Corticosteroid injections may be helpful in the short term. Vitamin D supplements, shoes specifically designed for persons with OA, antioxidant supplements, physical therapy for hip OA, ionized wrist bracelets, lateral wedge insoles for medial knee OA, and hyaluronic acid injections are not effective.

### Health challenges and acute sports injuries restrict weightlifting training of older athletes [^116eWWvj]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Variable importance of predictors

The variable importance metric ascertains the relative contribution of a particular covariate to the accuracy of the prediction but does not indicate whether a variable is a risk factor for injuries. Age-related variables such as age, age at start of weightlifting or years of experience were among the top three predictors for injury locations. Training frequency or length of session for groups of exercises (warm-up, cool-down, supplementary) were also top predictors. Sex, chronic inflammation/osteoarthritis were rated high for shoulder injuries, while training programmes (own or coach) were important for back, knee and wrist injuries (table 3, online supplemental table S4, figure S3).

Table 3
Top predictors for injury locations ranked by variable importance metric

Expert model estimates

A subset of variables was selected based on expert feedback and included in logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of an acute injury sustained during weightlifting for the injury locations. Men were almost two times as likely to sustain injuries for shoulders, back, knees or wrists than women (table 4). Injuries are more likely to occur at younger ages for knees and wrists. Chronic inflammation/osteoarthritis increased the risk at all injury locations. Following their own programme may be associated with shoulder injuries, but this could be confounded with age, since older male weightlifters are more likely to follow their own programme. Longer time spent on supplementary exercises were associated with sustaining wrist injuries and longer time to cool-down was associated with an increased risk for shoulder injuries. Concurrent yoga/Pilates lowered the risk of back injuries. Those who believe that following a training-specific nutrition programme was important for their weightlifting training (ie, recovery, muscle increase) were less likely to report a shoulder injury. Following their own programme was associated with knee injuries. Concurrent training in CrossFit was associated with back injuries. However, prior sport participation (body building, power lifting, ball sports, gymnastics) was not associated with an injury risk sustained during weightlifting.

### Effectiveness of a muticomponent workout program integrated in an evidence based multimodal program in hyperfrail elderly patients: POWERAGING randomized clinical trial protocol [^113E9mFv]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Experimental group

Each one of this group's participants will undergo the following schedule three times a week every alternative day. It will consist in one specific strength training and another for endurance (sequenced in this order). Before beginning the strength training the participants will carry out two habituating sets to practice the training tests to be performed. After the second habituation session, the 1st RM (maximum repetitions) will be calculated. Each one of them will perform nine exercises: bench press, inclined leg press, seated row, leg extension, back opening, hamstring curl, triceps curl, biceps curl and crunches. These exercises have been chosen to emphasise the synergy between major and smaller muscle groups, as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. During the first four weeks, the subjects will perform two series of 18–20 maximum repetitions (RM), shifting to 15–17 RM (weeks 5–9). In weeks 10 to 14, the subjects will perform two series of 15 to 19 RM, shifting to three series of 8–10 RM (weeks 13–16), changing to 6–8 RM (weeks 20–24). The workload per session will be adjusted if the number of repetitions were to be more or less than what was just stated. The recovery time between sets ranged from 90s to 120 s. The estimated time of each strength training session will be 40 min.

An endurance training session will be performed using a cycloergometre and with an intensity relative to the Heart Rate (IRHR). During the first four weeks, the subjects will pedal for 20 min at 80% of their IRHR, moving ahead to 25 min at 85–90% of their IRHR from weeks five to nine. From weeks ten to eighteen, the subjects will cycle for 30 min at 95% of their IRHR and during the last five weeks of training (weeks 20 to 24), the subjects will perform six (6) series of four minutes at 100% of their IRHR, with one minute of active recovery between series.

All training sessions will be carefully supervised by a physiotherapist experienced in therapeutic training. It will be the physiotherapist as well who will conduct the health education during the training sessions. Furthermore, each one of the experimental group patients will undergo a medication review and they will be handed in a diet adjustment plan.

### Injuries in weightlifting and powerlifting: an updated systematic review [^114E1cKo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

According to this review, injury in weightlifting was predominantly found in the knees, lower back, hands/fingers and shoulders. This could be attributed to the greater range of motion required at the knee joint during weightlifting exercises, such as the squat, which is performed to a greater depth than in powerlifting. Swinton et al supported this by demonstrating that traditional weightlifting squats resulted in higher biomechanical forces at the knee and ankle, associated with increased flexion angles at both joints. In contrast, powerlifting squats typically involve a more vertical shin angle, resulting in less anterior displacement of the knee and greater muscular forces generated at the hip and lumbar spine, which might explain the comparatively higher prevalence of hip injuries, as shown in Stromback et al

### Chronic pain management in the obese patient: a focused review of key challenges and potential exercise solutions [^113gK1yo]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

For individuals experiencing pain too disabling for regular movement, pain reduction is paramount for breaking the cycle of pain-related inhibition of exercise. Depending on the location of the pain and the severity, several medications may be used to reduce pain to make exercise more tolerable. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin can help control inflammatory processes associated with obesity and pain severity. Procedural treatments such as intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid preparations into the knee, hip, or shoulder may be used for immediate and long-term pain relief, thereby allowing the individual to exercise, burn calories, and improve function.

Exercise-induced joint pain should not persist or increase by 24 hours after exercise, which is an indication that the musculoskeletal system was not prepared for the exercise, or physical days will permit the individual to make a self-assessment of the pain response. If an obese person with preexisting mild joint pain starts activity (< 3 points out of a 10-point scale), similar guidelines apply: the pain should not worsen during the exercise session or last into the next day. If the pain causes a limp or a compensatory gait change, the exercise volume must be reduced, or the exercise must be stopped until a normal gait pattern is achieved. It has been suggested that strengthening exercise or RX be initiated prior to starting a formal AX program to help develop muscle strength, joint support, and stability. Control of exercise pain and functional ability may foster enjoyment of exercise and better adherence.

### Shorter high-intensity cycling intervals reduce performance and perceived fatigability at work-matched but not task failure [^115fxa2d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The intensity, duration, and distribution of work and recovery phases during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) modulate metabolic perturbations during exercise and subsequently influence the development of performance fatigability and exercise tolerance. This study aimed to characterize neuromuscular, perceptual, and cardiorespiratory responses to work-to-rest ratio-matched HIIT protocols differing in work and rest interval duration.

Methods

Twelve healthy individuals (six women) first completed a ramp incremental test to determine 90% of peak power output, and then in three randomized visits, they completed three cycling protocols to task failure at 90% of peak power output: (i) 3- to 3-min work-to-passive rest ratio HIIT (HIIT 3min), (ii) 1- to 1-min work-to-passive rest ratio HIIT (HIIT 1min), and (iii) constant load (CL). Interpolated twitch technique, including maximal voluntary isometric knee extensions and femoral nerve electrical stimuli, was performed at baseline, every 6 min of work, and task failure. Perceptual and cardiorespiratory responses were recorded every 3 min and continuously across the exercises, respectively.

Results

The work completed during HIIT 1min (8447 ± 5124 kJ) was considerably greater than HIIT 3min (1930 ± 712 kJ) and CL (1076 ± 356) (P < 0.001). At work-matched, HIIT 1min resulted in a lesser decline in maximal voluntary contraction and twitch force compared with HIIT 3min and CL (P < 0.001). Perceived effort, pain, and dyspnea were least in HIIT 1min and HIIT 3min compared with CL (P < 0.001). At task failure, HIIT 1min resulted in less voluntary activation than HIIT 3min (P = 0.010) and CL (P = 0.043), and engendered less twitch force decline than CL (P = 0.021).

Conclusions

Overall, the mitigated physiological and perceptual responses during shorter work periods (HIIT 1min) enhance exercise tolerance in comparison to longer work intervals at the same intensity (HIIT 3min, CL).

### Work participation and working life expectancy after a disabling shoulder lesion [^114GiDVf]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our results are in line with a previously published study reporting a high co-occurrence of shoulder pain with pain in other regions (93% in the neck, 75% in forearm or hands, 50% in low back, 40% in knees and 44% in ankles or feet) in female kitchen workers. In our study, persons with a disabling shoulder lesion were more frequently exposed to heavy lifting than the general population. Heavy lifting is a known risk factor for low back pain and osteoarthritis, particularly in the knee and hip joint and could thereby explain the high musculoskeletal comorbidity observed in our study.

Mental disorders were the second most common comorbid cause of disability retirement in our study. The result is in line with earlier findings on the co-occurrences of shoulder pain with mental problems and sleep disturbances. Although a relationship between cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes and smoking) and shoulder disorders was reported in a systematic review, the proportion of persons retired due to cardiovascular diseases was similar to that of the general population.

Intervention — Procedures and Protocols

Exercise groups

HR training was used for the exercise protocols. HR measured at peak aerobic capacity (HR peak) was used to calibrate HR training zones from baseline to 6 wk. After the CPET at week 6, the training zones were recalibrated based on the newly measured HR peak. Participants randomized to one of the exercise groups were instructed to present to the Cancer Prevention Center three times per week for 12 wk to complete their workouts. Participants were not required to complete their workouts at the same time of day on the same days every week and were able to schedule their workouts as their schedules allowed on a weekly basis with study personnel. All workouts were completed on a treadmill, and both exercise protocols were matched in estimated total energy expenditure. Participants in the exercise groups also completed monthly in-person motivational interviewing sessions with study personnel and received text messages related to the intervention three times per week.

HIIT and MICT

Participants randomized to HIIT completed a 5-min warm-up at 50%–70% HR peak, followed by four 4-min intervals at 90%–100% HR peak. Each 4-min high-intensity interval was followed by 3 min of active recovery at 50%–70% HR peak. The final 3-min active recovery interval served as the cooldown. The total exercise time of the HIIT protocol was 33 min. We measured HR and RPE at the end of the warm-up and each high-intensity and active recovery interval. The MICT protocol consisted of a continuous 41-min workout at 60%–70% HR peak. We measured HR and RPE in 5-min increments throughout the duration of the workout.

Monthly motivational interviewing sessions

Individuals randomized to the exercise groups participated in monthly one-on-one, in-person motivational interviewing sessions with trained study personnel. All sessions were approximately 15–30 min in length. These sessions were held before or after the participant's supervised exercise session. Within these sessions, strategies for overcoming barriers to attending exercise sessions were discussed along with strategies to continue physical activity upon completion of the program.

Text messaging

Participants randomized to the exercise groups received a total of 36 text messages throughout the study, three messages per week. The content of the text messages was based on the self-determination theory and was used to both help motivate participants to complete their workouts and remind participants to come in for their scheduled workouts.

### Effectiveness of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training, and resistance and aerobic exercise for cardiovascular health in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HIRAC-COPD): a randomized controlled trial protocol [^112yneti]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention design and strategy

The two intervention groups will receive intervention for eight weeks after participants' recruitment into the study. Participants will undergo assessments at baseline, 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks to observe changes in their arterial stiffness. This three-arm randomized controlled trial will compare the reduction of baPWV in the bundle arm and the H-IMT arm with that in the control arm. The study will be conducted at the pulmonary rehabilitation center of the local town hospital. A total of 16 training sessions will be carried out over 8 weeks (2× per week), supervised and monitored by two experienced physiotherapists specialized in pulmonary rehabilitation. The detailed intervention strategy is summarized in Table 1.

The bundle arm consists of three components of exercise training: H-IMT, aerobic training, and resistance training for global muscles. After recruitment, participants will initially start the H-IMT program at 50% of their oral maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), assessed at baseline. The assessment and training procedures will be implemented using a hand-held digital device (Blue Whale™, Xeek, Xiamen, China) with a tapered flow resistance in sitting position. A total of 30 repetitions will be performed, divided into three sets with a one-minute recovery interval between sets. An increment of 5% MIP will be set each week after two sessions for progression. Aerobic training will be conducted using an ergometer. Instead of adjusting the intensity by watts, participants will be asked to maintain their Borg scale at 4–6/10 through the training. The duration of the aerobic training will be 20 min, including two-minute warm-up and two-minute cool-down. Physiotherapists will continuously and closely monitor patients' peripheral saturation and heart rate to avoid adverse events. Resistance training will target global muscles of the upper and lower extremities using three functional movements: arm vertical extension (shoulder abduction with elbow extension at frontal plane), arm horizontal extension (shoulder extension with elbow extension at horizontal plane), and half-squat (leaning on a swiss-ball against the wall with a 60-degree knee flexion). The one-repetition maximum (1-RM) will be firstly assessed at baseline, and the intensity of resistance training will be conducted at 60% 1-RM (10 × 4/d), considering the deconditioned fitness of all participants. After four weeks, a re-assessment of 1-RM will be conducted to reset the intensity. The intervention will be guided by the self-efficacy theory to improve participants' adherence to intervention and behavior maintenance. We will assist participants in setting realistic training goals and continuously monitor their performance throughout the training process. Those who successfully complete the training will be recognized and rewarded for their achievements. For participants facing obstacles during training, we will provide encouragement and support to help them overcome challenges and complete the program.

### Osteoarthritis: diagnosis and treatment [^116A6mGS]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative disorder of the articular cartilage associated with hypertrophic bone changes. Risk factors include genetics, female sex, past trauma, advancing age, and obesity. The diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain worsened by movement, which can lead to disability in activities of daily living. Plain radiography may help in the diagnosis, but laboratory testing usually does not. Pharmacologic treatment should begin with acetaminophen and step up to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Exercise is a useful adjunct to treatment and has been shown to reduce pain and disability. The supplements glucosamine and chondroitin can be used for moderate to severe osteoarthritis when taken in combination. Corticosteroid injections provide inexpensive, short-term (four to eight weeks) relief of osteoarthritic flare-ups of the knee, whereas hyaluronic acid injections are more expensive but can maintain symptom improvement for longer periods. Total joint replacement of the hip, knee, or shoulder is recommended for patients with chronic pain and disability despite maximal medical therapy.

### Musculoskeletal disorders among nurses compared with two other occupational groups [^114YZjSR]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is a high incidence of low back pain (LBP) among nurses. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) at other anatomical sites in nurses.

Aims

To describe the cumulative incidence and persistence/recurrence of MSDs of the low back, neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand and knee among New Zealand nurses, to investigate the impact of MSDs on work and functional tasks and to compare findings for nurses with those in postal workers and office workers.

Methods

Participants completed a postal survey at baseline and again 1 year later. Information was collected about MSDs in the previous 1 month and 12 months and about the ability to attend work, undertake work duties and perform functional tasks.

Results

Among nurses, the low back was the site with the highest cumulative incidence and highest prevalence of persistent/recurrent, work-disabling and functional-task-disabling pain. Work-disabling LBP was more prevalent among nurses and postal workers than office workers (P < 0.001). Nurses had a substantial prevalence of work-disabling shoulder pain (10%) and functional-task-disabling knee (19%) and wrist/hand pain (16%). With the exception of the elbow, each occupational group had a high prevalence of persistent/recurrent MSDs at all anatomical sites.

Conclusions

LBP continues to have a substantial impact among nurses. Other less commonly considered MSDs, such as shoulder, wrist/hand and knee pain, also made work or functional tasks difficult, suggesting that primary and secondary prevention efforts should consider MSDs at other anatomical sites as well as the low back.

### Safety of exercise in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111PoyZV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis benefit from long-term moderate or high-intensity exercises. Moderate or high-intensity exercises were found to improve aerobic capacity, muscle strength, functional ability, and psychological well-being, and slow the age-related and sex-related decrease in bone mineral density of the hip. Despite these positive findings, there is also concern about its risks. Studies on the effects of exercise on disease activity and joint damage are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Studies on the effects of moderate or high-intensity exercise in rheumatoid arthritis demonstrate either decreased or stable disease activity. From the few available studies that address exercise and radiologic progression of the small joints, results indicate that exercises are safe for the joints of hands and feet. However, a recent study suggests caution in prescribing long-term high-intensity weight-bearing exercises to patients who have significant radiologic damage of large joints, as some patients might develop additional damage.

Summary

Moderate or high-intensity weight-bearing exercises are safe with respect to disease activity and radiologic damage of the hands and feet. In the absence of sufficient data on exercise and radiologic progression of the large joints, patients with significant radiologic damage of the large joints should not be encouraged to participate in moderate to high-intensity weight-bearing exercise unless individualized to protect affected joints. A broader dissemination of the effectiveness and safety of moderate and high-intensity exercise for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is needed among rheumatologists, physical therapists, and patients.

### Physical preparation and return to performance of an elite female football player following ACL reconstruction: a journey to the FIFA women's world cup [^117WCQdk]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Player perspective: "It feels amazing" [to be back on the pitch] "It definitely gives you that lift to keep on going. Every injury is obviously hard on the person going through it and for the most part I have handled that aspect of it quite well". "But I've had a big smile on my face being out on the pitch again, and I can't wait to be enjoying my football again".

Moderate control

At 7 months post-surgery (weeks 5–6 on-pitch; figure 2), with the foundation laid for running volume progression, and no pain or swelling, we progressively introduced change of direction activities and running with the ball to increase movement variability. Within conditioning blocks to develop aerobic qualities, we targeted lower threshold high-speed running (HSR) exposure (5.5–6.9 ms -1), with session-to-session increments in volume (figure 11) involving embedded linear running with and without the ball in intermittent dribbling lanes. Low-level technical actions were also incorporated in drill content. Warm-ups integrated running mechanics, acceleration/deceleration and change of direction drills (online supplemental video 5).

Player perspective: The knee has showed really positive signs, no swelling, and has shown it is able to handle running.

Control to chaos

At 8 months post-surgery (weeks 7–8 on-pitch; figure 2), we introduced the football-specific weekly training structure with the intention of overloading game-specific demands. We continued the development of acceleration and deceleration qualities, programming higher-speed change of direction drills in warm-ups (online supplemental video 5). Within intensive sessions, we integrated position-specific acceleration/deceleration activities to replicate the explosive movement demands of match play and 'pass and move' drills to develop technical actions, progressively including more reactive passing and movement within drills (figure 11). Within extensive sessions, we progressively incorporated HSR, manipulating exercise:rest ratios to target the required energy systems (figure 11).

Player perspective: (With regards to the importance of support staff in the RTS process) the biggest thing that an injury teaches you is who the good people are around you and who is with you. Those people are huge and will help you get through the injury. In recovery, you don't always show your true emotions but having the right people around you help carry you through it.

### Conditioning of cartilage during normal activities is an important factor in the development of osteoarthritis [^115S4Bzx]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Mechanical factors have long been implicated in the aetiology of osteoarthritis (OA). The two most popular hypotheses regarding the mechanism of cartilage damage are: the application of too high a stress and the mechanism of fatigue. Mechanical failure in any material, however, can be caused by either or both of these mechanisms. It is hypothesized that, because cartilage is a living tissue, the threshold at which it fails by either mechanism is regulated by the prevalent stresses arising in a joint. As these stresses are determined by activities and lifestyles, a low failure threshold can be the result of prolonged periods of low-level activity, which, if interrupted with short periods of intense activities, can subject weakened cartilage to damaging stresses. Were this hypothesis proven, it would address difficulties encountered with these hypotheses and explain some clinical observations. It would also have implications for the activities and lifestyles of individuals.

### A 2-yr randomized controlled trial on creatine supplementation during exercise for postmenopausal bone health [^114ysqUJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Exercise training

Resistance exercises and brisk walking were performed in-lab and supervised 3 d·wk −1. An additional 3 d of nonsupervised brisk walking was performed outside of the laboratory.

Exercises performed during resistance training included hack squat, hip abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension using a multihip machine, bench press, lat pull-down, shoulder press, hamstrings curl, quadriceps (knee) extension, biceps curl, triceps extension (presses), and back extension. Participants initially took part in a 2-wk familiarization process (two supervised sessions per week, 2 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise) where light resistance was used and proper form was emphasized. After the familiarization phase, participants took part in strength assessments and then enrolled in the resistance training program that involved two sets of eight repetitions for each exercise to muscular fatigue with 2-min rest between sets for each exercise at an intensity corresponding to a load equal to or > 80% one-repetition maximum (1RM) (i.e. 80% of their maximal strength, for the bench press and hack squat) or the maximal amount of weight that could be lifted eight times (i.e. 8RM). Resistance was progressively increased by 2–5 kg once a participant could complete two sets of eight repetitions for an exercise. All exercises were performed on plate-loaded or weight stack machines (Lever Fitness or Hammer Strength, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).

The walking program involved 20–30 min of brisk walking per session at an intensity corresponding to 70% of age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 − age). This duration was chosen as it would ensure participants were meeting the recommendations set by the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Older Adults of approximately 150 min·wk −1 of moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity. Participants were educated how to take a 15-s radial pulse count to ensure they were exercising at the proper intensity. Compliance was monitored by recording and tracking exercise in training logs.

### Joint status of patients with nonsevere hemophilia a… [^11617bFf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Clinical function

The clinical function of joints was assessed at the same day of the MRI examinations and scored according to the HJHS version 2.1 by two physicians (A.Z. and F.K.) trained in advance by physiotherapists with expertise in the field of hemophilia. The HJHS assesses swelling, muscle atrophy, crepitus on motion, range of motion, joint pain, strength, and gait. As a result, the maximum scores are 20 points per joint and 124 points in total (including gait score). The presence of an abnormal HJHS subscore was defined as > 1 point per joint. This cutoff was chosen based on the interquartile ranges of the HJHS in healthy males.

2.4.3 Retrospective clinical data

The following data were collected from medical files: demographics, lifetime lowest FVIII activity, body mass index (BMI), history of joint surgery, treatment regimen, and information on all lifetime joint bleeding events including cause and treatment of bleeds. BMI was calculated from the highest measured weight and height in the past 10 years. Joint bleeding events were defined as bleeds that occurred in elbows, wrists, shoulders, knees, hips, or ankles and classified as such by the treating physician. Annual joint bleeding rates (AJBRs) were derived for the duration from the period 1 January 2009 until the study visit and calculated as: (total number of joint bleeding episodes during follow‐up / follow‐up in months) × 12. Further definitions are described in the supplemental materials.

2.4.4 Patient‐reported data

All patients completed an online questionnaire on the day of the study visit and were asked to provide details on all physical exercises they perform in a typical 7‐day period for more than 15 min. A total activity score was calculated based on the Godin Leisure‐Time Exercise Questionnaire and classified into sedentary, moderately active, and active. More information on the Godin Leisure‐Time Exercise Questionnaire can be found in the supplemental materials.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^116rYJcn]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 High‐Intensity and Repeated Sprint Interval Training

High‐intensity interval training (HIIT) or repeated sprint interval training consists of repeated bouts of vigorous‐intensity exercise followed by lower intensity or passive recovery periods (generally between 4 and 8 sets). The workout typically totals 20–60 min in duration with exercise and recovery periods alternating between 5 s and 8 min depending on the specific protocol and patient tolerability. HIIT workouts can be tailored to medical or personal requirements and baseline aerobic fitness, including a diverse range of exercise modalities. The potential benefits of HIIT include comparable or greater physiological adaptations (e.g. improved skeletal muscle metabolic control and cardiovascular function) when compared to continuous aerobic exercise in a shorter time period, and elevated post exercise metabolism known as "EPOC" (excess post‐exercise oxygen consumption), which may contribute to increased fat oxidation. The benefits of HIIT are becoming increasingly recognised in healthy individuals and in people with cardiometabolic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The potential application of HIIT in the context of asthma management includes improvements in perceived dyspnoea, anxiety, fatigue and reductions in ICS therapy without compromising asthma control.

The rationale to consider prescribing HIIT in people with asthma includes: (i) the inability or desire to undertake or sustain continuous moderate to vigorous‐intensity aerobic exercise to elicit significant physiological adaptations (i.e. increase oxidative capacity of locomotor muscle and expression of anabolic hormones to stimulate muscle fibre hypertrophy); (ii) superior to continuous exercise in improving exercise capacity while inducing lower dyspnoea sensations; (iii) a preferable training option for individuals unable to undertake and sustain exercise due to severe dyspnoea and those at risk of developing exercise‐induced arterial hypoxemia (defined as oxygen saturation [SpO 2] 93%–95% [or 3%–4% below rest]); (iv) lower ventilatory requirement post intervention at the same relative sub‐maximal workload (i.e. increased inspiratory capacity, reduced dynamic hyperinflation and reduced dyspnoea). Whilst the potential risk of developing EIB in response to vigorous exercise is an important consideration, HIIT has been shown to be a safe, feasible, and well‐tolerated form of exercise in adults with asthma, irrespective of pre‐intervention disease control, airway inflammation, or AHR. RCTs evaluating continuous HIIT interventions are summarised for reference in Table 2.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. progression models in resistance training for healthy adults [^114Udfb7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

In order to stimulate further adaptation toward specific training goals, progressive resistance training (RT) protocols are necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific programs include the use of concentric (CON), eccentric (ECC), and isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral and unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addition, it is recommended that strength programs sequence exercises to optimize the preservation of exercise intensity (large before small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before single-joint exercises, and higher-intensity before lower-intensity exercises). For novice (untrained individuals with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years) training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition range of an 8–12 repetition maximum (RM). For intermediate (individuals with approximately 6 months of consistent RT experience) to advanced (individuals with years of RT experience) training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading range from 1 to 12 RM in a periodized fashion with eventual emphasis on heavy loading (1–6 RM) using 3- to 5-min rest periods between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1–2 s CON; 1–2 s ECC). When training at a specific RM load, it is recommended that 2–10% increase in load be applied when the individual can perform the current workload for one to two repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for training frequency is 2–3 d x wk(-1) for novice training, 3–4 d x wk(-1) for intermediate training, and 4–5 d x wk(-1) for advanced training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1–12 RM be used in periodized fashion with emphasis on the 6–12 RM zone using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails two general loading strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use of light loads (0–60% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30–60% of 1 RM for upper body exercises) performed at a fast contraction velocity with 3–5 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per exercise (three to five sets). It is also recommended that emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises especially those involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training, it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40–60% of 1 RM) be performed for high repetitions (> 15) using short rest periods (< 90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand as with prior ones, recommendations should be applied in context and should be contingent upon an individual's target goals, physical capacity, and training status.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^1163jvjL]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (knee) — Recommendation 1 states that in a patient with knee symptoms (pain, swelling, locking, catching, popping, giving way) and/or signs (tenderness, effusion, loss of motion, crepitus), x-rays (including AP, lateral, sunrise/Merchant, and tunnel views) are an option, and the strength statement reads "Strength of Recommendation: Limited". Supporting evidence indicates that AAOS conducted a systematic review that identified one diagnostic study. One Level II study reports the diagnostic performance of a clinical exam including consideration of AP, lateral, tunnel, and Merchant radiographs and enrolled 125 patients with various knee lesions, 22 of which were diagnosed as osteochondritis dissecans during arthroscopic examination.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111npVpZ]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) noncontact activity and shared decision-making — early activity parameters: Previous guidance emphasized refraining from high-intensity activity for the first 3 weeks of illness and absence of splenomegaly, while acknowledging there are no well-designed large clinical trials (SOR Recommendation grade: C). Premature return earlier than 2 to 3 weeks to heavy exertion may prolong symptoms, yet there is support for considering low-level, supervised activity earlier than 3 weeks within an individualized plan. Resumption of light activity assumes avoidance of contact or abdominal trauma, no significant exertion or Valsalva, the athlete is asymptomatic, and progression of noncontact sport-specific activity should then be gradually increased as judged by clinical progress.

### Effects of high-intensity strength training in adults with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116ew6yQ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to assess the effects of high-intensity strength training versus low-intensity strength training or routine care in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

Design

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched up to March 10, 2021. The outcomes were knee pain, knee function, quality of life, and adverse events.

Results

Ten studies of 892 subjects with knee osteoarthritis were included. No significant differences were found between the high-intensity strength training group and the low-intensity strength training or routine care group in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score pain score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index stiffness score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index physical function score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score symptom score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score activities of daily living score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score sport and recreation score, Timed Up and Go result, gait velocity, walking time, peak torque of the knee extensors, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score quality of life score, and adverse event incidence (all P > 0.05). The peak torque of the knee flexors at 120-degree per sec contraction (pooled weighted mean difference, 7.520; 95% confidence interval, 1.256 to 13.784; P = 0.019) in the high-intensity group was improved significantly than that in the low-intensity training or routine care group.

Conclusions

High-intensity strength training may have similar effects in improving knee pain, knee function, and quality of life, with comparable safety to low-intensity strength training and routine care.

### Osteoarthritis… [^112VeYkc]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility. Evidence has shown that active management is more effective in decreasing knee pain and improving function than passive modalities. 36 Patellar taping is a popular adjunct treatment that has been shown to reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 2 should be encouraged to lose weight. 7 The addition of a calorie-restricted diet to a combined aerobic/strength-training program improves pain, function, and body composition scores vs. exercise alone. 10 All types of exercise have been shown to improve osteoarthritis pain and physical function scores. 37 Home exercise programs are as effective as a supervised clinical exercise program in improving function and six-minute walk distance in persons with knee osteoarthritis. 9 Twisting and high-impact activities should be avoided.

BRACES, ORTHOSES, AND OTHER THERAPIES There is little evidence that the use of knee braces causes harm; therefore, it is a reasonable option to consider as part of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of chronic overuse injuries, including knee osteoarthritis. However, the use of a brace should not replace a comprehensive physical therapy or home exercise program that addresses functional deficits in strength and flexibility. Small studies have shown medial unloader valgus braces to be beneficial in patients with predominant medial compartment osteoarthritis. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome PHYSICAL THERAPY Active treatments, such as strength training and stretching, are the first-line therapies for patellofemoral pain syndrome. Strengthening exercises targeting the quadriceps and hip musculature, combined with stretching of the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip abductors, and iliotibial band complex, are often recommended.

23 A Cochrane review concluded that based on low-quality studies, there is likely some benefit for exercise in patients with PFPS, but researchers could not draw conclusions about the most effective modality. 54 Figures 2 through 5 demonstrate stretching and strengthening exercises that are often used in the treatment of PFPS. Patellar taping has mixed results in the treatment of PFPS. A Cochrane review showed no significant effect on pain, 55 whereas a recent meta-analysis showed that early taping helped improve pain scores. 24 Evidence to support transcutaneous electrical stimulation, biofeedback, or chiropractic manipulation is limited.

### Bone adaptation in adult women is related to loading dose: a 12-month randomized controlled trial [^116uohXE]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results suggest that, although compressive loading in general is osteogenic, it may not be necessary to generate extremely high strain magnitudes or rates to elicit a positive response in the upper extremity. Significant gains in BMC were associated with strain rates and magnitudes within the range of those measured experimentally during activities of daily living (less than or equal to ~1300 με)and can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time (100 loading cycles/bout, and an average of 128 loading bouts over a 12‐month period for the highest tertile group). This is reassuring, because although impact loads are osteogenic, high loading rates have also been linked to increased risk of bone stress injury. Although we did not systematically test the effect of loading cycles/bout, we based our target of 100 on: (i) feasibility and time to complete the intervention, about 3 min; and (ii) theoretical calculations of bone adaptation, that suggested a diminished osteogenic response with additional cycles. Others have shown that breaking loading bouts into multiple sessions, inserting rest periods between cycles, and changing the number of cyclesall can independently influence the osteogenic response in small animal loading models. An alternative loading regimen may have produced a greater response than what was observed here, although testing these parameters was not the focus of the present investigation.

### Patellofemoral pain [^114aUEbP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — tissue irritability–guided intervention selection is emphasized, as "clinicians should use tissue irritability as a factor to consider when determining intervention type and intensity". Patients with high irritability — "fairly constant pain greater than 5/10 that fluctuates related to activity" — "may benefit from interventions to reduce physical stress to these structures (eg, patellar taping)", whereas those with low irritability — "intermittent-low level pain less than 3/10 not easily aggravated" — "may benefit from interventions that apply more physical stress to the tissues of the knee, such as weight-bearing strengthening exercises". Because duration of symptoms may not align with irritability, "clinicians may be required to make judgments when applying time-based research results to individual patients".

### Improving cardiorespiratory and muscular function of Korean firefighters: a kinect-based mixed reality device exercise intervention randomized control trial [^115py6RG]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The 8-week exercise training utilizing the VM also yielded positive effects on the muscular strength of the knee (flexors: P < 0.05; extensors: P < 0.01), shoulder (flexors and extensors: P < 0.05), and trunk (flexors: P < 0.05) joints, as well as the muscular endurance of the knee (flexors: P < 0.05) and shoulder (flexors and extensors: P < 0.05) joints among Korean firefighters. These findings indicate the effectiveness of exercise training using the VM in improving muscular function.

The results of the isokinetic muscular function test showed a strong correlation with firefighting tasks. Moreover, given that strain, sprain, or muscular pain injuries account for a high frequency of more than 45% of injuries on the fireground, effective management of muscular function is crucial for ensuring firefighter safety. Maintaining correct exercise posture in resistance training is essential for promoting muscular function improvement, highlighting the crucial role of exercise instructors. However, in this study, improvements in muscular strength and endurance were observed overall within a similar exercise frequency and duration as the previous study, even without exercise instructors. This indicates that an exercise program using the VM can effectively enhance muscular function. The ability to achieve these effects without exercise instructors can be attributed to the Kinect sensors of the VM, which assist firefighters in maintaining accurate exercise posture. On the other hand, in this study, there was no significant interaction effect observed in some parameters of the muscular function test, including trunk extensors strength, knee flexors endurance, and trunk flexors and extensors endurance. This could be attributed to the composition of the exercise program rather than the effects of the VM.

### Narrative review of injuries in powerlifting with special reference to their association to the squat, bench press and deadlift [^111xwRhX]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The squat exercise is performed with the barbell held horizontally across the back of the shoulders, and the lifter removes the barbell from the powerlifting rack and steps backwards. During training, the lifter then lowers the body by flexing at the hip, knee and ankle joints until the hip crease is lower than the top of the knee. Thereafter, the lifter returns to an upright position by extending the same joints. During competition, the lifter has to assume an erect, motionless posture with the knees fully extended and the torso in an upright position before receiving the SQUAT signal from the referee to initiate the descent and then return to an upright position. When the ascent is completed, the referee signals 'RACK', and the lifter returns the barbell to the rack. The main contributing muscles during performance of the squat are the back and hip extensors, hip adductors, hip abductors, knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors.

For the bench press, the lifter lies supine on a bench, lifts the barbell from the powerlifting rack and holds the barbell with straight arms perpendicular to the lifter's body. During training, the lifter then lowers the barbell to the chest and then returns the barbell to the starting position either with or without a pause at the chest. During competition, the lifter holds the barbell with straight arms, and on the referee's signal, the lifter lowers the barbell to the chest. Thereafter, the lifter must pause with the barbell at the chest until he or she receives a 'PRESS' command, whereupon the barbell shall be returned to the starting position. The lifter then receives a 'RACK' command in order to mark the completion of the lift and returns the barbell to the rack. The bench press is performed with a grip width of no more than 81 cm between index fingers. The main muscles contributing to performance of the bench press are the pectoralis major, triceps brachii and the anterior deltoid muscles.

### How much is too much? (part 1) international olympic committee consensus statement on load in sport and risk of injury [^116zd1UR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Athletes participating in elite sports are exposed to high training loads and increasingly saturated competition calendars. Emerging evidence indicates that poor load management is a major risk factor for injury. The International Olympic Committee convened an expert group to review the scientific evidence for the relationship of load (defined broadly to include rapid changes in training and competition load, competition calendar congestion, psychological load and travel) and health outcomes in sport. We summarise the results linking load to risk of injury in athletes, and provide athletes, coaches and support staff with practical guidelines to manage load in sport. This consensus statement includes guidelines for (1) prescription of training and competition load, as well as for (2) monitoring of training, competition and psychological load, athlete well-being and injury. In the process, we identified research priorities.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^112cHmz1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Several other studies confirm the high CK increase occurring in healthy individuals during unaccustomed strenuous exercise. A study in healthy individuals participating in lengthy marches (50 and 80 km) with heavy backload also showed a huge increase of CK during each march, reaching levels 40-fold to 80-fold higher than the typical value for healthy sedentary participants, reflecting ongoing muscle damage. Recently, Oh et al presented clinical data from 30 previously healthy patients admitted to a military hospital for ERM. The exercise regimens included strength and resistance training, CrossFit training and loaded marches. CK levels ranged between 1565 and 410 755 IU/L, and in nine participants CK was above 100 000 IU/L. All participants recovered well and no complications were noted at follow-up following discharge from the hospital. A similar increase in rhabdomyolysis events occurred when a swim coach added strenuous push-ups to the usual training routine and when a gym teacher told 119 high school students to do 120 push-ups in 5 min. Other reports of triceps or biceps rhabdomyolysis have included female lacrosse players, sailors aboard a ship, a physician after a gym workout, a young man after a rowing drill, and research volunteers in a laboratory model of biceps overexertion. Apparently, strength and conditioning coaches are generally well aware of heat injury and dehydration, but not always of the risk of ERM.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2018: rehabilitation and outcomes [^1132j912]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Conduct a systematic review of systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the past year evaluating rehabilitation for people with osteoarthritis, and provide narrative synthesis of findings focused on core recommended treatments for osteoarthritis (exercise, education, biomechanical interventions, weight loss).

Design

A comprehensive search strategy was used to search PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases (16 th May 2017 to 22 nd March 2018). Search terms included 'osteoarthritis', 'rehabilitation', 'systematic review', and 'randomised controlled trial' Inclusion criteria were: (1) RCT, or systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs); (2) human participants with osteoarthritis (any joint); (3) evaluation of rehabilitation intervention; and (4) at least one patient-reported measure. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool (systematic reviews) and PEDro rating scale (RCTs). Narrative synthesis mapped findings to core recommendations from existing osteoarthritis clinical guidelines.

Results

From 1994 records, 13 systematic reviews and 36 RCTs were included. 73% of these evaluated knee osteoarthritis (36 studies). The remaining studies evaluated hand osteoarthritis (6 studies), hip, hip/knee and general osteoarthritis (each 2 studies), and neck osteoarthritis (1 study). Exercise was the most common intervention evaluated (31%). Updated recommendations for exercise prescription and preliminary guidance for psychological interventions are provided.

Conclusion

Level 1 and 2 osteoarthritis rehabilitation literature continues to be dominated by knee osteoarthritis studies. Consistent with current clinical guidelines, exercise should be a core treatment for osteoarthritis, but future studies should ensure that exercise programs follow published dose guidelines. There is a clear need for research on rehabilitation for hip, hand, foot/ankle, shoulder and spine osteoarthritis.

### Premalignant conditions of bone [^111nSCHH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Synovial Chondromatosis

The formation of cartilaginous and osteochondral bodies by synovium is the hallmark of synovial chondromatosis. This rare, benign condition can occur in any joint of the body. It often presents nonspecifically and can have a delayed diagnosis of up to 5 years after the onset of symptoms. There is a predilection for weight-bearing joints, with the most common locations being the knee followed by the hip, shoulder, elbow, and ankle. Overall, it is believed to be a metaplastic process of hyaline cartilaginous with loose body production (Figure 5 A–D) that microscopically forms nodules of mature hyaline cartilage with variable cellularity and nuclear atypia (Figure 5 E). Typical symptoms include pain, swelling, catching, popping, or crepitus within the affected joint.

Figure 5
Diagram showing synovial chondromatosis. A and B, Soft-tissue ossifications around fifth toe. C and D, Sequential coronal T1 postcontrast MRI with multiple bodies with peripheral enhancement. E, Nodules of mature hyaline cartilage are seen with variable degrees of cellularity and nuclear atypia.

Although malignant transformation of synovial chondromatosis is rare, there have been multiple case reports and series. These small sample-sized studies postulate the rate of chondrosarcomatous transformation of up to 6.3%; however, the authors caution that this may be a high estimate because many cases of synovial chondromatosis are asymptomatic. Typically, low-grade or intermediate-grade chondrosarcoma arises from a range of 2 to 39 years after initial diagnosis, with an average of 20 years. Clinically differentiating primary synovial chondromatosis from secondary chondrosarcoma can be very difficult, so clinical suspicion should be raised based on lesion recurrence alone. As is typical of chondrosarcoma treatment, radiation and chemotherapy have limited roles in these patients and surgical intervention is the mainstay of treatment. Surgical treatment is often wide resection or, if necessary for adequate control, amputation

### Unsafe workout: a weak and painful shoulder in a professional volleyball player [^113Hg8hS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 29-year-old professional volleyball player started complaining of a dull ache in the right lateral base of the neck. This pain arose during a preseasonal athletic training intense session. After 3 days, he presented deficiency of right scapula adduction, limitation of scapula elevation, right shoulder weakness and local mild pain. He had asymmetrical neckline with drooping of the affected shoulder, lateral displacement and minimal winging of the right scapula. After 1week, hypothrophy of superior trapezius appeared. An electromyography of right upper limb showed a denervation in the upper, middle and lower components of the right trapezius muscle, due to axonotmesis of spinal accessory nerve (SAN). A subsequent MRI was consistent with muscular suffering caused by early denervation. This case shows idiopathic SAN palsy, likely secondary to an inappropriate use of a weight-lifting machine, where the athlete recovered after an adequate rest and rehabilitation period.

### Water-based exercise improves health-related aspects of fitness in older women [^116mbuAH]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the physiological responses of elderly women to a well-rounded exercise program performed in water (WEX).

Methods

The participants (60–75 yr of age) were randomly divided into a training (TR) group (N = 15) and a control group (N = 15). The TR group participated in a 12-wk supervised WEX program, 70 min x day(-1), 3 d x wk(-1). The WEX consisted of 20 min of warm-up and stretching exercise, 10 min of resistance exercise, 30 min of endurance-type exercise (walking and dancing), and 10 min of cool-down exercise.

Results

The WEX led to an increase (P < 0.05) in peak VO2 (12%) and VO2 at lactate threshold (20%). Muscular strength evaluated by a hydraulic resistance machine increased significantly at resistance dial setting 8 (slow) for knee extension (8%), knee flexion (13%), chest press (7%) and pull (11%), shoulder press (4%) and pull (6%), and back extension (6%). Vertical jump (9%), side-stepping agility (22%), trunk extension (11%), and FEV1.0 (7%) also increased significantly. There was a significant decrease in skin-fold thickness (-8%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-17%), and total cholesterol (-11%). There were no significant changes in these variables in the control group.

Conclusion

These results indicate that WEX elicits significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, body fat, and total cholesterol in older adult women. Water-based exercise appears to be a very safe and beneficial mode of exercise that can be performed as part of a well-rounded exercise program.

### Resistance training for children and adolescents [^112AcN9G]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Youth resistance training — program design and dosage parameters emphasize repetition ranges (< 6) at a higher training intensity (> 80% 1 RM) provided that RTSC is high, and during more complex, multijoint exercises fewer repetitions (eg, 1–3) may be productive to aid in motor control development. Programs should include all muscle groups, including core muscles; perform exercises through the full range of motion with proper technique; and perform exercises in a particular sequence during training, with large muscle groups before small muscle groups and complex, multijoint exercises before single-joint exercises. Achieving strength gains requires sessions to be at least 20 to 30 minutes long and performed 2 to 3 times per week on nonconsecutive days while gradually increasing resistance training intensity and volume as strength and RTSC improve. Training should keep the stimulus effective and enjoyable by periodically varying the exercises, sets, and repetitions, use dynamic warm-up exercises followed by cool-down periods with appropriate stretching techniques, and be technique driven and consistent with the needs, abilities, and maturity level of the participants.

### Progressing rehabilitation after injury: consider the 'control-chaos continuum' [^115cQQwG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

High chaos

Aims: Return the player to relative weekly training demands (figure 2) and include drills designed to test worst-case scenarios (high speed/high chaos).

Technical considerations: passing/crossing and shooting; graded in intensity from short/mid/long range while jumping/heading and tackling; graded in intensity as static/movement/in-context. The volume of technical actions should be progressively increased and be player and injury specific.

In the final phase, we emphasise position-specific conditioning and reflect game intensity with volumes relative to weekly preinjury training outputs. Positional specific speed/speed-endurance drills (online supplementary videos 9 and 10) prepare players for game activity — where the speed/direction of the pass dictates how fast the player moves. Technical considerations specific to the injury in question (eg, ball striking activity for a groin injury) form part of our final criteria for return to training, alongside strength and power diagnostics (table 1).

### Hamstrings hypertrophy is specific to the training exercise: nordic hamstring versus lengthened state eccentric training [^111oCvBy]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

In fact, NHT produced greater hypertrophy of the BFsh and SAR compared with LSET, with no between-group difference in GRA (Fig. 3) and POP showing no hypertrophic response to either type of training, perhaps because of either reduced accuracy in assessing the volume of this small muscle, or its primary role as a knee joint stabilizer rather than a knee flexor. Collectively, the nonhip extending knee flexors (KF not HE; BFsh, SAR, GRA, POP) were more responsive to NHT (approximately twofold LSET), whereas the hip extending knee flexors (KF and HE; BFlh, SM, ST) were more responsive to LSET (more than twofold NHT). As discussed previously, during LSET, the long length of the KF and HE muscles (i.e. biarticular hamstrings), but not the KF muscles that are not HE muscles, is the likely explanation for their differing hypertrophic response to this type of training. Considering NHT, although no convincing data are available, the lack of high external resistance to hip extension during this exercise (i.e. hip extension torque is restrained by gravity acting on the trunk and antagonist co-activation) may limit the contribution/activation of the hip extending knee flexors and place greater reliance on the nonhip extending knee flexors. This point is partly supported by the finding that peak forces during NHT coincided with low BFlh and SM muscle activities, suggesting other muscles may be more heavily involved in this exercise, and this agrees with our finding of no hypertrophy of BFlh and SM after NHT. The SAR, being a biarticular hip flexor, would also have likely been at longer lengths during NHT (hip extended) than LSET (hip flexed), which may also explain its greater hypertrophic response to NHT.
