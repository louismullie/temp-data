## Question

Idiopathic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about idiopathic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining idiopathic anemia and its synonyms. Then, I should verify epidemiology and why it matters clinically. Next, I will examine pathophysiology, followed by a careful diagnostic approach and when to escalate to marrow studies. After that, I need to consider special entities that masquerade as "idiopathic". Finally, I will outline management principles, prognosis, and knowledge gaps, making sure I anchor each step to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislabel cases. Idiopathic anemia, more accurately termed unexplained anemia of aging or unexplained anemia of the elderly, refers to anemia in older adults in whom a comprehensive evaluation fails to identify a cause such as iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, or hematologic malignancy, despite appropriate testing including, when indicated, bone marrow examination [^aafe417c] [^bbebb535].

> I should double-check the epidemiology before drawing conclusions. In adults aged 60 and over, anemia prevalence is roughly 10–15% and increases with age; importantly, after thorough workups, 25–44% of cases remain unexplained, with UAA prevalence rising from about 2.9% in those 60–69 to 12.3% in those ≥ 80 years, and UAA remains common even in rigorously evaluated cohorts, including hematology referrals and long-term care settings [^aafe417c] [^bbebb535] [^7275a9d3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without reviewing the data. Multiple lines of evidence suggest UAA is multifactorial: impaired erythropoietin production or responsiveness, low-grade clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP/CCUS), stem cell senescence, and subtle inflammatory signaling contribute; notably, UAA is characterized by lower EPO levels and lower pro-inflammatory markers than anemia of chronic disease, and a substantial fraction harbor somatic mutations without meeting MDS criteria, supporting a clonal component in some cases [^f6b1b3ff] [^698424be] [^ec97866f].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I'm not missing reversible causes. A systematic evaluation includes history for bleeding, diet, medications, and family history; CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, and smear; iron studies with attention to inflammation (ferritin may be misleading, so transferrin saturation and CRP help); B12 and folate; renal and hepatic function; TSH; and inflammatory markers; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics and, increasingly, next-generation sequencing is reserved for red flags such as macrocytosis, cytopenias, dysplasia, or severe or progressive anemia, to distinguish UAA from MDS, CCUS, or ICUS [^28ff4692] [^69b79037] [^aafe417c].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that should trigger marrow evaluation so I don't overcall UAA prematurely. Indications include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias, peripheral smear dysplasia or blasts, severe anemia (Hb < 9 g/dL), or a rapidly falling Hb; in these scenarios, marrow studies with cytogenetics and NGS help differentiate MDS, CCUS, and ICUS, recognizing that clonal mutations alone are not diagnostic of MDS without morphologic criteria [^28ff4692] [^ec97866f].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating UAA with other "idiopathic" anemias. Idiopathic aplastic anemia is a distinct immune-mediated marrow failure syndrome with pancytopenia and hypocellular marrow; idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a warm-antibody hemolysis with a primary form when no secondary cause is found; and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare cause of iron deficiency anemia from recurrent alveolar hemorrhage — these are pathobiologically different from UAA and should not be labeled as UAA [^490ab072] [^5953a499] [^d803c96c].

> Let me consider management principles, and I should confirm that supportive care is appropriate when no cause is found. For mild, stable UAA, observation with periodic reassessment is reasonable; for symptomatic patients or Hb < 10 g/dL, cautious iron trials may be considered if iron indices suggest functional restriction, though overt iron loading should be avoided; erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are not routinely indicated without clear EPO-deficient physiology; and importantly, even mild anemia correlates with worse functional outcomes, so goals should be individualized and comorbidity-optimized rather than chasing normalization of Hb [^aafe417c] [^69b79037] [^6d439f4c].

> But wait, what about prognosis and the clinical significance of labeling something "idiopathic"? I should confirm that UAA is not benign. UAA is associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression; mechanistically, low EPO responsiveness and clonal hematopoiesis plausibly contribute to adverse outcomes, and the lack of disease-modifying therapy underscores an unmet need for targeted interventions and better phenotyping of UAA subtypes [^aafe417c] [^698424be] [^f6b1b3ff].

> I should double-check knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainty. We lack standardized diagnostic criteria for UAA, consensus on when to perform molecular testing, and evidence-based treatments; the boundary between UAA, ICUS, and CCUS remains blurred, and longitudinal studies are needed to define progression risks and identify which patients with clonal mutations will benefit from earlier hematologic follow-up or therapy [^aafe417c] [^ec97866f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: idiopathic anemia in older adults most often reflects unexplained anemia of aging, a common, multifactorial, and clinically consequential entity diagnosed after exclusion of nutritional, inflammatory, renal, and malignant causes; a structured, guideline-concordant workup prevents misclassification, while recognizing that a meaningful fraction will harbor clonal hematopoiesis and that management remains largely supportive pending advances in pathophysiology-driven therapy [^aafe417c] [^28ff4692] [^698424be].

---

Idiopathic anemia is best understood as **unexplained anemia** — anemia that persists after a thorough evaluation excludes common causes such as iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and hematologic malignancies [^aafe417c]. It is especially common in older adults, where it accounts for roughly one-third of anemia cases and is linked to worse outcomes, including higher mortality, frailty, and cognitive decline [^bbebb535] [^6d439f4c]. The pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving impaired erythropoietin response, low-grade inflammation, and clonal hematopoiesis; management is supportive, with transfusion for severe symptoms and cautious trials of iron or ESAs in select cases, while ongoing monitoring is essential to detect evolving disease [^f6b1b3ff] [^698424be] [^69b79037].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Idiopathic anemia is defined as anemia **without an identifiable cause** after a comprehensive evaluation that includes:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for bleeding, chronic disease, medication use, and family history [^5945ef78].
- **Laboratory evaluation**: CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), vitamin B12 and folate levels, renal and liver function tests, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and a peripheral smear [^28ff4692].
- **Additional tests**: Bone marrow biopsy, hematology consultation, and molecular testing (e.g. next-generation sequencing) if indicated to exclude myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), clonal cytopenias, or other hematologic disorders [^28ff4692].

---

## Epidemiology

Idiopathic anemia is **common in older adults**, with a prevalence of approximately 10–15% in individuals aged 60 years and older, increasing with age [^aafe417c]. It accounts for about one-third of anemia cases in this population, with a higher prevalence in men and in those with chronic comorbidities [^bbebb535].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of idiopathic anemia is **multifactorial** and not fully understood. Proposed mechanisms include:

- **Impaired erythropoietin response**: Blunted erythropoietin production or responsiveness, particularly in the context of renal impairment or chronic disease [^f6b1b3ff].
- **Low-grade inflammation**: Chronic low-level inflammation may contribute to anemia by altering iron metabolism and erythropoiesis [^698424be].
- **Clonal hematopoiesis**: Age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH) and clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance (CCUS) may underlie some cases, representing a pre-malignant state [^698424be].

---

## Clinical significance and outcomes

Idiopathic anemia is associated with **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Increased mortality**: Higher all-cause mortality, particularly in older adults [^aafe417c].
- **Functional impairment**: Reduced physical function, frailty, and cognitive decline [^aafe417c].
- **Quality of life**: Lower quality of life and increased healthcare utilization [^aafe417c].

---

## Management strategies

Management of idiopathic anemia is **supportive and individualized**, given the absence of a definitive underlying cause:

- **Observation**: Mild anemia (hemoglobin > 10 g/dL) may be monitored with periodic reassessment [^notfound].
- **Iron supplementation**: Cautious trial of oral or intravenous iron may be considered, particularly if there is evidence of functional iron deficiency or low ferritin [^notfound].
- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: Reserved for select cases with symptomatic anemia and documented erythropoietin deficiency, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Transfusion**: Red cell transfusion is indicated for severe symptomatic anemia or acute decompensation [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of idiopathic anemia varies with severity and comorbidities. Mild anemia may remain stable for years, whereas **severe anemia is associated with increased mortality and functional decline**. Regular monitoring is essential to detect progression or emergence of underlying disease [^aafe417c].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying idiopathic anemia, including the role of clonal hematopoiesis, inflammation, and erythropoietin dysregulation. Advances in genomic sequencing and biomarker discovery may enable earlier detection and targeted therapies [^ec97866f].

---

Idiopathic anemia is a common and clinically significant condition, particularly in older adults, characterized by anemia without an identifiable cause after thorough evaluation. It is associated with adverse outcomes, and management is supportive, with ongoing research aimed at uncovering underlying mechanisms and improving therapeutic options.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^7f38d88b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^aafe417c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 15% of people aged 60 and over are anemic, and the prevalence of anemia increases with age. In older men and women, anemia is associated with increases in the risk of death and all-cause hospitalization, poor functional capacity, quality of life, and depression.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing anemia in aging populations, focusing on the specific diagnostic criteria of anemia and potential causes in older men and women. Even after extensive etiologic workup that involves careful medical history, physical examination, laboratory measurements, and additional studies such as bone marrow biopsy, anemia of aging is unexplained in up to 40% of older patients with anemia. As a result, treatment options remain limited.

Conclusions

The prevalence of unexplained anemia of aging (UAA; also called unexplained anemia of the elderly, UAE), its deleterious impacts on health, physical function, and quality of life, and the lack of effective treatment or therapy guidelines represent a compelling unmet clinical need. In this review and consensus document, we discuss the scope of the problem, possible causes of UAA, diagnostic criteria, and potential treatment options. Because even mild anemia is strongly linked to poor clinical outcomes, it should receive clinical attention rather than simply being considered a normal part of aging.

### Evidence of a sub-clinical lymphoproliferative disease in patients with 'idiopathic' autoimmune hemolytic anemia… [^0403fb01]. ASCO (2008). Low credibility.

Abstract 7074 Background: Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which accounts for about half of cases, is diagnosed in the absence of a concomitant disease. A lymphoproliferative disease is frequently associated or can follow AHA. The aim of this study was to better define the clinical features of 50 cases defined as idiopathic AHA. Results: The median age of the 50 patients was 66 years, 32 patients were females. The immunohematologic study revealed an anti-erythrocyte auto-antibody in all cases. An idiopathic AHA was confirmed in 26 cases, while in 24 a concurrent disease was diagnosed. In 16 cases, all with a normal lymphocyte count, the PB immunophenotype revealed the presence of a small B-lymphocyte clone with a CD5+/CD19+, CD23+ phenotype in 3 cases and a CD5+/CD19+, CD23- or CD5-/CD19+, CD23- phenotype in 13.

The median number of clonal B lymphocytes in the PB was
0.5 × 10⁹/L. Clonality was confirmed by PCR. The same clonal population was detected in the bone marrow aspirate. No other signs ascribable to a lymphoproliferative disease were detected, except for a patient with an enlarged abdominal lymph node. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that about one third of newly diagnosed patients with otherwise defined "idiopathic" AHA show a underlined sub clinical B-lymphocyte clone which may play a role both in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune disorder and in the subsequent occurrence of a lymphoproliferative disease. The detection of such clones should be considered in the diagnostic work-out of patients with AHA. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Anemia at older age: etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^698424be]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and is a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia at older age is increasing, and this is mainly attributable to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies. The etiology of anemia at older age is complex and ranges from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear-cut etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In others, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled, a condition termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance. Management of anemias at older age depends on (1) the severity of the anemia, (2) underlying condition(s), and (3) patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even a mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that because of age-related changes, organ function such as erythropoietin production in the kidney may become suboptimal. Management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function. In this article, we review current concepts around anemias at older age, with special emphasis on etiologies, clinical implications, and innovative concepts in the management of these patients.

### The pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anemia: current concepts revisited [^fd4a3d2d]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by cytopenias and hypocellular bone marrow. The pathophysiology is unknown; the most favored model is of a dysregulated immune system leading to autoreactive T-cell destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in a genetically susceptible host. The authors review the literature and propose that the major driver of acquired aplastic anemia is a combination of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells intrinsic defects and an inappropriately activated immune response in the setting of a viral infection. Alterations in bone marrow microenvironment may also contribute to the disease process.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^cc1b531e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^d3578acb]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Classic idiopathic presentation aside, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As a consequence, treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario. Here, we propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications in regard to the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

### Transplantation for bone marrow failure: current issues [^b65996e2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The preferred treatment of idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. Transplantation from a well-matched unrelated donor (MUD) may be considered for patients without a sibling donor after failure of immunosuppressive therapy, as may alternative transplantation (mismatched, cord blood or haplo-identical HSCT) for patients without a MUD. HSCT may also be contemplated for congenital disorders in cases of pancytopenia or severe isolated cytopenia. Currently, HSCT aims are not only to cure patients but also to avoid long-term complications, notably chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), essential for a good quality of life long term. This paper summarizes recent advances in HSCT for idiopathic and inherited AA disorders. The effect of age on current transplantation outcomes, the role of transplantation in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and the prevention of GVHD are also discussed. Emerging strategies regarding the role of up-front unrelated donor and alternative donor HSCT in idiopathic AA, along with advances in the treatment of clonal evolution in Fanconi anemia, are also examined.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^409646b6]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Anemia of inflammation [^f2002ab5]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Anemia in the pediatric patient [^85d40088]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately a quarter of the world's population suffers from anemia, including almost half of preschool-age children. Globally, iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia. Other important causes of anemia in children are hemoglobinopathies, infection, and other chronic diseases. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity, including neurologic complications, increased risk of low birth weight, infection, and heart failure, as well as increased mortality. When approaching a child with anemia, detailed historical information, particularly diet, environmental exposures, and family history, often yield important clues to the diagnosis. Dysmorphic features on physical examination may indicate syndromic causes of anemia. Diagnostic testing involves a stepwise approach utilizing various laboratory techniques. The increasing availability of genetic testing is providing new mechanistic insights into inherited anemias and allowing diagnosis in many previously undiagnosed cases. Population-based approaches are being taken to address nutritional anemias. Novel pharmacologic agents and advances in gene therapy-based therapeutics have the potential to ameliorate anemia-associated disease and provide treatment strategies even in the most difficult and complex cases.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^7b627bd7]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### Graft – host disease and relapse / rejection-free survival after allogeneic transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia: a comprehensive analysis from the SAAWP of the EBMT [^6d934f6a]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Due to major developments in transplantation modalities over the past 20 years (graft- versus -host disease [GvHD] prophylaxis, HLA typing, conditioning regimens, optimization of alternative donor transplantation), overall survival (OS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for severe idiopathic aplastic anemia (SAA) has largely improved, approaching 80% at 5 years. In contrast to allo-HSCT in hematological malignancies, the challenges in allo-HSCT for SAA remain the achievement of sustained engraftment without significant clinical alloreactivity since no graft- versus -tumor effect is required to achieve long-term survival. Long-term follow-up studies repeatedly reported that GvHD strongly impairs quality of life and plays a pivotal role in the occurrence of late complications, including secondary cancers. Consequently, avoiding GvHD is of particular importance in allo-HSCT for SAA. 7– Furthermore, when considering beyond simple OS, the use of the SAA-adapted composite endpoint of GvHD and rejection-free survival (GRFS) may be a more meaningful clinical study endpoint by allowing for greater accuracy in assessing patient outcomes. Although some retrospective studies have assessed GRFS in this context, there is no published report including large numbers of patients with the goal of identifying risk factors and causes of GRFS failure. Based on the Data Quality Initiative program of the Severe Aplastic Anemia Working Party (SAAWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), we performed a comprehensive analysis of GRFS and causes of failure in, separately, both those previously untreated and of relapsed/refractory SAA.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^21e45e1c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^69b79037]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Aplastic anaemia [^490ab072]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Aplastic anaemia is a rare haemopoietic stem-cell disorder that results in pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Although most cases are acquired, there are unusual inherited forms. The pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anaemia is immune mediated in most cases; autoreactive lymphocytes mediate the destruction of haemopoietic stem cells. Environmental exposures, such as to drugs, viruses, and toxins, are thought to trigger the aberrant immune response in some patients, but most cases are classified as idiopathic. Similarly to other autoimmune diseases, aplastic anaemia has a varied clinical course; some patients have mild symptoms that necessitate little or no therapy, whereas others present with life-threatening pancytopenia representing a medical emergency. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and myelodysplastic syndrome commonly arise in patients with aplastic anaemia, showing a pathophysiological link between these disorders. Acquired aplastic anaemia can be effectively treated by allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, immunosuppression (generally antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin), and high-dose cyclophosphamide.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Iatrogenic anemia (can it be prevented?) [^e7da02b3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

'Iatrogenic anemia' is a condition of lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin count resulting from large or frequent removal of blood samples, usually for laboratory testing. It is frequently seen in patients who are already suffering from bone marrow depression, and thus may become a comorbidity. Because several different types of chemical agents may be required for test procedures, a large volume of blood could be removed for each set of testing, perhaps 50–60 mL. Often local and reference laboratories request larger samples than are really necessary to perform a given test and still have some left to perform any required repeat testing. My experience shows that a volume of about 3 mL of each type of sample should be sufficient for this purpose.

### Unexplained anaemia in older persons is characterised by low erythropoietin and low levels of pro-inflammatory markers [^f6b1b3ff]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies report that a third of the cases of anaemia in older persons is unexplained. We compared erythropoietin (EPO), inflammatory markers and major comorbidities between older subjects with normal haemoglobin levels and those with different aetiologic forms of anaemia, including unexplained anaemia. Participants were a representative sample of 964 persons aged ≥ 65 years, with no evidence of bleeding, complete blood tests, and a complete blood count within 6 h of phlebotomy. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin < 130 g/l in men and 120 g/l in women, and classified as a result of chronic kidney disease, iron deficiency, chronic disease and B12/folate deficiency anaemia, or unexplained anaemia based on standard criteria. Of the 124 anaemic participants, 42 (36.8%) had unexplained anaemia. Participants with anaemia of chronic diseases had significantly higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, while those with unexplained anaemia had significantly lower CRP than non-anaemic controls. Iron deficiency anaemia was characterised by significantly higher EPO levels compared with other types of anaemia and normal haemoglobin, B12 and/or folate deficiency. Unexplained anaemia was characterised by unexpectedly low EPO and low lymphocyte count. Unexplained anaemia is associated with reduced kidney EPO response, low levels of pro-inflammatory markers and low lymphocyte counts.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^32476418]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has gained from the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme syntheses. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, and therefore these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, and recommendations and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^28ff4692]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements.RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate between MDS, CCUS, and idiopathic cytopenia of undermined significance (ICUS). MDS is diagnosed if MDS diagnostic criteria are met. If the patient has anemia, does not meet the MDS diagnostic criteria, and has somatic mutations associated with hematologic malignancies on cytogenetics, FISH, or NGS, then the diagnosis is consistent with either CCUS if variant allele frequency (VAF) is > 2% or ICUS if VAF is < 2% (Figure 2). Overlap exists between ICUS and UAA and possibly CCUS, depending on the CCUS definition. We favor UAA if the patient is older, they have an isolated mild anemia (eg, hemoglobin less than 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal), and, if performed, no suspicious findings on smear or BM studies of a hematologic malignancy. In this case UAA was diagnosed after other causes of anemia were excluded (Table 1).

### Approach to the diagnosis of aplastic anemia [^424df2d1]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Establishing a diagnosis of aplastic anemia (AA) can be challenging, but it is absolutely critical to appropriate management, especially differentiating between acquired and inherited forms of the disease. The hematology field requires updated diagnostic guidelines to ensure that appropriate clinical pathways are pursued for patients and their safety. There are increasing clinical options for patients with immunosuppressive therapy and transplant once the diagnosis is made. In a case-based format, this review emphasizes the newer data on molecular (somatic and germline) findings in AA and how they are (or are not) helpful during diagnosis. There are key details on somatic mutation profiles and stated evidence where available for prognostic and treatment indications. Germline details of newer syndromes are also outlined, which make this review modern and reflect areas of uncertainty for clinicians.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Disease-modifying treatments for primary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^d19c0fb7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is an autoantibody mediated condition characterised by a variable disease course. A myriad of immunomodulatory agents have been employed but there is a paucity of evidence to support their use or compare their effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effects of various disease-modifying treatment modalities in people with AHIHA.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2021), Embase (Ovid) (1974 to 2021), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 2021), and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). Clinical trial registries and relevant conference proceedings were also reviewed. Records were included as of 7 March 2021. We did not impose any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments against no treatment, placebo, or another immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, for people of all age with idiopathic AIHA.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The prioritised pre-defined outcomes included complete haematological response at 12 months, frequency of adverse events at two, six and 12 months, partial haematological response at 12 months, overall survival at six and 12 months, relapse-free survival (RFS) at six and 12 months, red blood cel (RBC) transfusion requirement after treatment at 12 months, and quality of life (QOL) as measured by validated instruments at 12 months. Based on data availability, we were only able to perform meta-analysis on frequency of complete haematological response.

Main Results

Two trials were included, enrolling a total of 104 adult participants (96 randomised) with warm AIHA in the setting of tertiary referral centres, both comparing the effectiveness between rituximab (375 mg/m² weekly for four weeks, or 1000 mg for two doses two weeks apart) plus glucocorticoid (prednisolone 1.5 or 1mg/kg/day with taper) and glucocorticoid monotherapy. The average age of participants in the two trials were 67 and 71, respectively. One of the included studies had good methodological quality with low risk of bias, whereas the other study had high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding. Compared with glucocorticoid alone, adding rituximab may result in a large increase of complete response at 12 months (n = 96, risk ratio (RR) 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 3.40, GRADE: low-certainty evidence). Rates of adverse effects at prespecified time-points were not reported. Limited data on partial haematological response were reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of adding rituximab to glucocorticoids on partial haematological response at 12 months (n = 32; study = 1; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 68.57; GRADE very low-certainty evidence). RBC transfusion need at 12 months was reported in one study, with four participants (mean number of packed red cell units 4.0 ± 2.82) from the rituximab group and five participants from the placebo (corticosteroid only) (mean number of packed red cell units 5.6 ± 4.15) group requiring transfusion, indicating very uncertain evidence about the effect of adding rituximab to glucocorticoids (n = 32, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.45, GRADE very low-certainty evidence). The other study did not report transfusion requirement at prespecified time points but reported no difference in transfusion requirement between the two groups when comparing responders from enrolment to end of response or to the end of study follow-up (34 units versus 30 units, median [range]: 0 [1 to 6] versus 0 [1 to 5], P = 0·81). Overall survival and RFS rates at prespecified time-points were not explicitly reported in either study. Data on QOL were not available.

Authors' Conclusions

Available literature on the effectiveness of immunomodulatory therapy for primary AIHA is restricted to comparison between rituximab plus glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid alone, in patients with newly diagnosed warm AIHA, calling for need for additional studies. The current result suggests that combinatory therapy with rituximab and glucocorticoid may increase the rate of complete haematological response over glucocorticoid monotherapy.

### Clinical approach to marrow failure [^0b4b465e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment and medical management of aplastic anemia fundamentally differ between patients with inherited versus acquired marrow failure; however, the diagnosis of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome is frequently obscure. Recent exciting advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have resulted in a profusion of new tests to aid in diagnosis. This in turn has raised questions regarding the appropriate choice of testing for the patient presenting with aplastic anemia. Important clues to the diagnosis of an inherited marrow failure syndrome may be gleaned from careful attention to the clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory workup.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### High anemia prevalence in Korean older adults, an advent healthcare problem: 2007–2016 KNHANES [^7275a9d3]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

However, results from this study are limited in their ability to be generalized, because populations with laboratory data displayed significantly varying characteristics compared to populations without laboratory data. The decision to conduct laboratory tests was left entirely to the participants and the decision was made by the family unit in KNHANES; hence, the group with missing laboratory data was not randomly distributed. This seems to contribute to the observed differences.

The occurrence of anemia in older people is not fully understood. Hemoglobin levels in the older population are reportedly lower than the reference values for other population groups. Some reports concluded that this decrease in hemoglobin levels might be one of the consequences of the normal aging process; hence, the criteria for anemia should be reassigned in this population. However, many reports also showed that anemia in older individuals is related to the presence of underlying health conditions and is therefore associated with high mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, most people with anemia have been shown to have nutritional deficiency, but the etiology is unknown in one-third of the anemia cases. This unexplained category of anemia includes aging-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), and pre-myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); these conditions are associated with a low but potential risk of hematologic malignancy. Therefore, older people with anemia are recommended to undergo evaluations for etiology analysis. However, there is no guideline or consensus for the range and frequency of the evaluation and management in this population.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Mechanisms of unexplained anemia in the nursing home [^2033c195]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize anemia in elderly nursing home residents.

Design

Prospective multiinstitutional cohort study.

Setting

Five nursing homes.

Participants

From retrospective analysis, residents found to be anemic using chart review were prospectively randomized. Of the 81 residents enrolled, 60 were anemic.

Measurements

Chart review for medical history and factors related to treatment or history of anemia, extensive laboratory evaluation for causes of anemia, and classification of anemia by two hematologists.

Results

Among the 60 anemic residents, the causes of anemia were idiopathic (n = 27), iron-deficiency (n = 14), anemia associated with chronic disease (n = 8), anemia of renal insufficiency (n = 6), and other (n = 5). The eryrthropoietin (EPO) response to anemia was lower in residents with idiopathic anemia (IA) than in those with iron-deficiency anemia, and this correlated with renal function as estimated using calculated creatinine clearance. In this elderly population, advancing age was not correlated with lower EPO response.

Conclusion

IA is common in nursing home residents. A lower EPO response contributes to the high prevalence of anemia in this setting and may be due, in part, to occult renal dysfunction.

### Primary hypochromic anemia… [^c715b8f2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the past few years, interest has developed in a "new" type of primary or idiopathic anemia. This disease, characterized by the presence, usually in middle-aged women, of pallor, weakness, atrophied tongue, brittle finger nails, achlorhydria and hypochromic anemia, responding readily to large doses of iron and tending to spontaneous relapse, has recently been described under numerous synonyms. Among these may be mentioned chronic microcytic anemia, 1 idiopathic hypochromic anemia, 2 simple achlorhydric anemia, 3 chronic chlorosis, 4 achylic chloranemia, 5 essential hypochromic anemia, 6 and simple achylic anemia. 7 In a previous paper8 the term "primary hypochromic anemia" was suggested, since it was felt that the disease was "primary" or idiopathic in nature and since its chief hematologic feature was the hypochromia of the red blood cells. It was thought that the disease could be compared with another "primary" anemia; namely, pernicious anemia.

### Idiopathic acquired hemolytic anemia… [^0874b365]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

From 1955 to 1965, 117 patients with idiopathic acquired hemolytic anemia were observed. Survival was 91% at one year, 76% at five years, and 73% at ten years. The data suggest that survival has no significant relationship to the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis, to sex, or to hemoglobin level, leukocyte count, platelet count, reticulocyte count, or presence or absence of splenomegaly or a positive Coombs' test at the time of the initial examination. Survival data suggested that, at the five- and ten-year periods of observation, patients treated with both splenectomy and corticosteroids have a more favorable prognosis than do patients treated with corticosteroids alone.

### Rational management approach to pure red cell aplasia [^bdd0c285]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Progress in the management of rare diseases relies on the accumulation of empiric experiences, integrative analyses of several cases, and rarely, clinical trials. Guidelines for the management of PRCA are incomplete and, outside of a few referral centers, patients rely on the inquisitive minds of their hematologists. Given the rarity of this condition, we were inspired to further investigate the large number of cases of PRCA seen in our institution. A summary of our diagnostic approach and treatment results, and study outcomes previously published, are shown in Table 4. We also studied patient etiology, clinical phenotypes, immunological characteristics and genomic data. Our diagnostic approach was based on rational steps to exclude congenital disease (rare in adults), and malproductive anemia, which includes nutritional deficiencies, systemic diseases, and iatrogenic/drug-related diseases. Thereafter, infectious etiologies, in particular B19-mediated TAC, were distinguished in order to arrive at idiopathic- and pathophysiologically-related T-LGL cases. The diagnostic fractions obtained by this approach likely reflect those that would be seen in the community. Idiopathic aPRCA is present in a high percentage of cases and is likely T-cell-mediated. There are also reports of PRCA mediated by antibodies specific for erythroid progenitors. Mature red cells would have to lack such a tar get antigen as they would have been annihilated otherwise, as is the case in hemolytic anemia. While anti-EPO antibodies have been invoked in some cases treated with recombinant EPO, in our cohort not a single case suggested the presence of such antibodies. Nevertheless, rare responses to rituximab may imply the presence of erythroid antibodies in an occasional patient, but routine laboratory tests are not available to identify such patients. Lastly, the identification of clonal mutations, including subclonal hierarchy, with an assigned role in MDS may seem to suggest some are cases of "missed" MDS, or early developing MDS, but our results do not support this notion. Conversely, the presence of clonal events in older patients may simply be consistent with the diagnosis of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or underscore, as in aplastic anemia, the contraction of normal progenitor and stem cell pools with a greater likelihood of detecting clonal events.

### Aplastic anaemia [^4052e730]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aplastic anemia:

- **Definition**: AA is a rare hematopoietic stem cell disorder that results in pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AA is largely immune-mediated, with autoreactive lymphocytes mediating the destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. This immune dysregulation leads to bone marrow failure and the cessation of new blood cell production.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AA is estimated at 0.2–0.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AA include exposure to specific medications, pesticides, and certain chemicals, as well as genetic predisposition and low socioeconomic status.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients may present with symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue and pallor, bleeding tendencies due to thrombocytopenia, and increased susceptibility to infections due to neutropenia. A significant complication of AA is the risk of progression to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of AA can vary widely. Some patients may have mild symptoms that require little or no therapy, while others may present with life-threatening pancytopenia.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^bbebb535]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

In one of the first population‐based studies to describe UAA, Guralnik et al. examined the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 4199 community‐dwelling men and women over the age of 65 years. One third of cases of anemia could be attributed to nutritional causes, and another third were associated with inflammation or chronic kidney disease (CKD). This left one third of cases without a clear etiology. A comparable proportion of mild anemia (defined as a Hb concentration of 10.0–11.9 g/dl in women and 10.0–12.9 g/dl in men) is unexplained: in an Italian cohort of 8744 individuals between aged 65–84, mild anemia had no identifiable cause in 26.4% of cases.

In a wide range of population‐based studies of anemia, 25%–44% of cases could be classified as UAA (Table 1). This holds true whether the study population is community‐based, hospital inpatient, or long‐term care residents. Importantly, the prevalence of UAA remains high even when the potential cause of anemia is rigorously examined. In study populations consisting of hematology clinic outpatients and patients referred to anemia referral clinics, in which cohorts were subjected to comprehensive examinations, the frequency of UAA is 35%–44%. For example, Artz et al.examined a community‐dwelling, predominantly African‐American (69%) group of patients over the age of 65 who had been referred to an anemia clinic and even after intensive evaluations of causes, UAA was the most common category in both white and African‐American patients. Michalak et al.retrospectively examined medical records of 981 patients over the age of 60 and found that anemia was unexplained in 48 of 169 patients, with a UAA prevalence of 4.9%. The prevalence of UAA increased from 2.9% in those between 60 and 69 to 12.3% in patients ≥ 80 years of age.

### Anemia in older persons [^6d439f4c]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia in older persons is commonly overlooked despite mounting evidence that low hemoglobin levels are a significant marker of physiologic decline. Using the World Health Organization definition of anemia (hemoglobin level less than 13 g per dL [130 g per L] in men and less than 12 g per dL [120 g per L] in women), more than 10 percent of persons older than 65 years are anemic. The prevalence increases with age, approaching 50 percent in chronically ill patients living in nursing homes. There is increasing evidence that even mild anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Anemia warrants evaluation in all older persons, except those at the end of life or who decline interventions. About one third of persons have anemia secondary to a nutritional deficiency, one third have anemia caused by chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease, and one third have unexplained anemia. Nutritional anemia is effectively treated with vitamin or iron replacement. Iron deficiency anemia often is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding and requires further investigation in most patients. Anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease may respond to treatment of the underlying disease and selective use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The treatment of unexplained anemia is difficult, and there is little evidence that treatment decreases morbidity and mortality, or improves quality of life. Occasionally, anemia may be caused by less common but potentially treatable conditions, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^5945ef78]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^648132fd]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

Anemia remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in high‐altitude populations where physiological adaptations complicate standard diagnostic practices. Current WHO Hb cutoff points may lead to misclassification, either under‐ or overestimating anemia in high‐altitude regions. To address this, a refined approach is needed, incorporating revised diagnostic thresholds tailored to population‐specific adaptations, alongside personalized clinical assessments and emerging biomarkers. Additionally, integrating genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors will enhance diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy. Implementing this comprehensive framework would facilitate greater diagnostic precision, enable more targeted therapeutic interventions, and enhance health outcomes for the populations most impacted.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^adf2a1de]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an uncommon entity that presents diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic dilemmas despite being a well-recognized entity for over 150 years. This is because of significant differences in the rates of hemolysis and associated diseases and because there is considerable clinical heterogeneity. In addition, there is a lack of clinical trials required to refine and update standardized and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. To aid the clinician in AIHA management, we present four vignettes that represent and highlight distinct clinical presentations with separate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways that we use in our clinical practice setting. We also review the parameters present in diagnostic testing that allow for prognostic insight and present algorithms for both diagnosis and treatment of the AIHA patient in diverse situations. This is done in the hope that this review may offer guidance in regard to personalized therapy recommendations. A section is included for the diagnosis of suspected AIHA with negative test results, a relatively infrequent but challenging situation, in order to assist in the overall evaluation spectrum for these patients.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^dfd609a1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### New challenges in evaluating anemia in older persons in the era of molecular testing [^ec97866f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in older persons, and often remains unexplained despite a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory testing, including marrow aspiration, biopsy, and karyotyping. The advent of molecular genetic testing panels in hematology clinical practice has complicated the evaluation of older patients with unexplained anemia. While the presence of a somatic mutation provides evidence of clonal hematopoiesis and may support a diagnosis of a hematologic neoplasm such as one of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), with rare exceptions, individual mutations are not strongly associated with one specific diagnosis, nor are they by themselves diagnostic of neoplasia. A clonal mutation in a patient with cytopenias and a nondiagnostic bone marrow may indicate a syndrome with a similar natural history to MDS, but at present there are no clear criteria to distinguish cytopenias coincidentally seen in association with an unrelated clonal mutation from cytopenias that are directly caused by that mutation. Ongoing and planned analyses will help define when mutation patterns alone can identify a disorder equivalent to a morphologically defined myeloid neoplasm such as MDS, further clarifying the etiology and natural history of unexplained anemia in the elderly.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

### Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis presenting as anemia, failure to thrive, and jaundice in a toddler [^adade3b5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease characterized by the triad of hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, and anemia. Its diagnosis should be considered in any child presenting with moderate to severe anemia and failure to thrive of unclear etiology. Consideration of the differential diagnosis in such a child should include the review of both extravascular and intravascular causes of hemolysis. Systemic treatment of IPH with glucocorticoids has been shown to decrease morbidity, mortality, and disease progression to pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, diagnostic delays can impact prognosis. Here, we present a case of a 15-month-old boy with IPH who presented with anemia, jaundice, and failure to thrive, as well as a history of hemoptysis that was not initially elicited.

### How I treat unexplained refractory iron deficiency anemia [^977fe436]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Endoscopic gastrointestinal workup fails to establish the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a substantial proportion of patients. In patients referred for hematologic evaluation with unexplained or refractory IDA, screening for celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis, Helicobacter pylori, and hereditary forms of IDA is recommended. About 4% to 6% of patients with obscure refractory IDA have celiac disease, and autoimmune gastritis is encountered in 20% to 27% of patients. Stratification by age cohorts in autoimmune gastritis implies a disease presenting as IDA many years before the establishment of clinical cobalamin deficiency. Over 50% of patients with unexplained refractory IDA have active H pylori infection and, after excluding all other causes of IDA, 64% to 75% of such patients are permanently cured by H pylori eradication. In young patients with a history suggestive of hereditary iron deficiency with serum ferritin higher than expected for IDA, mutations involving iron trafficking and regulation should be considered. Recognition of the respective roles of H pylori, autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, and genetic defects in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency should have a strong impact on the current diagnostic workup and management of unexplained, or refractory, IDA.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Diagnosis and management of aplastic anemia [^d483a4cb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Aplastic anemia remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Our ability to reliably diagnose, and therefore exclude, a variety of inherited or acquired diseases with similar phenotypes has improved markedly. An efficient diagnostic plan is important because time from diagnosis to treatment is related to outcome regardless of the therapeutic option chosen. HSCT remains the mainstay of therapy for those with matched sibling donors, and results have improved even further in recent years. For those without a sibling donor, the high response and overall survival rates of combined immunosuppressive therapy (IST) have proven robust. Nonetheless, incomplete response, relapse, and progression to myelodysplasia/leukemia have more clearly emerged as significant long-term issues. Improvements in outcome of alternative donor transplantation and the use of established and novel immunosuppressive agents provide multiple alternatives for treating refractory or relapsed patients. Best practices in this regard are not yet clearly established and may vary by a variety of demographic and treatment-specific factors. Regardless of the type of therapeutic approach, patients require ongoing monitoring for occurrence of disease and/or therapy-related side effects.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^04d21bef]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^5953a499]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and heterogeneous disease that affects 1 to 3/100000 patients per year. AIHA caused by warm autoantibodies (w-AIHA), ie, antibodies that react with their antigens on the red blood cell optimally at 37°C, is the most common type, comprising ∼70% to 80% of all adult cases and ∼50% of pediatric cases. About half of the w-AIHA cases are called primary because no specific etiology can be found, whereas the rest are secondary to other recognizable underlying disorders. This review will focus on the postulated immunopathogenetic mechanisms in idiopathic and secondary w-AIHA and report on the rare cases of direct antiglobulin test-negative AIHA, which are even more likely to be fatal because of inherent characteristics of the causative antibodies, as well as because of delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Then, the characteristics of w-AIHA associated with genetically defined immune dysregulation disorders and special considerations on its management will be discussed. Finally, the standard treatment options and newer therapeutic approaches for this chronic autoimmune blood disorder will be reviewed.

1.10 Iron deficiency in high‐risk populations with chronic inflammatory conditions

Chronic conditions cannot be viewed in isolation and there will be circumstances where individuals may have further increased susceptibility to iron deficiency. To optimize outcomes for these patients, risks need to be pre‐empted wherever possible. Three important populations to consider among your patients are: women (particularly those who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, and those who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]); the elderly; and those undergoing surgery.

Women of reproductive age are one of the most at‐risk population groups for iron deficiency anemia. Between 4 and 52% of women of reproductive age are reported to suffer from HMB, with a wide range reflecting disparities between study populations and how HMB is defined 88 Notably, a recent European study demonstrated that 63% of the participating HMB patients were suffering from iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. 89 Iron deficiency in combination with HMB can have debilitating consequences on the QoL and wellbeing of the sufferer. 90, 91, 92, 93 Thus, many of these women enter pregnancy with low iron stores and are often already anemic. Approximately 42% of pregnant women worldwide have anemia, with iron deficiency anemia being the primary cause, and this may have a serious detrimental effect on the outcome for both mother and child. 2, 94, 95, 96 In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, possibly due to not being able to withstand the adverse effect of excessive blood loss at delivery and the increased risk of infection. 96 Iron deficiency anemia also affects the child and has been linked with increased risk of preterm labor and subsequent low birthweight, and perinatal complications. 97 Moreover, there is an association between maternal iron status in pregnancy with that of the infant; with infants born to anemic mothers being more likely to be anemic themselves. 98 Iron deficiency also carries negative long‐term impact on the mother–child relationship and the child's cognitive development, of which the latter has shown to persist for up to 10 years, even after iron repletion. 95, 99, 100

1 INTRODUCTION

Managing patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with complex inflammatory disorders, can be challenging. In these patients, a considered multidisciplinary approach needs to be adopted to maintain quality of life (QoL) and improve outcomes. 2, 3 One condition that is frequently associated with chronic disease, but often overlooked, is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is estimated to affect 37–61% of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), 24–85% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 13–90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Iron is essential to every cell and, while its fundamental role in oxygen transport through erythropoiesis is well recognized, it is equally critical for energy production and efficient functioning of all of the body's organs. 10, 11 In patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, its impact can be particularly severe and may exacerbate the underlying disease state, leading to accelerated clinical deterioration. 5, 12

Anemia is the ultimate consequence of iron deficiency in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. 2, 3, 13, 14 However, the medical field should recognize iron deficiency as a clinical condition distinct from anemia. Recognition is improving owing to our better understanding of the pathophysiological role of iron deficiency (independent of chronic anemia) in symptomatology and clinical outcomes. 10, 15, 16 This is further supported by recent clinical observations of an association between the alleviation of morbidity or mortality and the treatment of iron deficiency, even outside the context of anemia. 6, 17, 18 However, there is uncertainty among physicians on how to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. This is partially because of symptom overlap with the underlying disease and unclear laboratory diagnostic thresholds. Several publications have also highlighted the problems of recognizing iron deficiency in the context of anemia of inflammation. 13, 19, 20, 21 This has led to under‐diagnosis of an easily treatable condition, leading to anemia, at which point physicians feel more confident about using iron therapy. 22
