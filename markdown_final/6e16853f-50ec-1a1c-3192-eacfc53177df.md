## Question

9.12 How many different four-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 0,1,2,3, if each digit appears only once in the representation of the number?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many different four-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3, with each digit used exactly once. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total permutations of four distinct digits. Then, I should verify how many of those permutations are invalid because they start with 0. Finally, I will subtract the invalid cases from the total to get the count of valid four-digit numbers.

> Let me first confirm the total number of ways to arrange four distinct digits without any restrictions. That is simply 4 factorial, which equals 24, because there are 4 choices for the first position, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth, giving 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 permutations [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the constraint that matters here: a four-digit number cannot start with 0, so I need to exclude permutations where 0 is in the thousands place. If 0 is fixed in the first position, the remaining three digits (1, 2, 3) can be arranged in 3 factorial ways, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 invalid arrangements [^notfound].

> I should double-check the subtraction step. The number of valid four-digit numbers is the total permutations minus the invalid ones, so 24 − 6 = 18. Therefore, 18 different four-digit numbers can be formed using 0, 1, 2, and 3 with each digit used exactly once [^notfound].

---

The number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed from the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3, with each digit appearing only once, is **18**. This is calculated by considering that the first digit cannot be 0 (3 choices: 1, 2, 3), then the remaining three digits can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, giving 3 × 6 = 18 valid numbers.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Total permutations of the digits

First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange the four digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 without restriction. This is the number of permutations of 4 distinct digits, which is **4! = 24**.

---

### Invalid permutations (numbers starting with 0)

Next, identify the invalid cases — those in which the number starts with 0, because a four-digit number cannot have 0 in the thousands place. Fix 0 in the first position; the remaining three digits (1, 2, 3) can be arranged in **3! = 6** ways.

---

### Valid four-digit numbers

Subtract the invalid permutations from the total to obtain the number of valid four-digit numbers: **24 − 6 = 18**.

---

## Verification by enumeration

To ensure correctness, enumerate the valid numbers:

- **First digit 1**: 1023, 1032, 1203, 1230, 1302, 1320 (6 numbers)
- **First digit 2**: 2013, 2031, 2103, 2130, 2301, 2310 (6 numbers)
- **First digit 3**: 3012, 3021, 3102, 3120, 3201, 3210 (6 numbers)

Total: **6 + 6 + 6 = 18** valid four-digit numbers.

---

## Conclusion

The number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed from the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3, with each digit appearing only once, is **18**.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### A DNA-based system for selecting and displaying the combined result of two input variables [^98a5cd1c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

If the method should be used to process the input of two biological sequences it would require that X and Y be decoupled to allow input of arbitrary sequences. For this purpose we have introduced a third capture–linker strand as shown in Fig. 3a. This sequence contains two 8-nt domains that are each complementary to the two inputs, and furthermore it contains the capture sequence that allows binding to the MBs. This forms an incomplete four-way junction that is completed by selecting the fully complementary result sequence on the two 8-nt domains on X and Y to form a stable four-way junction. To demonstrate the principle we have used two short synthetic input strands. As shown with native PAGE in Fig. 3b, lane 4, inputs X and Y are independent. In lane 7, inputs X, Y and the capture–linker form a stable complex. In the native PAGE result shown in Fig. 3c, lanes 3 and 4, neither X nor Y alone binds with the result strand. In lane 5, where both X and Y are present, the input complex can bind to the correct result. This means that the correct result is only selected in the presence of both inputs X and Y. In lane 6 it is demonstrated, using three results where only one of the domains is correct, that wrong results do not bind to the input complex. Finally, in lane 7 the correct result is selected in the mixture with three wrong result sequences.

Translation of the results to a seven-segmented display

The mechanism of the output generation proceeds by selection of translator strands that guide the assembled complex to the lines of the digital number that displays the result in a seven-segmented display. As illustrated in Fig. 4 for the simple calculation of 1 × 2 = 2, the result two strands can hybridize with each of the five translator strands that are required to display the number 2. After MB-mediated separation from the solution of translator strands, the result–translator complex is (in most cases) liberated from the MBs and applied to a surface containing a pattern of one or more digital numbers. Each of the lines in the digit is functionalized with a unique host sequence that is complementary to the translator stands a–g. This means that contingent on the selected set of translator strands the digit has the capacity to display all numbers from 0 to 9. The encoding required for displaying the numbers 0–9 is shown in Table 1. A total of 49 translator sequences are required for displaying the 10 numbers in a one-digit display.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^07189726]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Digits Span is a cognitive task designed to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of numbers that they must recall. The first sequence is always 2 numbers long, and at each trial, if the participant replies correctly, the length of the next sequence increases by one. If the participant incorrectly recalls the sequence of numbers, then another string of the same length is presented. This is repeated until the participant replies incorrectly 3 times consecutively, when the task terminates. Spatial Span has a similar design to Digits Span, but instead of digits participants recall the location of sequences of flashes on a 4 × 4 grid of squares, testing their spatial working memory capacity. As shown in Fig. 3c for Digits Span, the derived DS measure suggested that the more numbers participants must remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.92). Similarly for Spatial Span, the more squares participants have to remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.84) (Fig. 3d).

Words Definitions is designed to measure crystallised intelligence. Participants are presented with a word and four alternative definitions. They must select the definition that corresponds to the meaning of the word as quickly as possible. The task has multiple trials and at each trial a different word is shown. The words are characterised by different frequency of occurrence in the English language. To assess the word difficulty scale predicted by IDoCT for the Words Definitions task, the correlation between the obtained measure of difficulty DS and the frequency of occurrence in the English language of the words included in the cognitive assessment was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the most frequently used words in English were assigned a lower D and DS compared to the least frequently used ones. A Spearman correlation of −0.66 and −0.64 between respectively DS and D with the log frequency measures of the words was found.

Motor Control is designed to measure motor abilities. Participants are shown a moving target, which is represented as a circular red button, and are expected to press on the target as quickly as possible, as soon as it appears, and before it changes location in the screen. According to IDoCT, the further the location of the current target from the previous location, the higher the difficulty estimate DS (Spearman correlation between the distance and D and DS was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively — Fig. 3b).

### Evidence against tetrapod-wide digit identities and for a limited frame shift in bird wings [^f78f984e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Analyses of developmental identity of digits tend to focus on either Shh expression and signaling in the limb bud prior to digit condensation or gene expression in the interdigital mesenchyme after digit condensation. In this paper, we follow the latter approach. Although Shh signaling determines the number of digits formed and initiates the development of differences between digits, the execution of digit-specific developmental programs continues long after the Shh signal has ceased. Dahn and Fallondemonstrated in the chicken hindlimb that genes expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme regulate digit-specific morphologies, including the number of phalanges. Subsequent work in the chicken hindlimb showed that this signaling, in the phalanx-forming region, is active between stages 27 and 30. In addition, we follow the latter approach because we allow the possibility that in digits developmental identity can be decoupled from digit position.

Here we present comparative transcriptomic data, analyzing developing digits, and their associated posterior interdigital mesenchyme in five species to test hypotheses of digit identity in amniotes. We report a surprising diversity of regulatory gene expression profiles of digits between species. Analyses further reveal a core set of transcription factor genes differentially expressed among digits and suggest an alternative model for the evolution of the bird wing.

### Second to fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D), breast cancer risk factors, and breast cancer risk: a prospective cohort study [^6b941821]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Inter and intraobserver reliability was high for raw digit measurements, with ICC's for left and right, index and ring fingers all being greater than 0.95. Intraclass correlation coefficients for 2D: 4D ratio were slightly lower than those for raw digit measurements (0.80 for right and 0.73 for left 2D: 4D), but still suggest that the observed variability in digit ratio is largely due to between individual differences rather than measurement error.

Of the 9044 women available for this study, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases during a median follow-up of 16 years 4 months per participant (a total of 145 328 person-years at risk were observed). Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Cases were slightly older than non-cases on average, with median age at baseline of 55 years compared with 53. Seventy-five percent of the participants were born in Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^ab85dde2]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

National drug code (NDC) reporting — manufacturers may use different NDC configurations with variation in the number of digits assigned to each of the 3 segments; to accommodate this, an 11th digit (a leading 0) may be inserted into a segment, and payers request that administered units be appended to NDC codes on claim forms. An example states that in multidose packaging 1 U equates to 1 dose and, if units are specified in milliliters for a 0.5-mL vaccine dose, one would specify 0.5 U rather than 1 U.

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^3c9a2b7d]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by using the average 2D:4D from at least two raters for each hand and each procedure (photocopy and radiography). Significant relations have been reported between 2D:4D and various outcomes when male and female individuals are combined into one group. In other instances, the relation between 2D:4D and an outcome is only statistically significant when men and women are analyzed separately. Therefore, we performed all analyses both ways — with sexes combined and separated.

In our (facetious) effort to persuade less statistically savvy readers of the validity of our statistical analyses, we report as many P values as possible, even where they are not necessary (eg, descriptive statistics). All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS version 27.0 and a priori statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.

Inter-rater agreement

To determine reliability of the most consistent raters for a given 2D:4D, a one-way random intraclass correlation coefficient was computed for each hand using each technique. Additionally, the mean inter-rater percentage differences were computed for each measurement technique for each hand.

To determine the relation between 2D:4D and sex, hand, and measurement technique, linear mixed effects models were computed by use of a scaled identity as the repeated measures covariance structure. Sex (male v female), hand (left v right), measurement technique (photocopy v radiograph), and all two way interactions between the three factors served as categorical predictors, and 2D:4D served as the dependent variable. A similar linear mixed effects model was also used to compare age, height, and body mass between sexes.

For correlations between 2D:4D and body composition parameters and good luck, preliminary analysis showed that the continuous body composition outcome variables were not normally distributed. Therefore, Spearman's r s was computed for all correlations.

Patient and public involvement

Conversations with members of the public inspired this study, because many indicated that they had seen 2D:4D mentioned in social media; some believed that scientific research had confirmed that 2D:4D had real life applications, while others expressed doubt that 2D:4D could predict anything. However, patients or the public were not directly involved in this study because of limited resources. A member of the public read this manuscript after submission.

Digit ratio data collection

Digit ratios were measured by two different procedures in accordance with best practice recommendations (appendix 1). Figure 2 shows example images. Participants were instructed to lightly place their hand on a standard photocopier (MX-3570N, Sharp Electronics, Montvale, NJ), and the researcher then scanned one hand at a time. Digital images were captured and delivered electronically to the research team. To minimize radiation exposure and optimize time efficiency, we also used DXA to obtain images of the phalangeal bones. We used the scanner's lumbar spine analysis software to capture an image with sufficient detail to identify details of the phalangeal bones.

Example hand images used to measure the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D). Both images are the right hand of the same participant; yellow lines represent second and fourth digit measurements. (A) Photocopy image: 2D:4D = 0.966. (B) Radiographic image: 2D:4D = 0.943 (radiographic image has been horizontally flipped to be in the same orientation as the photocopy)

Good luck measurement

Participants were asked to select five cards from a deck of playing cards (United States Playing Card Company, Erlanger, KY). Cards were thoroughly shuffled by an investigator and then fanned out, face down, onto a smooth, flat surface. The participant was then requested to select any five of the face down cards and flip them over. The value and suit of the cards were recorded. This procedure was repeated a second time with a separate, shuffled deck of playing cards, which resulted in each participant having two separate, randomly selected, five card poker hands, drawn from two separate decks of cards.

Poker hands were classified and ranked according to standard poker rules (that is, royal flush as the highest hand, single high card as lowest hand). Each individual's highest ranking hand was then selected, and ranked in relation to all other participants at the completion of the study. For instance, the best poker hand in the study's dataset (a nine high straight) was given the top rank of 1. In the event of a tie, both hands were given the same rank, and the ranking below was given a rank two units below those (eg, if two participants had identical hands, and both were ranked 37th, the next hand below them would be ranked 39th).

### Three learning stages and accuracy-efficiency tradeoff of restricted boltzmann machines [^2d291dc7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Our second example (cf. Fig. 3) is closer in spirit to traditional machine-learning applications and involves pattern recognition and artificial image generation. The target distribution p (x) generates 5 × 5 pixel images with a "hook" pattern comprised of 15 pixels (see Fig. 3 a) implanted at a random position in a background of noisy pixels that are independently activated (white, x i = 1) with probability q = 0.1 (see also Supplementary Note 2 B for more details). Periodic boundary conditions are assumed, meaning that p (x) is translationally invariant along the two image dimensions.

We also consider a one-dimensional variant of this example with only M = 4 (M = 5) visible units and an implanted "010" ("0110") pattern, cf. Fig. 3 d. In this case, we can solve the continuous-time learning dynamics (η → 0 limit of (4)) for the exact target and model distributions p (x) and, obviating artifacts caused by insufficient training data or biased gradient approximations, see also Supplementary Note 1.

Our third example (cf. Fig. 4 a–c) is a simplified digit reproduction task. Patterns of the ten digits 0 through 9 (see Fig. 4 a) are selected and inserted uniformly at random into image frames of 5 × 7 pixels, with the remaining pixels outside of the pattern again activated with probability q = 0.1 (see Supplementary Note 2 C for details). No periodic boundary conditions are imposed, i.e. the input comprises proper, ordinary images.

In our fourth example (cf. Fig. 4 d, e), we train RBMs on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28 × 28-pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. It comprises a training set of 60,000 and a test set of 10,000 images. We convert the grayscale images with pixel values between 0 and 255 to binary data by mapping values 0… 127 to 0 and 128… 255 to 1 (see also Supplementary Note 2 D).

### Integration of growth and specification in chick wing digit-patterning [^892cdcf5]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

In the classical model of chick wing digit-patterning, the polarizing region — a group of cells at the posterior margin of the early bud — produces a morphogen gradient, now known to be based on Sonic hedgehog (Shh), that progressively specifies anteroposterior positional identities in the posterior digit-forming region. Here we add an integral growth component to this model by showing that Shh-dependent proliferation of prospective digit progenitor cells is essential for specifying the complete pattern of digits across the anteroposterior axis. Inhibiting Shh signalling in early wing buds reduced anteroposterior expansion, and posterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed anterior structures. Inhibiting proliferation also irreversibly reduced anteroposterior expansion, but instead anterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed posterior structures. When proliferation recovered in such wings, Shh transcription was maintained for longer than normal, suggesting that duration of Shh expression is controlled by a mechanism that measures proliferation. Rescue experiments confirmed that Shh-dependent proliferation controls digit number during a discrete time-window in which Shh-dependent specification normally occurs. Our findings that Shh signalling has dual functions that can be temporally uncoupled have implications for understanding congenital and evolutionary digit reductions.

### The genetic relationship between educational attainment and cognitive performance in major psychiatric disorders [^fc60a14a]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Trail-Making-Test (TMT)

The TMT is a measure of visual attention and task switching and is one of several executive functioning measures. The test consists of two parts, part A assesses psychomotor speed of the participant, and part B assesses switching between two automated tasks (counting and reciting the alphabet). The time taken to complete each part of the test was measured and the difference in time needed (part B-part A) was used, as it is considered a more accurate measure of the divided attention and alternating sequencing tasks tested in part B –. In this case, a higher score meant worse cognitive performance.

Verbal digit span

The verbal digit span, from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, assesses short-term (forward digit-span) and working memory capacity (backward digit-span). Briefly, participants were asked to recall verbally a sequence of digits, with increasingly longer sequences in each trial. For each correctly recalled string of digits, one point was given. The test was ended when the participant was unable to correctly repeat two presented strings of the same length. The difference between the forward and backward task is that the latter involves mental manipulation as the participant is required to repeat the digits in backward order. A score for each task was considered.

Digit-Symbol-Test (DST)

The DST is a subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scaleand measures processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention. In this test, the participant was asked to use a key of numbers 1–9 with coinciding symbols to draw the appropriate symbol that matched the number given. The participant was given 120 s to fill in as many corresponding symbols as possible. In the end, the correct number of symbols drawn was totaled to get an overall score.

Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT)

The VLMT is the German version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. This word-list learning paradigm assesses several memory parameters through serial list learning with subsequent distraction, retrieval after distraction and half-hour time delay, and through a recognition task. The test consists of two different word lists which are each 15 independent words and a recognition list which includes 30 words from the two lists and 20 similar distractor words. Four VLMT scores were rated, the first for the number of correctly recalled words from the first list, a second score for the number of words lost after distraction, a third score of words lost after a time interval, and a fourth score of correctly recalled words from the recognition list.

### The impact of learning multiple real-world skills on cognitive abilities and functional independence in healthy older adults [^c2f01534]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Measures

A baseline assessment (Week 0) was added in Study 2, so that the participants could serve as their own control. We also included pre-test (Week 6), midpoint (Week 12), and post-test (Week 18) assessments, following Study 1. The measurement battery for Study 2 was identical to the battery in Study 1, with the exception of two additional working memory measures: the 2-back from the EXAMINER battery, and the forward and backward digit span task (Table 2). The 2-back task required participants to remember the location of a square on two trials prior to the current trial (compared with only one trial prior in the 1-back task). The forward and backward digit span task required participants to memorize 16 sequences for the forward task and 14 sequences for the backward task. There were two sequences per trial, with eight trials for the forward task and seven trials for the backward task. The number of digits in each sequence increased after each trial, starting with two digits in the sequences for the first trial and ending with eight to nine digits in the last trial. The total score was divided by 15, the total number of trials.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

5.2.3 书写

对于DCD患者，尤其是DCD儿童，书写是一个特殊的问题；实际上许多患儿都专门针对书写问题接受了治疗。

指南第一版发布后，尚没有DCD儿童书写干预的论文发表，因此第一版这方面的内容暂时不变。仅一项病例研究 264 报道了书写技能训练的相关内容，但只涉及3名儿童。经过强化训练后（每周2次，每次 45分钟；以及持续13周的家庭作业），其中2名儿童有所改善。

虽然智能手机、平板电脑和笔记本电脑等现代技术使用有所增加，并且在某种程度上（取决于文化背景和社会环境）儿童对书写的依赖程度有所下降，但由书写障碍引发的参与问题仍是DCD儿童面临的一个严峻考验。操作键盘和鼠标也是精细运动能力，这可能会给DCD儿童造成问题，他们可能需要接受训练。为防止DCD儿童书写或操作电脑问题带来的对学业成绩的影响（被贴上差生或学习成绩差的标签），可建议进行键盘和平板电脑操作的同步训练。

### Electronic application to improve management of infections in low-income neonatal units: pilot implementation of the neoTree beta app in a public sector hospital in Zimbabwe [^b7b73b38]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

PDSA 2: revision of NeoTree ID number

By month 3, we found a high number of 'unmatched' discharge forms where the NeoTree ID entered on the discharge form had no corresponding NeoTree ID on an admission form. This was partly due to admission forms not being completed if the baby died shortly after admission (as mentioned under PDSA 1), but the percentage of unmatched discharge forms were still excessive. We found that NeoTree ID numbers were frequently entered incorrectly on the discharge form. We addressed this in month 4 partly via software changes using ongoing version control (software code available at) — shortening the 16-digit ID number to eight digits and using 'fuzzy matching' (a code string to find very near, but imperfect matches, eg, with one digit different) to match admissions/discharges based on common mismatches in the dataset where, for example, 0 (number) and O (letter) had been confused. These were labelled as imperfect matches within the dataset. We also further amended the monthly prizes to include a 'league table' of highest percentage matches by junior doctors. This successfully reduced the number of NeoTree ID mismatches, dropping from 44% unmatched to < 10% unmatched (figure 1). A small increase in unmatched records in month 8 was traced back to an individual new starter who received remedial training with good effect.

Figure 1
Trend in NeoTree ID matches per month throughout the project.

In a current parallel project, we are investigating the use of record linkage techniques, including probabilistic record linkage, to improve record matching and to increase the proportion of matched admission and discharge files. The next iteration of the NeoTree app has built-in functionality to match ID numbers with currently admitted patients at discharge to minimise mismatch risk.

### Giving science the finger-is the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D: 4D) a biomarker of good luck? A cross sectional study [^e344c654]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Comparison of 2D:4D by sex, hand, and measurement technique

A summary of 2D:4D data are provided in table 2. Some significant differences were seen: men had a lower 2D:4D than women (P < 0.001), the left hand had a lower 2D:4D than the right hand for the photocopy technique (P = 0.004; but a two way interaction showed this association was significant for photocopy only), and the radiograph technique produced lower 2D:4D measurements than the photocopy technique (P < 0.001). A significant interaction between measurement technique and hand measured (P = 0.006) was noted, but the interactions between sex and measurement technique (P = 0.70) and between sex and hand measured (P = 0.92) were not significant. Despite significant differences in mean 2D:4D, the distribution of 2D:4D between sexes, hands, and techniques showed considerable overlap (fig 3).

### An interdigit signalling centre instructs coordinate phalanx-joint formation governed by 5' hoxd-gli3 antagonism [^017630e9]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Differing net Bmp levels governed by the 5′Hoxd–Gli3 balance in different interdigits provides one input that determines progenitor pool size/duration by regulating exit of progenitors into the PFR, and possibly by modulating AER- and progenitor maintenance. Clearly, other regulatory inputs must also play a role. In forelimb digits, information on proper interzone position appears to be at least partly preserved in 5′Hoxd − / − digits (see Fig. 1m) and rescued mutant interzones are similarly positioned to controls (Figs 1i, j and 4a, b). In addition, other models, such as a Turing mechanism, that could predict periodicity in interzone specification have not been excluded. It is noteworthy that both 5′Hoxd and Gli3 gene functions have also been implicated genetically in controlling the number of digit rays formed in mouse, which has been modelled using reaction-diffusion mechanisms involving both Bmp and Wnt pathways. However, in this context, Hoxd–Gli3 roles differ somewhat, and interact synergistically rather than antagonistically. Sox9 + digit rays formed by ∼E11.5, whose number varies with Hoxd–Gli3 dosage, are progenitors of the more proximal metapodial elements (Fig. 3a), and their formation is regulated at an earlier stage, prior to interdigit signalling effects on PFR/interzone digit formation. Consistent with this, Gli3 removal at later stagesor selectively from interdigits (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4) still affects joint formation/phalangeal phenotypes dramatically, but does not alter digit condensation number. Future work directed towards interrogating the interplay between Bmp pathway and other inputs leading to periodic interzone–phalanx formation will be required to test different models for this process and to elucidate the contribution of AER/Fgf function.

### Number representations drive number-line estimates [^6bf63201]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The number-line task has been extensively used to study the mental representation of numbers in children. However, studies suggest that proportional reasoning provides a better account of children's performance. Ninety 4- to 6-year-olds were given a number-line task with symbolic numbers, with clustered dot arrays that resembled a perceptual scaling task, or with spread-out dot arrays that involved numerical estimation. Children performed well with clustered dot arrays, but poorly with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays. Performances with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays were highly correlated and were related to counting skill; neither was true for clustered dot arrays. Overall, results provide evidence for the role of mental representation of numbers in the symbolic number-line task.

### Symbrachydactyly-diagnosis, function, and treatment [^9ab31a61]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Symbrachydactyly is a congenital hand difference that presents with diverse morphologic forms and can be confused with many other congenital hand differences. Congenital hand difference classification schemes categorize symbrachydactyly as an undergrowth or failure of axis formation. It is further categorized by the number of affected fingers, by morphologic characteristics, and by the functional status of the hand. Symbrachydactyly represents a disruption of embryonic formation and differentiation that results in a hand shorter and smaller than the contralateral with underdeveloped often short or webbed digits, digital nubbins, or absent digits. Treatment is patient specific and should be guided to improve the function and appearance of the hand.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^dffe7e7d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The model can perform well with as little as 100 participants

The simulation analysis (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Figure 1) suggested that IDoCT can reliably capture measures of D, DS, AS and DT also when as little as 100 samples are used. Being able to obtain precise measures with a smaller sample size is fundamental, since large scale data collection is not always feasible. To confirm these results, IDoCT was applied to the Words Definitions and Digits Span tasks using a range of N samples between 100 and the maximum number of participants available (e.g. 36,392 for Digits Span and 358,894 for Words Definitions). Digits Span was selected as it is characterised by an adaptive staircase algorithm, with the most difficult samples being presented only to the best participants. On the other hand, Words Definitions consists of a relatively complex trial's space characterised by 150 different types of trials (i.e. words). The correlation between the measures of D, DS, AS and DT obtained when using different subsamples and the full dataset are presented in Fig. 4d, e. As can be observed, when training IDoCT on as little as 100 samples, in case of Digits Span, the Pearson's correlation between the IDoCT derived metrics using the subsample and the full sample was very high at 0.948, 0.974, 0.992, and 0.999 for D, DS, AS and DT respectively. Similarly, in case of Words Definitions, the minimum correlation obtained between the IDoCT derived metrics using the subsample and the full sample was 0.80, 0.826, 0.998, 0.999 for respectively D, DS, AS and DT. When repeating the subsample analysis (30 times) with different subsets of 100 participants, the results were consistent, and just a minimal drop in performance was observed. Specifically, the derived correlation was 0.99 ± 0.003, 0.999 ± 0.007, 0.74 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.08 for respectively DT, AS, D and DS in Words Definitions, and 0.86 ± 0.22, 0.72 ± 0.20, 0.97 ± 0.03, and 0.98 ± 0.03 for DT, AS, D and DS respectively in Digits Span.

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### Symbolic arithmetic knowledge without instruction [^d0ca42f7]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is fundamental to science, technology and economics, but its acquisition by children typically requires years of effort, instruction and drill. When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.

### Does antenatal micronutrient supplementation improve children's cognitive function? Evidence from the follow-up of a double-blind randomised controlled trial in Nepal [^3e84e143]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

We used a counting Stroop test to assess children's executive function. The number–quantity Stroop task involved three conditions. In each condition, the children were asked to name the quantity of items in rows of one to seven identical items. In the baseline condition, children were asked to name the quantity of X in a row (eg, the correct response to XX is 'two'). Second, in the congruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the equivalent digits (eg, 55555 = 'five'). Finally, in the third, incongruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the non-equivalent digits (eg, 1111 = 'four'). We recorded the time that children took to correctly name all items for each condition. We then derived two scores from these totals. An interference score was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the incongruent condition. This represented the potentially disruptive effect of automatic reading of the incongruous digits on quantity naming. A facilitation score was calculated by subtracting results for the congruent condition from those for the baseline, representing the enhancing effect of congruent digits.

Training of the testers was comparable to that for the US standardisation of the UNIT. The principal investigator (SD) was trained by two experienced UK-based psychologists (one clinical, one experimental, AK and FL) in the general principles of psychometric assessment and procedures specific to the UNIT and the counting Stroop test. She recruited two testers from Dhanusha district who were fluent in the local language (Maithili) and had a background in education and social science. The testers were trained for 15 days to administer the tests and practised under supervision for a week with children aged 10–13. We video-recorded the testers' practice administrations of the UNIT. These were checked by the two experienced psychologists to ensure adherence to standardised testing procedures.

SD and the two other testers administered the UNIT and Stroop tests in an office with minimal distractions located in Janakpur. The testers recorded the children's UNIT raw and scaled scores on a form with a unique child identification number. We checked each form individually and confirmed the scores using the proprietary CompuScore (V.1.1) UNIT software. These audited raw, scaled and standardised scores were double-entered into a Microsoft Access database. We identified discrepancies between first and second entries and resolved them by consulting the original forms.

### A number-form area in the blind [^7d324b45]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Having seen the distinct cortical areas for number symbols (VNFA) and letters (VWFA), we now discuss how they might have emerged. Number symbols and letters are, arguably, highly similar in their physical features (consider for instance the symbol for zero and the letter O in English). It is only a cultural convention that makes them different. In fact, some cultures used the exact same symbol as a number with an assigned quantity and as a letter with an assigned phoneme, for example, in Roman script V is used to represent both the letter V and the number 5. The emergence of an area with preference for the task of deciphering number symbols, which is distinct from the area with preference for the task of deciphering letters, and yet located at a systematically reproducible localization across subjects (whether blind or sighted), cannot be explained by the visual features of such symbols. It is more plausible, however, to propose that cortical connections between these areas and networks processing relevant information play a role in this emergence. Therefore, we hypothesized that an area showing preference for number symbols could arise at a reproducible anatomical location across subjects if such a region showed systematic connections to evolutionarily ancient cortical areas of the intraparietal cortex responsible for the representation and mental manipulation of quantities. Similarly, an area showing preference for letters could arise at a reproducible anatomical location across subjects if such a region showed systematic connections to cortical areas responsible language processing. Our data confirm these hypotheses by (1) showing a preference for numerals that is reproducible across subjects, different from that of letters, even when using the exact same stimuli, thus ruling out the effect of physical differences; (2) showing functional connectivity between this area and a site in the intraparietal sulcus, which is activated whenever numerical quantities are processed; (3) showing, conversely, functional connectivity between the VWFA and language-processing areas; (4) showing that these connectivity patterns do not arise from mere hemisphere-specific differences.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^eed8853a]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

For Arabic digits, results are more controversial: there is no consensus yet on the existence of a specific neural network for their visual processing in numerate adults (for review, Yeo, Wilkey, & Price, 2017). The Triple‐code model (Dehaene, 1992; Dehaene & Cohen, 1995) postulates a specific representation for Arabic digits: the Visual Arabic Number Form code represents numbers as an ordered string of digits used to support specific numerical operations (e.g. calculation), and is processed in bilateral VOTC within general object recognition regions. This proposal implies the existence of a region in the VOTC that would be more engaged by Arabic numerals than any other written characters ("Number Form Area" — NFA). Given the functional dissociations between letters and numbers recognition in cases of alexia (Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011), neuropsychological reports suggested that they might be processed by distinct neural structures. However, such dissociations always revealed a weaker impairment for digits than letters, leading to the alternative view that digits would simply be easier to recognize and therefore, more resistant to brain damage (Schubert, 2017; Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011).

So far, functional MRI (fMRI) studies of visual processing of Arabic numbers have not provided clear answers to this issue, finding no number‐specific region (Price & Ansari, 2011; Reinke, Fernandes, Schwindt, O'Craven, & Grady, 2008), or activation bilaterally (Grotheer, Herrmann, & Kovacs, 2016), in left (Fias, Lammertyn, Caessens, & Orban, 2007) or right VOTC (Pinel, Dehaene, Rivière, & LeBihan, 2001). Finally, a substantial amount of studies found activations only outside of the VOTC (Yeo et al. 2017 for a review). Conclusions on fMRI studies are limited by the fact that the NFA might be located within a region where BOLD signal is difficult to record due to magnetic susceptibility artefacts (Shum et al. 2013) and possibly varies with (mathematical) task demands (Grotheer, Jeska, & Grill‐Spector, 2018; Peters, De Smedt, & Op de Beeck, 2015).

### Nonlocal photonic quantum gates over 7.0 km [^79d240b6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The key challenge in implementing a distributed phase estimation algorithm is to achieve nonlocal controlled- U (C- U) gates. Here, we construct the nonlocal C- U gate based on quantum gate teleportation, where a local CNOT gate C 21 is implemented in node A and C 43 in node B is changed to a local C- U gate (see the Supplementary materials for details). As shown in Fig. 3g–j, we perform the quantum phase estimation algorithm for U = I, Z 1/2, Z 5/4, and Z 3/2 with three iterations. These three unitary operations each act on the statewith phase shifts φ = 0, π /2, 5 π /4, and 3 π /2 (corresponding to 0.000, 0.010, 0.101 and 0.110 in binary form, respectively, multiplied by 2 π). We obtain the probabilities of each binary digit by polarization measurement of the register. The deviation between measured probabilities and theoretical results is mainly due to the imperfection of nonlocal C- U gates. To determine the phase, each binary digit (0 or 1) is chosen based on which measurement probability exceeds 1/2. Here, three rounds of iteration are sufficient to accurately determine the target phase chosen in this experiment. However, if the precision of the digital phase shift exceeds the number of measurement rounds (e.g. if a phase in binary form 0.1111 is determined but only three measurement rounds are conducted), a discrepancy will arise between the experimental measurements and the actual value.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^ab365260]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that 6‐year‐old children display specific neural responses to visually presented letters and digits, both arbitrary visual shapes conveying culturally acquired meaning. Remarkably, this differential brain response to letters/digits occurred in a very fast presentation mode (< 170 ms per stimulus), low‐level confounds being controlled through random changes at every stimulus onset. These results suggest that already at the beginning of first grade, letters and digits give rise to specific neural responses, directly indicating selective modes of processing for one category compared to the other.

This novel finding goes beyond previous study where categorical responses emerged between familiar letters and unfamiliar pseudofonts (Lochy et al. 2016). At this age, children have had limited reading and arithmetic instruction, but they already possess letter and number knowledge due to early sociocultural and preschool‐related exposure to print (Wright et al. 1991; for digits see also Mejias & Schiltz, 2013; Hoffmann, Hornung, Martin, & Schiltz, 2013). Our results contrast with previous studies on the neuronal substrate of (differential) letter and digit processing in children. An fMRI study with 4‐year‐old preschoolers revealed greater selectivity for symbols (letters and digits) than objects (shoes and faces) processing in the left hemisphere, but no difference for letters versus digits (Cantlon et al. 2011). In a working memory task involving letters, digits or faces, 8‐year‐old children also did not show specific activation for letters versus digits (Libertus et al. 2009). Recently, an ERP study (Park et al. 2017) did not reveal lateralized response pattern for letters versus digits in 7‐ and 10‐year‐old children. Here on the contrary, inspection of topographies indicated that letters (vs. digits) are selectively associated with left occipital responses (PO9) and digits (vs. letters) to right occipital responses (PO10). In line with neuropsychological data (Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011), topographies and amplitude values also suggested stronger discrimination abilities for digits than letters in 6‐year‐olds. While requiring further investigation, this might be because digits contain only 10 exemplars, and all (except 0) were presented here. In contrast, letters contain 26 exemplars, and only a subset was used (among which "J" and "Z", not very frequent in French). Finally, digits might bear a meaning by themselves, already known at this age, whereas letters do not mean anything in isolation.

### Neural association between non-verbal number sense and arithmetic fluency [^3b9765a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

### Space-time-coding digital metasurfaces [^0447f2a0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

More specifically, we consider a coding metasurface with 8 × 8 elements and time-coding sequences with a length of 8. First, we address the beam-steering design in one plane at the central frequency. Hence, we only need to study time-coding sequences of eight elements, and each column of elements has the same digital code. Figure 4a, b shows the 2-bit space-time-coding matrix, in which the red, yellow, green, and blue dots represent "0", "1", "2", and "3" digits, representing 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° phase responses, respectively (the criterion for selecting those eight sets of time-coding sequences is detailed in Supplementary Note 7). The equivalent amplitudes and phases of those eight coding elements at different harmonic frequencies are shown in Fig. 4c, d, respectively. We can clearly observe that the designed space-time-coding matrix effectively results in equivalent 3-bit responses, "0 ′ " (−135°), "1 ′ " (−90°), "2 ′ " (−45°), "3 ′ " (0°), "4 ′ " (45°), "5 ′ " (90°), "6 ′ " (135°), and "7 ′ " (180°), and an equivalent phase gradient at the central frequency. According to the generalized Snell's law, this phase discontinuity will steer a normally incident wave by an angle of 14.5°. The corresponding 2D scattering pattern at the central frequency and the scattering patterns at different harmonic frequencies are displayed in Fig. 4e, f. It can be seen that the main beam at the central frequency points at θ = −14.5°, and the scattered powers at the harmonic frequencies are much smaller, which provides good sideband suppression. Moreover, we compare the beam-steering performance of the original 2-bit coding "0-0-1-1-2-2-3-3" with the equivalent 3-bit coding "0 ′ -1 ′ -2 ′ -3 ′ -4 ′ -5 ′ -6 ′ -7 ′ ", as shown in Fig. 4g. It is observed that the former scheme could realize a steering angle of 14.5°, but accompanied by high sidelobes, while the latter scheme attains the steering with much lower sidelobes and only a little gain reduction attributable to the sideband power losses. Similar examples of equivalent 3-bit coding for large-angle beam steering are illustrated in Supplementary Figures 6c and 6d.

### Predictors of hand function following digit replantation: quantitative review and meta-analysis [^032ffa4f]. Hand (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Digit replantation affords the opportunity to restore hand function following amputation. To date, however, few studies have evaluated functional outcomes following replantation. Therefore, it was the objective of this study to perform a meta-analysis to better characterize the predictors of hand function. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database to identify studies that focused on digit amputation/replantation and functional outcomes. Studies were evaluated for patient- and injury-related factors and their respective effects on clinical outcomes of sensation, grip strength, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores. Statistical analysis was conducted across the pooled data set to identify significant trends. Results: Twenty-eight studies representing 618 replanted digits were included in this study. We found the average grip strength was 78.7% (relative to contralateral), the average 2-point discrimination (2PD) was 7.8 mm, and the average DASH score was 12.81. After conducting statistical analysis, we found patients with more proximal injuries had lower grip strength scores (P < .05). We found 2PD scores were influenced by age, mechanism of injury, and amputation level (P < .05). Finally, we found DASH scores after replantation were predicted by mechanism of injury and level of amputation (P < .05). The following variables did not influence outcomes: gender, tobacco use, ischemia time, and digit number. Conclusions: Digit replant does not restore premorbid hand function but does result in adequate hand function. Expected functional outcomes following replant should be considered in the decision-making process. These data can help risk-stratify patients, guide postreplant expectations, and influence the decision for replantation.

### Large-scale capture of hidden fluorescent labels for training generalizable markerless motion capture models [^114a0735]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To remove incorrect matches, we developed a spatial coherency heuristic as a filter. Considering a putative match, we defined a circle of radius δ around its left endpoint and a circle of radius ε around its right endpoint (Fig. 5c, top left). For the match to be valid, it should have at least one coherent neighboring match: a match whose left endpoint is within the left circle and whose right endpoint is within the right circle. For the experiments shown here, we set δ and ε to 50 pixels. Visual inspection shows that most matches with no coherent neighboring matches are spurious (Fig. 5c, middle), and that the far more abundant matches with at least one coherent neighboring match are correct (Fig. 5c, bottom).

To visualize the number and accuracy of SIFT matches, we found it convenient to color code them according to which part of a template image they match. We accomplished this by manually labeling template images with an arbitrary number of different regions, in this case the twelve segments of the digits with the palm facing up (Fig. 5d). Denser SIFT coverage can be accomplished by selecting several template images, given the wide variety of configurations the hand can make. Moreover, while we focus on the palm surface of the hand, any hand region can be prioritized based on which template images are selected. To help select a set of template images that achieve good matching coverage and are not too redundant (i.e. templates containing a diversity of poses with the 12 digit segments mostly visible), we devised a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects as a template the next image estimated to match with the greatest number of unmatched SIFT features (Supp. Fig. 6), which we then supplement with a small amount of human filtering. With this visualization approach, we find dense coverage of SIFT matches across all twelve digits, with essentially no spurious labels on the incorrect digit segment or when the segment is occluded (features pooled over 10 templates; 1000-frame clip) (Fig. 5e, f and Supp. Movie 4). These results support the idea that thousands of fluorescent barcodes can effectively be matched across images. Moreover, only a small number of template frames (10 in this case) are needed to effectively cover the full 12,000-frame dataset, demonstrating the strong scaling properties of the approach.

### Number development and developmental dyscalculia [^e45e7f45]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings of developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder of 'number sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate numerical magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However, this spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school and requires additional cognitive components including working memory and number symbolization (language). Thus, there may be children with familial-genetic DD with deficits limited to number sense and others with DD and comorbidities such as language delay, dyslexia, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is supported by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with DD have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically, they differ according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties. fMRI studies indicate that parietal areas (important for number functions), and frontal regions (dominant for executive working memory and attention functions), are under-activated in children with DD. A four-step developmental model that allows prediction of different pathways for DD is presented. The core-system representation of numerical magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number', a precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step 3) number symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic development of an expanding mental number line during school years (step 4). Therapeutic and educational interventions can be drawn from this model.

### Single neurons in the human brain encode numbers [^5a7074f7]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Our human-specific symbolic number skills that underpin science and technology spring from nonsymbolic set size representations. Despite the significance of numerical competence, its single-neuron mechanisms in the human brain are unknown. We therefore recorded from single neurons in the medial temporal lobe of neurosurgical patients that performed a calculation task. We found that distinct groups of neurons represented either nonsymbolic or symbolic number, but not both number formats simultaneously. Numerical information could be decoded robustly from the population of neurons tuned to nonsymbolic number and with lower accuracy also from the population of neurons selective to number symbols. The tuning characteristics of selective neurons may explain why set size is represented only approximately in behavior, whereas number symbols allow exact assessments of numerical values. Our results suggest number neurons as neuronal basis of human number representations that ultimately give rise to number theory and mathematics.

### Second to fourth digit ratio and prostate cancer severity [^27d0a2f0]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.

Methods

Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with digit ratios to determine relationships.

Results

African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.

Conclusion

2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.

### Digit distribution of proper digital nerve action potential [^9b1181ae]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

Antidromic sensory nerve action potential testing is well characterized and commonly used to assess the sensory component of the upper limb median and ulnar nerves. The final terminal segments of these nerves are the proper digital nerves. Ring recording electrodes are commonly used to detect the proper digital nerves' antidromic responses. Attempts to record the separate contributions of individual digital nerves along the lateral aspects of each finger, using small surface electrodes, is shown to be unreliable for determining the integrity of a single terminal digital branch. We found between 50% to 77% of the stimulated terminal branch's response amplitude when recorded at electrodes positioned over the nonstimulated branch located 180 degrees from the activated terminal branch. Detecting a single terminal nerve response was achieved by using the fourth digit and the second digit with one of the second digit's branches neurophysiologically blocked by local anesthetic. The volume-conducted response from the opposite side of the finger resulted in this relatively large recorded response, which remains within the range of reference values precluding the simple use of antidromic techniques to assess injury to a single proper digital nerve. Techniques are proposed to avoid such pitfalls and to assess most accurately the desired response.

### Is the control of applied digital forces during natural five-digit grasping affected by carpal tunnel syndrome? [^9eb94552]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The impaired sensory function of the hand induced by carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is known to disturb dexterous manipulations. However, force control during daily grasping configuration among the five digits has not been a prominent focus of study. Because grasping is so important to normal function and use of a hand, it is important to understand how sensory changes in CTS affect the digit force of natural grasp.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore examined the altered patterns of digit forces applied during natural five-digit grasping in patients with CTS and compared them with those seen in control subjects without CTS. We hypothesized that the patients with CTS will grasp by applying larger forces with lowered pair correlations and more force variability of the involved digits than the control subjects. Specifically, we asked: (1) Is there a difference between patients with CTS and control subjects in applied force by digits during lift-hold-lower task? (2) Is there a difference in force correlation coefficient of the digit pairs? (3) Are there force variability differences during the holding phase?

Methods

We evaluated 15 female patients with CTS and 15 control subjects matched for age, gender, and hand dominance. The applied radial forces (Fr) of the five digits were recorded by respective force transducers on a cylinder simulator during the lift-hold-lower task with natural grasping. The movement phases of the task were determined by a video-based motion capture system.

Results

The applied forces of the thumb in patients with CTS (7 ± 0.8 N; 95% CI, 7.2–7.4 N) versus control subjects (5 ± 0.8 N; 95% CI, 5.1–5.3 N) and the index finger in patients with CTS (3 ± 0.3 N; 95% CI, 3.2–3.3 N) versus control subjects (2 ± 0.3 N; 95% CI, 2.2–2.3 N) observed throughout most of the task were larger in the CTS group (p ranges 0.035–0.050 for thumb and 0.016–0.050 for index finger). In addition, the applied force of the middle finger in patients with CTS (1 ± 0.1 N; 95% CI, 1.3–1.4 N) versus the control subjects (2 ± 0.2 N; 95% CI, 1.9–2.0 N) during the lowering phase was larger in CTS group (p ranges 0.039–0.050). The force correlations of the thumb-middle finger observed during the lowering phase in the patients with CTS (0.8 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9) versus the control subjects (0.9 ± 0.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.0; p = 0.04) were weaker in the CTS group. The thumb-little finger during holding in the patients with CTS (0.5 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7) versus the control subjects (0.8 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9; p = 0.02), and the lowering phase in the patients with CTS (0.6 ± 0.2; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8) versus the control subjects (0.9 ± 0.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.0; p = 0.01) also were weaker. The force variabilities of patients with CTS were greater in the CTS group than in the control subjects: in the thumb ([0.26 ± 0.11 N, 95% CI, 0.20–0.32 N] versus [0.19 ± 0.06 N; 95% CI, 0.16–0.22 N], p = 0.03); index finger ([0.09 ± 0.07 N; 95% CI, 0.05–0.13 N] versus [0.05 ± 0.03 N; 95% CI, 0.04–0.07 N], p = 0.03); middle finger ([0.06 ± 0.04 N; 95% CI, 0.04–0.08 N] versus [0.03 ± 0.01 N; 95% CI, 0.02–0.04 N], p = 0.02), and ring finger ([0.04 ± 0.03 N; 95% CI, 0.20–0.06 N] versus [0.02 ± 0.01 N; 95% CI, 0.02–0.02 N], p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with CTS grasped with greater digit force associated with weaker correlation and higher variability on specific digits in different task demands. These altered patterns in daily grasping may lead to secondary problems, which will need to be assessed in future studies with this model to see if they are reversible in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release.

Clinical Relevance

The current results helped to identify altered patterns of grasping force during simulated daily function in patients with CTS and to provide the clinician with potential information that might help guide the rehabilitation of grasp in these patients.

### Similar somatotopy for active and passive digit representation in primary somatosensory cortex [^f704666c]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2.3 Passive task

In the passive stimulation task, participants were asked to rest their right hand in a comfortable, supine position on a foam support. A trained experimenter used a plastic probe to tap the distal pad of a single digit at a 1 Hz rate, before moving on to the next digit. There were 12 trials (taps) per digit in each digit block before the experimenter moved on to the next digit, and 15 blocks per scan (three per digit). Timing was controlled by audio cues presented to the experimenter over headphones. During the task, participants were shown five white dots on the screen, corresponding to each of the five digits (Figure 1, right). One dot, indicating the stimulated digit, would flash at a rate of 1/s whilst the digit was being stimulated to help participants attend to that digit (note that attention is known to modulate digit representations in SI; Puckett et al.). To promote engagement during the task, double taps were administered randomly (one double‐tap per digit condition in each scan). Participants were asked to indicate when they felt the double taps by pressing a button on a button‐box placed in their left hand.

2.2.4 Digit‐specific clusters localiser

An independent functional localiser was carried out using a traveling wave design task in order to identify digit‐specific clusters used for later analysis. Participants used the same keyboard and visual display as in the active task (see Section 2.2.2). Two separate scans with reverse orders, forward (digit 1‐2‐3‐4‐5) and backward (digit 5‐4‐3‐2‐1) cycles, were used to overcome potential order‐related biases due to the sluggish hemodynamic response (Besle et al.).

In each scan, the cycle was repeated five times continuously with no rest periods in between. Each cycle consisted of five blocks (one per digit) which progressed in either the forward or backwards order of digits. At the start of each block, participants were visually instructed which of their digits to use in the upcoming block (see Figure 1). Eight trials were then completed in which the participant had to move one of their digits eight times at 1 Hz, before the instructions for the next digit was shown. Each scan lasted ~4 min.

Descriptive statistics.

2.3 Cognitive outcomes

The 2021–2022 telephone survey included neurocognitive assessments of (1) auditory attention and working memory; (2) verbal learning and episodic memory; (3) letter fluency; and (4) semantic fluency. The Web survey included two assessments of episodic memory via (5) a verbal paired associates task and (6) a visual paired associates task. Each task on the phone survey was evaluated by a team of trained scorers; for most tasks, independent re‐scoring allowed us to identify and correct problems in scoring.

2.3.1 Auditory attention and working memory

In a "forward number span" task, participants heard increasingly longer lists of digits, one digit per second, and were immediately asked to repeat the digits in the same order. Each item provided two chances to repeat a certain length of digits; the task was discontinued if participants incorrectly recalled two sequences of the same length of digits in a row. Then, in a "backward number span" task, sample members completed the same task except that numbers were to be read back in reverse order.

### Brief international cognitive assessment for MS (BICAMS) and NEDA maintenance in MS patients: a 2-year follow-up longitudinal study [^5bae83a0]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive evaluation

The Italian version of the BICAMS, was administered by a trained neuropsychologist to evaluate cognitive functions at baseline and follow‐up. The administrated battery included the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test — SDMT(form 1 and 2), the California Verbal Learning Test, 2ndEd. — CVLT‐II (list A and list B) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised — BVMT‐R (Form 1 and form 2). Due to a potential learning effect, all test stimuli were different at baseline and follow‐up sessions, performing them in a randomized order to minimize practice effects when repeated.

The SDMT presents a series of nine symbols, each paired with a number in a legend at the top of a standard sheet of paper. Subjects are asked to verbally respond with the paired digits as quickly as possible when presented with a pseudo‐random sequence of symbols. The outcome measure of the SDMT is the number of correct responses in 90 seconds.

### Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement [^dbafba86]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational systems. Competence in some domains of mathematics, such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching. More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults, infants and non-human animals-these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development, it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non-verbal 'number sense' than others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non-verbal approximation abilities of 14-year-old children, and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children's past scores on standardized maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors. Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned approximate number sense. Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity, and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both.

### Neuropsychological test performance of cognitively healthy centenarians: normative data from the Dutch 100-plus study [^20228cd9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological Tests

The neuropsychological test battery consisted of 15 tests measuring global cognition, premorbid intelligence, attention and/or concentration, language, memory, executive function, and visuospatial function. See supplementary data for more detailed information on properties of these tests. At the start of the study, the test battery was limited to the MMSE and CDT but expanded gradually over the course of the study with tests that allow the evaluation of specific cognitive domains. For this reason, not all centenarians were presented with the same battery or the same number of tests.

The MMSE was used to evaluate global cognition. 21 We addressed premorbid intelligence using the DART, 22, 23, 24 in which subjects are asked to read out loud 50 words with atypical phonemic pronunciation. These words were presented in an enlarged font size to take into account possible visual difficulties. The Digit Span was used to evaluate attention/concentration (forward condition) and working memory (backward condition). 25 The forward condition requires subjects to repeat sequences of digits that increase in length, whereas in the backward condition, sequences of digits have to be repeated in reverse order. We evaluated processing speed and attention using the TMT A, and mental flexibility using the TMT B, which respectively requires subjects to connect dots of numbers in numerical order and alternate between numbers and letters in numerical and alphabetical sequence. 26 If the centenarians were not determined to proceed after 180 seconds (TMT A) and 300 seconds (TMT B), the test was aborted and scores were extrapolated based on the last finished item (number or letter) and the time spent on the test. The Dutch version of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (naming words from initial letters) and Category fluency (naming animals) were administered to evaluate executive functioning and language, the latter also assessing semantic memory. 27, 28 To evaluate executive functioning, we administered the Key Search subtest of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Test Battery 29 involving a problem‐solving task instructing subjects to think of a strategy to find a lost key. Memory was measured with the story recall subtest of the Dutch version of the RBMT and the VAT. 30, 31, 32 The RBMT requires subjects to immediately repeat all items they remember from two stories read out loud, and again after a 15‐minute interval. When necessary, a cue was given for helping them recall the story line, which was considered when calculating the total score. We made two adaptations to the test procedure: (1) two stories were read instead of one to improve reliability; (2) during recall, all remembered items were scored, whether they belonged to the appropriate story line or not. The VAT involves subjects to name two visual items shown in one picture (eg, a hedgehog on a chair), of which one item (hedgehog) needs to be recalled afterwards while the other (the chair without the hedgehog) is used as a cue. We used naming of the items as an additional measure of language functioning. Visuospatial orientation was assessed with the Number Location subtest of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, 33 which required subjects to indicate a specific number that corresponded with the exact location of a dot. For evaluating visuospatial construction, subjects were instructed to draw a clock with the hands at 10 past 11 (CDT). Because of common tremors in centenarians, the CDT was offered with a predrawn circle and was scored according to a method that does not consider the drawing of the circle. 34, 35

### Association between hand digit ratio (2D: 4D) and nonsyndromic orofacial clefts [^b3c21f2b]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Digit ratio (2D:4D) has been considered to be a marker in studies evaluating an individual's susceptibility to diseases, especially those diseases that show sex differences in their occurrence. We aimed to assess whether 2D:4D ratios are associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) and verify the existence of a specific pattern of 2D:4D ratio in individuals affected by orofacial clefts.

Design

This was a case-control study.

Methods

Digital measurements of index and ring finger lengths of both hands of patients with NSCL/P (n = 54) and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 54) were obtained using a digital vernier caliper. Mean ratios between the second and fourth digits were compared. Data were analyzed by Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test with a significance level of 5%.

Results

No significant difference was found between the mean digit ratios of the right and left hands between the groups for any analysis (P > .05), neither for the whole sample nor for the distributions by type of cleft and by gender.

Conclusions

Although the development of the fingers and the occurrence of NSCL/P can be regulated by the actions of similar genes, our results are not consistent with an association between 2D:4D ratio and this craniofacial deformity. This suggests that intrauterine exposure to fetal androgens, assessed using this marker, is similar between patients with NSCL/P and healthy individuals. We highlight the need for further studies in populations with different ancestries.

### Spatial acuity after digit amputation [^33958c91]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

Digit amputation in human and non-human primates results in reorganization of somatosensory cortex in which the representations of adjacent, intact digits expand to fill the cortical region previously devoted to the amputated digits. Whether this expanded representation results in improved sensory performance has not been determined. Consequently, we measured the ability to recognize small objects (raised letters) with a digit adjacent to the amputation and the same digit on the normal, contralateral hand in 15 amputees. The same digits were also tested in 15 age-matched, amputation-free subjects. There was no significant difference in recognition scores between digits in the amputees or between amputees and control subjects. More detailed analyses of specific confusion patterns and of the improvement with practice showed no significant differences. As far as we could determine, the cortical expansion that is presumed to accompany digit amputation had no effect on tactile pattern recognition performance.

### Hand burns surface area: a rule of thumb [^98e6dcae]. Burns (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapid estimation of acute hand burns is important for communication, standardisation of assessment, rehabilitation and research. Use of an individual's own thumbprint area as a fraction of their total hand surface area was evaluated to assess potential utility in hand burn evaluation.

Materials and Methods

Ten health professionals used an ink-covered dominant thumb pulp to cover the surfaces of their own non-dominant hand using the contralateral thumb. Thumbprints were assessed on the web spaces, sides of digits and dorsum and palm beyond the distal wrist crease. Hand surface area was estimated using the Banerjee and Sen method, and thumbprint ellipse area calculated to assess correlation.

Results

Mean estimated total hand surface area was 390.0cm 2 ± SD 51.5 (328.3–469.0), mean thumbprint ellipse area was 5.5cm 2 ± SD 1.3 (3.7–8.4), and mean estimated print number was 73.5 ± SD 11.0 (range 53.1–87.8, 95% CI 6.8). The mean observed number of thumbprints on one hand was 80.1 ± SD 5.9 (range 70.0–88.0, 95% CI 3.7), χ 2 = 0.009. The combined mean of digital prints was 42, comprising a mean of two prints each on volar, dorsal, radial and ulnar digit surfaces, except volar middle and ring (3 prints each). Palmar prints were 15 (11–19), dorsal 15 (11–19), ulnar palm border 3, first web space 2, and second, third and fourth web spaces one each. Using the surface of the palm alone, excluding digits, as 0.5% of total body surface area, the area of one thumbprint was approximated as 1/30th of 1%.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated how thumbprint area serves as a simple method for evaluating hand burn surface area.

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^eed221ea]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In table 3, we use numerical examples to show that if p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 ≠0, all combinations of 1–9 and 13 in table 2 may occur.

Table 3
Numerical examples of Δ 0, Δ 1 and Δ when p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 ≠0

The following theorem gives a more general sufficient condition of consistency than the first three cases discussed above.

Theorem: given Δ 0 and Δ 1, for any p 1 and p 2 between 0 and 1, there always exists a p between 0 and 1 such that Δ = Δ 0 p +Δ 1 (1− p) if and only if p 1 = p 2 or d 1 d 2 ≤ 0.

The proof of this theorem is available on request. Note that d 1 d 2 = 0 implies d 1 d 2 ≤ 0.

Unfortunately, if we are only given the information that p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 > 0, we cannot determine whether the inconsistency will happen. For example, combinations 1 and 3 satisfy the condition of p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 > 0. In combination 1, the overall difference is consistent with the subgroup differences, while it is not in combination 3.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^6163fb29]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

The emergence of visual cortex specialization for culturally acquired characters like letters and digits, both arbitrary shapes related to specific cognitive domains, is yet unclear. Here, 20 young children (6.12 years old) were tested with a frequency-tagging paradigm coupled with electroencephalogram recordings to assess discrimination responses of letters from digits and vice-versa. One category of stimuli (e.g., letters) was periodically inserted (1/5) in streams of the other category (e.g., digits) presented at a fast rate (6 Hz). Results show clear right-lateralized discrimination responses at 6 Hz/5 for digits within letters, and a trend for left-lateralization for letters. These results support an early developmental emergence of ventral occipito-temporal cortex specialization for visual recognition of digits and letters, potentially in relation with relevant coactivated brain networks.

### Finger counting training enhances addition performance in kindergarteners [^2bd5ff1d]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

This interaction was further modulated by Finger use group (i.e. Group × Finger use group × Testing point, F (1, 324) = 16.4, = .05, p < .001). Indeed, the experimental effect just described was higher in the group of 86 non‐finger users than in the group of 105 finger users. In fact, the positive effect of the training was significant only for non‐finger users (as seen above, from 37.3% at pre‐test to 77.1% at immediate post‐test, +39.8%, t (129) = 4.83, d = 0.89, p < .001) and not for finger users (from 81.8% at pre‐test to 92.4% at immediate post‐test, +10.6%, t (195) = 1.71, d = 0.24, p = .089).

Finally, analyses in the sub‐samples of non‐finger users from the experimental group who responded to our intervention (i.e. who shifted to finger use at post‐test) or not were conducted. Concerning the 74% of children (N = 64) who shifted to a finger counting strategy at immediate post‐test, the percentages of correctly solved additions went from 32.5% at pre‐test to 86.6% at immediate post‐test (i.e. +54.1%), t (63) = 12.70, d = 1.59, p < .001. In contrast, the remaining 26% of children (N = 22), who still did not use their fingers to solve the additions at immediate post‐test, did not show accuracy improvement (from 51.4% at pre‐test to 49.5% at immediate post‐test, −1.9%), t (21) = 0.59, d = 0.13, p = .559.

### Fifteen years and counting: looking towards the future [^ae4845e1]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

As I make my first steps as the newly appointed Editor-in-Chief of Insights into Imaging, guided by the invaluable support of my predecessor, this editorial is the perfect opportunity to once again emphasize the role of Insights into Imaging as a source for all radiologists, irrespective of the work setting, to find precise information on cutting edge radiology and reflection on how to improve our current practice.

In the last few years, the concept of evidence-based medicine has gradually evolved into the concept of value-based medicine. Practicing value-based radiology means practicing radiology while considering the evidence but also the benefits conferred on patients and society. I believe this concept is an essential part of the aims and scope of the journal moving forward. Medicine, in general, but radiology, in particular, is rapidly evolving. Radiology, being based on technology, is probably the field in which fast changes, with artificial intelligence introduction and fast and continuous development of new radiological devices, are more apparent. These changes could be a beneficial support at a time when the radiologist shortage is becoming apparent in many European countries, particularly in the academic setting. The only way in which we can successfully face these challenges is by moving out of our reporting rooms. We are not doctors' doctors, only seeing society through our (admittedly, now often rather colorful) screens. We are clinicians who play a central role in patient management and decision-making, and it is our responsibility to behave as such and train the next generation for this role.

As the Editor-in-Chief, together with a growing and passionate Editorial Team, we will keep the focus of the journal on high-quality review and educational articles, to refresh basic knowledge but also to facilitate the translation of new methods and technologies into clinical practice.

Open access publishing can be onerous for authors, but it allows the published work to reach a wider audience that goes beyond academic institutions. It is in the interest of our journal to provide the readers with educational and critical reviews from experts in the field, and the ESR will continue to support its members with funding options in this endeavor.

The journal will also increase its focus on multidisciplinarity, supporting radiologists in keeping up-to-date with the upcoming novelties outside the field of radiology, complementary to the "ESR Bridges" series from European Radiology. In addition, Insights into Imaging will further increase its focus on educational, review, and original articles on resource optimization, equity of access to care, and sustainability.

### Explainable automated evaluation of the clock drawing task for memory impairment screening [^e4365c87]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4 Clock measures

Human‐based MoCA scoring for the CDT includes gross scoring for the contour of the clock, the placement and legibility of the digits used in the clock, and the shape and direction of the hands used in the clock. As such, we group features below to similarly reflect potential sources of variability in the clock scoring and focused on including features, such as circularity of the contour, or the ratio of the length of the clock's minute and hour hands, which are commonly used to score the CDT, but also included several novel features that were considered of potential benefit.

To facilitate computerized analyses, we relied on all usable data collected over the period from January 2014 to June 2019. To be included, scans needed to be clear and needed to have been stored with appropriate meta‐data so that an automated routine could reliably determine the person's research identification and the date of data collection, and so that the computer could reliably determine the location of the clock. Scans were often excluded because scans were of lower overall quality and the clock could not be seen well or was blurry, or because the scanner induced visual defects in the files. In addition, filename conventions and/or PDF‐labeling standards were not always clear. In many cases, the date was not clear from either the meta‐data or could not be accurately read by the computer from the PDF in a way that matched the scores. Thus, although we collected data on up to 15,298 observations, these exclusion criteria left 7109 CDTs spread at random throughout the observational period that were effectively scanned and matched to clinical data for use in the current analysis.

Automated CDT scoring focused on 19 dimensions of the Clock (Supplemental Methodological Appendix for full details). Specifically, we computed five contour measures (radius size, radius minimum/maximum ratio, circularity, center deviation, and removed points), eight measures of the digits (digit radius mean and SD, digit angle mean and SD, digit area mean and SD, as well as missing or extra digits), and finally six hand measures (intersection distance, hand angles, hands length ratio, density ratio, bound box ratio, and the number of components). These form the feature set used in the remainder of the manuscript.

### Pseudo-linear summation explains neural geometry of multi-finger movements in human premotor cortex [^b75d3799]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Single finger movement task (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 4)

A single finger was either fully flexed or extended in each trial. Each trial consisted of a 1.5 s preparatory phase and a 1 s movement phase. Each block consisted of 81 gestures (162 trial total as center-out and return trials alternate). Center-out single finger movements were also performed across contexts (different hands and palm-poses), either changing contexts across blocks (but fixing the context within each block) or alternating across contexts within a block.

Natural gestures task (Fig. 3A, B)

Sign-language task consisted of 38 total gestures, with some corresponding to signs from the American Sign language and others added probe single-finger movements, coordinated movements of all fingers (e.g. all finger flexion/extension), or decorrelating the movements of all fingers (e.g. Sign Alternating Fingers). Each trial had 1 s preparatory time, 1.5 s move tim, e and 2 s hold time.

Pairwise finger movement task (Figs. 4, 5A, Supplementary Fig. 5)

Two finger groups were independently cued (each at full flexion/full extension/rest), resulting in 9 unique movements, with one movement being rest. The two finger groups either consisted of thumb vs all other fingers tied together (Fig. 4AB, Fig. 5A), or individual fingers (Fig. 4B, Supplementary fig. 5). Each trial consisted of a 1.5 s preparatory phase and a 1 s movement phase.

Combinatorial four-finger movement task (Figs. 3 C, 4, 5, 6, Supplementary Fig. 6)

For combinatorial movements of four finger-groups (the ring and little fingers were constrained to move together), the target position for each finger-group was sampled independently (full flexion/full extension/rest), resulting in 81 unique movements, with one movement being rest. These 81 movements were randomly divided into three groups consisting of 27 movements each. Each block only contained movements from one of these groups, and each movement was repeated three times in a row. The multiple repetitions of each movement were designed to improve behavioral reproducibility since the movements were often non-intuitive and non-natural. Hence, three open-loop blocks with different subsets of target configurations give three trials of all 81 target gestures. Each trial had 1 s preparatory time and 2 s move time (slightly longer move time reduces behavioral variability).

### Neural representation precision of distance predicts children's arithmetic performance [^87c900f6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Illustration of the task design and decoding procedure. (A) The illustration of the dot pattern comparison procedure. Subjects needed to compare the two numerical stimuli and decide which one was larger. (B) We first divided the data into a training set with 4/5 trials and a test set with the remaining 1/5 trials. In the training phase, the pattern from 4/5 training trials and their actual labels (distance or magnitude) were used to fit a model (set of weights on each voxel). During the testing phase, the test patterns were multiplied by the weight vector to generate predicted labels (which could take on any real value). A 5‐fold cross‐validation was conducted which iteratively left out 1/5 trials. Performance was assessed by computing the correlation between the actual and predicted labels (aggregated across iterations).

During the fMRI scanning, participants viewed centrally presented dot arrays in succession. Participants were instructed to respond with one of the two buttons depending on whether the first or second number was larger; if the first number was larger, then press the leftmost button with the thumb of the left hand, and if the second number was larger, then press the rightmost one with the thumb of the right hand. The button pressed was balanced across trials. The presentation details for each trial were shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Weber Fraction Estimation

The Weber fraction estimated each participant's minimum distinguishable difference between the number of dots and which was also known as the ANS (Approximate number system) acuity. The Weber Fraction score was assessed for 29 subjects using the accuracy (ACC) of the dot comparison task. The percentage correct was modeled for each individual subject as 1 — error rate (Halberda et al.), where the error rate is defined as:where erfc (x) is the complementary error function, which is associated with the integral of the normalized Gaussian distribution. This model describes the percentage of correct responses as a function of the Gaussian approximation of number representations for the two dot sets presented in each trial, namely n 1 and n 2 (i.e. n 1 is the numerosity of the larger set, n 2 is the numerosity of the smaller set), with a single adjustable parameter, the Weber fraction (w).

Time Course of Treatment Response

In the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies, an effect of TRINTELLIX based on the primary efficacy measure was generally observed starting at Week 2 and increased in subsequent weeks with the full antidepressant effect of TRINTELLIX generally not seen until Study Week 4 or later. Figure 4 depicts time course of response in U.S. based on the primary efficacy measure (MADRS) in Study 5.

Digit Symbol Substitution Test in Major Depressive Disorder

Two, eight week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of TRINTELLIX on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) during the treatment of acute MDD. The DSST is a neuropsychological test that most specifically measures processing speed, an aspect of cognitive function that may be impaired in MDD. Patients are asked to match nine symbols with their corresponding number (1 to 9) according to a key; the score is the correct number of matches achieved in 90 seconds. For reference, the mean score for healthy 45 to 54 year-old subjects is 50 (SD = 15).

Study 7 randomized adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD to receive TRINTELLIX 10 mg, TRINTELLIX 20 mg, or placebo once daily. Study 8 randomized adult patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD and reporting subjective difficulty concentrating or slow thinking to receive a flexible dose of TRINTELLIX (10 or 20 mg) or placebo once daily. Neither study included patients whose MDD was in remission yet who continued to experience difficulty concentrating or slow thinking. Patients' mean age was 46 (SD = 12) and 45 (SD = 12) in Study 7 and 8, respectively. In both studies, patients in the TRINTELLIX group had a statistically significantly greater improvement in number of correct responses on the DSST (Table 6); depressed mood as assessed by change from baseline in MADRS total score also improved in both studies.

The effects observed on DSST may reflect improvement in depression. Comparative studies have not been conducted to demonstrate a therapeutic advantage over other antidepressants on the DSST.

### Finger counting training enhances addition performance in kindergarteners [^1dd652fd]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Out of the 328 children involved in this first experiment, there were more children who spontaneously used their fingers in an addition task (N = 197) than children who did not use their fingers at all (N = 131). As it is obvious from Figure 5 and in replication to previous studies (e.g. Dupont‐Boime & Thevenot; Jordan et al.), finger users at pre‐test presented a higher percentage of correctly solved additions (i.e. 84.1%) than non‐finger users (i.e. 38.1%). As predicted, the strategy massively used spontaneously by children was the "ALL" strategy (Table 1), the one we taught to children.

As already stated and supported by a higher increase in finger counting after the training program in the experimental than in the control group, we show in this first experiment that it is possible to teach the "ALL" strategy to kindergartners. In fact, almost 75% of the children who did not count on their fingers at pre‐test responded positively to our training or, in other words, used finger counting during the immediate post‐test (massively using the strategy taught). Moreover, we established here that our training program significatively enhanced children's arithmetic skills because the increase in performance between pre‐ and post‐test was higher in the experimental group than in the control group. This effect was created by non‐finger users at pre‐test and was even more pronounced when only children who responded positively to the training were considered (+54.1% between pre‐ and post‐test in the percentages of correctly solved additions).

### Neural representation precision of distance predicts children's arithmetic performance [^e8bf2522]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Participants

A total of 32 healthy voluntary children were initially recruited for this study. Three participants were excluded due to either incomplete imaging data (N = 1) or the presence of structural image anomalies (N = 2). The ART toolbox was employed to detect artifact points with two criteria: (1) frame‐to‐frame displacement > 0.5 * voxel size; (2) signal amplitude surpassing three standard deviations above the average whole‐brain signal. Subjects were eliminated when more than one‐third of the time points exhibited artifacts. Ultimately, no subject was eliminated due to measurement artifacts. Consequently, 29 participants (16 males, mean age = 8.61 ± 0.92) were included in the analyses. All participants were right‐handed, had normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, and had no history of neurological diseases. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all child participants, and the children themselves also gave their assent to participate in the study. Ethical approval of the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute.

2.2 Stimuli and Experimental Design

Each participant completed the dot number comparison task in the scanner and the basic arithmetic fluency test outside the scanner.

In the dot comparison task, all stimuli consisted of arrays of black dots presented on a gray circular area against a black background (Figure 1A). The number of dots ranged from 1 to 9. The total area and density were kept constant across all stimuli, while the element size of each dot and its presentation location were randomized. The numerical distance between stimuli ranged from 1 to 6, and the magnitude of the dot pairs and their numerical distances were orthogonalized. So, 12 basic dot pairs were used: 5–6, 4–6, 5–7, 2–5, 3–6, 4–7, 1–5, 4–8, 2–7, 3–8, 2–8, and 3–9. The order in which the two dot patterns within each pair were presented was counterbalanced, resulting in 24 pairs in total. Each pair was repeated three times, yielding a total of 72 trials. These trials were randomly distributed across three runs, each consisting of four mini‐blocks of six trials. Four rest blocks were interspersed between the task blocks in each run. The stimuli were presented in a pseudo‐random sequence, ensuring that no more than four consecutive trials required the same response side, and the same pair of stimuli was not presented consecutively.

### Neural representations of the perception of handwritten digits and visual objects from a convolutional neural network compared to humans [^bc7ddf25]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

We obtained the RDM for each layer of the CNN using the corresponding features of the input image. The dimensions of the feature vector that was 1D concatenated across all features obtained from all Conv filters for one input image in each of the CNN layers was very large (i.e. from 100,352 to 3,211,264). Thus, we applied a dimension reduction method using principal component analysis (PCA). The number of PCs that preserved 90% of the variance of all feature representations from the 192 images across all 16 classes were obtained for each layer. Table S2 summarizes the dimensions of the 1D concatenated features in each CNN layer and the minimum number of PCs that preserved at least 90% of the explained variance. We then averaged the 12 sets of dimension‐reduced features for 12 images per class in each CNN layer. Consequently, an RDM of feature representations across the 16 classes was constructed for each CNN layer using the dissimilarity measure based on Pearson's CCs (i.e. 1 – r) calculated across all pairs of the average dimension‐reduced feature vectors from the 16 classes.

### Digits and fin rays share common developmental histories [^be9666d4]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the evolutionary transformation of fish fins into tetrapod limbs is a fundamental problem in biology. The search for antecedents of tetrapod digits in fish has remained controversial because the distal skeletons of limbs and fins differ structurally, developmentally, and histologically. Moreover, comparisons of fins with limbs have been limited by a relative paucity of data on the cellular and molecular processes underlying the development of the fin skeleton. Here, we provide a functional analysis, using CRISPR/Cas9 and fate mapping, of 5' hox genes and enhancers in zebrafish that are indispensable for the development of the wrists and digits of tetrapods. We show that cells marked by the activity of an autopodial hoxa13 enhancer exclusively form elements of the fin fold, including the osteoblasts of the dermal rays. In hox13 knockout fish, we find that a marked reduction and loss of fin rays is associated with an increased number of endochondral distal radials. These discoveries reveal a cellular and genetic connection between the fin rays of fish and the digits of tetrapods and suggest that digits originated via the transition of distal cellular fates.

### Three diverse motives for information sharing [^97a4fba4]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Information-seeking task

Following instructions, participants answered six comprehension questions before the first block and one question before the second block. Participants who responded incorrectly twice on at least one question were not permitted to go on to complete the task. After reading the instructions, participants completed two example trials before starting the actual task.

The task is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Recipients were told they owned 100 stocks in a financial market we created. On each trial recipients were presented with an algorithm's prediction of the value of their stocks and the algorithm's average prediction accuracy (the algorithms could be different on each trial). These cues were presented for 5 s. Predictions regarding the stocks' value ranged from −400 to −500 and from +400 to +500. A positive stock value meant recipients were earning money, a negative value meant they were losing money. We use the word 'valence' to indicate both the direction of the change in stock's value (positive or negative) and the magnitude of such change. The algorithm's prediction accuracy ranged from 0 to 99%, high numbers suggest the algorithm is often correct and vice versa. The algorithm's accuracy represents the probability of the revealed stocks' value being the real value. When the prediction is incorrect, the stocks' value is uniformly distributed over the possible values. Stocks' value and uncertainty level were randomly sampled for each trial. Recipients then indicated whether they wanted to open an envelope containing information about the true value of their stocks (information-seeking decision). They did so using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 0, "Not at all", to 6, "Very much". We adopted a 7-point Likert scale rather than a binary response scale to increase the sensitivity of our measure. Recipients were told that the closer their answer was to "Very much", the more likely we were to open the envelope and reveal the value of their stocks, and vice versa (similar to other studies. If they selected 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then the information was delivered with a probability of 5%, 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 80%, and 95%, respectively. This probabilistic approach, which is adapted from past studies, is reflective of real life where actions are often not deterministically related to outcomes (e.g. one may ask a question but not receive an answer and may need to ask again if they really want to know). Recipients were not aware of these exact mathematical conversions as we did not want them to focus their attention on exact mathematical calculations to avoid distraction. Next, either the value of their stocks (information) was presented on screen for 4 s or hidden ('XX' was shown).

### Left-digit price effects on smoking cessation motivation [^5751c797]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cigarette price increases have been associated with increases in smoking cessation, but relatively little is known about this relationship at the level of individual smokers. To address this and to inform tax policy, the goal of this study was to apply a behavioural economic approach to the relationship between the price of cigarettes and the probability of attempting smoking cessation.

Methods

Adult daily smokers (n = 1074; ie, 5+ cigarettes/day; 18+years old; ≥ 8th grade education) completed in-person descriptive survey assessments. Assessments included estimated probability of making a smoking cessation attempt across a range of cigarette prices, demographics and nicotine dependence.

Results

As price increases, probability of making a smoking cessation attempt exhibited an orderly increase, with the form of the relationship being similar to an inverted demand curve. The largest effect size increases in motivation to make a quit attempt were in the form of 'left-digit effects', (ie, maximal sensitivity across pack price whole-number changes; eg, US$5.80–6/pack). Significant differences were also observed among the left-digit effects, suggesting the most substantial effects were for price changes that were most market relevant. Severity of nicotine dependence was significantly associated with price sensitivity, but not for all indices.

Conclusions

These data reveal the clear and robust relationship between the price of cigarettes and an individual's motivation to attempt smoking cessation. Furthermore, the current study indicates the importance of left-digit price transitions in this relationship, suggesting policymakers should consider relative price positions in the context of tax changes.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Variation in surgeon proficiency scores and association with digit replantation outcomes [^465f43a8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

A total of 145 patients and 226 digits met inclusion criteria, of which 51% (116) underwent replantation and 49% (110) underwent revascularization (Table 2). Of the total patient cohort, 90% (204) were men and 10% (22) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.9 (15.2) years. The study cohort was formed by 11 surgeons who participated in replantation call. The surgeons had a range of 3 to 16 years of independent surgical experience at the start of the assessment period (median [IQR] experience, 8 [7.3] years). Nine surgeons were hand-fellowship trained, and 2 surgeons were microsurgery-fellowship trained. Surgeons varied in the total number of cases performed, with a mean (SD) of 21 (12) cases and a range of 9 to 44 cases. Among 226 included digits, 155 digits (68.9%) were successfully replanted or revascularized.

Descriptive Statistics of Replanted and Revascularized Digits

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

Among the 11 surgeons included in this study, the case success rates in the latter half of surgeons' careers ranged from 20.0% to 90.5%, averaging 64.9%. Surgeon proficiency scores also varied widely from 1.3 to 5.7, with a mean (SD) of 3.4 (Table 3). The proficiency score demonstrated adequate variation to enable differentiation among surgeons, as the range (1.26–5.71, difference = 4.45) was 3 times wider than the SD. Surgeon proficiency score and success rates from the second half of cases were highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.70 (eFigure in the Supplement).

### Differences in spatial acuity between digits [^869ebc5f]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The spatial acuity of the index, middle, and ring distal finger pads of eight right-handed men, aged 22 to 57 years, was measured by using gratings and raised letters. Acuity declined significantly from the index to the middle finger and from the middle to the ring finger. There were no significant differences between homologous fingers of the two hands. Letter recognition and grating orientation threshold measures were highly correlated.

### A randomized, controlled pilot trial of the emotional faces memory task: a digital therapeutic for depression [^d9e5ba9d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Procedure

The study intervention was administered over 20 visits. At the first visit, the SCID and Ham-D were administered to confirm MDD diagnosis and determine symptom severity. A subsequent baseline evaluation assessed reading level, attention and working memory, MDD symptom severity, and participants' perceived acceptability of a cognitive training exercise as an intervention for MDD. To measure reading ability, a Wide Range Achievement Test Reading test was administered. To assess attention span and working memory, a composite score was calculated as the mean scaled score from the Digit-Span Forward (DSF), Digit-Span Backward (DSB) and Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition.MDD symptoms were evaluated using the clinician-rated Ham-D, and the self-report measure Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Acceptability of a cognitive training intervention as a treatment for MDD was assessed using a 5-point Likert-scale ("Using the scale below, please circle the number corresponding to how acceptable cognitive training would be to you, for the treatment of your depression symptoms, if cognitive training were a treatment option in the future". 1: not at all acceptable; 3: somewhat acceptable; 5: very acceptable).

Participants were randomly assigned to the EFMT or CT groups by a research coordinator using a pre-determined randomization sequence for group assignment, with balancing in blocks of six participants in the sequence. Investigators and blinded study raters were kept blind to group assignment throughout the study. Participants were assigned to complete 18 training sessions over 6 weeks (approximately 20–35 min each, three times per week). Participants that failed to complete at least two sessions in any week, or that missed greater than three sessions during the course of the study, were discontinued as per the study protocol. Weekly Ham-D assessments were conducted by PhD or MD-level clinicians who were blind to group assignment. Ham-D raters were extensively trained to administer the assessment and demonstrated an ICC > 0.8 on two separate training interviews. An outcome evaluation was conducted within 1 week of completing the training sessions, at which time the baseline assessments were repeated. At the outcome evaluation, assessments of participants' perceived acceptability of a cognitive-training intervention were again obtained, as were assessments of perceived helpfulness with improving memory, improving attention and concentration, improving control over thoughts, and improving mood. Assessments were obtained using a 5-point Likert-scale (1: not acceptable; 3: somewhat acceptable; 5: very acceptable).

### Men and women differ in the neural basis of handwriting [^77797ede]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognitive testing consisted of sustained attention and verbal working memory tests. Sustained attention was assessed by using a cancelation test, in which participants were instructed to search and mark the target number ("3") as quickly and accurately as possible within 3 min. The score were calculated by this equation: score = attack −(false alarms+0.5*omission). A digit span task was employed for evaluating verbal working memory in which participants were asked to repeat a series of digits in forward (range 3 to 12 digits) and backward order (range 3 to 10 digits). The test was terminated when participants failed in two consecutive trials of the same length, and the working memory span was the number of digits in the last successful trials.

Finally, a visual‐motor integration test was conducted to assess low‐level visual‐motor skill in which participants were asked to copy 12 geometric symbols varying in visual complexity as accurately as possible. Two independent evaluators assessed the similarity between samples and participants' responses using a 7‐point scale, and the score was the sum of each symbol. The inter‐rater reliability of the assessment was good (intra‐class correlation coefficients [ICC] = 0.86).

There were no differences in all reading, cognitive and motor tests between males and females, suggesting that these abilities were well‐matched between groups. Detailed information of all the participants was presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic characteristics of participants and behavioral results

2.2 Stimuli and task procedure

Participants were instructed to perform a handwriting task (copying Chinese characters) and a control task (drawing nonsense symbols). Thirty characters were selected for presentation, of which one half were of "high frequency" (1,500 times per million) and the other half were of "low frequency" (< 5 times per million), according to the Modern Chinese Frequency Dictionary (1986). Visual complexity measured by the mean number of strokes was matched between high‐frequency and low‐frequency characters. To control for activation elicited by motor and basic visual processing, participants also performed a control task in which they were instructed to copy nonsense symbols. Participants were instructed to write characters and draw symbols with matched duration and size, while minimizing movements of their upper arm and forearm (thus minimizing potential head motion artifacts in the fMRI data).

### Augmented manipulation ability in humans with six-fingered hands [^9b746492]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Next, we investigated the functional organization of the motor cortex in P1 using an individual finger tapping task and functional MRI at 7T high resolution. In order to highlight the specific representations of each finger, we compared the activity patterns generated by individual finger movements (Supplementary Fig. 3). The results show that the representation of the SF in the primary sensorimotor cortices was distinct from the representations of all other fingers, including the thumb (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 4). This demonstrates that separate neural resources are used to control movements of the SF in this six-fingered subject.

Mental representation of polydactyly hands

To infer the mental representation of the hand in our polydactyly subjects, we asked them to indicate their perceived location of landmarks on the hand (fingertip, first and second knuckles, for each finger) by pointing with the other hand to the corresponding target on a two-dimensional graded grid placed above the hidden hand, following a tactile cue on the target. As we see in Fig. 2f, the hand representation corresponds to its anatomy, with the SF perceived correctly between the thumb and index. We found similar localization errors in the six-fingered and five-fingered subjects (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.33, W = 7, 95% CIs [−0.89 cm,0.47 cm], average across fingers six- vs. five-fingered subjects, N 1,2 = 2,9, cf. ref.). This morphologically correct representation of the fingers may support six-fingered manipulation.

### Somatropin (Humatrope) [^e8b8c7b0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 3E – Store Pen and Cartridge for next use

See, " How do I store HumatroPen 6 mg?" in Section 1 of this Instructions for Use for more information.
When it is time for the next scheduled dose, go to Section 3, and repeat Steps 3A through 3D.
When using the Hidden Needle Cover with HumatroPen 6 mg, repeat steps 1 to 10 of the Hidden Needle Cover Instructions for Use.

Commonly asked questions:

Do I need to perform the New Cartridge Setup before every dose?
No. You only need to perform the New Cartridge Set-up 1 time for each Cartridge, just before a new Cartridge is used for the first time.
The purpose of the New Cartridge Set-up is to make sure the HumatroPen 6 mg with an attached HUMATROPE 6 mg Cartridge are ready to use.
If you repeat the New Cartridge Set-up before each routine dose, you may run out of HUMATROPE early. The small amount of medicine used in the New Cartridge Set-up will not affect the amount of HUMATROPE in the Cartridge.
What should I do if the Cartridge label and Pen do not match?
Do not use the Pen if the Cartridge strength on the HUMATROPE Cartridge label does not match the number on the Pen's front housing. This is important to make sure the correct dose of HUMATROPE is given.
Contact your healthcare provider for a replacement.
What should I do if the HUMATROPE is not clear?
Do not use the Pen if the liquid is cloudy or contains particles. Contact your healthcare provider or call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or go to www.humatrope.com.
Why are there air bubbles in the Cartridge?
Air bubbles may remain in the Cartridge after mixing.
If the Pen is stored with a Needle attached, air bubbles may form in the Cartridge.

### Association of prenatal depression with second to fourth digit ratio in children aged 4 and 6 years [^6d42ed6f]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study, we observed that prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with an increased 2D:4D digit ratio in offspring of both sexes at 4 and 6 years of age. Dose–response relationships were found with regard to both the strength and duration of depressive symptoms. Our study suggests that prenatal depressive symptoms may perturb the reproductive development of offspring and predominantly exhibit a feminizing effect. Our findings advocate an increased focus on screening and intervention for prenatal depressive symptoms to potentially mitigate the long-term effects on offspring reproductive health.

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^84f571b4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, being a non-native English speaker was a significant predictor of AS. However, its effect was in the small and negligible range for most of the tasks, namely Motor Control (0.002 SD), Blocks (−0.08 SD), 2D Manipulations (−0.12 SD), Digits Span (−0.09 SD), Objects Memory Immediate (−0.14 SD) and Delayed (−0.18), Words Memory Immediate (0.09 SD) and Delayed (0.14 SD), Spatial Span (−0.04 SD) and TOL (−0.11 SD). This is expected considered that these tasks mainly require spatial, motor and memory functions. On the other hand, in case of the two language tasks (i.e. Words Definitions and Verbal Analogies), participants with a mother tongue different from English were associated to respectively a 0.56 SD and 0.49 SD decrease in AS compared to English speaking participants.

When predicting DT, Age, Education and Language were statistically significant predictors in all tasks, except for Education in case of the Objects Memory Delayed (Fig. 5b). However, the effect sizes of language and education were predominantly in the small to negligible range. More specifically, an increase in age was associated to an increase in DT, and the effect size was always in the medium to large range, except for Words Definitions, where the oldest age bracket was associated with a small (0.19 SD) increase in DT. By comparison, participants at age 80 were associated to an increase in DT of 1.63 SD for Digits Span, 1.58 for Verbal Analogies, 1.57 and 1.41 for Words Memory Delayed and Immediate, 1.47 for spatial span, 1.34 for 2D Manipulations, 1.05 and 0.62 for Objects Memory Delayed and Immediate, 0.89 for Motor Control, 0.84 for Blocks, and 0.66 for TOL.

For education, the effect size was in the negligible to small range (< 0.2 SD units) for all tasks except for Words Definitions and TOL, where having a PhD was associated to respectively a decrease of 0.54 SD and increase of 0.35 SD units in DT compared to participants without prior education. Finally, although language was a significant predictor of DT, the absolute effect size was below 0.2 for all tasks except Words Definitions (0.70) and Verbal Analogies (0.51).

### Hand pattern indicates prostate cancer risk [^198eb9d5]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy indicator for prenatal testosterone levels.

Methods

We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls.

Results

Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D:4D), men with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D:4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57–0.80). Risk reduction was even greater (87%) in age group < 60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09–0.21).

Conclusion

Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.

### Low molecular weight heparin for prevention of microvascular occlusion in digital replantation [^ce675852]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The success of digital replantation is highly dependent on the patency of the repaired vessels after microvascular anastomosis. Antithrombotic agents are frequently used for preventing vascular occlusion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been reported to be as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in peripheral vascular surgery, but with fewer adverse effects. Its benefit in microvascular surgery such as digital replantation is unclear. This is an update of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess if treatment with subcutaneous LMWH improves the salvage rate of the digits in patients with digital replantation after traumatic amputation.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers, to 17 March 2020. The authors searched PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Electronic Periodical Services (CEPS) on 17 March 2020 and sought additional trials from reference lists of relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing treatment with LMWH versus any other treatment in participants who received digital replantation following traumatic digital amputation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (PL, CC) independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included two new randomised trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials to four. They included a total of 258 participants, with at least 273 digits, from hospitals in China. Three studies compared LMWH versus UFH, and one compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The mean age of participants ranged from 24.5 to 37.6 years. In the studies reporting the sex of participants, there were a total of 145 men and 59 women. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded to low or very low because all studies were at high risk of performance or reporting bias (or both) and there was imprecision in the results due to the small numbers of participants. The three studies comparing LMWH versus UFH reported the success rate of replantation using different units of analysis (participant or digit), so we were unable to combine data from all three studies (one study reported results for both participants and digits). No evidence of a benefit in success of replantation was seen in the LMWH group when compared with UFH, regardless of whether the outcomes were reported by number of participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.10; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence); or by number of digits (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 200 digits, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the incidence of compromised microcirculation requiring surgical or non-surgical therapy, or any systemic/other causes of microvascular insufficiency. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the LMWH and UFH groups in occurrence of arterial occlusion (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10; 54 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence) or venous occlusion (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.27; 54 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported adverse effects. The LMWH and UFH groups showed no evidence of a difference in wound bleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.23; 130 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), haematuria (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.11; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), ecchymoses (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.19; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), epistaxis (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), gingival bleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.43; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), and faecal occult blood (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). We could not pool data on coagulation abnormalities as varying definitions and tests were used in the three studies. One study compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The success rate of replantation, when analysed by digits, was reported as 91.2% success in the LMWH group and 82.1% in the control group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33; 73 digits, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring surgical re-exploration, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.58; 73 digits, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring incision occurred in five out of 34 digits (14.7%) in the LMWH group and eight out of 39 digits (20.5%) in the control group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits; very low-certainty evidence). Microvascular insufficiency due to arterial occlusion, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.05; 73 digits, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and venous occlusion was 14.7% in the LMWH group and 20.5% in the control (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report complications or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently low to very low-certainty evidence, based on four RCTs, suggesting no evidence of a benefit from LMWH when compared to UFH on the success rates of replantation or affect microvascular insufficiency due to vessel occlusion (analysed by digit or participant). LMWH had similar success rates of replantation; and the incidence rate of venous and arterial microvascular insufficiency showed no evidence of a difference between groups when LMWH was compared to no LMWH (analysed by digit). Similar rates of complications and adverse effects were seen between UFH and LMWH. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on any effect on coagulation when comparing LMWH to UFH or no LMWH. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to performance and reporting bias, as well as imprecision in the results. Further adequately powered studies are warranted to provide high-certainty evidence.

### The impact of digit-related radiographic osteoarthritis of the hand on grip-strength and upper extremity disability [^0ec07759]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Interpreting the impact of hand osteoarthritis (OA) on hand function is complicated owing to the multiple digits and joints in the hand.

Questions/Purpose

We determined the impact of digit-related radiographic OA on hand function in patients 65 years or older.

Methods

We evaluated hand radiographs in 196 men and 182 women older than 65 years without shoulder or elbow pain who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. Using the Kellgren and Lawrence criteria, we graded the 15 joints in each hand from 0 to 4 for OA, and evaluated hand function by measuring DASH scores and grip and pinch strength of dominant hands. We performed multiple linear regression analyses to evaluate associations between hand functions and the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grade of each digit.

Results

The sums of Kellgren and Lawrence grades for thumbs and middle fingers were independently associated with grip strength, and the sums of the Kellgren and Lawrence grades for thumbs and index fingers were independently associated with pinch strength after controlling for age and sex. DASH scores were independently associated with OA of the thumb, or index or middle finger, but not with OA of the ring or small finger.

Conclusions

This study revealed cumulative effects of joint involvement and Kellgren and Lawrence grades of thumb and middle finger OA on grip strength, and thumb and index finger OA on pinch strength. Furthermore, OA of either of three radial digits was associated with more severe upper extremity disabilities.

### Distributed functional connectivity predicts neuropsychological test performance among older adults [^79e1903f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2.2 KSHAP neuropsychological test

To test the generalizability of the predictive model, we identified eight homologous neuropsychological tests included in the KSHAP dataset. Similarity and correspondence of administration procedures and contents were scrutinized. For the attention and working memory, Digit Span Forward, and Digit Span Backward tests included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale (Chey, 2007) were available. The score was the sum of all correct trials were counted from 2 to 8 lengths of digits. The category fluency test asked participants to generate words from the two semantic categories (i.e. animal and supermarket) each within a minute (Kang, Chin, Na, Lee, & Park, 2000; Kang, Jang, & Na, 2012). While interference condition of the original Trail Making Test in UDSNB asks to alternate between numbers and alphabets (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), modified Trail Making Test (mTMT) asked to alternate between numbers and symbols (triangle and rectangle) to minimize the floor effect of illiterate elderly (M. Park & Chey, 2003; Seo et al. 2006). The mTMT Part A (Trail A) consisted of 15 consecutively numbered circles arranged randomly on a sheet of paper. Participants were asked to draw a line between the circles in ascending order as quickly as possible. In mTMT Part B, they were asked to draw between triangles and squares alternately. In mTMT Part C (Trail C), participants consecutively connected lines between 8 numbers (ascending order) and 7 shapes (triangle and square) in an alternating way (1 – △ – 2 – □ – 3 – △…). Total time consumed to complete the mTMT‐A and mTMT‐C were used in the analysis, and mTMT‐B was not used in the analysis due to the variability in the possible trail options. A few participants exceeded the typical time limit of mTMT‐A (150 s, n = 1) and mTMT‐C (300 s, n = 7), but a maximum of 300 and 600 s, respectively, were allowed to finish the task due to the participants' unskilled usage of pencil. Total time (s) to complete the lines were log‐transformed and inversed. The Story Recall Test included in the Elderly Memory disorder Scale was used to assess episodic memory function. The Story Recall Test consisted of one story modified from the Logical Memory subtest in WMS‐III into a more culturally familiar content (An & Chey, 2004). The SRT required subjects to recall a paragraph containing 24 semantic units and the delayed recall subtests were administered 15–30 min after the immediate recall session.

Impact of outcome hierarchical position and number on intervention conclusions

Table 2 illustrates the impact of outcome hierarchical position and number on intervention conclusions for three interventions originally evaluated using (1) a single primary outcome, (2) multiple primary outcomes, and (3) multiple non-hierarchised outcomes. Additional file 9: Table S8 provides additional details on the hierarchical position and result of each outcome for these interventions.

† Total score calculated by summing the products of each outcome result by its weight; ‡ arbitrary threshold for intervention success was set at 0.5. Abbreviations: M, months; N, number of; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IMB, Information-Motivation-Behavioural; MSM, men who have sex with men; LGB +, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority; App, mobile application; RCT, randomised controlled trial; STIs, sexually transmitted infections. How to read the table: for example, in intervention 1, under Strategy 1, the unique primary outcome is improved, deeming the intervention successful. Under Strategy 2, eight non-hierarchised outcomes are evaluated, with one improvement, leading to a non-conclusive intervention. Under Strategy 3, four outcomes are equally weighted (0.25 each) with one improved outcome, yielding an intervention score of 0.25, below the success threshold of 0.5, indicating failure. Under Strategy 4, four outcomes are differentially weighted (0.35, 0.35, 0.15, 0.15) with one improved outcome, yielding an intervention score of 0.35, below the success threshold of 0.5, indicating failure

Original authors' conclusions

Intervention 1 was considered successful based on improvement in its unique primary outcome. Intervention 2 was deemed non-conclusive, as only two of its four primary outcomes showed improvement. Intervention 3 was judged successful, although only 10 of the 18 non-hierarchised outcomes showed improvement.

### The big finger: the second to fourth digit ratio is a predictor of sporting ability in women [^db9c6e54]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The second to fourth finger length ratio (2d:4d) is thought to be related to diverse traits including cognitive ability, disease susceptibility, and sexuality.

Objective

To examine the relationship between 2d:4d and sports ability in women.

Methods

Hand radiographs from 607 women (mean age 54 years) were used to estimate 2d:4d. Ranking of sports ability was on a scale (1–5).

Results

The highest achieved level of participation in any sport was significantly negatively associated with 2d:4d (b = -4.93, p = 0.01) as was the relationship between 2d:4d and running level (b = -6.81, p = 0.034). Ability in other sports also showed a negative relationship albeit non-significant.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a low 2d:4d ratio is related to increased female sports ability. It can be postulated that this ratio may predict potential sports ability. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship may give important insights into musculoskeletal fitness, health and disease.
