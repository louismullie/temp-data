## Question

is a dilated left atrium indication enough to order holter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a dilated left atrium alone is enough reason to order a Holter monitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a dilated left atrium signifies pathophysiologically and how strongly it correlates with atrial fibrillation risk. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and consensus statements say about ambulatory ECG monitoring in asymptomatic individuals and whether they endorse monitoring based on atrial size alone. Next, I will review high-risk contexts where atrial enlargement does justify intensified monitoring, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cryptogenic stroke, and specific valvular or device populations. After that, I should examine the diagnostic yield and limitations of Holter versus extended monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring intervals and triggers to escalate to longer-duration devices, while ensuring I anchor to the strength of evidence and avoid overgeneralization.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and prognostic implications of left atrial enlargement, because that frames risk. A dilated left atrium is a marker of chronic atrial stretch, diastolic burden, and atrial myopathy, and is strongly associated with incident atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, and mortality, with a dose–response relationship whereby larger size confers higher risk; importantly, obesity-associated AF risk appears to be mediated through left atrial dilation, reinforcing its role as a causal substrate for arrhythmogenesis rather than a mere epiphenomenon [^114oYTvK] [^1113Tv2X] [^116TUe2v] [^1119diDs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether any guideline endorses routine Holter monitoring solely for a dilated left atrium in an otherwise asymptomatic person without a specific high-risk phenotype. I should double-check consensus documents and major society statements. The ISHNE-HRS expert consensus emphasizes that short-duration Holter is not useful for AF detection in asymptomatic patients, and the ACC/AHA/HRS AF guideline likewise focuses ambulatory monitoring on patients with symptoms or a defined indication rather than on atrial size per se; moreover, an EHRA risk-assessment consensus notes that short Holter adds little predictive value in asymptomatic populations and that longer-duration monitoring is reserved for suspected paroxysmal AF, not screening by chamber size alone [^115hnGnP] [^1114BocU].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a subgroup where atrial enlargement meaningfully changes the pretest probability and guideline-directed screening is advised. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, expert surveys and the ESC position converge on periodic ambulatory ECG monitoring, and the ESC explicitly recommends 48-hour Holter every 6–12 months in patients with sinus rhythm and left atrial dimension ≥ 45 mm; this is a scenario where left atrial enlargement does function as a trigger for surveillance, albeit within a disease-specific framework rather than as a universal screening rule [^113331vR] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source, because this is another high-yield context where atrial enlargement shifts practice. Randomized and prospective data support extended ECG monitoring to detect occult AF after stroke, with markedly higher detection rates for 30-day external monitors or implantable loop recorders compared with 24-hour Holter. Contemporary ACC/AHA guidance endorses initial and, if needed, extended monitoring to improve AF detection in stroke or TIA of undetermined cause, and the 2024 expert consensus advises considering implantable monitors when maximum sensitivity is desired. Importantly, in patients considered for PFO closure, an enlarged left atrium is listed as a risk factor for AF, prompting prolonged monitoring to avoid missing occult atrial arrhythmia before structural closure decisions [^1127EpB8] [^11248Jrm] [^1114BocU] [^111vaXEV].

> Let me consider the practical performance of Holter versus extended devices, because that influences whether ordering a 24–48 hour Holter in an asymptomatic person with LA enlargement is likely to change management. Standard Holter has low sensitivity for paroxysmal AF, whereas scheduled 7-day Holter or 30-day external loop recorders materially increase detection, and implantable monitors detect the highest burden of subclinical AF over time; device-detected subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias carry stroke risk and often require anticoagulation, which underscores why more intensive monitoring is prioritized when the clinical stakes are high [^114MnFNY] [^1155Rn35].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence to ensure I am not overstating the role of atrial size in triggering monitoring outside defined contexts. While multiple observational cohorts show that moderate-to-severe left atrial enlargement increases incident AF and stroke risk, there are no randomized or high-quality comparative data supporting routine Holter screening solely for LA enlargement in the general asymptomatic population; instead, the strongest direct monitoring indications derive from disease-specific populations such as HCM, cryptogenic stroke, and select valvular or device contexts, which function as risk-enrichment frameworks rather than broad screening mandates [^1127EpB8] [^1167UevS] [^111vaXEV].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A dilated left atrium alone is not a sufficient standalone indication to order Holter monitoring in an asymptomatic person without other high-risk features; Holter or extended monitoring is appropriate when atrial enlargement occurs in high-risk settings such as HCM with LA ≥ 45 mm, cryptogenic stroke or TIA, evaluation of palpitations or presyncope, pre-ablation or post-ablation rhythm surveillance, or when assessing other arrhythmias like NSVT where guidelines support ambulatory ECG, and escalation to 7–30 day external monitors or implantable recorders is reasonable when the clinical suspicion for paroxysmal AF remains high despite negative short-duration recordings [^1167UevS] [^1127EpB8] [^1127EpB8] [^111begqT].

> Practically, I should double-check a few operational details to make the recommendation actionable. If monitoring is pursued for a specific indication, a 24–48 hour Holter can be a first step for very frequent symptoms, but a 7–14 day external patch or a 30-day event monitor meaningfully increases yield, and implantable loop recorders should be considered when detection will change anticoagulation or rhythm-control decisions, such as after cryptogenic stroke or in high-risk HCM. For post-ablation follow-up, HRS/EHRA guidance endorses structured visits with ECGs and intermittent Holter or event monitoring to document recurrences, which aligns with the principle of indication-driven, not size-driven, surveillance [^114MnFNY] [^112cdFH4] [^117S1RTM].

---

In general, **left atrial dilation alone is not an automatic indication** for Holter monitoring [^115hnGnP]. Holter is appropriate when there are symptoms (palpitations, syncope), arrhythmia risk factors (AF, HCM, stroke/TIA) [^11519sDQ] [^1167UevS] [^1127EpB8] [^114Vswzd], or when LA enlargement is moderate-to-severe (≥ 4.5 cm) with clinical concern for occult AF [^1167UevS]. Routine Holter for isolated, mild LA dilation without symptoms or risk factors is **not recommended**; use clinical judgment and consider extended monitoring only if suspicion for AF is high [^115hnGnP].

---

## Clinical significance of left atrial dilation

Left atrial dilation is a marker of **chronic atrial stretch** from elevated left atrial pressure or volume overload — most often due to hypertension, mitral valve disease, or heart failure [^114oYTvK]. It reflects structural and electrical remodeling that increases AF risk and is associated with higher rates of stroke, heart failure, and mortality [^1113Tv2X] [^1139JNNA].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus on Holter monitoring

There is **no guideline mandate** for routine Holter monitoring in all patients with left atrial dilation. Recommendations are based on symptoms, arrhythmia risk, and LA size:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Holter is indicated for palpitations, syncope, or presyncope to detect arrhythmias [^11519sDQ] [^115J1WXT].
- **Asymptomatic patients**: Holter is not routinely indicated without risk factors or significant LA enlargement [^115hnGnP].
- **High-risk populations**: In HCM, ESC recommends 48-hour Holter every 6–12 months if LA diameter ≥ 45 mm, even if asymptomatic [^1167UevS].
- **Stroke/TIA**: Extended monitoring is recommended in cryptogenic stroke or TIA to detect occult AF [^1127EpB8] [^1114BocU].

---

## Evidence supporting Holter monitoring in left atrial dilation

Evidence linking LA dilation to arrhythmias supports **selective monitoring**:

- **AF risk**: LA enlargement is strongly associated with incident AF; risk rises with greater LA size [^114oYTvK] [^1139JNNA].
- **Stroke risk**: LA enlargement independently predicts ischemic stroke, especially in AF [^1113Tv2X].
- **Detection yield**: Holter improves AF detection in high-risk patients, including those with LA enlargement [^1127EpB8] [^114UGBSX].

---

## Limitations of Holter monitoring

Holter monitoring has important **limitations**:

- **Duration**: 24–48 hours may miss infrequent or intermittent arrhythmias [^113rABWP].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, movement, and skin irritation can reduce signal quality.
- **False positives/negatives**: Brief artifacts or missed brief episodes can misclassify rhythms [^114MnFNY].

---

## Alternative and complementary diagnostic tools

When Holter is inconclusive or suspicion remains high, **consider**:

- **Extended ambulatory monitors**: 7–14 day patches or 30-day event monitors increase AF detection [^114MnFNY] [^1127EpB8].
- **Implantable loop recorders**: For prolonged, continuous monitoring in high-risk patients [^11248Jrm].
- **Echocardiography**: Assesses LA size/function, valves, and ventricular function [^115BnwJb].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Evaluates fibrosis and structural heart disease [^113E595k].

---

## Clinical judgment and individualized decision-making

Decisions should be **individualized**, integrating:

- **Symptoms**: Palpitations, syncope, or presyncope increase arrhythmia likelihood [^11519sDQ].
- **LA size**: Moderate-to-severe enlargement (≥ 4.5 cm) warrants closer surveillance [^1167UevS].
- **Comorbidities**: AF, HCM, stroke/TIA, or heart failure favor monitoring [^1127EpB8] [^1167UevS].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Holter monitoring recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients (palpitations, syncope) | Yes | Detect arrhythmias causing symptoms [^11519sDQ] |
| Asymptomatic, mild LA dilation | No | Low likelihood of detecting clinically significant arrhythmias [^115hnGnP] |
| Asymptomatic, moderate-to-severe LA dilation (≥ 4.5 cm) | Consider | Increased AF risk; clinical judgment required [^114oYTvK] |
| High-risk populations (HCM, stroke/TIA, heart failure) | Yes | Higher arrhythmia prevalence; guideline-supported [^1167UevS] [^1127EpB8] |

---

Left atrial dilation alone is **not an automatic indication** for Holter monitoring. Use Holter selectively for symptoms, significant LA enlargement, or high-risk conditions, and consider extended monitoring when suspicion for AF remains high.

### The cox maze IV procedure: predictors of late recurrence [^1167rY1T]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Cox maze III procedure achieved high cure rates and became the surgical gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Because of its invasiveness, a more simplified ablation-assisted procedure, the Cox maze IV procedure, has been performed at our institution since January 2002. The study examined multiple preoperative and perioperative variables to determine predictors of late recurrence.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively on 282 patients who underwent the Cox maze IV procedure from January 2002 through December 2009. Forty-two percent of patients had paroxysmal and 58% had either persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. All patients were available for follow-up. Follow-up included electrocardiograms in all patients. Since 2006, 24-hour Holter monitoring was obtained in 94% of patients at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis at 12 months, with 13 preoperative and perioperative variables used as covariates.

Results

Sixty-six percent of patients had a concomitant procedure. After an ablation-assisted Cox maze procedure, the freedom from atrial fibrillation was 89%, 93%, and 89% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The freedom from both atrial fibrillation and antiarrhythmic drugs was 63%, 79%, and 78% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The risk factors for atrial fibrillation recurrence at 1 year were enlarged left atrial diameter (P = 0.027), failure to isolate the entire posterior left atrium (P = 0.022), and early atrial tachyarrhythmias (P = 0.010).

Conclusions

The Cox maze IV procedure has a high success rate at 1 year, even with improved follow-up and stricter definitions of failure. In patients with large left atria, there might be a need for more extensive size reduction or expanded lesion sets.

### Finding atrial fibrillation in stroke patients: randomized evaluation of enhanced and prolonged holter monitoring – find-AF (RANDOMISED) – rationale and design [^115cYHPR]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ischemic strokes presenting in sinus rhythm is challenging because episodes are often short, occur randomly, and are frequently asymptomatic. If AF is detected, recurrent thromboembolism can be prevented efficiently by oral anticoagulation. Numerous uncontrolled studies using various electrocardiogram (ECG) devices have established that prolonged ECG monitoring increases the yield of AF detection, but most established procedures are time-consuming and costly. The few randomized trials are mostly limited to cryptogenic strokes. The optimal method, duration, and patient selection remain unclear. Repeated prolonged continuous Holter ECG monitoring to detect paroxysmal AF within an unspecific stroke population may prove to be a widely applicable, effective secondary prevention strategy.

Study Design

Find-AFRANDOMISED is a randomized and controlled prospective multicenter trial. Four hundred patients 60 years or older with manifest (symptoms ≥ 24 hours or acute computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging lesion) and acute (symptoms ≤ 7 days) ischemic strokes will be included at 4 certified stroke centers in Germany. Those with previously diagnosed AF/flutter, indications/contraindications for oral anticoagulation, or obvious causative blood vessel pathologies will be excluded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either enhanced and prolonged Holter ECG monitoring (10 days at baseline and after 3 and 6 months) or standard of care (≥ 24-hour continuous ECG monitoring, according to current stroke guidelines). All patients will be followed up for at least 12 months.

Outcomes

The primary end point is newly detected AF (≥ 30 seconds) after 6 months, confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. We plan to complete recruitment in autumn 2014. First results can be expected by spring 2016.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^116x54T1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The association between echocardiographic parameters of atrial remodeling and AF has also been extensively documented. In a case‐control cohort, structural and functional LA remodeling assessed by echocardiogram were independently and strongly associated with paroxysmal AF. 16 Assessment of LA size and function has also been useful to predict the success of restoring sinus rhythm in patients with AF after either direct‐current cardioversion 17 or catheter ablation. 18 Electrophysiologic mapping studies have demonstrated that these echocardiographic markers of remodeling are associated with both electrical conduction slowing and regional atrial fibrosis; both are also strongly linked to progression of AF. 19 More recently, a retrospective cohort study of patients with AF showed that more severe LA fibrosis, as detected by late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, was associated with increased major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event risk, driven primarily by increased risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 20

### Preserved heart rate variability identifies low-risk patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy: results from the DEFINITE trial [^114QCSu4]. Heart Rhythm (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The recent expansion of indications for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement in subjects with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy has raised concerns about the cost-effectiveness of this therapy.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify low-risk patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who may not require prophylactic ICD placement.

Methods

This was a prospective study of 274 participants in the Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation (DEFINITE) trial, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the role of prophylactic ICD placement in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients underwent 24-hour Holter recording for analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The primary HRV variable was the standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN). Patients with atrial fibrillation and frequent ventricular ectopy (> 25% of beats) were excluded from HRV analysis (23% of patients). SDNN was categorized in tertiles, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare survival in the three tertiles and excluded patients.

Results

The study population was 73% male, with a mean age of 59 ± 12 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 21% ± 6%. After 3-year follow-up, significant differences in mortality rates were observed: SDNN > 113 ms: 0 (0%), SDNN 81–113 ms: 5 (7%), SDNN < 81 ms: 7 (10%), excluded patients: 11 (17%) (P = 0.03). There were no deaths in the tertile with SDNN > 113 ms regardless of treatment assignment (ICD vs control).

Conclusion

Patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and preserved HRV have an excellent prognosis and may not benefit from prophylactic ICD placement. Patients with severely depressed HRV and patients who are excluded from HRV analysis because of atrial fibrillation and frequent ventricular ectopy have the highest mortality.

### Evolving indications for permanent pacemakers [^1152zePw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

New indications for permanent cardiac pacing have been developed in recent years, with numerous studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes in a variety of disorders. Because hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, neurocardiogenic syncope, and atrial fibrillation are common conditions, every clinician should be aware of evolving alternative therapies for them. Observational studies in patients with refractory, symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular outflow gradient at rest suggest that cardiac pacing may result in symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement. Clinical trials have not shown conclusive evidence regarding the long-term benefit from pacing in these patients, and it is unclear whether pacing will be a preferred treatment option. Preliminary data suggest that pacing is a viable adjunctive therapeutic approach for improving symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mortality benefit has yet to be established, but it is to be hoped that ongoing randomized clinical trials will provide definitive information on that issue. Patients with refractory neurocardiogenic syncope or those who are intolerant of medical treatment may benefit from pacing therapies, especially those that use rate-drop sensor algorithms. Biatrial pacing has emerged as a technique that resynchronizes atrial electrical activity and has been shown to prevent atrial fibrillation. Multisite atrial pacing for the prevention of atrial fibrillation is considered investigational but seems promising. Newer indications for pacing are expected to result in improved clinical outcomes for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, neurocardiogenic syncope, and the prevention of atrial fibrillation.

### Atrial cardiopathy in the absence of atrial fibrillation increases risk of ischemic stroke, incident atrial fibrillation, and mortality and improves stroke risk prediction [^1139JNNA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Exposures

Measures of atrial cardiopathy included left atrial enlargement (LAE) and excessive atrial ectopy (EAE), obtained from outpatient echocardiography and Holter monitor studies. LAE was measured as antero‐posterior linear left atrial diameter (mm) on the baseline 2D echocardiogram, with moderate‐to‐severe enlargement defined using sex‐specific cut‐offs (≥ 43 mm for women and ≥ 47 mm for men). 18 EAE was measured as frequency of atrial premature beats per hour on the baseline Holter, with hourly atrial premature beats (APB) count categorized as: (1) normal (0–30 beats/h) and (2) excessive (30+ beats/h), as has previously been reported. 19 To examine potential cumulative effects of multiple markers of atrial cardiopathy, a composite measure was also obtained for individuals with both LAE and EAE, as defined above.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a hospital admission for acute ischemic stroke, ascertained using a previously validated administrative data algorithm for stroke (sensitivity = 86%; positive predictive value = 90%) 20 (Table S1). Secondary outcomes included a diagnosis of incident AF, ascertained using a previously validated administrative data algorithm for AF (sensitivity = 79.3%; positive predictive value = 80.4%) 21 and all‐cause mortality (Table S1).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for dilated cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to ICD, primary prevention of SCD, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to perform ICD placement in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, HF with NYHA class II-III symptoms, and LVEF of ≤ 35% despite guideline-directed medical therapy, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — diagnostic investigations require ECG documentation by at least a single-lead recording during the arrhythmia, which may be facilitated by emergency department records, Holter monitoring, or transtelephonic or telemetric recordings; a portable ECG tool may help in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and devices with diagnostic and memory functions may allow accurate and automatic detection. A chest radiograph may detect enlargement of the cardiac chambers and heart failure but is valuable mostly to detect intrinsic pulmonary pathology and to evaluate the pulmonary vasculature, and it is less important than echocardiography for routine evaluation. As part of the initial evaluation, all patients with atrial fibrillation should have 2-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography to assess LA and LV dimensions, LV wall thickness and function, and to exclude occult valvular or pericardial disease and HCM; LV systolic and diastolic performance helps guide decisions regarding antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic therapy, and thrombus should be sought in the LA but is seldom detected without TEE.

Cardiac sarcoidosis — device therapy and advanced management include that patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or symptomatic heart failure (HF) should also receive standard HF therapy; because fatal arrhythmias account for 25% to 65% of deaths, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) could prevent death in those with reduced LVEF and in some with relatively preserved LVEF, and 2012 ACCF/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines list cardiac sarcoidosis as a reasonable indication for ICD implantation with a Class IIA recommendation; isolated cardiac sarcoidosis showed very high rates of appropriate ICD therapy in a retrospective study, consideration of ICDs or risk stratification without myocardial impairment or spontaneous significant arrhythmias is more controversial, and cardiac transplantation has been used successfully with recurrences as early as 24 weeks that usually respond to steroids.

### Digoxin (digox) [^112pQ1z1]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Heart Failure: Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and improves heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but an optimal order for starting these three drugs cannot be specified.

Atrial Fibrillation: Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

### Detecting atrial fibrillation in patients with an embolic stroke of undetermined source (from the DAF-ESUS registry) [^114UGBSX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes a substantial proportion of embolic strokes of undeterminded source (ESUS). Effective detection of subclinical AF (SCAF) has important therapeutic implications. We conducted a prospective study to determine the prevalence of SCAF in patients with ESUS through of a 21-day Holter monitoring. In an early-monitoring group, Holter was initiated immediately after hospital discharge. The results were compared with a previous cohort of patients in whom the Holter was initiated at least 1 week after hospital discharge (late-monitoring group). We included 100 patients (50 each group; 69 ± 13 years, 56% male). Mean time from ESUS to Holter was 1.2 ± 1 day in the early-monitoring group and 30 ± 15 days in the late-monitoring group. SCAF was detected in 22% of patients in the early-monitoring and 6% in the late-monitoring group (p < 0.05). Patients with SCAF were older (77 ± 9 vs 67 ± 11 years, p < 0.05), with a higher rate of left atrial enlargement (50% vs 20%, p < 0.05), renal impairment (28% vs 5%; p < 0.01), and a slower mean heart rate (55 ± 6 vs 70 ± 6 beats/min; p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the presence of persistent bradycardia (≤ 60 beats/min) in the 21-day Holter was a powerful and significant risk factor for SCAF. In conclusion, the sooner 21-day Holter electrocardiogram monitoring is initiated after ESUS, the more likely SCAF can be detected. Sinus bradycardia is a powerful predictor of SCAF in patients with ESUS.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^116MDoG2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial size and function can be assessed with echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance, but because of its safety, relative low cost, and universal availability, echocardiography is the most widely applied first‐line modality. Many of the earlier measures of atrial function were only measurable during sinus rhythm, making comparisons in subjects with AF challenging. These measures include the following: (1) peak "A" wave velocity and velocity time integral of transmitral flow in late diastole; (2) estimation of the fractional contribution of atrial contraction to total mitral inflow; and (3) the use of Doppler tissue imaging as a global measure of atrial function. Recent advances in 2‐ and 3‐dimensional echocardiography, including in tissue Doppler imaging, and speckle tracking for strain analysis 9 have allowed evaluation of atrial function during AF. These varying parameters have distinct strengths and weaknesses and are complementary in differing clinical scenarios. The LA function index (LAFI) uses volumetric measurement of the LA and is a composite rhythm‐independent measure of LA function. It is a ratio that incorporates analogues of cardiac output, atrial reservoir function, and LA size and is calculated as follows: LAFI = (LA emptying fraction×velocity time integral across the left ventricular outflow tract)/largest LA volume measure in ventricular systole indexed to body surface area. 10 Thus, LAFI increases proportionally to LA reservoir function and stroke volume, but it is inversely proportional to LA size.

It has become increasingly recognized that structural and functional remodeling are important factors that determine cardiovascular prognosis and risk stratification. Several studies have demonstrated this association in different population subsets. In a single‐center study 11 that included ambulatory patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (< 40%) who were clinically stable and optimally treated, LAFI was a predictor of long‐term survival. Patients in the lower LAFI quartile had more severe heart failure symptoms, renal function, and left ventricular systolic function. Subgroup analysis by heart rhythm (sinus rhythm versus AF) revealed that this remained consistent in both subgroups. LAFI was also noted to be a predictor of heart failure hospitalization in another population‐based cohort study with stable coronary artery disease and preserved baseline ejection fraction (≥ 50%). 12 Besides functional remodeling, LA enlargement alone estimated by LA volume indexed to body surface area has also been demonstrated to predict adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease, 13 valvular heart disease, 14 and dilated cardiomyopathy. 15

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) — arrhythmias, conduction disease, and pacing considerations include that spontaneous complete heart block may be present from birth in approximately 4% of cases and the estimated risk of spontaneous heart block is 2% per year; therefore, the status of atrioventricular conduction must be monitored regularly with ECG and periodic Holter monitoring in adults with CCTGA. Accessory pathways are also somewhat common, particularly with Ebstein malformation of the left-sided tricuspid valve, and pacing may be associated with septal shift that may exacerbate SV dilatation and cause worsening of SAVV regurgitation, so it is probably prudent to have more frequent clinical and echocardiographic monitoring in an unoperated patient after pacemaker implantation.

Cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) — extended cardiac monitoring to detect occult atrial fibrillation (AF) is supported by randomized trials. EMBRACE randomized 572 patients ≥ 55 years of age with recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA to 30-day external loop recorder versus 24-hour Holter and found higher AF detection at 90 days. CRYSTAL-AF randomized 441 patients ≥ 40 years and implantable recorders were superior in detecting AF at 6 months (8.9% versus 1.4%), 12 months (12.4% versus 2.0%), and 3 years (30% versus 3%). In FIND-AF, repeated 10-day Holter monitoring in patients ≥ 60 years increased detection compared with conventional 24-Holter (14% versus 5%; absolute difference, 9.0% [95% CI, 3.4–14.5]; P = 0.002).

Right atrial abnormality — Right atrial abnormality is typically manifested as an increase in amplitude of the P wave and a tendency to rightward shift of the P-wave vector; a tall upright P wave in lead II (greater than 2.5 mm) is characteristic, and prominent initial positivity of the P wave in V1 or V2 (≥ 1.5 mm [0.15 mV] or more) also indicates right atrial abnormality. Rightward axis of the P wave and a peaked form without increased amplitude are supportive signs. Total P-wave duration is usually normal, but an exception occurs in patients with surgically repaired congenital heart disease (especially those with single-ventricle physiology) where significant P-wave prolongation occurs and is a risk factor for the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias.

### Concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with significant atrial dilation > 55 mm. worth the effort? [^116q6wCu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Concomitant Surgical AF ablation is an established procedure, recommended in guidelines. However many surgeons are reluctant to perform AF ablation in patients with significantly enlarged left atrium. We therefore analyzed outcomes of patients with left-atrial diameter > 55 mm undergoing concomitant AF ablation.

Methods

Between 05/2003 and 12/2012 124 patients with significantly enlarged left-atrium > 55 mm underwent concomitant surgical AF ablation. Rhythm monitoring was accomplished by implantable loop recorder (ILR) interrogation (n = 54), or 24-h Holter-ECG (n = 70). Successful ablation was defined as AF Burden < 0.5% in ILR interrogation or absence of AF episode > 30 s in 24-h Holter-ECG. Primary endpoint of the study was freedom from AF at 12 months follow-up.

Results

Mean patient's age was 65.7 ± 9.6 years, 69.4% were male. No major ablation or ILR related complications occurred. Mean LA diameter was 60.7 ± 4.4 mm. Survival rate at one-year follow up was 94.4%. 11 (8.8%) patients received additional catheter-based ablation, while 23 (18.5%) had an electrical cardioversion during follow-up period. Overall freedom from AF rate after one-year follow-up was 64.4% and 59.4% off antiarrhythmic drugs respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative paroxysmal AF, duration of AF and LA diameter > 70 mm as predictors for rhythm outcome at 12 months follow-up.

Conclusion

In this patient cohort with significantly enlarged LA diameter, concomitant surgical AF ablation provided freedom from AF of 64.4% after one-year follow-up. However in this patient population, an accurate postoperative care with interventions like medical or- electrical cardioversion and additional catheter based ablation is necessary to achieve satisfactory results.

### Atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [^113331vR]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A survey among international HCM experts found that most experts (87%) perform routine screening for AF, with the majority (61%) conducting it on an annual basis. A 24-to-48-hour Holter monitor was the preferred first-line tool (91%), followed by prolonged Holter monitoring. Consumer wearable devices were the third most-used screening tool (56%); but 91% of experts would not rely on these to start OAC and pursue further Holter or event monitor screening if a patient reports AF on these devices. LA dilatation was an important factor when considering screening for AF by most experts (78%). Additional factors that prompted increased frequency of screening included severe mitral regurgitation (61%), NYHA functional class III-IV (43%), and dynamic LVOTO (19%).

Whether extended ECG monitoring is more sensitive than the standard 24 to 48-hour Holter monitoring was examined in two small studies. Weissler-Snir et al. found newly diagnosed AF in 4 of 77 patients using 14-day ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring, none of which occurred during the first 48 hours of monitoring. The TEMPO-HCM study compared the yield of a 24-hour vs 30-day ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring in 100 HCM patients with a clinical indication for AF screening or for risk stratification for SCD. The 30-day monitoring detected 3 more cases of newly diagnosed AF than 24-hour monitoring. The difference was not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample size. However, the study suggests that extended ECG monitoring may have a role for AF screening in HCM.

Data regarding the yield of an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) for AF detection in HCM are scarce. A prospective observational study of 30 unselected HCM patients detected AF using ICM in 7 patients (5 asymptomatic) without a prior diagnosis of AF during an 18-month follow-up period. An additional study of 25 HCM patients who received an ICM for either recurrent near-syncope, palpitations, myocardial fibrosis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance, or HCM Risk-SCD score ≥ 4 to < 6% found newly diagnosed AF in 3 patients during a 30-month follow-up period. Only 1 of the 3 patients developed symptoms. No AF was diagnosed in the control group, who received conventional follow-up (ie, Holter monitoring every 6–24 months based on treating physician's discretion).

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure — electrocardiography and monitoring: Electrocardiogram-derived variables such as the PR interval, ECG-based left ventricular hypertrophy, and P wave indices have been used in AF prediction models but their additive value over other clinical risk factors is minimal; short duration Holter monitoring is not useful for AF detection in asymptomatic patients; longer duration monitoring with external or implantable loop recorders may help when paroxysmal AF is suspected; and in device implanted HF patients, frequent interrogation or remote monitoring of Holter memories is mandatory in order to diagnose AF and allow its early management.

### Left atrial cardiomyopathy: a puzzling disease process short of an easy answer [^114fzazc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The left atrium (LA) contributes to the development and propagation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Manifestations of LA disease include LA enlargement, diminished strain, fibrosis, and atrial arrhythmias. Observational studies suggest that alcohol consumption contributes to LA dilation, myocardial fibrosis, and the development of AF. Although these findings are consistent across multiple studies, the exact nature of the link between alcohol consumption and atrial disease remains incompletely understood.

The rigorous analyses published by Alam and colleagues in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) provide new insights into the subject. The investigators analyzed associations between alcohol consumption and LA size and functional parametersamong participants enrolled in the ongoing randomized controlled PREDIMED‐Plus (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea‐Plus) trial. Participants had rigorous follow‐up with longitudinal echocardiographic studies at 3 and 5 years. In addition, the investigators evaluated behavioral changes, including those related to alcohol intake, over the study duration. Some of their findings demonstrate a dose‐dependent effect of alcohol on the LA. At baseline, heavy drinkers had an increased LA volume index and had evidence of atrial dysfunction manifested by reduced reservoir and contractile strain. Over the follow‐up period, there was no association between baseline alcohol consumption and longitudinal changes in LA volume index and LA strain. However, among those who increased their alcohol intake by at least 1 drink per day, there was an increase in LA volume index by 0.71 mL/m 2 (95% CI, 0.17–1.26). This increase in volume was not accompanied by a decrease in any of the strain measurements. A counterintuitive finding was that a reduction in alcohol intake was not associated with positive LA remodeling or improvements in LA volume index and strain. Although these findings raise the possibility of alcohol inducing irreversible LA remodeling, they would not be concordant with prior studies and clinical experience demonstrating a reduction in AF burden with lower alcohol intake. Of course, it is also conceivable that structural and functional changes do not correspond with electrical remodeling, such as the burden of atrial arrhythmias observed in these individuals. Furthermore, one should be careful not to overinterpret the current findings as there were multiple outcomes evaluated in this study without correction for multiple testing. This could explain some of the discrepant findings, which could in part be attributable to chance.

### Should surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation be performed in patients with a significantly enlarged left atrium? [^115oYJin]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

One established predictor for failure of surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation is increased left atrial size. Surgeon perception is that surgical ablation in these patients is ineffective and should not be performed. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a larger left atrial size carries a prohibitive risk for failure and embolic events after surgical ablation.

Methods

In patients undergoing surgical ablation without left atrial reduction (N = 373), left atrial size was measured via transthoracic echocardiography within 6 months before surgery. Large (> 5.5 cm; n = 83) and small (≤ 5.5 cm; n = 290) left atrial size groups were compared on outcomes.

Results

Patients in the large left atrium group were younger (P = 0.02) and had lower operative risk (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, P = 0.01), but they were not different in type (P = 0.51) or duration of atrial fibrillation (P = 0.93). The large left atrium group was less likely to be in sinus rhythm at 1 year (86% vs 93%, P = 0.04), but there was no difference in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drugs (77% vs 85%, P = 0.10). By 2 years, the large and small left atrium groups were similar in sinus rhythm (85% vs 90%, P = 0.35). Freedom from embolic stroke was similar (P = 0.70) despite the majority of patients not taking anticoagulation at 1 year.

Conclusions

The large left atrium group had acceptable return to sinus rhythm and sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drugs. The embolic stroke rate was low despite the majority of patients not taking anticoagulation. If patients are managed appropriately post-ablation, left atrial size should not be a discouragement when evaluating surgical candidates with atrial fibrillation.

8.4.1 Patient selection for catheter ablation — patient selection is a critically important step; younger patients are likely to derive greater long-term benefit, and clinical trials have demonstrated improved cardiovascular outcomes with rhythm control even with median ages in the 70s; patients with minimal atrial enlargement have the best outcomes, whereas increased myocardial fibrosis and more persistent AF are associated with higher recurrence after ablation; time from diagnosis to ablation is also associated with improved outcomes; in some patients, ablation should be avoided due to overwhelming substrate or ongoing processes that make success unlikely, including advanced infiltrative cardiomyopathies like amyloid, severe mitral stenosis or regurgitation, and cor pulmonale; certain patients such as those with HFrEF have been shown to have improved functional status, LV function, and cardiovascular outcomes.

Brief summary of underlying pathomechanisms in HCM

There is overlap of the putative mechanisms of AF among patients with and without HCM, such as cardiac changes associated with older age. The cardiac substrate for AF can be categorized in structural and electrical changes (ie, remodeling) of the left atrium (LA), which usually is the site of the origin and perpetuation of AF. Electrocardiographic markers for AF which may indicate those structural and electrical abnormalities include P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (especially in the setting of concomitant obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]), as well as inflammatory pathways, may also be involved in the generation of AF. Evidence for an HCM-related atrial myopathy with decreased atrial systolic function and excessive fibrosis has also been documented and may further contribute to the development of AF and the excess risk of associated thromboembolic stroke noted in HCM (Figure 1).,

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: does functionality matter more than size? [^111AveBV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The left atrium (LA) is often regarded as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk. It serves several important functions: it modulates left ventricular filling and cardiovascular performance by functioning as a reservoir for pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole; it is a conduit for pulmonary venous return during early ventricular diastole; and it functions as a booster pump that augments ventricular filling during late ventricular diastole. 1 It is highly dynamic and demonstrates structural, functional, and electrical remodeling in a time‐dependent manner in response to various pathophysiological insults. The hallmark of structural remodeling is atrial dilatation and is frequently accompanied by increased interstitial fibrosis with cardiac structural alterations. 2 Functional impairment may occur with or without alteration in LA size. Remodeling that occurs in the initial phase is often reversible, 3 in contrast to remodeling that occurs with ongoing "stressors" over longer duration. 4 These maladaptive changes have a strong association with a wide array of conditions, including heart failure, 4 hypertension, 5 myocardial ischemia, 6 obesity, 7 and obstructive sleep apnea. 8 In tandem with structural change, electrophysiologic abnormalities develop, including global and regional conduction slowing and changes in refractoriness predisposing to onset of atrial arrhythmias and ultimately atrial fibrillation (AF).

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

Methods

Study Population

We analyzed 285 patients with a recent diagnosis of DCM (the median duration of the disease was 1 month [range 0 to 7 months]) who were prospectively enrolled in our Familial Cardiomyopathy Registry and who had 24‐hour Holter monitoring data within 12 months from enrollment. We excluded 183 patients for whom a baseline Holter monitoring was either never performed or performed > 1 year from enrollment. The enrollment period was from 1991 to 2012. Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled subjects, and the respective institutional review committees approved the study. Enrolled patients had a physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and laboratory investigations performed according to published guidelines. 8, 9, 10

None of the patients was treated with amiodarone at the time of Holter monitoring. Additional clinically indicated studies were performed, including right‐ and left‐side heart catheterization, ventriculography, coronary angiography, endomyocardial biopsy, and neuromuscular evaluation.

Criteria for the diagnosis of DCM were the presence of LV fractional shortening < 25% and/or LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45%, and LV end‐diastolic dimensions (LVEDD) > 117% of the predicted value based on the Henry formula. 8, 11

Exclusion criteria included arterial hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg), 12 coronary artery disease (obstruction > 50% of the luminal diameter in a major branch by coronary angiography), history of chronic excess alcohol consumption (> 100 g/d), tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, systemic diseases affecting short‐term prognosis, pericardial disease, congenital heart disease, and cor pulmonale. 8, 13

Familial DCM was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 family members affected by DCM. 8, 9, 10 AR‐DCM phenotype was diagnosed by the presence of 1 of the following: (1) unexplained syncope (likely due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia), 2, 14, 15, 16 (2) rapid nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) defined as ≥ 5 consecutive ventricular beats, 17 lasting < 30 seconds, with a rate ≥ 150/min on 24‐hour Holter monitoring, 18 (3) ≥ 1000 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in 24 hours 1 or (4) ≥ 50 couplets in 24 hours. 19 ICD implantation had been performed for primary prevention in selected patients with DCM considered at high risk for SCD (ie, persistent LV dysfunction with LVEF ≤ 35% and New York Heart Association class II or III while being treated with optimal medical therapy).

### Vigorous physical activity and atrial fibrillation in healthy individuals: what is the correct approach? [^111oPQyF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 CASE 2

A 48‐year old male was admitted to the hospital with a minor stroke. He was an ironman athlete with a BMI of 25 and only 3% of fat in his body. He practiced every day between 2 and 3 h of vigorous sport activity, whether running, swimming, cycling or a combination of these. ECG revealed AF. Based on brain CT findings, and the rapid clinical neurological improvement, no mechanical intervention or thrombolytic therapy was done. The neurological findings resolved within a few days. Trans Esophageal Echocardiography did not reveal a patent forman ovale, there was no plaque in the aorta and no thrombus in the left atrium or the left atrial appendage. His left atrium was mildly dilated, and there was mild hypertrophy of the LV walls. He was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm. Due to the stroke, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were started.

When discussed future recommendations regarding his ironman activity, he insisted he wants to continue. Several weeks later he underwent AF ablation with pulmonary vein isolation. He currently continues to take DOACs, continues to practice sport activity, though with a lower heart rate target and somewhat less vigorous. No AF episodes were recorded in his Apple watch nor in several 24‐h ECG Holter monitor recordings.

### Left atrial size: physiologic determinants and clinical applications [^113RbPoB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement has been proposed as a barometer of diastolic burden and a predictor of common cardiovascular outcomes such as atrial fibrillation, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular death. It has been shown that advancing age alone does not independently contribute to LA enlargement, and the impact of gender on LA volume can largely be accounted for by the differences in body surface area between men and women. Therefore, enlargement of the left atrium reflects remodeling associated with pathophysiologic processes. In this review, we discuss the normal size and phasic function of the left atrium. Further, we outline the clinically important aspects and pitfalls of evaluating LA size, and the methods for assessing LA function using echocardiography. Finally, we review the determinants of LA size and remodeling, and we describe the evidence regarding the prognostic value of LA size. The use of LA volume for risk stratification is an evolving science. More data are required with respect to the natural history of LA remodeling in disease, the degree of LA modifiability with therapy, and whether regression of LA size translates into improved cardiovascular outcomes.

8 PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE ENDURANCE ATHLETE LEADING TO AF

Several different physio‐pathological mechanisms may explain the increased risk of arrhythmia in athletes. Coumel's triangle, still represents the clearest way of understanding the complex pathophysiological AF mechanism, identifying three important elements: [1] electrical and structural remodeling, [2] triggers and [3] the role of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac adaptation to intense exercise results in increased vagal tone, lower resting heart rate and increased systolic output, ventricular dilation, and hypertrophy, all of which may cause a predisposition to AF recurrences. Additional pathophysiologic mechanisms may include recurrent fluid and electrolyte shifts (Table 1).

Table 1
Potential mechanisms and associated sequelae for atrial fibrillation induced by strenuous endurance exercise.

The left atrium plays a critical role in receiving pulmonary venous return and modulating left ventricular filling. With the onset of exercise, left atrial function contributes to the augmentation in stroke volume. Athletes are frequently observed to have enlarged left atrial size, when compared to non‐athletes. The adaptation of the left atrium appears to be proportional to the cumulative volume of training over an individual's lifetime. The left atrial enlargement is attributed to the repetitive, volume and pressure overload applied during exercise, particularly that of long duration over many years, with some contribution from an expanded blood volume that is observed amongst the well‐trained. Beyond the size of the left atrium, cross‐sectional studies demonstrate a modest reduction in left atrial reservoir and contractile strain amongst athletes compared to sedentary controls. Structural and electrical changes within the atrium may also lead to a reduction in atrial refractoriness and therefore to conduction slowdown and electrical dispersion known to facilitate the formation of re‐entry circuits and AF as a result.

The increased vagal tone in athletes further decreases the atrial refractory period, which could facilitate re‐entry and predispose to AF, especially because it is associated with an intermittent‐exercise‐related increase in sympathetic tone. Indeed, AF in athletes typically occur at rest and especially during sleep when the vagal tone is higher. Moreover, animal studies demonstrated an association between atrial enlargement, progressive atrial fibrosis, and inflammation due to intense exercise and their correlation with the risk of AF.

Of note, it seems that women are at a generally lower risk of developing AF than men because resting heart rate is usually higher, differences in vagal tone, smaller atria, and shorter P‐wave duration, but these hypotheses are speculative and have not been demonstrated yet.

### Alterations in atrial electrophysiology and tissue structure in a canine model of chronic atrial dilatation due to mitral regurgitation [^115ZbsLD]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Clinically, chronic atrial dilatation is associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. We have investigated atrial electrophysiology and tissue structure in a canine model of chronic atrial dilatation due to mitral regurgitation (MR).

Methods and Results

Thirteen control and 19 MR dogs (1 month after partial mitral valve avulsion) were studied. Dogs in the MR group were monitored using echocardiography and Holter recording. In open-chest follow-up experiments, electrode arrays were placed on the atria to investigate conduction patterns, effective refractory periods, and inducibility of AF. Alterations in tissue structure and ultrastructure were assessed in atrial tissue samples. At follow-up, left atrial length in MR dogs was 4.09 ± 0.45 cm, compared with 3.25 ± 0.28 at baseline (P < 0.01), corresponding to a volume of 205 ± 61% of baseline. At follow-up, no differences in atrial conduction pattern and conduction velocities were noted between control and MR dogs. Effective refractory periods were increased homogeneously throughout the left and right atrium. Sustained AF (> 1 hour) was inducible in 10 of 19 MR dogs and none of 13 control dogs (P < 0.01). In the dilated MR left atrium, areas of increased interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation were accompanied by increased glycogen ultrastructurally.

Conclusions

Chronic atrial dilatation in the absence of overt heart failure leads to an increased vulnerability to AF that is not based on a decrease in wavelength.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — ambulatory electrocardiogram (AECG) monitoring is integral for arrhythmia detection and sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification. Up to 30% of HCM patients present with NSVT episodes on Holter monitoring, and paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias (including AF) are observed in up to 38% of patients with HCM. ACCF/AHA guidelines published in 2011 recommended 24-hr AECG monitoring, while 2014 ESC guidelines recommend longer 48-hr AECG monitoring in patients at their initial clinical assessment to detect atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (Class IB). According to ESC guidelines, HCM patients with left atrium diameter ≥ 45 mm should undergo 48 hr AECG every 6–12 months to detect AF even if asymptomatic, and ESC guidelines recommend longer recordings (48-hr) in all subjects and more frequent monitoring (every 6–12 months) in patients with a sinus rhythm and left atrium dimension ≥ 45 mm. For NSVT assessment, 48-hr AECG monitoring to detect NSVT, defined as ≥ 3 PVCs at heart rate ≥ 120 bpm, together with clinical history and echocardiogram are considered as a first-line recommended assessment, and during follow-up AECG monitoring should be repeated in the case of any symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia or routinely every 1–2 years to evaluate evidence of NSVT episodes (class IIb). Nevertheless, NSVT is characterized by high negative (95%) but low positive predictive values.

### A simple electrocardiographic indication of left atrial enlargement… [^113PvQFP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The P-waves in standard electrocardiograms were analyzed in 101 normal children and adolescents and in 88 with asymptomatic rheumatic heart disease. Results were correlated with roentgenographically significant left atrial enlargement defined by new criteria that increase precision in x-ray assessment. Abnormalities in P-waves were more consistent in lead V-1 than in lead II. Left atrial enlargement could be suspected when a broadly-notched PII or an inverted or diphasic PV-1 was seen, and confirmed if the P-wave downstroke in V-1 was more than 1. 0 mm deep or lasted more than
0. 06 sec, or if PII lasted more than 0. 12 sec. P-waves were abnormal in lead V-1 for 29, and in lead II for 8, of 35 patients with significant left atrial enlargement. Normal and abnormal P-waves often overlapped in the analysis of lead II, but were sharply differentiated in lead V-1. Arevalo AC, Spagnuolo M, Feinstein AR.

### Sex differences in arterial hypertension [^1119diDs]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Dilated left atrium

A dilated left atrium (LA) is another common sign of hypertensive heart disease. LA dilatation is associated with increased CVD, in particular atrial fibrillation, heart failure (HF) and ischaemic stroke. In healthy subjects, the LA is normally larger in males than in females, but in hypertension LA dilatation is more common in females. In older subjects with hypertension and LVH, LA dilatation was significantly more prevalent in females. Similarly, also in middle-aged subjects with obesity without known CVD, LA dilatation was significantly more prevalent in females than in males, and particularly associated with co-presence of hypertension and increased arterial stiffness(Box 3).

Box 3
Key messages about sex-differences in hypertension mediated organ damage

Hypertension mediated organ damage like hypertensive heart disease and arterial dysfunction show sex specific incidence, threshold values and treatment success and may develop despite treatment.
Identification of the underlying mechanisms for such development in females and males may provide targets to reduce high-risk phenotypes and progression to CVD.

### Percutaneous versus thoracoscopic ablation of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a randomised controlled trial-the FAST II study [^111L2783]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Our dataset is too small to assess reliable differences in success rates between the different time periods within the CA and VATS PVI groups. Most AF relapses occurred outside the scheduled Holter monitoring period. A 7-day Holter monitoring covers only a small portion of the follow-up period. Similar monitoring issues could be suspected when comparing results from the present study with other studies.

No pre-operative Holter monitoring was performed, so a comparison with 7-day Holter monitoring at six and 12 months could not be done. According to the Holter monitoring data, five patients showed various degrees of AF-burden (from 0.1 to 99.9%) in the CA group.

The Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation Versus Surgical Ablation Treatment (FAST) study randomized patients with previously failed CA to VATS pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) or repeat CA and showed significantly greater efficacy with VATS PVI, but at the cost of a higher adverse event rate. Their results showed absence of AF without AADs at 12 months at 36,5% for CA and 65,6% for VATS PVI. However, the patients in the FAST-study differed from the patients in the present study in that some had paroxysmal AF, persistent AF and/or an enlarged left atrium and previously failed CA. Patients with an enlarged atria and persistent AF especially, have lower success rates with PVI as the only treatment and could account for the failures in the FAST-study.

A recent review article on VATS PVI by Laar et al. showed an efficacy rate of VATS PVI of 81% at 1 year (SR off AAD), which is similar to our results.

Different strategies for post-procedure monitoring have been applied in many studies and all have their strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, 1- to 7-day Holter monitoring has been used because it is relatively easy to apply and is patient-friendly. Unfortunately, it only covers a small fraction of the entire follow-up period. Pappone et al. reported an average of 6 ± 4 AF episodes per month prior to treatment. A 24-h Holter monitoring would have an approximate 20% chance of detecting AF based on those numbers. Jaïs et al. showed 4–30 episodes per month in which the average episode lasted 5.5 h (range 1–12 h). Therefore, Holter monitoring may have a very good positive predictive value but a low negative predictive value in this setting.

Again, the purpose of the trial should be married to the type of monitoring performed. If the ultimate goal is to improve patients' QOL, then excessive monitoring for asymptomatic AF might not be worth the effort. However, if the goal is to reduce AF burden, or change prognosis, particularly from a stroke point of view, then continuous monitoring should be required.

In the past, the consensus statement has provided minimum clinical requirements for postablation monitoring for clinical trials. Initially, these were quite stringent, and in the last consensus statement, the requirements were made more flexible. The current consensus recommends the following minimum monitoring requirements: For PAF, follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit, a 24-hour Holter at the end of the follow-up period (e.g. 12 months), and more limited event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up (e.g. 12 months), both at regular periods and with patient activated recordings obtained at the time of symptoms (or equivalent). Follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent). For persistent and long-standing persistent AF, follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit, a 24-hour Holter every 6 months, and event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up (e.g. 12 months), as well as at the time of symptoms (or equivalent). Follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent) (Table 10). In making these recommendations, it is important to recognize that the writing group views these as minimal monitoring recommendations. More intensive follow-up with more frequent Holters and/or extended ECG monitoring is encouraged. Similarly, follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent). It is acknowledged that this recommendation falls short of continuous monitoring and will largely detect symptomatic recurrences with only a limited ability to detect asymptomatic recurrences. However, this minimum standard will at least provide some consistency in trial reporting, and trials are encouraged to exceed this standard where possible. Details are specified in Table 10.

Left atrial size and clinical significance — The left atrium delivers 15% to 30% of the entire LV filling, functions as a reservoir that collects pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole, and as a conduit for stored blood to the left ventricle during early ventricular diastole. An enlarged left atrium is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and in the absence of mitral valve disease, an increase in LA size most commonly reflects increased wall tension as a result of increased LA pressure as well as impairment in LA function secondary to an atrial myopathy. A clear relationship exists between an enlarged left atrium and the incidence of atrial fibrillation and stroke, risk for overall mortality after myocardial infarction, risk for death and hospitalization in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and major cardiac events or death in patients with diabetes mellitus. LA enlargement is a marker of both the severity and chronicity of diastolic dysfunction and magnitude of LA pressure elevation.

### Shared decision making in athletes with cardiovascular disease: what we can learn from a masters athlete [^1134x5qg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 75-year-old male cyclist began suffering from palpitations on exertion. Symptoms terminated spontaneously with cessation of physical activity. The episodes caused significant distress with an impact on physical performance and quality of life. An echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium, and an exercise ECG demonstrated that episodes of atrial fibrillation developed when his ventricular rate was above 140 beats per minute. Rate control could not be offered due to a history of sinus bradycardia nor rhythm control due to low likelihood of success. Anticoagulant therapy was commenced but discontinued at patient request as he considered risks to outweigh benefits given his desire to continue cycling. Management of athletes with atrial fibrillation is based on guidelines for the general population; however, treatment goals for athletes may differ. Shared decision making is essential to allow patients to make informed decisions about their care, accepting that individuals view treatment risks and benefits differently.

Patient 4

The fourth patient, who is now 6 years old, was incidentally found to be in complete AVB block at 2.8 years of age. Her mean junctional escape rate by Holter monitoring was 39 bpm, with a maximum pause of 3.4 s. She was asymptomatic and had biventricular dilation (Z score of 3.5) with normal biventricular systolic function. Work‐up revealed anti‐SSA antibodies in her mother. An epicardial pacemaker was implanted at 3 years of age, with leads positioned on the LAA and left ventricle without complication. Pacemaker interrogation revealed marked delay between the onset of the surface P wave and the local LAA signal, suggestive of atrial conduction delay. Left ventricular function progressively decreased on follow‐up, with a shortening fraction of 12% and ejection fraction of 25% 6 months later. One year after pacemaker implantation, the system was upgraded to epicardial cardiac resynchronization therapy, and the LAA lead was replaced by a right atrial lead (Figure 3). At last follow‐up, her left ventricular systolic function had improved, with an ejection fraction of 45% and shortening fraction of 22%. As shown in Figure 3 C, a narrow paced QRS‐complex was obtained with a PR interval of 120 ms.

### Efficacy of catheter ablation in nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation patients with severe enlarged left atrium and its impact on left atrial structural remodeling [^1142daLp]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effect of catheter ablation on severe left atrial enlargement especially in nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation (NPAF) patients is not well understood. Whether reverse remodelling may occur after ablation has not been evaluated in this setting.

Methods and Results

Fifty consecutive patients with left atrial diameter (LAD) ≥ 50 mm, and LA volume > 200 cc undergoing catheter ablation for drug-refractory NPAF were included in this study. Transthoracic echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline and at 12-months postprocedure. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were indexed by body surface area (LVEDDI, LVESDI). Electroanatomic mapping system (Carto or NavX system) and computed tomography (CT) were used for 3-dimensional reconstruction of the LA. All patients underwent posterior wall isolation and pulmonary vein (PV) antrum and extra PV trigger ablations. Long-term follow-up was monitored by event recordings, 7-day Holter monitors and office visits. The mean age was 65 ± 10 years, 78% male, persistent AF 22 (44%), longstanding AF 28 (56%), LAD diameter 56.9 ± 7.8 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 53 ± 14 and median AF duration 72 (49–96) months. At 12-month follow-up, 27 patients (54%) remained arrhythmia-free off antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant reduction in LAD at follow-up (≥ 10% reduction) was observed in 52% (26/50) of the total population and among the 63% (17/27) of recurrence-free patients. Magnitude of LA reduction was identically distributed among the persistent and longstanding persistent AF cohorts (16 ± 12% vs 14 ± 16%, respectively, P = 0.15). A significant 20% improvement in LVEF (from 53 ± 14 to 58 ± 9, P = 0.03) was found in the overall population. Improvement was noted in recurrence-free patients. No significant change in LVEDDI and LVESDI was noted. After adjusting for baseline risk factors in a multivariable model, a reduction in LAD was identified as a strong predictor of long-term success (beta = -11.1, P = 0.013). Preexisting LA scarring was associated with increased LAD (beta = 2.7, P = 0.023). No periprocedural or long-term complications were reported.

Conclusion

Our results show that atrial fibrillation ablation is effective in NPAF patients with severe LA enlargement and is associated with LA reverse remodeling and improvement in LVEF.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) risk stratification and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use — major sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk factors include prior cardiac arrest, spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), spontaneous nonsustained VT, family history of SCD, syncope, left ventricular (LV) thickness greater than or equal to 30 mm, and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise; possible risk factors include atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, LV outflow obstruction, high-risk mutations, and intensive (competitive) physical exertion. A flat or hypotensive response to upright or supine exercise testing in patients younger than 40 years old is a risk factor for SCD with low positive predictive value, whereas a normal blood pressure response identifies a low-risk group; nonsustained VT on Holter monitoring is associated with higher SCD risk but has relatively low positive predictive accuracy. In high-risk HCM cohorts, ICD interventions were frequent and highly effective in restoring normal sinus rhythm; among patients with cardiac arrest, sustained VT, or ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate ICD discharges occurred at a rate of 11% per year, while in a primary prophylaxis subgroup the rate of appropriate discharge was 5% per year. The ICD is not indicated in the majority of asymptomatic patients with HCM; however, a single risk marker of high risk for sudden cardiac arrest may be sufficient to justify consideration for prophylactic ICD implantation in selected patients, and patients with multiple risk factors — especially severe septal hypertrophy, greater than or equal to 30 mm — or those with SCD (especially multiple SCDs) in close relatives appear to be at sufficiently high risk to merit consideration of ICD therapy.

Atrial structural abnormalities, remodeling, and atrial myopathy — Atrial cardiomyopathy has been identified as "any complex of structural, architectural, contractile or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria with the potential to produce clinically relevant manifestations", is common with aging and metabolic or hemodynamic stress, and often leads to or results from AF; structural and electrical remodeling promote AF and include interstitial changes, increased myofibroblast activity, collagen deposition, fibrofatty deposits, altered ion channel expression, calcium signaling and contractility, and inflammatory infiltrates; inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways are implicated, including myeloperoxidase associations with fibroblast activation, interstitial fibrosis, and AF inducibility in a mouse model, and LA endothelial changes with von Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 that may increase risk of thrombus formation and stroke; experimental hemodynamic overload such as reversible aortopulmonary artery shunting promotes atrial dilation, myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, extracellular matrix alterations, vascular dysfunction, and vulnerability to atrial ectopy and AF inducibility.

Atrial Enlargement and Geometry

A susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias has been demonstrated during abnormal myocardial loading that results in atrial stretch and dilatation, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of AF. During AF, uncontrolled ventricular rates can lead to increased hemodynamic overload and consequently cardiac failure, providing an underlying mechanism for atrial dilatation. However, comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, or mitral valve disease also contribute to atrial dilatation, increasing the vulnerability of the left atrium to AF. Ex vivo studies in guinea pig hearts demonstrated electrophysiological changes in atrial tissue following increased left atrial volume. A further study in Langendorff‐perfused rabbit hearts showed a graded increase in AF vulnerability that correlated with increasing atrial pressures. Later, in vitro studies of atrial stretch have shown downstream effects of hypertrophy and apoptosis that feed into the structural and electrophysiological changes described above. Atrial dilatation is related to both the severity of the underlying disease as well as the AF burden and may therefore precede AF manifestation in the context of other risk factors.

The relationship between atrial size and stroke risk has been controversial, in large part because of the significant limitations of studies that were conducted in patients with AF or mitral valve disease. A subgroup analysis of the Framingham Study assessed left atrial size and stroke risk in all patients > 50 years of age. After multivariable adjustment, left atrial size was found to be an independent predictor of stroke with every 10‐mm increase in left atrial size, resulting in a relative risk ratio of 2.4 for men (95% CI, 1.6–3.7) and 1.4 for women (95% CI, 0.9–2.1). Further population‐based studies in the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study assessed the role of atrial enlargement as an independent risk factor for recurrent ischemic stroke in a multiethnic population. Moderate to severe left atrial enlargement was demonstrated in patients with a recurrent cardioembolic or cryptogenic stroke with a hazard ratio of 2.83 after multivariable adjustment (95% CI, 1.03–7.81). These findings were attributed to reduced flow velocity in the LAA or left atrial enlargement representing a marker of end‐organ damage from hypertension, which is a known risk factor for recurrent stroke.

### Detection of unknown atrial fibrillation by prolonged ECG monitoring in an all-comer patient cohort and association with clinical and holter variables [^114tDQWE]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Seven-day Holter ECG monitoring detects unknown AF in around 9% of patients with various symptoms in an open access, 'all-comer' setting, suggesting that this is a useful diagnostic approach to enhance detection of unknown AF. Risk factor analysis for paroxysmal AF and systematic evaluations of treatment and outcomes after AF screening are needed to define populations for screening silent AF. Comparable AF detection rates between cardiology and primary care also supports provision of ECG monitoring using open-access services across various healthcare sectors.

Mechanisms and epidemiology of atrial annular dilation MR: In patients with preserved LV systolic function, progressive left atrial and annular dilation can lead to secondary MR, which is often associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) that may increase MR severity; successful AF ablation may reduce or eliminate MR, and isolated annular dilation accounts for < 20% of surgical referrals for severe MR in the STS database.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115sfDAr]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy — treatment focuses on eliminating or controlling the tachyarrhythmia, with catheter ablation often curative and standard heart failure (HF) therapy used to attenuate adverse remodeling; specifically, "Maintenance of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate is indicated in treating patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (Level of Evidence B)". Data suggest that a "heart rate > 100 beats per minute can lead to cardiomyopathy", but the exact threshold is not defined, and "The role of ICDs is not known". Disease course may be prolonged before HF and then accelerate: the insult "can develop over 1 month to years", and in one series tachycardia was present for "a mean of 8 years" before left ventricular (LV) dysfunction/HF, whereas with recurrence "HF developed within 6 months".

### Detection of unknown atrial fibrillation by prolonged ECG monitoring in an all-comer patient cohort and association with clinical and holter variables [^11451Gvn]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prolonged ECG monitoring is clinically useful to detect unknown atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke survivors. The diagnostic yield of prolonged ECG monitoring in other patient populations is less well characterised. We therefore studied the diagnostic yield of prolonged Holter ECG monitoring for AF in an unselected patient cohort referred from primary care or seen in a teaching hospital.

Methods

We analysed consecutive 7-day ECG recordings in unselected patients referred from different medical specialities and assessed AF detection rates by indication, age and comorbidities.

Results

Seven-day Holter ECGs (median monitoring 127.5hours, IQR 116 to 152) were recorded in 476 patients (mean age 54.6 (SD 17.0) years, 55.9% female) without previously known AF, requested to evaluate palpitations (n = 241), syncope (n = 99), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 75), dizziness (n = 29) or episodic chest pain (n = 32). AF was newly detected in 42/476 (8.8%) patients. Oral anticoagulation was initiated in 40/42 (95.2%) patients with newly detected AF. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex and monitoring duration found four clinical parameters to be associated with newly detected AF: hypertension OR = 2.54, (1.08 to 8.61) (adjusted OR (95% CI)), p = 0.034; previous stroke or TIA OR = 4.14 (1.81 to 13.01), p = 0.001; left-sided valvular heart disease OR = 5.07 (2.48 to 18.70), p < 0.001and palpitations OR = 2.86, (1.33 to 10.44), p = 0.015.

Conclusions

Open multispeciality access to prolonged ECG monitoring, for example, as part of integrated, cross-sector AF care, can accelerate diagnosis of AF and increase adequate use of oral anticoagulation, especially in older and symptomatic patients with comorbidities.

Management considerations in patients with AF and obesity — risk magnitude: Overweight and obesity increased the risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF), with a 4% increase in AF risk per unit increase in body mass index (BMI) in men and women, and adjusted hazard ratios for AF associated with obesity were 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09–2.13; P = 0.02) for men and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.03–2.07; P = 0.03) for women compared with individuals with normal BMI; the excess risk appeared to be mediated through left atrial dilatation.

### Cardioembolic stroke: everything has changed [^1152ujdL]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Because the risk of recurrent stroke is high soon after a cardioembolic event, it is more prudent to anticoagulate the patient pending the results of investigations, rather than wait several weeks to anticoagulate the patient after the results are available from an echocardiogram and Holter recording (followed by more prolonged ECG monitoring if the initial Holter is negative). Indeed, if there is a strong suspicion of a cardioembolic source, as described above, it is now more prudent to anticoagulate the patient with a DOAC than to persist with antiplatelet therapy. Two trials of this approach in patients with ESUS are in progress.

### On the origin of microembolic signals – a clinical and postmortem study [^113B1mP6]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Clinically silent circulating microembolic signals (MES) can be identified by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). It is not yet clear whether their occurrence is always linked to the presence of embolic sources.

Methods

24 terminally ill patients (7 women, 17 men; mean age 68 years) were investigated by TCD of the middle cerebral arteries. These findings were correlated with a complete post-mortem examination of potential embolic pathways.

Results

Four patients out of the 24 under investigation showed MES, 2 of them bilaterally. All these 4 MES-positive patients had a definite embolic source, i.e. bilateral carotid artery occlusive disease, endocarditis with thrombotic valvular adhesions and severe plaques in the aortic arch, dilated left atrium and a patent foramen ovale, or severe plaques in the aortic arch and a dilated left atrium, respectively.

Conclusion

In the investigated patient group, we could demonstrate that MES can only be found when an embolic source is present. The finding of MES justifies an extensive clinical and laboratory search for potential embolic sources including extracranial and intracranial colour-coded duplex ultrasound, ECG, Holter-ECG, and TEE.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^113rABWP]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — ECG recording modalities: The definition of AF has been set as a minimum of 30 s. Some patients exhibit very-high-density atrial ectopy that can serve as AF triggers as well, and 24-hr recordings that contain > 1,000 atrial premature beats may be candidates for ablation of these "focal triggers". Short-duration 24- to 72-hr Holter recordings are best suited for patients with very frequent paroxysms of AF or persistent AF, while for less frequent episodes, patient-activated event and loop recorders can be used for several weeks at a time, and autotriggered devices have higher diagnostic yield than standard 24-hr Holter monitors and 30-day loop recorders.

The author examines the ability of left atrial size and function to predict cardiovascular outcomes. Data are sufficient to recommend evaluation of left atrial volume in certain populations, and although analysis of atrial reservoir, conduit, and booster pump function trails in that regard, the gap is rapidly closing. In this state-of-the-art paper, the author reviews the methods used to assess left atrial size and function and discusses their role in predicting cardiovascular events in general and referral populations and in patients with atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, and valvular heart disease.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left atrial enlargement… [^113eaGH2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Established scalar electrocardiographic criteria for left atrial enlargement are based on abnormalities of the P-terminal force, total P-wave duration, and the relationship of total P-wave duration to PR-interval duration. These electrocardiographic signs may also result from left atrial hypertension, left atrial hypertrophy, and interatrial conduction defects. This article describes the scalar electrocardiographic criteria for left atrial enlargement in current use, and provides a critical appraisal of their efficacy in diagnosis. Alpert MA, Munuswamy K.

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: are results maintained at 5 years of follow-up? [^117E16np]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study describes 5-year follow-up results of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Long-term efficacy following catheter ablation of AF remains unknown.

Methods

A total of 100 patients (86 men, 14 women), age 55.7 ± 9.6 years, referred to our center for a first AF ablation (63% paroxysmal; 3.5 ± 1.4 prior ineffective antiarrhythmic agents) were followed for 5 years. Complete success was defined as absence of any AF or atrial tachycardia recurrence (clinical or by 24-h Holter monitoring) lasting ≥ 30 s.

Results

Arrhythmia-free survival rates after a single catheter ablation procedure were 40%, 37%, and 29% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, with most recurrences over the first 6 months. Patients with long-standing persistent AF experienced a higher recurrence rate than those with paroxysmal or persistent forms (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 3.5; p = 0.0462). In all, 175 procedures were performed, with a median of 2 per patient. Arrhythmia-free survival following the last catheter ablation procedure was 87%, 81%, and 63% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Valvular heart disease (HR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.0 to 17.6; p = 0.0012) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (HR: 34.0, 95% CI: 6.3 to 182.1; p < 0.0001) independently predicted recurrences. Major complications (cardiac tamponade requiring drainage) occurred in 3 patients (3%).

Conclusions

In selected patients with AF, a catheter ablation strategy with repeat intervention as necessary provides acceptable long-term relief. Although most recurrences transpire over the first 6 to 12 months, a slow but steady decline in arrhythmia-free survival is noted thereafter.

### Excessive trabeculation of the left Ventricle: JACC: cardiovascular imaging expert panel paper [^1127ouMb]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 7
Case Report 4

Images of a 38-year-old master triathlete with history of catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography at preparticipation screening documented the presence of mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function, mild eccentric aortic regurgitation, and a severely dilated LV with excessive trabeculation (positive Jenni and Chin criteria) that resulted in the diagnosis of so-called left ventricular noncompaction. CMR confirmed the presence of a severely dilated LV with mildly impaired systolic function and excessive trabeculation (A) according to the Petersen criteria (noncompacted [trabecular] to compact layer ratio: 3.1). Severe eccentric aortic regurgitation was present (B and C) in addition to a thrombus within the left atrial appendage (A and D). Six months after surgical aortic valve replacement (E) and left atrial appendage occlusion, significant left ventricular reverse remodeling occurred with near-complete normalization of left ventricular function, volumes, and diameters (end-diastolic frame [F]; end-systolic frame [G]), further leading to a reduction of Petersen criteria for excessive trabeculation (noncompacted [trabecular] to compact layer ratio: 2.4). Moderate-to-severe left ventricular dilatation must be carefully investigated in athletes, irrespective of extent of ventricular trabeculation. If the excessive trabeculation had been part of a cardiomyopathy, arguably, these substantial improvements in left ventricular volumes and function would not have been observed. RF = regurgitant fraction; RVol = regurgitant volume; other abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 4.

Athletes with symptoms, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or a family history of cardiomyopathy should undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Holter monitoring, and CMR. Balanced atrioventricular remodeling, normal or supranormal indices of diastolic function, normal longitudinal systolic function, and preserved contractility reserve all suggest physiological adaptation to the intensity and/or frequency of physical workload. The recommendations for competitive athletes that have features of cardiomyopathy are not altered by the additional presence of excessive trabeculation. No data exist to indicate that athletes with isolated excessive trabeculation and normal myocardial structure and function should be routinely disqualified from participation in high-intensity exercise and competitive sport.

Atrial fibrillation with associated heart disease — specific cardiovascular conditions associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) include valvular heart disease (most often, mitral valve disease), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension, particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present; AF may also be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease (especially atrial septal defect in adults), with additional potential etiologies such as restrictive cardiomyopathies (including amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and endomyocardial fibrosis), cardiac tumors, and constrictive pericarditis; other heart diseases include mitral valve prolapse with or without mitral regurgitation, calcification of the mitral annulus, and idiopathic dilation of the right atrium (RA), and AF is commonly encountered in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure evaluation — cardiac rhythm assessment and echocardiography: In patients being considered for PFO closure, clinicians should perform a baseline ECG to look for atrial fibrillation (level A). Select patients thought to be at risk of atrial fibrillation should receive prolonged cardiac monitoring for at least 28 days (level B), with risk factors including age ≥ 50 years, hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, enlarged left atrium, elevated NT-proBNP, frequent premature atrial contractions, and increased P-wave dispersion. Clinicians should assess for cardioembolic sources using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) followed by TEE if the first study does not identify a high-risk stroke mechanism, and studies should use bubble contrast, with and without Valsalva maneuver, to assess for right-to-left shunt and determine degree of shunting (level B).

### Ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: treatment strategy, characteristics of consecutive atrial tachycardia and long-term outcome [^1174otNW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Concomitant surgical ablation was performed in patients with AF undergoing mitral valve surgery or surgical myectomy. The indication for AF surgery as a stand‐alone procedure was reserved for a selected number of patients with severely dilated LA after interdisciplinary decision of the cardiac surgeon and the electrophysiologist. Patients with paroxysmal AF received PVI. Left atrial ablation with box lesions, left atrial appendage isolation, the ablation of the left atrial isthmus, additional biatrial ablation with right atrial intercaval lesions, ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus, and ablation at the right atrial appendage and the terminal crest was performed at operator's discretion as was previously described. 30 The energy sources applied included unipolar radiofrequency ablation (Cardioblate unipolar RF pen, Medtronic Inc.) and bipolar ablation (Cardioblate BP2 device and Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System Generator, Medtronic Inc.).

Follow‐Up

All patients were monitored for peri‐procedural complications throughout the procedure and during hospitalization. Follow‐up was scheduled in a 3‐ to 6‐month interval in our outpatient clinic. AF and AT recurrences were assessed using 24‐hour Holter ECG recordings every 1 to 2 months. In patients with an implantable electronic cardiac device, the continuous rhythm monitoring function was used for the assessment of AF/AT recurrences. 31 Patients were assessed for clinical status and current antiarrhythmic medication. A single AF/AT episode with a duration of > 30 seconds on the 24‐hour Holter ECG or an atrial high rate episode lasting longer than 5 minutes as detected by a cardiovascular implantable electronic device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was defined as AF/AT recurrence. The absence of AF/AT recurrences during the entire follow‐up was considered freedom of AF/AT. If AAD therapy was continued after ablation and no further AF episodes were detected at follow‐up, discontinuation of AAD therapy was recommended. Patients experiencing symptomatic recurrences with documented AF/AT or an AF burden > 1% after a 3‐month blanking period underwent a change of AAD or a repeat ablation at the discretion of the electrophysiologist and patients' preference.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Left atrial flutter after atrial fibrillation ablation — incidence and clinical context: Left atrial flutter (LAFL) after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is described as common, occurring "between 12% and 50% of patients", yet it is "rarely observed in the context of paroxysmal AF ablation when the procedure is limited to PV". The statement adds that LAFL is "relatively uncommon (< 1%) when the cryoballoon is used for treatment of patients with paroxysmal AF". Risk increases because "the likelihood of developing a LAFL increases markedly in patients with longstanding persistent AF, markedly dilated atria, and where linear ablation strategies are employed", and many patients are highly symptomatic with rate control challenges, "making the performance of another ablation procedure mandatory in many patients".

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

EHRA consensus — Holter monitoring recommendations for atrial tachyarrhythmia detection indicate that Holter monitoring "may be used as a step in screening strategy or in combination with other screening tools to improve detection of subclinical arrhythmia and to select candidates for long-term monitoring", and "Serial Holter monitoring may be considered if longer duration monitoring tools are not available". A fact statement adds that "ESVEA documented by Holter monitoring can be considered as a surrogate marker for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)", with on-page abbreviations defining ESVEA as excessive supraventricular ectopic activity, AF as atrial fibrillation, CIED as cardiac implantable electronic device, and SAF as silent atrial fibrillation.
