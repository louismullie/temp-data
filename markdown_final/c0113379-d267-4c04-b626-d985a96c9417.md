## Question

one paragraph assessment: Initiate ESA therapy for support HGB levels.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a one-paragraph assessment on initiating erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy to support hemoglobin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the indication and the patient population. Then, I should verify population-specific hemoglobin thresholds for starting ESAs. Next, I will check iron status and other reversible causes. After that, I need to assess contraindications and cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk. Then, I will select the agent, route, and starting dose. I should confirm monitoring cadence and rate-of-rise limits. I will then define dose-adjustment rules and hemoglobin targets. Finally, I need to plan ongoing reassessment and stopping rules, ensuring alignment with FDA labels, KDIGO, UKKA, ASCO/ASH, ESMO, and ECCO guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indication and population because ESAs should be used only when the benefit of transfusion avoidance outweighs risks, and within labeled or guideline-supported contexts, namely CKD anemia, chemotherapy-associated anemia when treatment is not curative in intent, and selected non-IDA anemia in IBD after inadequate IV iron response, with the overarching principle that ESAs in CKD are indicated to reduce RBC transfusions rather than to normalize hemoglobin [^114nSbD8] [^116JRSua] [^113EzrJC] [^11228KUJ].

> I need to verify hemoglobin initiation thresholds by condition to avoid jumping too early; for CKD on dialysis, the FDA label directs initiation when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL and to reduce or interrupt the dose if hemoglobin approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, with similar initiation guidance appearing across biosimilar labels, while for non-dialysis CKD, initiation is also generally considered below 10 g/dL with individualized judgment, and for cancer receiving chemotherapy, ESAs are typically offered when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL if symptomatic or less than 8 g/dL if asymptomatic, provided treatment intent is not curative, whereas for IBD with anemia of chronic disease, ESAs are considered only after inadequate response to IV iron with targets not exceeding 12 g/dL, and if hemoglobin is above these thresholds, I should refrain from initiating ESA given cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks that rise with higher targets [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG] [^113K7LRN] [^116JRSua] [^1173aBjJ] [^11228KUJ].

> Wait, let me verify iron status next because ESA efficacy and safety hinge on iron sufficiency; I should check ferritin and transferrin saturation, correct absolute iron deficiency first, and treat functional iron deficiency as indicated, noting that ESMO 2018 recommends iron therapy before or during ESA in functional iron deficiency but the source text says "transferrin saturation > 100 ng/mL", which mixes units, so hold on, I should correct that and align with typical thresholds where ferritin is over about 100 µg/L and TSAT is low, confirming that ECCO similarly emphasizes IV iron first in IBD and that in uncomplicated IDA workups a trial of iron is recommended before further invasive testing [^116yvXcp] [^113YtWU4] [^11228KUJ] [^113BEyM7].

> I should confirm and treat other reversible causes of anemia before ESA initiation because missing these will blunt response and increase risk; I need to consider occult bleeding, B12 and folate deficiencies, inflammatory disease control, medication effects, and in oncology ensure anemia is truly chemotherapy-related rather than disease progression, while in liver disease or malnutrition I should optimize micronutrients as per EASL, and in CKD I should follow KDIGO's structured evaluation to exclude non-renal causes before ESA [^113YtWU4] [^116ixfoj] [^116gkbG6] [^11228KUJ].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and risk amplifiers to avoid harm; uncontrolled hypertension is a clear red flag because ESAs can raise blood pressure, higher hemoglobin targets are linked to increased risks of death, MI, stroke, thrombosis, and tumor-related thromboembolism in oncology, and ASCO/ASH explicitly warns against ESA use when cancer therapy has curative intent, so I must document baseline cardiovascular history and thromboembolic risk and proceed with the lowest effective dose strategy if benefits outweigh risks [^114nSbD8] [^114pCBe6] [^116JRSua].

> Next, I will select the ESA, route, and starting dose, keeping it simple and label-concordant; for CKD on hemodialysis, I should start epoetin alfa 50 to 100 Units/kg three times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously with IV preferred for hemodialysis, while for non-dialysis CKD I may individualize route and frequency to patient preference and logistics, and for chemotherapy-associated anemia, I should use label- or ESMO-concordant regimens such as epoetin 450 IU/kg per week or darbepoetin 2.25 mcg/kg weekly or 6.75 mcg/kg every 3 weeks, always with the guiding principle to use the lowest dose sufficient to reduce transfusions rather than to normalize hemoglobin [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG] [^1171L7Tu] [^116qMGMQ].

> Let me think about monitoring because early-phase vigilance prevents overshoot and complications; I need to monitor hemoglobin at least weekly during initiation and after dose changes until stable, then at least monthly in CKD, and in stable maintenance phases per UKKA consider every 1 to 3 months, with explicit attention to rate of rise, aiming for approximately 1 to 2 g/dL per month, while also checking blood pressure at each visit and reassessing iron indices periodically to prevent functional iron deficiency during ESA therapy [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG] [^113TjV1d] [^111VdAXF] [^114iX4WB] [^114QSS9c].

> I should double-check the dose adjustment rules to avoid rapid hemoglobin rises; if hemoglobin increases by more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period I should reduce the dose by about 25 percent or more, if hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks I can increase the dose by about 25 percent, and if there is inadequate response after a 12-week escalation period I should discontinue the ESA because further increases are unlikely to help and may increase risk, and in CKD dialysis patients I must reduce or interrupt therapy as hemoglobin approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL per label [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG].

> But wait, what is the appropriate hemoglobin target by condition; for adults with CKD on ESAs the UK Kidney Association recommends maintaining 100 to 120 g/L in those aged 2 years and older, for pediatrics KDIGO suggests 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL in children on ESA, oncology guidance recommends achieving the lowest hemoglobin compatible with avoiding transfusions with many practices stabilizing near 12 g/dL, and ECCO cautions not to exceed 12 g/dL in IBD anemia of chronic disease treated with ESA, whereas older NKF language suggested a target 11 to 12 g/dL and not to exceed 13 g/dL which I should reconcile with current labeling that emphasizes conservative targets and individualized judgment, so I will prioritize the lowest effective hemoglobin sufficient to avoid transfusion within these ranges [^116zSyq8] [^116Tii6A] [^116gkbG6] [^113sgauJ] [^11228KUJ] [^115cMe5W].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought initiation for CKD might occur around 11 g/dL because one contemporary review in older adults described initiation at 11 g/dL to minimize cardiovascular complications, but that conflicts with the FDA CKD dialysis label which directs initiation when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, so to stay consistent with labeling I will use less than 10 g/dL for CKD initiation and view the 11 g/dL comment as a narrative example rather than a directive threshold [^114dG39x] [^114nSbD8].

> I need to ensure I capture special hematology scenarios; in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes not on myelosuppressive chemotherapy and with serum EPO levels of 500 IU/L or less, ESA therapy can be considered with dosing and modifications per FDA-concordant approaches and oncology guidelines, while still applying the lowest-dose-to-avoid-transfusion principle and vigilance for thromboembolism [^112aJbth] [^112phpYx].

> Next, I should review the ongoing reassessment plan; at each encounter I will evaluate symptoms, transfusion requirements, blood pressure, iron stores, and changes in underlying disease or chemotherapy phase, tapering to the lowest effective dose in CKD once stable and discontinuing ESAs when chemotherapy stops or there is no response after a 12-week escalation, with proactive management of ESA hyporesponsiveness including addressing inflammation and iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^114nSbD8] [^111qGRWh] [^115jcKeA].

> Hold on, I should verify key safety guardrails; never aim to normalize hemoglobin or exceed approximately 12 g/dL in oncology or IBD settings and avoid exceeding 11 g/dL in CKD dialysis per label, avoid rapid hemoglobin rises greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks because of hypertension and adverse outcomes, and in cancer carefully weigh elevated venous thromboembolism risk and avoid ESAs when treatment intent is curative, with prompt dose reduction or interruption and consideration of discontinuation for safety signals [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG] [^114pCBe6] [^116JRSua].

> Let me reconsider the iron-ESA interface in oncology because it strongly affects response; ESMO advises correcting iron deficiency before or during ESA, and although the phrasing in one excerpt mixed TSAT with ng/mL units, the operational takeaway remains that patients with low TSAT despite adequate or elevated ferritin, consistent with functional iron deficiency, benefit from IV iron to optimize ESA responsiveness and reduce transfusions, which mirrors ECCO's prioritization of IV iron before considering ESA in IBD [^116yvXcp] [^113YtWU4] [^11228KUJ].

> To synthesize a safe initiation flow without skipping steps, I will confirm indication and non-curative intent where relevant, verify hemoglobin below the population-specific threshold, correct iron deficiency and reversible causes first, screen for and control hypertension and thromboembolic risks, start at the lowest effective label-concordant dose with appropriate route, monitor hemoglobin weekly with blood pressure and iron rechecks, adjust the dose to keep rate-of-rise within 1 to 2 g/dL per month, reduce or hold as hemoglobin approaches upper bounds, and discontinue for nonresponse after 12 weeks or when the underlying indication resolves, maintaining the overarching goal of avoiding transfusions while minimizing harm [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG] [^113TjV1d] [^113K7LRN] [^1173aBjJ] [^11228KUJ].

Initiate ESA therapy in CKD patients when **hemoglobin < 10 g/dL** [^114nSbD8], aiming for 10–12 g/dL [^116zSyq8] and avoiding levels > 13 g/dL to minimize cardiovascular risk [^115cMe5W] [^117LcAtM]. For chemotherapy-associated anemia, **initiate ESAs when hemoglobin < 10 g/dL** and treatment intent is non-curative [^113K7LRN], targeting the lowest level necessary to reduce transfusions [^116qMGMQ] [^113YtWU4]. Always **correct iron deficiency** before or during ESA therapy [^116yvXcp] [^113YtWU4], monitor hemoglobin weekly until stable, then monthly [^114nSbD8] [^112PAxUG], and adjust doses to prevent rapid rises or overshooting targets [^112PAxUG] [^113TjV1d]. Avoid ESAs in **non-chemotherapy cancer anemia** or curative-intent therapy [^114pS8n1] [^116JRSua], and use the lowest effective dose to balance benefits with thromboembolic and cardiovascular risks [^114pCBe6].

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist healthcare providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on evidence and expert judgment. Every healthcare professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in cancer patients. Controlled clinical studies have shown that epoetin alfa consistently and significantly increases levels of hemoglobin (Hb), decreases the need for RBC transfusion, and improves the quality of life, which is of such importance in cancer patients with a limited life expectancy. The rise achieved in Hb level correlates with an improvement in quality of life. Studies have also demonstrated that earlier initiation of epoetin therapy (i.e. starting treatment at an Hb level of 10–11 g/dl rather than waiting for Hb to fall to < 10 g/dl) is associated with a faster achievement of an optimal Hb level, a lower transfusion requirement, and a maintained quality of life.

### Anemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^115cMe5W]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations for treatment of anemia**: The NKF currently recommends that when treating anemia in CKD with an ESA, the Hb target range should be 11–12 g/dl and should not exceed 13 g/dl. Treatment should be individualized, taking into account patient characteristics including symptoms, Hb level, and evaluation for other causes of anemia.

	- If the initial evaluation indicates absolute iron deficiency as the cause, treatment with supplemental iron and a search for the cause of iron loss should be undertaken. If absolute iron deficiency is not present and causes other than kidney disease are excluded, then treatment with an ESA should be administered at a dose sufficient to increase Hb within the target range of 11–12 g/dl. Importantly, ESA-treated patients should, in general, receive iron to ensure that adequate stores are available for erythropoietic response. The NKF notes that, with few exceptions, anemia treatment trials in CKD patients demonstrated that treatment with an ESA to achieve Hb values in the range of 11–13 g/dl is associated with improved quality of life.

- **Food and Drug Administration**: In early 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promulgated new recommendations for use of ESA in patients with CKD, advising that ESA can increase risk for heart attack, stroke, blood clots, heart failure, and death when given to maintain higher Hb levels. Drugs affected by this recommendation included epoetin-α and darbepoetin. The FDA advised practitioners to use the lowest dose of an ESA needed to avo-.

### Procrit [^114nSbD8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For all patients with CKD: When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy, consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness, and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change. Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every four weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustments. If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g. more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Procrit by 25% or more as needed to mitigate rapid responses. For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after four weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%. For those who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, further increasing the Procrit dose is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain hemoglobin levels sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia and discontinue Procrit if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis: Initiate Procrit treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Procrit. The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg three times weekly, either intravenously or subcutaneously, with the intravenous route recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

### Individualizing decision-making — resurrecting the doctor-patient relationship in the anemia debate [^115hB3XS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are approved to avoid transfusions, a risk that increases when hemoglobin (Hgb) falls below 13 g/dl and is associated with increased cardiovascular events. Paradoxically, achieving this level results in lower mortality. The anemia paradox — higher cardiovascular events when targeting higher Hgb but lower events when patients achieve these targets — appears to be at least partially attributable to a hyporesponse to ESAs. Whether it is the ESAs or the conditions that necessitate an increased ESA dose that provokes morbidity cannot be answered definitively at present. The lowest ESA dose to achieve the desired level of anemia correction appears to be a safer strategy.

In acute illnesses, reducing the dose of ESAs or stopping it altogether may aggravate anemia, but this may be permissible. The rate of rise in Hgb greater than 1 g/dl in any 2-week period is associated with an increase in blood pressure (BP) and poor outcomes. Accordingly, while initiating and maintaining ESA therapy, monitoring BP at home twice daily is warranted. The clinical decision-making process in managing anemia should consider the risks of transfusion, kidney transplant potential, presence of cancer, and the risks of st.

### Association of dialysis facility-level hemoglobin measurement and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose adjustment frequencies with dialysis facility-level hemoglobin variation: a retrospective analysis [^1152bc5e]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

A central aim of anemia management in dialysis patients is to maintain patients' hemoglobin (Hb) levels consistently within a target range. Anemia management guidelines and protocols thus require appropriate adjustment of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) doses in response to Hb deviations relative to the target range. There are varied opinions among clinicians, however, regarding practice patterns that help achieve this objective.

The US Food and Drug Administration-approved ESA label recommends an Hb target range of 10 to 12 g/dL when treating dialysis patients, which represents a slightly broader range than the 11 to 12 g/dL Hb target currently recommended by the National Kidney Foundation. Recent data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have suggested no benefit and raised concerns regarding deleterious effects observed with Hb targets of 13–15 g/dL in patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with ESAs. At the same time, however, there are adverse consequences associated with low Hb levels. Thus, at the level of the individual dialysis provider, Hb target ranges have been influenced by the need to balance these opposing risks with the benefits of achieving Hb levels within the 10 to 12 g/dL range.

Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule for the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System that includes a payment penalty for dialysis facilities that maintain more than a specified proportion of patients in Hb 12 g/dL ranges. It is therefore helpful for clinicians to understand.

Regarding medical management for cancer-related anemia, specifically concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend weighing the risks of thromboembolism. They advise using caution and employing clinical judgment when considering the use of ESAs. Particular caution is warranted when using ESAs in conjunction with treatment strategies and diseases that have an increased risk of thromboembolic complications.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^1154ezE1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for anaemia of CKD:

- **Evaluation of anaemia - screening**: We suggest that haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be routinely measured to screen for anaemia at least annually in patients with CKD G3 and at least twice a year in patients with CKD G4–5 not on dialysis (2B).

- **Audit measure**: Proportion of CKD patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min (using 4 variable MDRD or CKD-EPI method) with an annual Hb level.

- **Rationale**: There is insufficient literature to suggest the ideal frequency of Hb testing in CKD patients who are not on ESA therapy. Data from clinical trials have shown that the rate of Hb decline in these patients is gradual. In a Canadian study to assess the effect of ESA therapy on left ventricular mass in patients with CKD, 172 patients were assigned to either receive therapy with erythropoietin α subcutaneously to maintain or achieve Hb level targets of 120 to 140 g/L, or to the control/delayed treatment group with mean Hb levels of 90 ± 5 g/L. During the 2-year follow-up, a significant proportion of patients eventually required ESA therapy. However, among those who did not require ESA therapy, mean Hb values remained relatively stable throughout the study period. Hb level should be measured at least monthly in CKD G5 haemodialysis patients and every 3 months in CKD G5 peritoneal dialysis patients.

- **Guidelines**: KDIGO 2012 guidelines suggest measurement of Hb at least annually in patients with CKD G3, at least twice per year in patients with CKD G4–5ND, and at least every 3 months.

Regarding the medical management of cancer-related anemia, particularly with respect to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend adhering to the approved labels of the individual products for dosing:

- **Epoetins alpha, beta, and zeta**: 450 IU/week/kg body weight
- **Darbepoetin alpha**: 6.75 mcg/kg body weight every 3 weeks or 2.25 mcg/kg body weight weekly
- **Epoetin theta**: 20,000 IU once weekly

### Retacrit [^112PAxUG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy, consider the hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness, and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every four weeks; decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments. If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g. more than 1 g/dL in any two-week period), reduce the dose of Retacrit by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses. For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after four weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.

For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Retacrit dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia and discontinue Retacrit if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate Retacrit treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Retacrit. The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg three times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously; the intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

### Understanding the clinical implications of differences between glucose management indicator and glycated haemoglobin [^111Cy3rP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratory-measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes and correlates with their risk of long-term complications. The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has highlighted limitations of HbA1c testing. HbA1c can only be reviewed infrequently and can mask the risk of hypoglycaemia or extreme glucose fluctuations. While CGM provides insights into the risk of hypoglycaemia as well as daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate an estimated HbA1c that has been used as a substitute for laboratory HbA1c. However, it is evident that estimated HbA1c and HbA1c values can differ widely.

The glucose management indicator (GMI), calculated exclusively from CGM data, has been proposed. It uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c, but is based on short-term average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure. HbA1c and GMI values differ in up to 81% of individuals by more than ± 0.1% and by more than ± 0.3% in 51% of cases. Here, we review the factors that define these differences, such as the time period being assessed, the variation in glycation rates, and factors such as anaemia and haemoglobinopathies. Recognizing and understanding the factors that cause differences between HbA1c and GMI is an important clinical skill.

In circumstances when HbA1c is elevated above GMI, further attempts at intensification of therapy based solely on the HbA1c value may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. The observed difference between GMI and HbA1c also informs the important question about…

### The controversy surrounding hemoglobin and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: What should we do now [^116JaVN7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been intensely debated over the past two years. The use of ESAs has significantly transformed the lives of millions of patients with CKD by reducing the need for blood transfusions and improving quality of life. However, randomized trials have suggested that targeting higher hematocrit or hemoglobin levels, or exposure to high doses of ESAs, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a boxed warning for ESAs. Additionally, the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) has reduced the recommended target hemoglobin ranges for ESA therapy. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have also decreased ESA dosing recommendations in the Medicare claims policy for ESAs. Managing anemia in CKD amidst the current controversy over hemoglobin levels and ESA use requires targeting appropriate hemoglobin levels, utilizing the lowest effective ESA dose, and better managing ESA hyporesponsiveness.

### Individualizing anaemia treatment: A discussion of case histories [^114V7r2Z]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines provide evidence-based advice on managing anaemia in patients with renal disease; however, they do not consider individual patient needs. Tailoring anaemia management to each patient remains a challenge for the treating physician. Two case studies are described to illustrate key factors to consider.

- **Haemoglobin targets**: The first case emphasizes that haemoglobin (Hb) targets recommended in guidelines may not suit all patients. The patient had been stably maintained on subcutaneous epoetin therapy with an average Hb concentration of > 13.0 g/dl because he developed angina symptoms when his Hb level fell to 12.2 g/dl. Iron deficiency was identified as the likely cause of the falling Hb. After increasing the patient's iron supplementation, his Hb level was normalized back to > 13.0 g/dl without increasing the epoetin dose, and the angina symptoms were resolved.

- **Pre-dialysis patients**: The second case involved a pre-dialysis patient with diabetes, who required a higher dose of epoetin after beginning concomitant antihypertensive treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Previously, the treatment of renal anaemia in pre-dialysis patients has not been the focus of attention. Two ongoing randomized controlled trials have been designed to study early initiation of epoetin treatment in pre-dialysis patients and will provide much-needed information in this area.

### The new FDA labeling for ESA — implications for patients and providers [^117LcAtM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent clinical trials comparing the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) targeting low hemoglobin levels (generally 90–115 g/L) and near-normal hemoglobin targets (generally > 130 g/L) in patients with chronic kidney disease have shown no improvements in clinical outcomes, except for a small reduction in transfusions. Furthermore, there is potential harm associated with ESAs targeting near-normal hemoglobin targets.

Based on these results, the US Food and Drug Administration recently released modified recommendations for more conservative dosing of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. These recommendations now emphasize individualizing therapy for each patient and using the lowest possible ESA dose necessary to reduce the need for transfusions.

The evolution in the management of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease over time and the recent evidence that has stimulated these labeling changes is discussed. Additionally, areas of controversy regarding the FDA's labeling changes are highlighted. Although the FDA's labeling changes are based on the results of recent large randomized trials testing ESAs targeting near-normal hemoglobin levels, more specific guidance for clinicians would have been helpful.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%, to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs, and offers uncertain benefits in return. We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being, healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

### Should A1C targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines generally include a proviso for patients who do not meet the A1C goal to be followed every 2–3 months. This enables adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen and indicates that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice for the vast majority of patients. The progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C can be challenging to maintain, and only 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year. Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines, with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy may not have been as effective.

### A rationale for an individualized haemoglobin target [^112AcvYZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO, epoetin) for more than a decade in treating renal anaemia, considerable debate remains over the optimal target haemoglobin (Hb) levels. European and North American guidelines, based on decade-old trials, aim for partial anaemia correction with a subnormal target Hb concentration. More recent randomized clinical trials examining the effect of normalizing Hb levels have produced conflicting results.

A study in the United States involving patients with existing congestive heart failure or ischaemic heart disease showed an unexpected rise in cardiac mortality and haemodialysis access failure with higher Hb levels. In contrast, three other studies conducted in Australia, Spain, and Canada, which normalized Hb levels in healthier dialysis patients, observed improvements in quality of life and exercise capacity and a slower progression of left ventricular dilatation, without an unacceptable increase in the incidence of adverse effects. These studies indicate that while higher Hb levels may be detrimental to patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, healthier patients benefit from normalized Hb levels.

Thus, there is no clear scientific rationale for setting a single Hb target for all patients, and individualized treatment targets would appear to be a more logical and patient-centered approach.

### Iron replacement therapy: Do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are due to iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen about when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Numerous guidelines are available, but none provide detailed information about therapeutic start and end points, or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency and any concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

The study points to major issues that should be considered in future guideline revisions for optimal iron replacement therapy. These include assessing the need for treatment, determining when to start and stop treatment, establishing when to follow-up for relapse, and deciding on the recommended dosage and type of therapy. It also raises the question of whether some patients should not receive treatment.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114QSS9c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

We recommend that the initial ESA dose should be determined by the patient's Hb level, the target Hb level, the observed rate of increase in Hb level, and clinical circumstances. For the initiation of ESA therapy, several points are to be considered:

- **Type(s) of licensed ESAs available**: Consider the options available for use.

- **Initial ESA dose**: Determine based on individual patient needs and conditions.

- **ESA dose adjustment**: Consider the dose required for Hb correction versus maintenance.

- **Route of ESA administration**: Choose the most effective route based on patient needs.

- **Frequency of ESA administration**: Ensure the frequency best fits the patient's requirements and achieves maximal convenience.

- **Patient monitoring**: Monitor for the anticipated response in terms of Hb rise, rate of Hb rise, and possible adverse effects (e.g. hypertension).

In general, the aim of initial ESA therapy is to achieve a rate of increase in Hb levels of 10 to 20 g/L per month. This rate of rise is considered safe, as evidenced by interventional trials on ESA naive patients. In CKD patients with initial Hb levels less than the target range, these trials have shown the mean initial rate of Hb level increase to be in the range of 7 to 25 g/L in the first four weeks. The rate of Hb increase is affected by the patient population, iron status, initial ESA dose, and the frequency and route of ESA administration.

### Individualizing target haemoglobin concentrations — tailoring treatment for renal anaemia [^1165LGrz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of National Kidney Foundation and European Best Practice Guidelines, there is still uncertainty among nephrologists regarding the optimum target haemoglobin (Hb) concentration for patients treated with erythropoietin. For most patients, the target Hb concentration is 11–12 g/dl, resulting in only partial correction of anaemia. However, there is a link between subnormal Hb concentration and the development of cardiovascular disease. Thus, it may be more beneficial to normalize Hb, although this has to be balanced against the concern that full correction of anaemia may result in adverse effects, such as hypertension and progression of renal disease.

There is increasing evidence that it may be appropriate to treat each patient individually and to tailor treatment according to a number of physiological and lifestyle variables, avoiding higher Hb concentrations in certain patient groups (such as those with cardiac problems). This was supported by the results of a survey of nephrologists and specialists in the field of renal anaemia. It was generally agreed that a higher target Hb concentration (12–14 g/dl) might be appropriate for a fit, young patient with no significant co-morbidity, whereas a lower target Hb (10–12 g/dl) might be appropriate for an elderly patient with multiple medical problems.

In conclusion, guidelines for target Hb in the US and Europe are probably not applicable to all patients. It is important that renal anaemia patients are considered as individuals and their treatment tailored accordingly.

### Continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring: A measured response to a critical review [^1175zjQv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

In a systematic evaluation of 450 studies and 494 clinical scenarios, investigators reported that: "Decisions to transfuse RBCs are often based on unsubstantiated Hb level or hematocrit 'triggers'". The authors concluded that 59% of transfusions actually reduced "well-being" defined as the health of the transfusion recipient (and therefore were considered inappropriate) and 29% had no benefit.

Clinicians are even less aware of the costs of blood transfusions than the potential risks. Although the acquisition cost of a unit of blood varies between $200 and $250 in most hospitals, activity-based costing that considers all of the other costs associated with administering blood reveals a total cost between $522 and $1,183 per unit, and probably more when adjusted for inflation and other factors.

Given the risks and costs of RBC transfusions, there is a growing recognition of the need for strategies to reduce unnecessary transfusions. The American Medical Association's Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement and the Joint Commission, with the participation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently identified RBC transfusions as one of the top five overused procedures in medicine. The Joint Commission has also introduced measures that track the appropriateness of RBC transfusion as a continuous quality indicator.

### Target-based anemia management with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (risks and benefits relearned) and iron (still more to learn) [^111qGRWh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

The FDA first licensed erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for use in patients with ESRD in 1989. Hemoglobin targets for treatment with ESAs were established at the outset on the basis of descriptive pre-ESA literature and Phase I-III data in patients with ESRD. Post-release literature in ESA-treated patients, accumulating over time, initially supported improvement in indices of both cardiovascular and other organ functions, as well as quality of life with therapy. Recommended treatment targets for hemoglobin evolved further in the United States, through four iterations of evidence- and opinion-based practice guidelines appearing between 1997 and 2007. Several randomized controlled trials published from 1998 to 2009 examined the normalization and near-normalization of hemoglobin in patients with both ESRD and CKD; they raised fundamental questions as to the safety of robust correction of anemia.

These findings, taken together with subsequent actions of the FDA in ESA labeling and CMS's quality expectations for hemoglobin in payment for dialysis treatments, resulted in a comprehensive reassessment of the hemoglobin targets in ESA therapy. A marked decrease in both national ESA utilization and hemoglobin attainment has ensued as a result. This discussion addresses the history of the striking changes in enthusiasm for hemoglobin-targeted anemia therapy from 1989 to the present, and similarly examines the evolution of ferritin-targeted iron administration, which has followed different — and markedly slower — historical development.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: Problems and solutions. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels. To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base. The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline-developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources in generating a common evidence report, whose recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally. This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### September 2007 update on EORTC guidelines and anemia management with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [^111NVm1v]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia is frequently experienced by cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and can negatively impact the patient's prognosis. Blood transfusions, iron supplementation (in absolute or functionally iron-deficient anemias), and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are among the treatment options for anemia. Treatment options for anemia management should be selected based on the best benefit-to-risk ratio for each individual patient.

In September 2007, the working party of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) updated their guidelines on the use of ESAs, which are summarized in this paper. ESAs reduce the number of transfusions required and significantly improve quality of life in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. A sustained hemoglobin level of about 12 g/dl should be the target for treatment with ESAs. ESAs should be used according to the EORTC guidelines and within label with carefully considered exceptions.

### A need for an individualized approach to end-stage renal disease patients [^1136YkrK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). High credibility.

Evidence suggests that an individualized and flexible approach may be beneficial to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This article discusses this approach in relation to three issues: target haemoglobin (Hb) level, epoetin dosing frequency/administration, and patient management/education programmes.

Trial data indicate that each patient's condition should be considered when assigning target Hb values. Normalization of Hb is unlikely to be protective in patients with well-established cardiac disease. However, in patients without severe cardiac conditions, normalization is associated with benefits, such as the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors and improved quality of life. Data are awaited from trials examining the impact of anemia correction in patients not yet on renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Two large, randomized controlled trials of haemodialysis patients have demonstrated that once-weekly epoetin beta is as effective and well tolerated as administration two or three times weekly. Additionally, one of these trials showed that once-weekly and three-times-weekly administrations were therapeutically equivalent in terms of maintaining both stable hematocrit levels and epoetin beta dose requirements. These results suggest that the epoetin beta route and frequency of administration can be individualized according to patient and physician preference.

Renal management programmes, which incorporate a multidisciplinary team approach, strategies for the early referral of patients, and patient education, have an impact on patient outcomes and on RRT modality choice.

### Society for the advancement of blood management administrative and clinical standards for patient blood management programs. 4th edition (pediatric version) [^111hqmjv]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). High credibility.

Patient Blood Management (PBM) is the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain hemoglobin concentration, optimize hemostasis, and minimize blood loss to improve patient outcomes. Conceptually similar to a "bundle" strategy, PBM aims to improve clinical care by utilizing comprehensive evidence-based treatment strategies to manage patients with potential or ongoing critical bleeding, bleeding diathesis, critical anemia, and/or coagulopathy. PBM includes multimodal strategies to screen, diagnose, and properly treat anemia and coagulopathies. It minimizes bleeding by using goal-directed therapy and leverages a patient's physiological ability to adapt to anemia while definitive treatment is pursued.

Allogeneic blood component transfusion is one traditional therapeutic modality among many for managing blood loss and anemia. While it may be the best choice in certain situations, other effective and more appropriate options are available and should be used in conjunction with, or instead of, transfusion. Therefore, comprehensive PBM is the new standard of care to prevent and manage anemia and optimize hemostasis. It has been recommended by the World Health Organization, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the European Society of Anaesthesiology, and the Australian National Blood Authority. Although numerous expert consensus and good practice guidelines for blood component transfusion are published by multiple professional organizations and societies, there remains a need for more comprehensive and broader strategic guidelines.

### The optimal hemoglobin in dialysis patients- a critical review [^114XgVFc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

The introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment has been one of the most important advances in the treatment of dialysis patients and others with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment of CKD anemia has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusions and improve quality of life. However, the target hemoglobin level in treating patients is currently controversial due to the recent publication of two randomized controlled studies in nondialysis CKD patients, the CREATE and CHOIR studies, as well as an accompanying meta-analysis. These studies demonstrate an increased risk for death and cardiovascular complications when aiming for a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of > 12 g/dl. In light of this new data, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative anemia guidelines are being revised, and the Food and Drug Administration has issued a Black Box warning indicating that hemoglobin levels should not exceed 12 g/dl.

While observational data suggest a benefit for higher hemoglobin levels, these studies have limitations because of their retrospective design and the potential effect of confounding factors. Hence, reliance on observational studies to guide CKD anemia treatment is a potentially flawed and hazardous process. We propose that the literature does not support an upper Hgb target above 12 g/dl. We also suggest that the reimbursement system for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment potentially encourages unsafe overtreatment.

### Age and anemia management: Relationship of hemoglobin levels with mortality might differ between elderly and nonelderly hemodialysis patients [^113W6NVu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Low hemoglobin (Hb) levels have been associated with cardiovascular events, mortality, health-related quality of life, or physical activities in many observational studies on hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, randomized controlled trials have indicated that normal Hb values are not necessarily associated with better survival among the HD population and predialysis patients. Therefore, anemia control is one of the most important factors in the management of HD patients.

The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) is an international observational study. The cohort has provided a wide range of information concerning clinical outcomes, practice patterns, and HD treatment itself. The DOPPS has included several studies on anemia management, which have indicated that low Hb levels may be associated with adverse outcomes.

The epidemiology of the HD population has been changing worldwide, with the elderly HD population growing. Older individuals experience a high incidence of cardiovascular complications and reduced levels of activity in daily life. It is known that increased Hb does not necessarily improve prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Moreover, many elderly patients have low Hb levels despite receiving high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Thus, there could be some specific differences in the Hb target for such HD patients.

Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether the Hb target for optimal anemia control in the elderly population differs from that in the nonelderly HD population.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^114dG39x]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

After identifying potential causes, the primary aim is to treat with the most specific agent. For instance, potential iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is addressed first. Any uncontrolled comorbid inflammatory illness should be appropriately managed. Anemia can often be attributed to remaining causes, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), after the sequential exclusion or optimal management of other conditions. For residual anemia with CKD, adherence to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines on hemoglobin threshold and targets for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is essential. Importantly, the goal is not to normalize hemoglobin levels when using ESAs; initiation occurs at a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL to minimize cardiovascular complications.

Given the patient's history of bariatric surgery, anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI), and CKD anemia, nutritional optimization was continued with vitamin B12 injections, intravenous iron therapy was initiated to maintain ferritin levels between 300 and 500 ng/mL, and ESA, due to a stable hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, was deferred. Symptoms of fatigue and exercise tolerance substantially improved.

- **Case 3 educational points**: Anemia in older adults is often multifactorial and should be evaluated and managed with a sequential approach. Nutritional deficiencies should be corrected and maintained, with special attention to ensuring adequate iron stores in patients treated with ESAs. Managing ACI involves addressing the underlying chronic inflammatory conditions whenever possible.

### Hemoglobin control, ESA resistance, and regular low-dose IV iron therapy: a review of the evidence [^115jcKeA]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia management in hemodialysis patients has progressed following the introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and intravenous (IV) iron. However, maintaining a stable hemoglobin (Hb) level can be challenging. Patient comorbidities and variable dosage administrations of ESA therapy can lead to significant variability in Hb concentrations over time. Fluctuating Hb levels are associated with increased complications. This article reviews factors that affect Hb control, with a focus on management practices, such as regular low-dose administration of IV iron, that can help improve anemia management.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^114JCsrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit.

- **Standard parameters of iron deficiency**: The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate iron deficiency, as the presence of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can cause it to be normal or low.

- **Iron metabolism parameters for diagnosis**: A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:
	- **Iron stores**: monitored by serum ferritin
	- **Iron transport**: assessed through transferrin saturation
	- **Iron utilization**: evaluated by erythropoiesis, i.e. the proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be

### Anemia management in dialysis patients: A pivot and a new path [^116C92zy]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

We will examine future options in the management of anemia in dialysis patients, focusing on recent trials in iron supplementation and alternatives to erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs).

- **Recent findings**: We review the literature on erythropoietin-stimulating agents, focusing on the risk benefits of various options available. We discuss a recent practice-changing trial in iron supplementation in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease and explore research on alternatives to ESA-stimulating agents, primarily hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs).

- **Summary**: ESAs constitute the mainstay of treatment for anemia in dialysis, and evidence does not support the preference of any one type over another. However, concerns exist about the cardiovascular safety of supra-physiological ESA levels. Iron supplementation has been shown to be a well-tolerated method to decrease ESA doses while maintaining hemoglobin levels. Recent evidence should prompt a revisiting of the guidelines for iron supplementation. HIF-PHIs are potentially safe alternatives to ESAs that correct and maintain hemoglobin while maintaining physiological levels of erythropoietin. Ongoing phase III trials for these drugs will likely answer questions regarding their long-term safety.

### Hemoglobin level variability: Anemia management among variability groups [^117VVEcU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin level variability in hemodialysis patients is common and has been associated with comorbidity, inter-illness, and mortality risk. We aimed to describe the influence of anemia management interventions, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), intravenous iron, and transfusions, on hemoglobin variability.

- **Methods**: We studied all Medicare primary payer hemodialysis patients who survived and had ESA claims in the first six months of 2004 (n = 159,720). Monthly hemoglobin values were categorized as low (≤ 10.5 g/dl), intermediate (10.6–12.4 g/dl), or high (> 12.5 g/dl). Variability groups were classified based on the lowest and highest hemoglobin categories during a six-month observation period. ESA, intravenous iron, and transfusion use were characterized by variability group.

- **Results**: Patients with consistently low or low and intermediate hemoglobin received the highest ESA doses and the most frequent transfusions, while patients with consistently or intermittently intermediate or high hemoglobin received lower ESA doses and fewer transfusions. Intravenous iron doses were highest initially for patients with consistently high hemoglobin; these doses subsequently declined. Iron doses were lowest for patients with consistently intermediate hemoglobin.

- **Conclusions**: Anemia management protocols describing coordinated administration of ESAs and iron may help to increase the number of patients achieving target hemoglobin levels.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UK Kidney Association 2025 guidelines recommend achieving hemoglobin levels between 95 and 115 g/L in children under 2 years of age with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those receiving dialysis on ESA therapy. This reflects the lower normal range in that age group.

### Cancer- and chemotherapy-induced anemia [^1172zQxQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is prevalent in 30% to 90% of patients with cancer. It can be corrected by either treating the underlying cause or providing supportive care through transfusion with packed red blood cells or administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), with or without iron supplementation. Recent studies showing detrimental health effects of ESAs have sparked a series of FDA label revisions and significantly altered the perception of these once commonly used agents. In light of this, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for cancer- and chemotherapy-induced anemia underwent substantial revisions this year. The purpose of these NCCN Guidelines is twofold: (1) to operationalize the evaluation and treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients, with an emphasis on those who are receiving concomitant chemotherapy, and (2) to enable patients and clinicians to individualize anemia treatment options based on patient condition.

### Safety update on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: trials within and outside the accepted indications [^11266LMM]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Certain studies in which erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been given not with the aim of correcting anemia but to achieve higher target levels of hemoglobin have shown significantly poorer survival among treated patients. However, studies in which ESAs were administered with the aim of reducing the need for RBC transfusions in patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia demonstrate that the use of these agents is not associated with any adverse effect on survival when compared with placebo controls. We can therefore be reassured that using ESAs within the labeled indications will not adversely affect patient outcome.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111R9NXw]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

In terms of medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines advise applying the hemoglobin target range exclusively to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are receiving ESAs. It is important to note that this target range is not intended for the treatment of iron deficiency in patients who are receiving iron therapy without the use of ESAs.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess, and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands.

When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required between achieving a reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and between what is achievable and the degree of benefit gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to account for the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidities, social environment, understanding of the steps required, and level of commitment to the treatment.

Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goals. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs, and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables — fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein — are discussed in terms of their convenience and effectiveness in diabetes management.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: A call to action [^111iDNqp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendations for treatment

Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are mainly for anemic patients receiving ESA and not for those with iron deficiency (ID) alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); failure to correct anemia within 4 weeks should lead to consideration of functional ID. Intravenous iron is recommended in functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%) in patients on ESA therapy.

According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20% regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L and in the absence of an inflammatory state (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

Knowledge gaps

ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients, and guidelines recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is generally considered only a supportive care treatment, combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID with or without anemia in the early phases of cancer in patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this setting. Although iron therapy is recommended in patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered a promising target in cancer progression because it facilitates cell proliferation and growth.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn [^1171YrrQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Partial correction of anemia with routine use of recombinant erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents (ESA) over the past three decades has significantly improved quality of life in most end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This improvement includes reducing the need for blood transfusions and anemia‐related morbidities. ESA use frequently leads to functional iron deficiency, termed iron‐restricted anemia, due to massive transfer of stored iron to erythroid progenitor cells and inadequate iron mobilization from repleted stores. This is related to high levels of hepcidin, together with true iron deficiency due to blood loss associated with the hemodialysis procedure, uremic enteropathy, and blood sampling. True iron deficiency is a major clinical concern, giving rise to ESA resistance, impaired cellular function, and aggravated cardiac insufficiency, which is frequently encountered in this setting.

Intravenous (IV) iron is typically administered during dialysis sessions, with almost all ESA‐treated hemodialysis patients receiving parenteral iron to restore the body iron pool before and during ESA therapy. Iron therapy, alongside ESA, is considered the mainstay of anemia treatment in ESRD. Iron metabolism is a closed system, critically regulated by hepcidin without any excretory mechanisms for excess iron. As a result, iron levels in ESRD patients chronically treated with IV iron products may exceed ongoing blood losses, exposing them to an increased risk of positive iron balance. These twin risks of iron deficiency and iron overload must be managed carefully in clinical settings.

### Higher hemoglobin levels and quality of life in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: No longer a moving target [^115d8Nyb]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease suggest target hemoglobin levels ≤ 11.5 g/dL (115 g/L), with individualized consideration of slightly higher hemoglobin targets to improve quality of life. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials demonstrates no significant improvement in quality of life with erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy targeting higher hemoglobin levels. Limitations of the available data suggest that individualized targets should nonetheless remain an option in future clinical practice guidelines.

### The background and methodology of the anaemia cancer treatment (A.C.T.) study: A global retrospective study of practice patterns and outcomes in the management of anaemia in cancer patients and their congruence with evidence-based guidelines [^115XNuWQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The benefit of supportive care with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for patients with cancer-related anaemia is well known. However, the European Cancer Anaemia Survey (ECAS, data from 2001) showed that about 60% of cancer patients with anaemia do not receive any treatment. Since ECAS, evidence-based guidelines have provided recommendations for ESA use, but it is not known to what extent treatment patterns follow these guidelines. To address this issue, the anaemia cancer treatment (A.C.T.) study was initiated. The background to the development of the A.C.T. study and study methodology are described.

- **Materials and methods**: The A.C.T. study is a global, retrospective, pharmacoepidemiologic study of at least 2,560 medical records of anaemic patients with cancer who were previously treated with an ESA from a minimum of 186 centres. Records from patients aged greater than or equal to 18 years with a diagnosis of solid tumour, myeloma, or lymphoma and who were started on ESAs 3–12 months before inclusion and followed for 8–10 weeks will be eligible. Factors associated with ESA non-responsiveness will also be evaluated.

- **Main results**: Completion of the European phase of the study is anticipated in late 2007, with the rest of the world closing in late 2007 or early 2008. Publication of findings is anticipated in 2008.

- **Conclusions**: By examining the extent to which anaemia management in clinical practice is congruent with best practice guidelines, the A.C.T. study will provide a further foundation for the development of evidence-based supportive cancer care.

### Pharmacist collaborative practice agreement for the management of anemia in malignant disease with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [^11597zo1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) reduce transfusions and increase hemoglobin levels in patients with anemia of malignant disease. A medication guideline and pharmacist collaborative practice agreement (CPA) were developed and implemented to standardize the ESA prescribing workflow. The use of ESAs in malignant diseases, in accordance with institutional guidelines, was evaluated to ensure safe and efficacious use.

An observational study was conducted on all ESA doses given throughout a health system's cancer clinics prior to and after implementation of an ESA guideline and pharmacist CPA. The primary outcome measured was ESA therapy initiated in accordance with guidelines before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes evaluated were nurse and pharmacist satisfaction, vitals recorded prior to dosing, and transfusion rates in patients receiving ESA therapy before and after the intervention.

In the pre-implementation group, criteria for initiation were not met by any of the 39 patients. Prior to therapy, 5.1% of patients had not had hemoglobin drawn, 23% of patients had no iron studies completed, and 29.4% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients had no erythropoietin levels drawn. In the post-implementation group, prior to therapy, all patients had hemoglobin levels drawn, 16.67% did not have iron studies completed, and all MDS patients had erythropoietin levels drawn appropriately. Chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) patients in the pre-implementation group had 71.4% compliance with receiving chemotherapy within 8 weeks of ESA dose.

### Managing anemia in for-profit dialysis chains: When ethics and business conflict [^117ME21e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of anemia in dialysis patients improves patient well-being and reduces the need for transfusions. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that normalization of hemoglobin via erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) would improve cardiovascular health and survival has largely been refuted by randomized trials showing increased cardiac events and mortality with higher hemoglobin targets and higher doses of ESAs.

Given these observations, one would expect restraint in ESA use. However, profits for dialysis facilities depend greatly on charging insurers for medications, and ESAs are the most profitable. Consequently, for-profit dialysis chains have an incentive to use high ESA doses. This practice was supported by the 2006 and 2007 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative anemia guidelines, both of which promote higher hemoglobin targets and greater ESA use than the FDA and European Medicines Agency recommend.

Under a Medicare bundled payment system in 2011, ESAs will move from being profitable to being an expense, and for-profit dialysis centers will have motivation to reduce the use of ESAs and other medications. Nephrologists, as caregivers and dialysis facility medical directors, have an ethical responsibility to protect the health and welfare of patients under all payment systems. This article reviews the financial and ethical issues involved in the treatment of dialysis-related anemia and offers recommendations for maintaining ethical patient-centered anemia management.

### Patient blood management in Europe [^113GaPrz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

ESA therapy may be used within PBM strategies. ESA increases Hb and reduces the need for transfusion in patients undergoing orthopedic and cardiac surgeries. It has been suggested that ESA should be used in anemic patients in whom iron deficiency anemia has been ruled out or corrected. Iron supplementation plus ESA corrected normocytic anemia due to chronic disease in preoperative orthopedic surgery patients; this can lead to increased transfusion avoidance. Patients should receive iron supplementation (preferably i.v.) throughout the use of ESA to avoid functional iron deficiency.

A recent study evaluated a blood conservation protocol involving a restrictive transfusion trigger (Hb < 8 g dl−1) and perioperative administration of i.v. iron with (n = 115) or without (n = 81) ESA in patients undergoing hip fracture repair. Patients who received ESA therapy together with i.v. iron had a significantly lower allogeneic transfusion rate (60% vs 42%, P = 0.013) and higher postoperative Hb than those who received iron alone, but there was no difference in postoperative complications or 30-day mortality rate. The combination of a restrictive Hb trigger, i.v. iron, and ESA reduced the use of ABT in patients (n = 139) undergoing TKR surgery. In this study, patients who received unwashed shed blood after operation (if their preoperative Hb was < 13.0 g dl−1), in addition to ESA and i.v. iron, showed a significantly reduced hospital stay compared with those who received i.v. iron and ESA alone (P < 0.05). A more conservative use has been advocated because of concerns about side-effects of ESAs.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1116a8o1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

All patients should be assessed for evidence of hemodynamic compromise and low hemoglobin levels. The decision to transfuse should take into account the hemoglobin level, but practitioners should keep in mind that transfusion may carry the risks of complications. This decision should be weighed carefully for each individual patient. As common sense dictates, hypovolemic patients with acute massive blood loss who may only show a spuriously small drop in hemoglobin on presentation should be managed proactively according to the hemoglobin levels that are anticipated to show following volume resuscitation. Similarly, a higher target level of hemoglobin should be pursued in patients who have low tolerance to anemia because of comorbidities such as coronary artery disease and cardiac or renal failure. More research is necessary before sound recommendations can be made about the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion and the target hemoglobin levels.

- **Risk stratification, management of co-morbidities, and time to endoscopy**: Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding have other medical co-morbidities which can affect their outcomes. Anticoagulation, in particular, is a treatment for many medical conditions, and recent guidelines recommend the reversal of coagulopathy when it is identified; they note, however, that reversal should not delay endoscopy.

There exists general consensus that patients presenting with upper GI bleeding should be considered for risk stratification using an evidence-based scoring system such as the Rockall score or the Blatchford score.

### Maintaining control over haemoglobin levels: Optimizing the management of anaemia in chronic kidney disease [^115VTpZ8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents radically advanced the management of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The European Best Practice Guidelines recommend that most patients with CKD achieve a target haemoglobin (Hb) level of ≥ 11 g/dL to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. The optimal upper Hb level has not been determined and will likely vary among CKD patient populations. Recently reported studies show evidence that normalizing Hb to approximately 14 g/dL in CKD may increase the risk of adverse events, highlighting the importance of the upper Hb target.

Most patients can achieve target Hb levels with proper treatment. However, recent studies have demonstrated that while average Hb levels may fall within desired targets, the Hb levels of many patients are not being adequately controlled; their Hb levels are not consistently maintained within a specified target range over time. Furthermore, data indicate that failing to control Hb levels over time may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality.

This review discusses the challenges in controlling Hb in the CKD patient population, particularly in haemodialysis patients.

- **Factors affecting Hb control over time**: Various factors affect Hb control over time and will be considered, as well as the clinical criteria for its assessment. Although challenging, control of Hb is manageable and has potential clinical benefits.
