## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best characterizes the relationship between Nubian civilization and Egyptian civilization, with choices ranging from Nubia predating and spurring Egypt, to Mesopotamian colonization, to development in response but not imitation of Egypt, to no contact with neighbors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chronological relationship between Nubia and Egypt. Then, I should verify the nature of cultural exchange and whether it amounted to imitation. Next, I will examine the plausibility of Mesopotamian colonization in Nubia. After that, I need to check evidence for contacts with neighboring cultures. Finally, I will weigh the options against the archaeological record and choose the best fit, noting any nuances I might be missing.

> Let me first confirm the timing, because if Nubia predates Egypt, that would support Option A, but if they are roughly contemporary or Egypt slightly earlier, that would undermine it. Wait, let me verify the archaeological sequence: both Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia show complex societies emerging in the late Neolithic and early dynastic periods, with no clear evidence that a unified Nubian state predated the rise of the Egyptian state; in fact, early Egyptian unification under Narmer/Menes slightly precedes the earliest documented Nubian kingdoms, so Option A's claim that Nubia predated and spurred Egypt is not supported by the chronology.

> Next, I should review the nature of cultural interaction, since Option C hinges on whether Nubia developed in response to Egypt but did not simply imitate it. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: Nubia and Egypt engaged in long-term trade, diplomacy, conflict, and intermarriage, and Nubian elites adopted Egyptian motifs, writing, and religious forms while also maintaining distinct Nubian traditions, architecture, and political structures; this pattern fits "response to, but not imitation of" rather than wholesale copying or passive dependency, so Option C aligns better with the evidence than a binary of either pure independence or mere mimicry.

> I will now examine Option B, which proposes Mesopotamian colonization of Nubia. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the geographic and historical plausibility: Mesopotamia is in the Near East, separated from Nubia by vast deserts and the Levant, and there is no credible archaeological evidence of Mesopotamian colonies in Nubia; any Mesopotamian influence on Egypt was indirect and limited, and there is even less reason to posit colonization south of Egypt, so Option B is not supported.

> Option D claims Nubia had no contacts with neighboring cultures. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking trade or migration evidence. The archaeological record shows continuous contact between Nubia and Egypt, as well as with other Saharan and sub-Saharan groups; Nubia served as a corridor for goods like gold, ivory, and exotic raw materials into Egypt, and Egyptian artifacts appear in Nubian burials from early periods, so "no contacts" is contradicted by abundant material evidence.

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Option A overstates Nubia's precedence and causal role, Option B invents Mesopotamian colonization, and Option D denies well-documented intercultural contact; Option C best captures the dynamic of mutual influence wherein Nubian civilization developed in ongoing interaction with Egypt, adopting and adapting Egyptian elements while retaining a distinct Nubian identity, which matches the archaeological and historical pattern of reciprocal exchange rather than unidirectional dependence or isolation.

---

The correct answer is **C. developed in response to, but not in imitation of, Egyptian culture**. Nubian civilization arose independently in the Nile Valley and, while it interacted extensively with Egypt through trade, warfare, and cultural exchange, it maintained distinct political structures, languages, and artistic traditions. Options A and B are incorrect because Nubia did not predate or spur Egyptian culture, nor was it colonized by Mesopotamia. Option D is false because Nubia had sustained contacts with Egypt and other neighboring cultures.

## Chronological relationship between Nubian and Egyptian civilizations

Nubian civilization **did not predate Egyptian civilization**; both emerged in the Nile Valley, with Egypt's unification occurring around 3100 BCE and Nubian kingdoms such as Kerma developing shortly thereafter. Nubia and Egypt influenced each other through trade, warfare, and cultural exchange, but there is no evidence that Nubia predated or spurred the rise of Egyptian culture.

---

## Influence of Mesopotamian civilization on Nubia

There is **no evidence of Mesopotamian colonization** or direct influence on Nubian civilization. Mesopotamia's influence on Egypt was limited and indirect, primarily through trade and cultural diffusion, and there is no archaeological or historical evidence of Mesopotamian colonization or direct influence in Nubia.

---

## Nubian civilization's relationship with Egyptian culture

Nubian civilization developed in response to interactions with Egypt, but it **did not imitate Egyptian culture**. Nubia maintained distinct political structures, languages, and artistic traditions while engaging in trade, warfare, and cultural exchange with Egypt. Nubian kingdoms such as Kerma and Kush exhibited unique cultural characteristics, including their own burial practices, architectural styles, and religious beliefs.

---

## Contacts with neighboring cultures

Nubia had **extensive contacts with neighboring cultures**, particularly Egypt, as well as with other African civilizations and Mediterranean cultures. These interactions included trade, diplomatic relations, and military conflicts, which significantly influenced Nubian society and culture.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. developed in response to, but not in imitation of, Egyptian culture**. Nubian civilization arose independently in the Nile Valley and, while it interacted extensively with Egypt, it maintained distinct cultural characteristics and did not simply imitate Egyptian culture. Options A, B, and D are incorrect based on archaeological and historical evidence.

D. Contact Frequencies and Durations

D.1. Persons Who Reside at Home

Four age strata are included in the simulation models: 0–4; 5–18; 19–64; and > 65 years. There are 5 types of mixing groups: households, daycare centers, schools, workplaces, and the community (for contacts of long-term care facility [LTCF] residents, see section D.2). For a given mixing group and type of day, and for each combination of 2 strata (i, j) we needed to determine: (i) the number of persons from stratum j contacted in 1 day by a person from stratum i, c ϋ, and (ii) the average total duration per day (in minutes) of all the contacts with 1 person, d ϋ. These numbers are symmetric: c ji - c ϋ and d ji = d ϋ.

D.1.a. Weekdays

Contacts in the household: We assumed that each member of the household contacted every other member, so we did not specify c ϋ 's. Table A3 presents values for the d ϋ 's.

Contacts in daycare centers: c 11 = 6, d 11 = 60. All other contact parameters are zero.

Contacts in schools: c 22 = 10, d 22 = 120. All other contact parameters are zero.

Contacts in workplaces: c 33 = 10, d 33 = 120. All other contact parameters are zero.

Contacts in the community: Table A4 presents the values of (c ϋ, d ϋ). For simplicity, we assume that no contacts occur between children and adults in the community.

D.1.b. Weekend days

On a weekend day, contacts are made only in households and in the community. The weekend values of the d ϋ 's in households and in the community are twice the corresponding weekday values. The community weekend values of the c ϋ 's are twice the corresponding weekday values.

### Using high-resolution contact networks to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control in large-scale multi-day events [^52390c4e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Incorporatingimplicitly extends the contact networks as the contact data was collected over a 3-day sail but the transmission was simulated over a longer timescale of seven days to quantify the differences in outbreak trajectory for events lasting more than 3 days. Nevertheless, we have also performed sensitivity analysis using the actual temporal network to understand how the correlation of contact duration and sequence of contact events could potentially influence the outbreak.

Transmission model

We simulated SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant transmission on the above generated social contact network by extending the individual-based models developed by Firth et al. and Hellewell et al. (Table 3).

For each simulation, we assume that the disease is introduced by one passenger who could be infected up to 14 days prior to the event, with equal probability on any of the days but the onset of the index case would only occur between the start (i.e. day 1) and the end (i.e. day 7) of the event. The distribution of the symptoms onset date, S, on respective day of the event, d, is as follows:where δ is the day of infection prior to the event (i.e. δ = 0 represents the day before the start of event), I (δ) is the probability of being infected on any of the 14 days prior to the event and is fixed at 1/14, θ is the incubation period distribution withrepresenting the time since infection on the respective day of the event.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^99cf8519]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Finally, in the numerical model, we rescale the curves of infectiousness of a factor, which plays a pivotal role. Indeed, the procedure described above for parameter setting is aimed at reconstructing a scenario without restrictions, where the epidemic of COVID-19 is free to spread and is characterized by a reproductive number equal to 3. However, in this work we analyze the effect of isolation and tracing in the context of reemerging epidemics where a number of protective measures are in places, such as face masks and physical distancing. Such measures contribute to mitigate the spreading and enter in our model as an overall reduction of R 0, in a range suggested by recent literature –. This can be obtained by setting the reduction factorto specific values, reported in Supplementary Table 5 in the Supplementary Information.

Design of appropriate policies

As mentioned above, the empirical CNS data set provides us with the opportunity to devise policies for tracing in order to avoid a massive preventive quarantine of the population.

We can classify contacts at a low and high probability of contagion on the basis of thresholds of duration and proximity: only contacts with duration above a threshold T d and Bluetooth signal strength above a threshold T p are considered as at risk and thus stored in the individual's devices (when both individuals in contact have adopted the app). Assuming that the dependence of infectiousness from duration and proximity is unknown, we consider several possible values for the thresholds T d and T p, thus defining multiple possible policies, reported in Fig. 3, from the least to the most restrictive. We also consider two additional policies in Supplementary Note 3.5, corresponding to either close range but short exposure interactions or long-range but long exposure interactions.

### Estimating the contribution of setting-specific contacts to SARS-CoV-2 transmission using digital contact tracing data [^739a748f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In summary, we characterized the contact number per day of tracing under different locations. These social contact patterns can serve as fundamental knowledges, as they were derived based on the intensive contact tracing with confirmed negative contacts. Informed by these social contact patterns, we also evaluated the contribution of different locations to transmission and super-spreading without control measures. These findings suggest that, in comparison to other locations, cospace–time interactions may have a comparatively lower significance if no NPIs were implemented. Our study may provide valuable insights for future pandemic management.

### Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox [^6b2b8436]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for mpox, more specifically with respect to contact tracing, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring contacts passively, actively, or directly depending on available sources:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Passive monitoring|- Provide identified contacts with information on the signs/symptoms to monitor, permitted activities and how to contact the public health department if signs/symptoms develop|
|Active monitoring|- Check at least once daily to see if a person under monitoring has self-reported signs/symptoms|
|Direct monitoring|- Visit the patient physically or examine visually via video for signs of illness at least daily.|

### Improving fragment-based ab initio protein structure assembly using low-accuracy contact-map predictions [^0c6ecfc9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In Supplementary Fig. S3 B, D, we present the accuracy of contact predictions directly against the TM-scores of the final C-QUARK models. While there is still a positive correlation between the TM-score and contact accuracy, it is considerably weaker than that of the contact-contact correlations (with PCC = 0.620 vs 0.793 for all-range contacts). In particular, among the 46 targets whose long-range contacts had low accuracy (< 30%), C-QUARK created correct folds with a TM-score > 0.5 for 20 cases (43%) (Supplementary Fig. S3D). In comparison, for these 46 targets, QUARK only successfully folded 9 proteins with TM-scores > 0.5. These data demonstrate the ability of QUARK to fold protein structures through its inherent fragment assembly procedure combined with fragment-based distance profiles. Furthermore, the number of foldable cases increased by a factor of 2.2 even with low-accuracy contact-maps, showing the effectiveness of C-QUARK at incorporating noisy contact-maps in its folding simulations for ab initio structure prediction.

While accurate contact prediction helps improve the success rate of the ab initio folding simulations, it is also important to incorporate the contacts in the simulations in an efficient way. Since contact predictions with higher confidence scores generally have a higher likelihood of being correct (see Supplementary Fig. S4), our 3 G contact potential (Eq. 1 in Methods) was designed in a way that the well depth is proportional to the confidence score of each predicted contact (Eq. S4 in SI) and therefore the folding simulations primarily satisfy the contacts with higher confidence scores. Accordingly, a strong correlation was observed between the contact satisfaction rate and the accuracy of the predicted contacts with PCCs of 0.847, 0.798, 0.796 and 0.842 for the short-, medium-, long- and all-range contacts, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Such strong correlations in turn lead to a positive correlation between the contact satisfaction rate and the TM-scores of the final models, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, where the PCCs between the TM-scores of the final models and the contact satisfaction rates for all- and long-range contacts were 0.665 and 0.672, respectively.

### The impact of stepfamily structure on older parents' frequency of contact with and care receipt from adult biological and stepchildren in the Netherlands [^51d98d93]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of Contact Frequency

In 35% of the observations, the highest frequency of contact with a child in the family, regardless of whether they were biological or stepchildren, was "every day," in 39% "a few times a week," in 18% "once a week," in 4% "once every two weeks," in 2% "monthly" or less frequently, and in 2% of families none of the children were identified as having "frequent or important" contact. When the respondent had both biological and stepchildren, the highest frequency of contact was often with a biological child (59% of observations), in 22% it was with a stepchild, and in 20% it was with both a biological child and a stepchild. Looking at the least contacted child in a family, the percentages were 9% "every day," 25%, 27%, 12%, 13% "monthly or less" and 14% no "frequent or important" contact, respectively. Thus, in one of the four observations, contact with at least one child was scarce or absent. At the parent level, 114 (3.5%) of the 3,196 respondents with biological children identified none of their biological children as someone with whom they had regular contact and who was also important to them; another three respondents reported never having contact, and 19 respondents said they had contact a few times a year or less. Of the 316 respondents with stepchildren, 138 (44%) identified none of them as a network member, and another 12 respondents had contact a few times a year or less.

Regression of the highest contact frequency shows differences across family structure types (F (241, 11277) = 21.1; p < .001). Parameter estimates are shown in Supplementary Table 2, and marginal probabilities are illustrated in Figure 2. Across observations, 34% of respondents in biological families (reference category) had daily contact. In reconstructed biological families, there was daily contact in 43% (p > .05) of observations among respondents with joint and biological children, and 47% (p > .05) of observations among respondents with joint and stepchildren.

### Deaths, late deaths, and role of infecting dose in Ebola virus disease in sierra leone: retrospective cohort study [^608e5bc4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

To estimate the level of exposure to Ebola virus, we asked household members to describe in their own words what happened when the Ebola infection struck. For each person with Ebola virus disease, we asked what symptoms they had had, who had taken care of them, who helped them with different activities, who shared a bed with them, among other details. We also asked about any external contacts. The aim was to identify the extent of contact with possibly infective body fluids. Using an eight level scale, we assigned the maximum contact level for each person in the household. We predefined this scale on the basis of the available literature and in discussion with frontline health workers working with individuals with Ebola virus disease. Exposure, from the highest to lowest levels, was defined as follows:

Direct contact with, or touching, the body of a person who died of Ebola virus disease
Direct contact with the body fluids of a patient who has Ebola virus disease with wet symptoms (that is, diarrhoea, vomiting, or bleeding)
Direct contact with a patient with wet symptoms (eg, sharing a bed, providing care, embracing, carrying)
Direct contact with a patient with dry symptoms (that is, without wet symptoms)
Indirect contact with a patient with wet symptoms (eg, washing their clothes)
Indirect contact with a patient with dry symptoms
Minimal contact (eg, shared meals)
No known contact

### Social mixing patterns of United States healthcare personnel at a quaternary health center: a prospective observational study [^9eea0edc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Contact matrices

Contacts for HCP were spread across all age ranges (Figure 3). Physical contacts and contacts with patients focused on younger and older ages. Contacts with other HCP were distributed across all working ages regardless of contact type (Supplemental Figure 3). The age-contact matrix of all contacts was not age-assortative: the average within age-group proportion of contact was 21.2% (SD 7.4%).

Figure 3.
The x-axis shows the HCP age with non-working ages grayed out (eg less than 20, greater than 70), and the y-axis shows the estimated contact age. Each tile is filled and colored with the average number of contacts per HCP of that age range with contacts of that age range per day. A horizontal marginal histogram of each contact matrix shows the age distribution of HCP and a vertical marginal histogram shows the age distribution of contacts. Please note each plot has a different scale, this is to preserve the ability to discriminate different values. A: Average contacts of HCP with all individuals per day (n = 2,550). B: Average non-physical contacts per day (n = 1,754). C: Average contacts per HCP with other HCP per day (n = 1,592). D: Average physical contacts per day (n = 462). E: Average direct proximity contacts per day (n = 328). F: Average contacts per HCP with patients per day (n = 570).

Sensitivity analysis

In the June 2022 diary, the total number of summative contacts was compared with the detailed number of daily contacts: in 76.6% of cases this was the same value. In those that differed, 58.5% had more contacts reported in detail than in summative reporting. By paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the null hypothesis that the number of contacts reported in detail and in sum are the same was not rejected (p-value 0.7) (Supplemental Figure 4).

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^28998f25]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Infection rate scenarios.

Growth or decrease rate of the number of newly infected individuals, assuming either that all the infected people can eventually be identified and isolated (a); or that only symptomatic people can be isolated with 20% of asymptomatic infected individuals (b); or that only symptomatic people can be isolated with 40% of asymptomatic infected individuals (c). Infection rates are reported as a function of the isolation efficiency ε I and the tracing efficiency ε T. In all the three settings the cases are reported with a delay of 2 days.

In the following, we assume an alternative scenario where 50% of the asymptomatic individuals are identified by a policy of randomized testing. These, added to the symptomatic individuals, result in a detection of 80% of the total infected cases. We remark that this scenario is equivalent to assuming that asymptomatic individuals account for only 20% of the infected population. Indeed, there is still no agreement in the scientific community about the fraction of asymptomatic infections for COVID-19, and different possible scenarios should be considered(Supplementary Note 1). This is our baseline for the following investigations and the resulting model predictions are plotted in Fig. 1 b.

Note also that we take into account in all settings a delay of 2 days between the detection of an infected individual and the time when this person is actually isolated and contact tracing is implemented. A delay of 3 days is considered in Supplementary Note 3.2.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^8d480ef7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For ε I = 0 and ε T = 0 we obtain a free spreading without control. The quantity of interest, which can be derived by numerically solving the above equations, is the incidenceof newly infected individuals at time t. We use the model to predict the evolution of λ (t) up to time t = 50 days, which is sufficient for the numerical solutions to reach a stationary growth or decline regime (constant growth or decline rate of λ (t)), and we consider the average growth or decline in the last 10 days as an indicator of the long-term behavior of the epidemic. A negative number indicates that the epidemic is declining, while a positive one corresponds to growth (uncontained epidemic).

An important feature of the model is given by the probability s (τ). The ideal case in which all infected individuals can eventually be identified because they exhibit symptoms (s (τ) approaching 1 for large times) is reported in Fig. 1 a: this represents the best-case scenario, considered in the previous studies of this model. Next, we assume instead that 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic –, and that only symptomatic individuals can be identified: no randomized testing is performed. This represents our worst-case scenario. We represent the presence of asymptomatic individuals by considering that the probability of an infected individual to display symptoms is a growing function of time, which however never reaches 1. In this case, the model predicts epidemic containment for the upper half of the range of values of the parameters ε I and ε T (Fig. 1 c).

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^bd53d977]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Observe that the contacts taken into account for the contact tracing are defined according to a given policy's thresholds (distance and duration), i.e. only those interactions with sufficient duration and small enough distance are stored in the contact lists. However, the spreading process can a priori occur between an infected node and any of its neighbors, the probability of a contagion event being given by ω data.

Moreover, the simulation assumes that each individual that is required to quarantine is willing to do so. We consider in Supplementary Note 3.6 the situation where individuals have a decreasing acceptance to comply, based on the number of times that they are asked to quarantine. On the other hand, the compliance to isolation is already modeled by the user-defined parameter ε I, which represents the effective fraction of identified infected who successfully isolate, where the value of this fraction may depend on the health system capacity, but also on the nodes' compliance and the possibility to isolate.

### Stochastic sampling effects favor manual over digital contact tracing [^b458c5b5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The control parameter r = λ / μ is the effective infection rate, whose critical value r C — the epidemic threshold — sets the transition point between the absorbing and the active phase of the epidemic. The increase in the value of r C is an indicator of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Within the adaptive activity-driven framework, the epidemic threshold can be calculated analytically via a mean-field approach (see Methods).

The effect of isolating symptomatic nodes as the only containment measure is shown in Fig. 1 b. We compare the epidemic threshold r C, obtained with the isolation of symptomatic nodes only, with the epidemic thresholdof the non-adaptive (NA) case, in which no containment measures are taken on infected individuals, as a function of γ P / μ (see Methods for the explicit expression). In the case of instantaneous symptoms development (γ P / μ → ∞), the threshold is increased by a factor of 1/(1 − δ), while for smaller γ P / μ the gain is reduced. For example, for (1 − δ) = 0.43, that is 43% of asymptomatic individuals, τ P = 1.5 days and τ = 14 days as observed for SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods for details on the parameters used in all figures), the threshold is doubled by the isolation of symptomatic nodes. This is the baseline reference for the evaluation of the performance of CT strategies.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^e75e3540]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

As of mid-January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 85 million detected cases worldwide, overwhelming the healthcare capacities of many countries and thus presenting extraordinary challenges for governments and societies. Rigorous restrictions such as lockdowns and quarantine have proven to be effective in many countries as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19, limit contagions and reduce the effective reproductive number. Many areas slowly started to lift the restrictions, but new outbreaks appeared again, arriving in waves as anticipated by several early models. An effective and affordable long-term plan is required, since the fraction of the population that has been infected is still far too low to provide herd immunity.

Despite their efficacy, large-scale quarantine and lockdown strategies carry large costs. Moreover, in a situation where most of the population is not infected, population-wide lockdowns are far from optimal, and interventions at smaller scale, selectively targeting individuals at higher risk of spreading the disease, are more desirable.

Categories and definitions of exposed populations

The exposed populations include close contacts, secondary close contacts, and general contacts. The definitions below are in compliance with the 7th edition of the Protocol of Prevention and Control for covid-19 released by the Chinese authorities.

Close contact — mainly refers to the primary close contact: a person who has unprotected close contact with an individual with confirmed or suspected covid-19 within two days before illness onset or with an asymptomatic carrier within two days before sampling. Criteria for a close contact include: Family members living in the same household Direct caregivers or those providing diagnosis, treatment, and nursing Healthcare workers providing medical services that might generate aerosols in the same space Any people sharing a small place, such as an office, workshop, team, elevator, cafeteria, or classroom Any people sharing meals or entertaining together, or providing catering and entertainment services in an enclosed environment Healthcare workers or family members caring for, or visiting, a patient, or any individuals having contact at a short distance Passengers taking the same transport having close contact (within one metre) with an infected person, including attendants and companions (eg family members, colleagues, or friends) Any people exposed to an environment that might be contaminated by an infected person Other people meeting criteria for close contacts as investigated and assessed by on-site investigators
Secondary close contact — a person who has unprotected close contact (being in the same enclosed environment for living, work, a gathering, or entertainment) with a primary close contact.
General contact — a person who has contact with a person with confirmed or suspected covid-19 or an asymptomatic carrier on public transport (eg, airplane, train, ship), or who is living, studying, working together, or seeking medical assistance, but does not meet the criteria for a close contact.

### Improving estimates of social contact patterns for airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens [^6829a0d7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Age-mixing matrices relevant for droplet transmission (A, B), nonsaturating airborne transmission (C, D), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission (F, G) for study of social contact patterns for airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Panels A, C, and F show absolute contact intensities between respondents and contacts in each age group; panels B, D, and G show intensities of contact between each member of each age group; panels E and H show intensities for airborne infections and Mycobacterium tuberculosis compared with intensities for droplet infections, respectively. Numbers shown in panel A are the mean number of contacts respondents in each age group have with contacts in each age group per day. Numbers shown in panel B are the rate of contact between each person in the population per day, expressed as rates × 10 5. Numbers and rates in panels C, D, F, and G are standardized so that the mean overall contact intensity by reported by adult respondents is the same as the mean number of overall close contacts reported by adult respondents (panel A). Contact numbers between child respondents and contacts in each age group were estimated from data on contact between adult respondents and child contacts.

Estimated contact patterns by age did not vary greatly between the infection types in either community. However, age-mixing patterns were less assortative in the nonsaturating airborne and M. tuberculosis matrices compared with the droplet matrices in both communities (Appendix). The exception to this pattern was contact between persons 15–19 years of age in KwaZulu-Natal, which was more intense in the nonsaturating airborne and M. tuberculosis matrices than the droplet matrices. In both communities, relative to other adult age groups, overall contact intensities were lower in persons > 50 years of age when considering contact relevant for nonsaturating airborne transmission or the transmission of M. tuberculosis compared with contact relevant for droplet transmission.

### Contact-tracing outcomes among household contacts of fully vaccinated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: san francisco, California, 29 January-2 July 2021 [^6e33b9cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, 20 secondary cases were diagnosed among household contacts of 14 fully vaccinated index patients (Figure 2). In 9 households, the index patient transmitted to 1 contact and in the 5 other households, the index patient transmitted to more than 1 contact. Among 83 index patients who were fully vaccinated with mRNA vaccine, 8 (10%) transmitted to 3 unvaccinated and 6 fully vaccinated household contacts. In contrast, among 23 index patients who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 6 (27%) transmitted to 5 unvaccinated contacts and 6 vaccinated contacts who had also received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. No transmission from 14 asymptomatic fully vaccinated index patients to household contacts was observed. In addition, no transmissions were found among tested contacts who had received Moderna (n = 7), whereas 8 of 9 contacts who received the Johnson & Johnson and 4 of 22 contacts who received Pfizer vaccine tested positive.

### Inferring asymptomatic carriers of antimicrobial-resistant organisms in hospitals using genomic, microbiological and patient mobility data [^ef300557]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The inference framework

We aim to assimilate information from hospitalization records, patient characteristics (e.g. pre-existing health conditions, previous medical procedures, hospitalization history prior to admission, etc.), clinical culture results, and WGS data (Fig. 2, Methods). To synergistically use multimodal observations, we developed an inference framework with three steps: 1) Use a variety of methods to independently estimate individual colonization probabilities from different data sources. 2) Synthesize those estimates from different observation types into single posterior estimates. 3) Incorporation into the network model for further inference of colonization probabilities of unobserved patients.

Fig. 2
Multimodal observations to support the inference of asymptomatic carriers.

The inference synthesizes information from hospitalization records, patient characteristics, clinical culture results, and WGS data. The three snapshots of network show the time-varying contact network structure derived from hospitalization records on three dates:, and. The initial colonization probabilities of newly admitted patients were estimated using patient characteristics in EHR data. For a fraction of patients, clinical culture results were available (here patient A has a clinical culture result on day), which can inform their colonization probabilities at the sample collection time. For patients with WGS data, using SNP distance and contact history can identify potential transmission events between them. In this example, WGS data from patients B and C on daysuggest a potential transmission from B to C following two potential paths (red arrows). The colonization probabilities of patients on the paths from B to C (i.e. patients D, E, and F) can be derived using this information. Estimates of colonization probabilities derived from (1) patient characteristics, (2) clinical culture results, and (3) WGS data were synthetized in the individual-level network model that described the evolution of colonization probabilities. The contact information in (4) hospitalization records was implicitly represented in this network model.

### Coming together to define membrane contact sites [^855ad6e1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Close proximities between organelles have been described for decades. However, only recently a specific field dealing with organelle communication at membrane contact sites has gained wide acceptance, attracting scientists from multiple areas of cell biology. The diversity of approaches warrants a unified vocabulary for the field. Such definitions would facilitate laying the foundations of this field, streamlining communication and resolving semantic controversies. This opinion, written by a panel of experts in the field, aims to provide this burgeoning area with guidelines for the experimental definition and analysis of contact sites. It also includes suggestions on how to operationally and tractably measure and analyze them with the hope of ultimately facilitating knowledge production and dissemination within and outside the field of contact-site research.

Conclusions and future directions

In summary, this opinion offers a compendium of techniques and guidelines to construct appropriate experiments for the reliable definition of contact sites and their modulation by established or newly discovered structural components. Our take-home advice to the field and to the colleagues interested in contact sites is to always combine biochemical, fluorescent, and EM approaches. Visualization of contact sites must be complemented with measurements of function such as: movement, fission, inheritance, ion exchange, or lipid transfer.

Many new and exciting questions remain to be answered in the field of contact sites — are there more contact sites that have not yet been described? Are there different varieties of contact sites between similar organelles? What are all the molecular tethers, spacers, and other contact residents? How is the distribution of signalling proteins determined between contact sites and non-junctional areas? And when these proteins are multi-subunit complexes (such as the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, mcu), does their molecular composition differ? What is the repertoire of functions carried out at contact sites? How does the loss of each contact affect cellular physiology and organismal function? How are contact sites regulated and co-regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis? And, given the apparent inability to completely deconstruct contact sites, what mechanisms exist that compensate malfunctions?

As it is becoming clear that contact sites affect a variety of diseases, interest in these structures will only increase. We anticipate that in the next decade the above questions will start to be addressed, calling for extended guidelines that help define good practices in these additional areas of contact-site research.

### SARS-CoV-2 transmission across age groups in France and implications for control [^d882a10d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Social contact data

We extracted social contact information from SocialCov, an online survey where participants aged ≥ 18 yr are invited to describe the contacts they had during the previous day. In the survey, a contact was defined as either a physical contact (e.g. a kiss or a handshake) or a close contact (e.g. face to face conversation at less than 1 meter). Collected information includes the age of the person involved in the contact and the setting where the contact happened (i.e. work, home, leisure place, or others). In addition, respondents living with one or more minors were asked to provide the same information for one of them. The survey was advertised following the same approach as in. Data were collected in accordance with the regulation in force in France for the protection and security of personal data. The answers of 1295 participants were collected between 30 July and 27 September 2020. To comply with the constraints in the survey design of the COMES-F study, used here as the reference for the mixing patterns in France, individuals with more than 40 contacts were excluded from this analysis, reducing the population from an initial number of 1628 to 1550 (including the underaged population). For each age group 0–9 y.o. 10–19 y.o. 20–29 y.o. 30–39 y.o. 40–49 y.o. 50–59 y.o. 60–69 y.o. 70–79 y.o. and ≥ 80 y.o. we computed the mean daily number of contacts, see Supplementary Table 2.

### Impact of delays on effectiveness of contact tracing strategies for COVID-19: a modelling study [^1d097d0b]. The Lancet: Public Health (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Using a mathematical model that describes the different steps of a contact tracing strategy for COVID-19, we have quantified the relevance of delays and coverage proportions for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We conclude that reducing the testing delay — ie, shortening the time between symptom onset and a positive test result, assuming immediate isolation — is the most important factor for improving contact tracing effectiveness. Reducing the tracing delay — ie, shortening the time to trace contacts, assuming immediate testing and isolation if found positive — might further enhance contact tracing effectiveness. Yet this additional effect rapidly declines with increasing testing delay. The effectiveness of mobile app-based contact tracing declines with lower app use coverage, but it remains more effective than conventional contact tracing even with lower coverage, due to its inherent speed. If an index case is tested positive and enters this information into the app, other users who have been in contact can be warned immediately, because the app will have recorded these contacts via Bluetooth. A contact tracing strategy therefore has the potential to control virus transmission, and to enable alleviation of other control measures, but only if all delays are maximally reduced. It should be noted that we simulated two contact tracing systems — conventional contact tracing with testing and tracing delays and app-based contact tracing without delays — and ignored hybrid approaches. At present, most European countries are using conventional contact tracing strategies, but are attempting to reduce delays (eg, by improving testing and tracing capacity and by removing testing barriers), and are piloting or planning the addition of app-based contact tracing. Such hybrid contact tracing systems would fall somewhere between the fully conventional and app-based scenarios described in this Article.

### NTCA guidelines for respiratory isolation and restrictions to reduce transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis in community settings [^fd941974]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory isolation and relative infectiousness of tuberculosis — there is uncertainty regarding the overall proportion of transmission that is avertable by respiratory isolation for PWTB after diagnosis and treatment. Data from the CDC's Contact Investigations Report (ARPE Data) from smear-positive cases from 2016–2020 show that, of 38 886 contacts identified in 2019, 5586 were identified as having latent TB infection (~14%), with available data not stratified by exposure timing or setting but providing general insights into relative infectiousness between PWTB and their closest contacts. Modeling suggests that the majority of TB transmission may occur from undiagnosed individuals. The population-level goal of isolation for a person with infectious forms of TB is to mitigate avertable transmission and thereby reduce TB incidence and potential future morbidity and mortality, yet transmission from a PWTB is a probabilistic event and such isolation decisions are not anticipated to have uniform population benefits in all scenarios.

### Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c0d27065]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Crowded indoor environments, such as households, are high-risk settings for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Objectives

To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses.

Data Source

PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission.

Study Selection

All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses.

Results

A total of 54 relevant studies with 77 758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%), to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that given that individuals with suspected or confirmed infections are being referred to isolate at home, households will continue to be a significant venue for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

C. difficile infection (CDI) prevention — duration of contact precautions after symptom resolution is addressed with low-quality evidence. Prolong the duration of contact precautions after the patient becomes asymptomatic until hospital discharge (Quality of evidence: LOW). CDC currently recommends contact precautions for at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves, and some hospitals may choose to extend for the duration of hospitalization even if symptoms have resolved; facilities must balance potential transmission reduction with patient risks of isolation such as behavior changes, anxiety, depression, and anger.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^f3c8e562]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Here, to better understand the effectiveness of real-world contact tracing, we expand this approach.

First, we restructure and generalize the mathematical framework to allow us to completely avoid assumptions regarding the functional form of the epidemic growth. This development makes the setting applicable to any possible evolution shape and any phase of the epidemic. Moreover, we modify the epidemiological aspects of the model according to the recent literature on COVID-19 –, to properly consider asymptomatic cases and the delay in isolating individuals after they are identified as infected. We consider different values of R 0, reduced with respect to the one assigned to the free pandemic, to take into account the widely implemented additional containment strategies, e.g. physical distancing and wearing masks (Supplementary Note 2).

Second, we provide a realistic quantification of the tracing ability ε T by performing simulations of contact tracing strategies on real-world data sets collected across different social settings (i.e. a university campus, a workplace, a high school) –. Hence, the tracing ability ε T, defined by Ferretti et al.as a free parameter, becomes here an empirically estimated quantity, which directly depends on the contact network. The impact of the tracing procedure on the spread can then be evaluated by inserting ε T into the mathematical model.

### Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^016c2492]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047.

Findings

Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n = 25697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n = 10736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] -10·2%, 95% CI -11·5 to -7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; p interaction = 0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n = 2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD -14·3%, -15·9 to -10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12-16-layer cotton masks; p interaction = 0·090; posterior probability > 95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n = 3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD -10·6%, 95% CI -12·5 to -7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.

Interpretation

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

### Improving fragment-based ab initio protein structure assembly using low-accuracy contact-map predictions [^8f236e12]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

C-QUARK performance correlates with contact prediction accuracy and satisfaction rate

One of the critical factors for contact-assisted ab initio folding is the accuracy of predicted contacts used as restraints during the simulations. Figs. S3 A and S3C show that the accuracy of the contact-maps extracted from the final C-QUARK models is indeed closely correlated with the accuracy of the predicted contact-maps that are used in the simulations, with a Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.703, 0.783, 0.778 and 0.793 for short-, medium-, long- and all-range contacts, respectively. These data imply that the contact restraints are effectively implemented in the folding simulations, which constitutes the major driving force for the success of C-QUARK ab initio structure modeling. The evidence can also be seen from the data in Supplementary Table S2, in which the accuracy of the overall input contacts to C-QUARK (0.502) was significantly higher than those extracted from the QUARK models (0.335) with a p-value of 1.2 × 10 −30. Interestingly, although the goal of C-QUARK is not to generate a high-accuracy contact-map, the contacts derived from the C-QUARK models had a slightly (but statistically significantly) higher accuracy than the input contacts, suggesting that the combination of deep-learning contacts with the QUARK force field can further improve the overall contact-map quality in the final models.

### Empirical evidence on the efficiency of backward contact tracing in COVID-19 [^c9dbf63a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Standard contact tracing practice for COVID-19 is to identify persons exposed to an infected person during the contagious period, assumed to start two days before symptom onset or diagnosis. In the first large cohort study on backward contact tracing for COVID-19, we extended the contact tracing window by 5 days, aiming to identify the source of the infection and persons infected by the same source. The risk of infection amongst these additional contacts was similar to contacts exposed during the standard tracing window and significantly higher than symptomatic individuals in a control group, leading to 42% more cases identified as direct contacts of an index case. Compared to standard practice, backward traced contacts required fewer tests and shorter quarantine. However, they were identified later in their infectious cycle if infected. Our results support implementing backward contact tracing when rigorous suppression of viral transmission is warranted.

### The differential impact of retirement on contact frequency with family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers [^d4b3323f]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Most studies on retirement and social network dynamics focus on the closer social network, leaving the role of more peripheral contacts largely overlooked. This article studies how retirement affects contact frequency with a wider range of social ties. We formulate and test differential hypotheses for each category of ties, and additionally examine gender and partner status differences.

Methods

We analyze 3 waves of panel data of the NIDI Pension Panel Study, collected in the Netherlands between 2015 and 2023 (n = 5,238). We use 2-way fixed-effects regression models to study within-person change in contact frequency with the different categories of social ties after retirement. To test the differential hypotheses, we conduct Wald tests comparing coefficients across models.

Results

The results indicate that retirement stimulates contact primarily with neighbors and friends, to a lesser extent with siblings and (grand)children, and does not affect contact frequency with parents. Contact with ex-coworkers initially increases but then decreases over time. For women, the positive association between retirement and contact with ex-coworkers, friends, and children is stronger. Not having a partner reduces the association between retirement and contact with friends and ex-coworkers.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that retirees attempt to replace lost workplace interactions by engaging with their former colleagues outside of work and increasing contact with neighbors. Simultaneously, the results suggest substantial continuity in contact with all ties. We suggest that larger changes might take place outside of the ties studied here, with new contacts, and provide several suggestions for future research.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^d40f1242]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

DCT: insights and limitations

The general model that we developed for studying the effect of isolation and contact tracing on controlling the COVID-19 epidemic is inspired by the work of Fraser et al. The main distinctive characteristics that we have introduced are the following: (i) a general mathematical model that allows to evaluate the evolution of an epidemic in the presence of isolation and DCT at finite time; (ii) the evaluation of tracing efficiency by means of a numerical simulation on real contact data, and no more as an arbitrary parameter of the model; (iii) the dependence of infectiousness on the actual duration and physical proximity of contacts; and (iv) consequently, the design of appropriate policies.

The functional shape of the infectiousness that we devised is composed by three dependencies: the time since primary infection ω (τ), the duration of a contact, and its proximity ω dist (s s). The first is originally suggested by Ferretti et al. while the other two were introduced in this work. We have shown that the implemented model is robust to changes of all three contributions, see Supplementary Notes 1.2 and 1.3.

Our results suggest that an insufficient app adoption may render any digital tracing effort helpless on its own, if the reproductive number is too high. In view of these results, bridging the gap between a realistic app adoption and the larger tracing capability required to contain the disease appears crucial. This goal can only be reached with a joint effort of policy makers and health authorities in organizing an effective manual tracing, and of individual citizens in adopting the app. We therefore tested different levels of app adoption and a range of possible values of R 0, reduced from its original value by other restrictive measures, like masks wearing and physical distancing.

Moreover, we found that the set of parameters that allow containment of the spread is strongly influenced by the fraction of asymptomatic cases. By first assuming an ideal setting where any pair of parameters ε I, ε T is possible, we showed (Fig. 1) that the area of the phase space representing the setting where it is possible to control the epidemic is reduced when considering 20% or, worst-case scenario, 40% of asymptomatic individuals in the population.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^d4dab7ae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Dynamic spatiotemporal determinants modulate GPCR: G protein coupling selectivity and promiscuity [^113c434a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To understand further why the promiscuous ADRB2-TM simulations poorly segregate with the "Gs" and "Gq" signatures we traditionally expect, we analyzed how each GPCR samples common and subfamily specific contacts in each simulation. We computed the mean frequency per residue for residues from the subset of "common contacts" and "G protein subfamily specific" contacts for each of the eight GPCR:G protein simulations shown in Fig. 5 c (six original simulations from the LDA model and two simulations of the promiscuous ADRB2-TM with Gs and Gq proteins). We also calculated the contribution of the common and specific contacts to the GPCR:G protein non-bonded interaction energies averaged over the MD trajectories (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Surprisingly, we observe that all the GPCR:G protein complexes studied show on average a higher frequency or duration of contact (~45–65%) within the common subset as compared to the G protein-specific subset (~5–55%) (Fig. 5c). Most of these receptors also show a similar trend with the calculated average interaction energies for these contacts (Supplementary Fig. 3g). We observe that the ratio of the mean frequency for common versus specific contacts is most prominent for the two promiscuous receptor simulations, ADRB2-TM:Gs and ADRB2-TM:Gq. Because both ADRB2-TM simulations showed higher than expected sorting into their alternative classes with the LDA classifier, we also evaluated the mean frequency of sampling for the alternative G protein subfamily specific contacts (ADRB2-TM:Gs sampling of Gq-specific contacts, and ADRB2-TM:Gq sampling of Gs-specific contacts). We observe that ADRB2-TM:Gs samples very little of the Gq-specific contact space, while the ADRB2-TM:Gq complex indeed is able to sample more Gs-specific contacts than Gq-specifc contacts, but still at a much lower mean frequency than common contacts. We expanded this analysis to compare the sampling of common contacts compared to any other contacts sampled within each class (Supplementary Fig. 3h). From this analysis, we still observe a much higher mean frequency of interaction through the common contacts (~45–65%) as compared to other contacts (~30–50%) sampled for each GPCR:G protein class. Interestingly, as seen in Supplementary Fig. 3b, the interaction energies coming from both common and specific contacts are similar in magnitude in the eight receptors studied here except in HT2A and in the promiscuous receptor ADRB2-TM. This suggests that promiscuous GPCRs sample more of the common contacts and likely derive their coupling strength from them more than the specific contacts.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^fac1e9c1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Tracing efficiency based on empirical contact data

The proposed mathematical framework makes it possible to address our main goal: characterizing the efficiency of contact tracing. This can be quantified by ε T, which instead of being a free parameter can be estimated numerically, by observing how well the implemented policies enable to find the infected individuals. More precisely, we assume that a fraction ε I of infected individuals is identified at each time step. Their recent contacts are then traced and, according to the nature of their interaction, as we explain in detail in the next sections, some of them will be classified as "at risk and thus possibly contagious". Tracing is therefore strongly dependent on the ability to identify those primary infected individuals that caused the secondary infections, and we thus assume that ε T is proportional to ε I. Moreover, it is influenced by the actual ability to find the secondary cases, given the primary infected. This in turn depends on multiple factors, involving the spreading model, the definition of a risky contact, the app adoption, the compliance to quarantine and clearly the quantity and nature of contacts in the population. For this reason, we need a numerical model that takes into account all these factors and simulates the spreading, with isolation and tracing, in a population of individuals with realistic contacts. To this end, we make use of three different data sets of empirical contacts involving large groups of people, in a high school, in a university campus and in an office building. The variable ε T will be computed by counting, for each primary infection, the fraction of the corresponding secondary cases that are actually quarantined according to some contact tracing strategy, see Section "Aggregation and parameter estimation" for the details on the derivation of ε T.

Step 1: Initial contact and response — purpose and key actions focus on intake, early evaluation, and education. The purpose of Step 1 is to collect information from the inquirer to determine whether the inquiry's concern warrants further follow-up, after which the health agency will need to decide whether to pursue the inquiry further, focusing on obtaining information the inquirer can provide as well as relevant data available to the health agency such as data from cancer registry, census, and environmental databases. The inquirer should be referred quickly to the responsible unit and the problem should not be dismissed prematurely, and although the majority of reports of potential clusters will be closed at the time of initial response because the inquirer's concerns are not consistent with a potential cancer cluster, the first encounter is often the health agency's best opportunity to educate about the nature of cancer and suspected cancer clusters. To be an effective initial responder, the health agency needs to understand the context of the inquirer's concern, the nature of the perceived problem, and the history of how it has or has not been reported to authorities.

### Tuning immune responses: diversity and adaptation of the immunological synapse [^a3a747fc]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2005). Medium credibility.

The onset and regulation of a specific immune response results from communication between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which form molecular interactions at the site of cell-cell contact — and this is known as the immunological synapse. Initially, the immunological synapse was viewed as a stereotypical adhesion and signalling device with a defined molecular structure and signalling processes. However, as we discuss here, T-cell-APC interactions comprise a diverse range of contact modes and distinct molecular arrangements. These diverse interaction modes might define a molecular code, in which the differences in timing, spacing and molecular composition of the signalling platform determine the outcome of T-cell-APC interactions.

Telepsychiatry cameras and eye contact — Cameras with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities facilitate the development of a therapeutic alliance, and control of the camera at the patient site assists in evaluating dysmorphology and developmental anomalies by zooming in on facial features and assessing motor and activity skills by following the patient around the room. Assessing eye contact is an essential component of the developmental assessment of youth and is challenging during an ITV encounter because of placement of the camera above or below the monitor. The psychiatrist should determine whether the child's apparent decreased eye contact represents a technical limitation or clinical impairment and query the youth and parent about the ability to sustain eye contact, and the psychiatrist can optimize the patient's experience of eye contact by alternating the gaze between the monitor and camera during the session.

### Innate and adaptive immune responses during acute M. tuberculosis infection in adult household contacts in Kampala, Uganda [^4f991f2c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Contacts of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients are at risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. Because most infections are controlled, studies during MTB infection provide insight into protective immunity. We compared immune responses of adult household contacts that did and did not convert the tuberculin skin test (TST). Innate and adaptive immune responses were measured by whole blood assay. Responses of TST converters (TSTC) were compared with persistently TST negative contacts (PTST-) and contacts who were TST+ at baseline (TST+). TLR-2, TLR-4, and IFN-γR responses to IFN-γ did not differ between the groups, nor did γδ T cell responses. T cell responses to MTB antigens differed markedly among TSTC, PTST-, and TST+ contacts. Thus, no differences in innate responses were found among the three household contact groups. However, adaptive T cell responses to MTB antigens did differ before and during MTB infection among PTST-, TSTC, and TST+ contacts.

### Contact tracing reveals community transmission of COVID-19 in New York city [^8f5b13a7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission within and among communities is critical for tailoring public health policies to local context. However, analysis of community transmission is challenging due to a lack of high-resolution surveillance and testing data. Here, using contact tracing records for 644,029 cases and their contacts in New York City during the second pandemic wave, we provide a detailed characterization of the operational performance of contact tracing and reconstruct exposure and transmission networks at individual and ZIP code scales. We find considerable heterogeneity in reported close contacts and secondary infections and evidence of extensive transmission across ZIP code areas. Our analysis reveals the spatial pattern of SARS-CoV-2 spread and communities that are tightly interconnected by exposure and transmission. We find that locations with higher vaccination coverage and lower numbers of visitors to points-of-interest had reduced within- and cross-ZIP code transmission events, highlighting potential measures for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 spread in urban settings.

### Digital proximity tracing on empirical contact networks for pandemic control [^a5b56115]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

How infectiousness depends on duration and proximity

In the theoretical model (1), infectiousness is simply given by the curve ω (τ) multiplied by R 0; on the other hand, as stated above, the numerical simulations make it possible to take into account several crucial factors, like duration and proximity of contacts.

We thus multiply ω (τ) by two independent factors, and ω dist (s s). They represent the probability for an infected individual to transmit the disease respectively given the duration e of contact and given the signal strength s s of a contact. Here, the Bluetooth received signal strength can be considered as a proxy for the distance between two individuals, where signal attenuations (in dBm) with smaller absolute value tend to correspond to smaller distances. We refer to Supplementary Note 1.2 for a detailed discussion on the functional shapes ofand ω dist (s s). In particular, as both are parametric functions, it is possible to tune their parameters by imposing some physical constraints regarding duration, distance, and R 0. The reproductive number of COVID-19 can be extracted from the literature as being close to R 0 = 3, while there is little evidence for the dependence on proximity and duration; we thus consider multiple possible infection curves corresponding to different combinations ofand ω dist (s s), keeping R 0 = 3 fixed. To this aim, we elaborate a procedure aimed at choosing the function parameters starting from physical constraints so as to always consider meaningful infectiousness curves. The procedure is explained in details in Supplementary Note 1.2, where we characterize three different possible curves. The constraint given by R 0 requires to find a good balance between the two functionsand ω dist (s s). If for instance we suppose that infectiousness is high even at long distances we should thus setsuch that contacts are contagious only for long durations in order not to have a huge R 0 (e.g. the pink curves in Supplementary Fig. 1). Vice versa, if ω dist is adjusted such that only close proximity contacts are contagious, we should give more importance to duration and suppose that also short durations are at risk (e.g. the blue curves in Supplementary Fig. 1). In Supplementary Note 1.2, we show the results of simulations in these different cases. We observe that for the controllability of the epidemics, the different types of infectiousness do not lead to significant differences. However, from the point of view of cost versus the effectiveness of the restrictive measures, different curves lead to different results. We discuss this point in Supplementary Note 2.1. Here, we choose for definiteness one of the obtained pairs of curves (, ω dist (s s)) compatible with R 0 = 3, and we assume in the following that infectiousness is governed by these. They correspond to anwhich reaches 90% infectiousness after 2 h of contact, and to an ω dist such that the contagion probability drops by 50% at a distance of 2.5 m, and by 99% at 7.0 meters.

### Fentanyl (Lazanda) [^bfed20c8]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with LAZANDA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Initiate treatment with LAZANDA for all patients (including those switching from another fentanyl product) using ONE 100 mcg spray of LAZANDA (1 spray in one nostril).

Repeat Dosing

If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg single spray, treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose.
If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.
Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

### How Do patients want Us to use the computer during medical encounters? – A discrete choice experiment study [^b37316f8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Visual and Verbal Contact Maintains the Fluency of the Conversation

Patients preferred visual and verbal contact to verbal or visual contact alone while typing. Visual and verbal contact is the most natural and fluent way of staying in contact during a conversation. Visual contact itself during a dialogue is known to activate "social" neural pathways related to the intention to communicate during a face-to-face dialogue. As mentioned by medical communication experts, a visual contact allows maintaining close contact while using EHR. Moments of silence without visual or verbal contact exceeding 5 s can cause a break in the patient's discourse and a change of topic. Previous studies have reported poorer quality of patient-physician communication and a decrease of patients' involvement when physicians were silent while using the computer. A decrease in visual contact while using EHR does not seem to be necessarily related with patients dissatisfactionand it is not clear whether visual contact has a superior "value" over verbal contact during physician-patient interaction. In our study, almost a third of patients preferred verbal contact alone while using EHR. Talking to patients while entering or extracting data seems to compensate for the decrease in visual contact, especially if physicians summarize patients' information or explain what they are doing while typing.

A Good Spatial Organization Is Needed to Face the Patient Most of the Time

Unsurprisingly, patients favored the "bust towards the patient and hands away from the keyboard" position as it is the most patient-centered position. It means that a good spatial organization is needed to face the patient most of the time and favor good non-verbal communication.

### Stochastic sampling effects favor manual over digital contact tracing [^72d08775]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Isolation of symptomatic individuals, tracing and testing of their nonsymptomatic contacts are fundamental strategies for mitigating the current COVID-19 pandemic. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital (app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic hybrid protocols.

### ORP1L mediated PI (4) P signaling at ER-lysosome-mitochondrion three-way contact contributes to mitochondrial division [^6bdb85a4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Next, we asked whether the upregulation of the lysosome-mitochondria contact in cells overexpressing ORP1L was dependent on ORP1L interaction with the ER. We first compared the formation of lysosome-mitochondria contacts in cells overexpressing wild-type GFP-ORP1L or the FFAT motif mutant (D478A) that cannot act as an ER-lysosome tetherto cells overexpressing GFP. Here we monitored lysosome-mitochondria contacts, using Lamp1-mCherry as a lysosomal marker. The overexpression of ORP1L, but not that of the FFAT motif mutant, showed increase in both the proportion and duration of lysosome-mitochondria contacts (Fig. 3f, g) suggesting that ORP1L overexpression mediates lysosome-mitochondria contacts in an ER dependant manner.

Next, we asked whether ORP1L is required for the formation of ER-lysosome-mitochondria three-way contacts by disrupting the expression of ORP1L. In HeLa cells where ORP1L expression was either depleted (Supplementary Fig. 2d) or knocked out (Supplementary Fig. 2e), we observed a significant reduction but not an abolishment of three-way contacts (Fig. 3h, i). Importantly, ORP1L knockdown did not affect the proportion of lysosomes in contact with the ER (Supplementary Fig. 2f) or the percentage and duration of lysosome contacts with mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 2g, h), indicating that the decreased proportion of ER-lysosome-mitochondria contacts was not caused by a global disruption of the ER-lysosome or lysosome-mitochondria contacts. Further, the siRNA studies also suggest that at basal conditions, ORP1L is not a dominant tethering protein for the lysosome-mitochondria contact. Next, we examined whether ORP1L's ER binding partners, VAPs, were required for the three-way contacts. Knockdown of VAPs resulted in a decrease in the three-way contacts (Fig. 3j and Supplementary Fig. 2i) suggesting that ORP1L interaction with VAPs plays an important role in the formation of the ORP1L dependent three-way contact.

### Quantifying population contact patterns in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic [^bafbbb31]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through close, person-to-person interactions. Physical distancing policies can control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the amount of these interactions in a population. Here, we report results from four waves of contact surveys designed to quantify the impact of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We surveyed 9,743 respondents between March 22 and September 26, 2020. We find that interpersonal contact has been dramatically reduced in the US, with an 82% (95%CI: 80%–83%) reduction in the average number of daily contacts observed during the first wave compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, we find increases in contact rates over the subsequent waves. We also find that certain demographic groups, including people under 45 and males, have significantly higher contact rates than the rest of the population. Tracking these changes can provide rapid assessments of the impact of physical distancing policies and help to identify at-risk populations.

### A simple and robust approach to reducing contact resistance in organic transistors [^534630e4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Efficient injection of charge carriers from the contacts into the semiconductor layer is crucial for achieving high-performance organic devices. The potential drop necessary to accomplish this process yields a resistance associated with the contacts, namely the contact resistance. A large contact resistance can limit the operation of devices and even lead to inaccuracies in the extraction of the device parameters. Here, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for reducing the contact resistance in organic thin-film transistors by more than an order of magnitude by creating high work function domains at the surface of the injecting electrodes to promote channels of enhanced injection. We find that the method is effective for both organic small molecule and polymer semiconductors, where we achieved a contact resistance as low as 200Ωcm and device charge carrier mobilities as high as 20cm 2 V -1 s -1, independent of the applied gate voltage.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^95205b77]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) patch testing — limitations and negative results: The chief limitation is the lack of a suitable gold standard by which it can be evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy predictors and likelihood ratios (C). Other technical limitations include inclusion of relevant contact allergens, proper vehicle, proper skin site, proper reading and interpretation, and correlating the tests with the patient's specific exposure (B). Other limiting factors concern reproducibility, lack of information about irritant thresholds, and minimal elicitation concentrations (MECs) for many common chemicals (C). The inability to separate irritants from allergic responses is often encountered in angry back syndrome, which occurs in approximately 6% of cases and is likely to develop in patients with a longer duration of the primary dermatitis (C); a prospective study reported that this occurred with a frequency of 6.2% and was more likely to develop in patients with a longer duration of the primary dermatitis. Negative patch test reactions may occur even when performed with the correct sensitizing materials because the test fails to duplicate the conditions under which the dermatitis developed (C).

### The longest-lasting relationship: patterns of contact and well-being among mid-to later-life siblings [^4ed143b1]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Adults in mid to later life experience shrinking social networks, which may hinder well-being. Siblings may be important sources of social contact. Yet, little is known about adults' patterns of contact with siblings and how contact is linked to well-being.

Method

Participants included 491 adults from across the United States (M age = 58.96, SD = 6.25; 68% female) recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk; they reported on their contact with their sibling in person, over the phone, via email, texting, and social media.

Results

Latent class analysis found evidence for four patterns of contact (classes) among siblings: low, medium, high, and traditional. Those with high contact reported greater life satisfaction than those in the other groups. Those in the high group reported lower self-rated health when they recalled being treated less favorably, relative to their sibling, by their mother as children.

Discussion

These findings suggest that differing patterns of sibling contact exist among older adults. In some cases, contact may promote well-being. In other cases, more contact may serve as a reminder of hurtful or painful past family experiences related to mothers' differential treatment, in which case more contact may be linked to poorer health.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2016–2017 [^d77b01bd]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Practice considerations for vaccinating close contacts and pregnant women: Pediatric offices may choose to serve as an alternate venue for providing influenza vaccination for parents and other care providers of children, if the practice is acceptable to both pediatricians and the adults who are to be vaccinated. Medical liability issues and medical record documentation requirements need to be considered before a pediatrician begins immunizing adults, and pediatricians are reminded to document the recommendation for adult vaccination in the child's medical record. Vaccination of close contacts of children at high risk of influenza-related complications is intended to reduce their risk of contagion ("cocooning"), and the practice of cocooning also will help protect infants younger than 6 months who are too young to be immunized with influenza vaccine. Pregnant women can receive influenza vaccine safely at any time during pregnancy, and pregnant women are of special concern because they are at high risk of complications from influenza.

### Capturing variation impact on molecular interactions in the IMEx consortium mutations data set [^473ce4f3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The interaction-perturbing effects reported in the IMEx data set can be caused by modifying overall protein structure or by alteration of binding interfaces. We can determine if the mutations reported fall within sequence regions associated with binding using both computational predictions and literature-reported experimental data. We obtained predicted interfaces, based on available structural data, from Interactome3D. Literature-curated interfaces were inferred from IMEx records that contained participant features of the 'binding-associated region' (MI:0117) branch. These represent experiments where the authors have tested fragment constructs in an attempt to find sequence regions that are critical for binding, although they may not necessarily represent the actual binding surface. As seen in Fig. 4g, h, most of the mutations fall within predicted or curated interfaces. The proportion of mutations having an effect over the interaction seems to be higher in binding interfaces, both predicted and inferred from IMEx curation. Disease-associated variants seem to show the same pattern (Supplementary Figure 4a, b). Thus, the majority of the variants reported to have effects on protein interactions (68%) can be linked to perturbations inside binding regions, with a smaller proportion of variants (32%) potentially representing systemic or allosteric effects influencing interactions.

### Hepatitis B [^4daf5371]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B screening — high-risk birth regions and other groups include individuals born in areas of high or intermediate prevalence for HBV including immigrants and adopted children, with regions listed as Asia, Africa, South Pacific Islands, Middle East (except Cyprus and Israel), European (Mediterranean: Malta and Spain), and The Arctic (indigenous populations of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland). Additional listed regions include South America (Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, and Amazon regions of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru) and Eastern Europe (all countries except Hungary), as well as the Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and Turks and Caicos) and Central America (Guatemala and Honduras). Other groups recommended for screening include U.S.-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with high HBV endemicity, household and sexual contacts of HBsAg-positive persons, persons who have ever injected drugs, persons with multiple sexual partners or history of sexually transmitted diseases, men who have sex with men, inmates of correctional facilities, individuals with chronically elevated ALT or AST, individuals infected with HIV or HCV, patients undergoing renal dialysis, all pregnant women, and persons needing immunosuppressive therapy; those who are seronegative should receive hepatitis B vaccine.

### FOSCARNET SODIUM… [^cd7a43ce]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 to foscarnet and clinical response to therapy has not been established and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture, vary greatly depending on the assay method used, cell type employed and the laboratory performing the test. Cell culture: CMV and HSV isolates with reduced susceptibility to foscarnet have been selected in cell culture by passage of wild type virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drug. All foscarnet resistant isolates are known to be generated through amino acid substitutions in the viral DNA polymerase pUL54 or pUL30.

Note: Many additional pathways to foscarnet resistance likely exist The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance: The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to foscarnet and either ganciclovir, acyclovir and/or cidofovir are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. Due to censoring on death, the latter analysis may overestimate the treatment effect. Treatment modifications due to toxicity were more common in the combination group than in the foscarnet sodium Injection or ganciclovir monotherapy groups. After the first dose, the hydration fluid should be administered concurrently with each infusion of foscarnet sodium Injection. Foscarnet sodium injection showed genotoxic effects in the BALB/3T3 in vitro transformation assay at concentrations greater than 0.

5 mcg/mL and an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations in the sister chromatid exchange assay at 1000 mcg/mL. A high dose of foscarnet caused an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in vivo in mice at doses that produced exposures comparable to that anticipated clinically. Since deposition in human bone has also been shown to occur, it is likely that it does so to a greater degree in developing bone in pediatric patients. Administration to pediatric patients should be undertaken only after careful evaluation and only if the potential benefits for treatment outweigh the risks.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^24ea1b25]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for catatonia, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to interact with patients if they are able to understand what is being said to them. Do not assume that non-engagement with clinical assessment is wilful in patients with suspected catatonia. Assess mental capacity to engage in an assessment and, if it is found lacking, consider acting in a patient's best interests within the appropriate legal framework.

### Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in health care settings, 2006 [^4d28616d]. American Journal of Infection Control (2007). Medium credibility.

Active surveillance cultures (ASC) and isolation measures for MRSA/MSSA — observational and review findings indicate that ASC with Contact Precautions for colonized patients contributed directly to the decline or eradication of target multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), yet results are mixed: poor control of MRSA despite ASC has been described, and a study in a MICU during a 10 week period when ASC were obtained failed to identify cross-transmission while investigators suggested that cohorting and adherence to Standard Precautions might have been important determinants rather than ASC and Contact Precautions for MRSA-colonized patients. A systematic review concluded that there is evidence that concerted efforts that include ASC and isolation can reduce MRSA even in endemic settings, but also noted methodological weaknesses and inadequate reporting and therefore concluded that the precise contribution of active surveillance and isolation alone is difficult to assess.
