## Question

What is the management of a patient with dysphagia who has COPD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a patient with dysphagia who has COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking COPD and dysphagia. Then, I should verify the clinical risks and consequences, including aspiration and exacerbations. Next, I will review screening and diagnostic strategies, including when to use VFSS versus FEES. After that, I need to outline multidisciplinary management, including respiratory, swallowing, nutritional, and pharmacologic interventions. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. COPD disrupts the normal exhale-swallow-exhale pattern, with patients more often swallowing during inspiration or inhaling immediately after swallowing, which compromises airway protection and increases aspiration risk; this breathing–swallowing discoordination is measurable and associated with worse outcomes [^1154p33W] [^113L6a78]. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence figures: dysphagia is reported in roughly 15–20% of COPD patients, with higher rates during exacerbations, and aspiration occurs in about 19–25% depending on the cohort and assessment method, which aligns with the literature [^116YmHfQ] [^113WE6t2].

> Next, I should review the clinical consequences because they drive urgency. Dysphagia in COPD is linked to a 2.4-fold higher risk of aspiration pneumonia and is independently associated with increased mortality; COPD itself is a strong predictor of pneumonia and death after VFSS, with ORs around 2.4–3.3 in observational cohorts, and dysphagia prolongs hospitalization and increases costs, reinforcing the need for early identification and intervention [^113WE6t2] [^116NeuEk] [^111bPQA9]. Wait, let me verify the exacerbation signal: breathing–swallowing discoordination predicts frequent exacerbations even in patients without overt swallowing complaints, which strengthens the case for proactive screening and therapy in at-risk COPD patients [^113L6a78].

> I will now examine screening and diagnosis, and I need to ensure I distinguish bedside from instrumental tools. Bedside screens like the EAT-10 and water swallow tests are useful for case-finding, but they miss silent aspiration; instrumental assessments are required to confirm and characterize dysphagia and to guide therapy, with VFSS and FEES as complementary gold standards [^117C92u6] [^1115huPQ]. Hold on, I should verify the role of VFSS in COPD: best-practice statements endorse VFSS to evaluate oropharyngeal and esophageal phases, test compensatory strategies, and determine safe oral intake, which is particularly relevant in COPD with suspected aspiration or reflux [^1115huPQ]. Let me consider FEES as well: it is portable, allows repeated assessments, and visualizes anatomy and secretion management, making it valuable for serial follow-up and in patients who cannot be transported [^1153hMwe].

> Now, I should confirm the multidisciplinary team and core interventions. Management should be coordinated by pulmonology, speech-language pathology, nutrition, and primary care, with input from gastroenterology when reflux is suspected; this integrated approach mirrors the broader COPD care model that addresses systemic manifestations and comorbidities beyond the lungs [^1175DeBf] [^1126Svoi]. I need to check that SLP-led therapy includes both compensatory strategies (posture, bolus modification, pacing) and rehabilitative exercises (e.g., expiratory muscle strength training, chin tuck against resistance, Mendelsohn maneuver), which have evidence for improving airway safety and swallowing mechanics, albeit largely extrapolated from stroke and ICU populations and supported by physiologic rationale in COPD [^1153hMwe] [^116ynmKU]. But wait, what if the patient is on NIV or HFNC? I should double-check the mixed evidence: noninvasive respiratory support can have variable effects on swallowing patterns, with some studies suggesting improved safety and others showing discoordination; thus, individualized trials of support during feeding may be reasonable, but I must monitor closely for aspiration risk [^114E7jkM].

> Let me think about nutrition and hydration next, because aspiration risk must be balanced against malnutrition. Dietitians should individualize texture modification and counsel on adherence to thickened liquids, which reduce laryngeal penetration and aspiration but are often poorly tolerated; adherence to thickeners hovers around 22–52%, so taste optimization, education, and follow-up are essential to sustain use and avoid dehydration [^115oAVgP]. I should confirm that when oral intake is unsafe or insufficient, enteral feeding via NG or PEG is considered, with shared decision-making about goals of care and reversibility, consistent with dysphagia management principles in chronic disease [^113LqLSq].

> I need to ensure I address reflux and aspiration pneumonia prevention. GERD and laryngopharyngeal reflux are common in COPD and associate with exacerbations; empiric PPIs may help selected patients, but evidence for routine PPI use to prevent COPD exacerbations is limited and conflicting, so I should reserve PPIs for those with symptomatic GERD or objective reflux, and avoid ICS monotherapy given pneumonia risk and limited benefit in many COPD phenotypes [^1122dMS3] [^1157qjUc] [^117LUBN6]. Hold on, I should verify the pneumonia piece: aspiration pneumonia risk is substantially higher in COPD, and strategies that reduce aspiration (texture modification, SLP therapy, oral care, vaccination) are prudent, though high-quality COPD-specific trials are sparse and much of the evidence is extrapolated [^113WE6t2] [^116NeuEk].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In acute exacerbations, breathing–swallowing discoordination worsens and aspiration risk rises; early SLP involvement and NPO status until cleared are reasonable, with stepwise reintroduction using instrumental guidance [^113WE6t2] [^1115huPQ]. In the ICU, post-extubation dysphagia is common and often silent; systematic screening with prompt FEES-based confirmation and early behavioral therapy reduce pneumonia and facilitate safe oral feeding, so I should not delay SLP input after extubation in COPD patients [^1163V5BC] [^1153hMwe]. For advanced COPD, I should integrate palliative principles: use fans for dyspnea, consider low-dose opioids for refractory breathlessness, and align feeding decisions with goals of care when dysphagia is severe or irreversible, ensuring comfort and dignity [^112DmJbP] [^114rgo4R] [^113kijfm].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up. Serial clinical assessments, periodic EAT-10 or similar screens, and repeat VFSS/FEES when status changes are appropriate; tracking cough peak flow can help gauge airway clearance capacity and guide expectations for secretion management and aspiration risk, though COPD-specific thresholds are not fully established and this remains an area for research [^116ynmKU]. Let me reconsider the economic angle: modeled analyses suggest that screening for dysphagia with simple tools and targeted rehabilitation may be cost-effective by reducing exacerbations, but I need to acknowledge this is modeling data and call for prospective trials to validate real-world impact [^112Kk8zC] [^112zTR8w].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Screen all COPD patients with symptom tools and clinical observation; escalate to VFSS or FEES if symptoms, signs, or exacerbation pattern suggest aspiration risk; initiate SLP therapy with compensatory and rehabilitative strategies; coordinate nutrition with texture modification and enteral support as needed; treat GERD selectively; and embed this within comprehensive COPD care that addresses comorbidities, vaccination, smoking cessation, and pulmonary rehabilitation, with reassessment at each clinical transition or exacerbation [^115bpatp] [^1115huPQ] [^113LqLSq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal screening; given prevalence and consequences, a case-finding approach in moderate-to-severe COPD or frequent exacerbators is reasonable, but I should remain alert to evolving evidence and tailor intensity to patient risk and preferences [^113WE6t2] [^113L6a78].

---

Dysphagia is common in COPD and increases risks of aspiration, pneumonia, and exacerbations [^113WE6t2] [^116NeuEk]. Management should be **multidisciplinary**, with early screening (EAT-10, water swallow test) [^117C92u6] and **instrumental assessment** (VFSS or FEES) [^1115huPQ] to confirm and guide therapy [^112NfjWq]. Speech therapy provides **swallowing exercises** and **postural strategies** [^1153hMwe]; nutrition supports texture modification and adequate intake [^115oAVgP]; and pulmonology optimizes COPD control and treats reflux [^1122dMS3] [^1157qjUc]. Noninvasive ventilation may help selected patients, but evidence is limited and should be individualized [^114E7jkM]. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor aspiration risk, nutrition, and exacerbation frequency [^115bpatp].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Dysphagia is present in **15–20% of COPD patients** [^116YmHfQ] and up to 56% during acute exacerbations [^116YmHfQ]. It is associated with increased risks of aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, and frequent exacerbations, leading to higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs [^113WE6t2] [^116NeuEk] [^116YmHfQ].

---

## Pathophysiology

Dysphagia in COPD arises from **complex interactions** between respiratory and swallowing mechanisms:

- **Breathing-swallowing discoordination**: COPD patients often exhibit disrupted coordination, including swallowing during inspiration or immediate post-swallow inspiration, increasing aspiration risk [^1154p2jr] [^113L6a78].

- **Reduced laryngeal elevation**: Hyperinflation and flattened diaphragm limit laryngeal elevation, impairing airway protection [^111n43pP].

- **Impaired cough mechanics**: Weak cough and impaired airway clearance increase aspiration risk [^116ynmKU].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: Reflux is common in COPD and contributes to aspiration and exacerbations [^1122dMS3] [^112YaPW2].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients may present with:

- Coughing or choking during meals
- Wet or gurgly voice
- Recurrent pneumonia or exacerbations
- Weight loss or malnutrition
- Sensation of food sticking

---

## Assessment and diagnosis

### Screening tools

Use **validated screens** to identify patients at risk:

| **Tool** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| EAT-10 | Patient-reported questionnaire; score ≥ 3 indicates risk [^notfound] |
| Water swallow test | Bedside screen; cough, wet voice, or oxygen desaturation indicate risk [^1173Kji2] |

---

### Instrumental assessments

Confirm dysphagia and guide management with **VFSS or FEES** [^1115huPQ]:

- **VFSS**: Gold standard; evaluates oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases; identifies aspiration and silent aspiration [^1115huPQ].

- **FEES**: Bedside, no radiation; visualizes pharyngeal structures and aspiration; useful for serial assessments [^112NfjWq].

---

## Multidisciplinary management

Effective management requires a **team approach**:

| **Discipline** | **Role** |
|-|-|
| Speech-language pathology | Swallowing therapy, postural strategies, diet modification [^1153hMwe] |
| Nutrition | Texture modification, supplementation, monitoring intake [^115oAVgP] |
| Pulmonology | Optimize COPD control, manage reflux, consider noninvasive ventilation [^1122dMS3] [^114E7jkM] |
| Primary care | Coordination, monitoring, patient education [^1175DeBf] |

---

## Specific interventions

### Swallowing therapy

- **Exercises**: Effortful swallow, Mendelsohn maneuver, tongue strengthening, expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) [^1153hMwe].

- **Postural strategies**: Chin tuck, head turn, upright positioning [^1153hMwe].

- **Diet modification**: Adjust textures (nectar, honey, pudding) to reduce aspiration risk [^115oAVgP].

---

### Nutritional management

Nutritional management emphasizes **individualized plans** with texture-modified diets to balance safety and nutrition, along with supplementation to address deficiencies and monitoring of weight and hydration status [^115oAVgP].

---

### Respiratory management

Respiratory management focuses on **optimizing COPD control** with bronchodilators, smoking cessation, and pulmonary rehabilitation [^115bpatp]. Reflux should be treated with PPIs and lifestyle changes when indicated [^1122dMS3] [^1157qjUc]. Noninvasive ventilation may be considered in selected patients to improve breathing-swallowing coordination, though evidence is limited [^114E7jkM].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to track **aspiration risk**, nutritional status, and exacerbation frequency. Repeat VFSS or FEES is indicated if symptoms progress or new issues arise [^1115huPQ]. Patient education should reinforce adherence to dietary modifications, swallowing strategies, and medication use [^113VFznA].

---

## Impact on outcomes

Effective dysphagia management in COPD can **reduce aspiration pneumonia**, improve nutrition, and decrease exacerbations, thereby enhancing quality of life and reducing healthcare utilization [^116YmHfQ] [^112Kk8zC].

---

Dysphagia is common in COPD and carries significant clinical consequences. A **multidisciplinary approach** with early screening, instrumental assessment, and targeted interventions is essential to reduce aspiration, improve nutrition, and enhance patient outcomes.

### Study on predictive models for swallowing risk in patients with AECOPD [^113WE6t2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a potentially fatal respiratory condition, is defined by persistently restricted airflow. Its occurrence rises significantly with advancing age. The death rate linked to this condition nearly two folded between 1970 and 2000. By 2030, it was anticipated that this widely occurring ailment would rank as the third most common cause of mortality and be among the top ten contributors to the overall disease burden. 90% of fatalities occurred in nations with lower and moderate income levels.

Between 32.7% and 49% of individuals with COPD experience dysphagia, and a 33% prevalence of subjective swallowing symptoms in stable COPD. In stable COPD, subjective swallowing symptoms appear to be a prevalent issue. This concern manifests across all phases of the condition, but it is more frequently observed in symptomatic patients and those with reduced physical capacity.

Due to the common neuroanatomical mechanisms and pathways involved in respiration and swallowing, precise coordination between them is necessary to protect the airway, which is crucial for safe and effective swallowing function. In addition, both patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and those with heart disease have symptoms of dyspnea. However, individuals in the former encounter notably higher instances of both self-reported and clinically assessed swallowing dysfunction.

Patients with AECOPD experience respiratory and swallowing incompatibility, which may lead to more frequent aspiration and deterioration due to the inability to develop airway protection mechanisms. The incidence of aspiration in COPD is 19.9%. In stable COPD, up to 25% of individuals experience aspiration, with an inclination towards elevated rates of hospitalizations and mortality over a period of 36 months. The rate of aspiration in patients with AECOPD was 17%. The probability of developing aspiration pneumonia in COPD is 2.4 times higher than that of the general population.

Introduction

Patients with moderate-to-very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) represent a considerable economic burden despite the current efficacious treatments available. COPD is among the most common non-communicable diseases, affecting 329 million people with a global economic cost of US$ 2.1 trillion. Annual COPD costs in the USA are expected to increase to 40 billion USD per year. Australia spent about AUD$ 831.6 million in 2020–21 on management of COPD; accounting up to 18% of disease expenditure on respiratory conditions, and 0.6% of total disease expenditure. Over half of this cost was for hospital care. We believe that a significant portion of this cost could be avoided by reducing exacerbations.

Studies have documented swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) in 15–20% of COPD patients, and in one study, 56% of hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD were diagnosed with oropharyngeal swallow disorder. In this study of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), 17% of COPD patients with exacerbations aspirated. During video-fluoroscopy in another study, 25% of people with COPD aspirated, and faced a greater number of hospitalizations and deaths over 36 months.

Dysphagia is not only common in COPD, but it is a significant economic burden, associated with up to 60% higher economic costs than people with normal swallowing, and increased length of stay in hospitals. It is estimated that 235 million older adults will suffer from a swallowing disorder, or dysphagia worldwide by 2050. Disrupted swallowing function is observed in 15% of people over 65 years old, and is often reported as dysphagia. Oropharyngeal dysphagia can result in penetration of particles into the larynx, aspiration into the trachea, or presence of oropharyngeal residue.

Impaired sensation and perception of respiratory loads is linked to poor outcomes of respiratory diseases. Our investigations of people with COPD found impaired sensation of inspiratory loads, and tongue strengths that were lower than the published weighted averages; here, around 30% of the COPD participants showed clinical signs of aspiration. Additionally, COPD patients have disrupted swallowing-breathing coordination in everyday life, and this could predispose them to aspirate, further increasing the exacerbation rate. Such aspirations can lead to aspiration pneumonia, worsening symptoms, or AECOPD, and this group with a high risk of aspiration could benefit from close monitoring and swallowing training.

### Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beyond the lungs [^1126Svoi]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term that covers many clinical subtypes with clearly different pulmonary and extra-pulmonary characteristics, but with persistent airflow limitation in common. This insight has led to the development of a more personalised approach in bronchodilator therapy, prevention of exacerbations, and advanced treatments (such as non-invasive ventilation and lung volume reduction techniques). However, systemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD also contribute to different clinical phenotypes and warrant an individualised approach as part of integrated disease management. Alterations in bodyweight and composition, from cachexia to obesity, demand specific management. Psychological symptoms are highly prevalent, and thorough diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Moreover, prevention of exacerbations requires interventions beyond the lungs, including treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and management of dyspnoea and anxiety. In this Review, we discuss the management of COPD beyond the respiratory system and propose treatment strategies on the basis of the latest research and best practices.

### Swallowing function and chronic respiratory diseases: systematic review [^114zXF2j]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The precise coordination between breathing and swallowing is an important mechanism to prevent pulmonary aspiration. Factors that alter breathing patterns and ventilation, such as chronic respiratory diseases, may influence that precise coordination of breathing and swallowing.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic literature review is to examine the effects of chronic respiratory diseases on swallowing function.

Method

Literature searches were performed using the electronic databases PubMed and Embase. All articles meeting the eligibility criteria up to March 2016 were included.

Results

All articles included studied Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA); no studies involving other respiratory diseases were found. A total of 1069 abstracts were retrieved, of which twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria; eleven studies dealt with OSA and fifteen studies dealt with COPD.

Conclusion

The outcome data indicate that chronic respiratory diseases increase the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) in patients. However, the relative small number of studies, differences in selection criteria, definitions and assessment techniques used for diagnosing OSA, COPD, and OD point to the need for further research.

Best practice position statement 3

Indications for a VFSS include the need for assessment of the oral preparatory, oral transit, pharyngeal, and/or oesophageal phases of swallowing in all patients with symptoms related to eating and drinking. These may be either subjectively reported or observed by a caregiver, and VFSS findings should have the potential to influence patient management. In some instances, VFSS may be performed as a "diagnostic" test accompanied by a "therapeutic-guiding" test, although there is considerable overlap between the two.

Patients with symptoms related to swallowing, whether self-reported by the patient, observed by a caregiver, or identified during a clinical swallowing examination, may be referred for VFSS. These symptoms and clinical conditions may especially include dysphagia, suspicion of aspiration, sensation of a lump in the throat (globus sensation), respiratory disorder, feeding difficulties, diagnosed or suspected abnormalities along the upper gastrointestinal tract, the need to evaluate therapeutic manoeuvres or other management strategies, or a medical condition with a recognised high risk for swallowing disorders.

A diagnostic VFSS aims to clarify the clinical symptoms of a patient and evaluate the extent of impairment by evaluating the bolus flow in relation to structural movement, timing, and coordination throughout the oropharyngeal and oesophageal tract. For a therapeutic-guiding VFSS, various compensatory strategies, such as adjusting bolus volume or consistency and implementing postural or swallowing manoeuvres, are tested and documented using videofluoroscopy to assess their impact on swallowing efficiency and safety. Therapeutic-guiding studies should not be performed without prior diagnostic evaluation. Nonetheless, both parts often intersect and are ideally combined into one examination.

Patients presenting with rapidly progressing obstruction for solids, weight loss, or other alarm symptoms should undergo endoscopy first as a priority before considering a VFSS. VFSS can serve as an initial assessment of swallowing function or as a repeated evaluation for patients whose swallowing capabilities are likely to change due to disease progression or improvement following an intervention. Additionally, VFSS may diagnose aspiration or residues, when a patient is unable or refuses to undergo transnasal endoscopy.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other pulmonary conditions often accompanied by dyspnoea and, in some cases, abnormal lung function associated with aspiration or gastro-oesophageal reflux, VFSS is used to evaluate the patient's ability to safely meet nutritional requirements on oral intake and manage oral medications.

### Breathing-swallowing discoordination is associated with frequent exacerbations of COPD [^111HUb8T]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common life-threatening lung disease worldwide. In the management of patients with COPD, prevention of COPD exacerbation is one of most important goals because exacerbation has serious impacts on the morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with COPD. Therefore, identifying and reducing the risk factors associated with COPD exacerbation are major therapeutic targets in clinical settings.

In our previous study, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) symptoms were found to be associated with frequent COPD exacerbation, and various replication studies have been conducted. However, treating GER symptoms simply with a proton pump inhibitor does not reduce COPD exacerbation. This result suggests that something else is associated with GER that may be important to prevent COPD exacerbation rather than the GER symptom itself. Because most patients with COPD are old, they may exhibit various functional abnormalities, including swallowing abnormalities. In another previous report by our group, we elucidated the association between GER and impaired swallowing abnormalities in patients with COPD; the results suggested that swallowing abnormalities and subsequent aspiration may exacerbate COPD.

To assess these swallowing abnormalities, we recently developed a non-invasive and quantitative technique for measuring breathing–swallowing coordination. Using this technique, we can monitor breathing and swallowing as a time series and identify the respiratory phase sequence, overlap and delay of inspiration/expiration and swallowing. In particular, according to a recent study by Gross et al, swallowing during inspiration (I-SW pattern) and swallowing immediately followed by inspiration (SW-I pattern) may be notable signs of breathing–swallowing discoordination. However, there is not sufficient information about such discoordination in patients with COPD, and it remains unclear whether breathing–swallowing discoordination is a meaningful feature and useful index in patients with COPD.

We hypothesised that breathing–swallowing coordination may be impaired in patients with COPD and that breathing–swallowing 'discoordination' may be a significant risk factor for frequent and/or further exacerbation.

### Post-extubation dysphagia in the ICU-a narrative review: epidemiology, mechanisms and clinical management (update 2025) [^115t3a5U]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysphagia is defined as impairment in swallowing function resulting in the difficulty or inability to transfer liquids and/or food from the mouth to the gastro-intestinal system. Despite the clinical observation that swallowing disorders are common in critically ill patients, the incidence of dysphagia in critically ill patients was not clear until very recently. Previously, an incidence of dysphagia in ICU patients of 3–62% was assumed with some authors indicating prevalence rates of up to 93%. Data derived from mostly smaller analyses in heterogeneous ICU populations without systematic dysphagia screening. The initially reported ranges (3–62%) might thus reflect a rather high degree of initial uncertainty. Further, methodology of dysphagia assessment, timing of dysphagia assessment, participant recruitment methods (systematic vs. non-systematic screening) or duration of mechanical ventilation partly differed. Available data from a large prospective analysis with systematic screening of all patients at risk (i.e. all ICU patients) now demonstrate an incidence of about 18% in emergency-admitted adult mixed medical-surgical ICU patients. The incidence of post-extubation dysphagia (PED) in elective postoperative patients was shown about 5%.

During recent years, further prospective analyses provided new insights into risk factors and long-term effects associated with post-extubation dysphagia in critical illness. Respective data address risk factors and comorbidities associated with PED including age, gender, BMI, sepsis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, COPD, myocardial infarction, advanced heart failure (NYHA class > II), transesophageal echocardiography, previous stroke, tracheostomy or endotracheal tube size, presence of gastroesophageal reflux, increased disease severity (APACHE-II and SOFA scores) and smoking. Nonetheless, most of the data again derive from smaller and heterogeneous ICU cohorts and varying methodological approaches or study protocols, in particular regarding screening and/or recruitment, are used.

Importantly, duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation is now considered an important risk factor for dysphagia, with one large-scale prospective analysis indicating that one additional day of mechanical ventilation increases the risk for PED by about 20%. Additionally, presence of pre-existing dysphagia (and consequently reduced functional reserve emerging from critical illness), local malignancy or post-surgical medical conditions affecting anatomic structures of the swallowing tract are considered relevant risk factors. A meta-analysis published in 2022 did not demonstrate a single risk factor statistically significant. This was mostly attributed to a heterogeneity in swallowing assessment methods, populations, and specific aspects on timing of investigations.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes between aspiration pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112s2TCx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the world. COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation associated with chronic airway inflammation. Often, exacerbation of COPD occurs in the clinical course of the disease, accelerates the rate of decline in lung function, and is associated with significant mortality, particularly in patients requiring hospitalization. The most common cause of exacerbation appears to be respiratory tract infection; it has been reported that exacerbation is caused by bacterial infection in approximately 50% of cases. Further, COPD is one of the most frequent co-morbid conditions associated with the development of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); COPD is the most common underlying disease in patients with CAP who require hospitalization, and such patients have increased mortality. Thus, CAP should be considered as a cause of exacerbation in the differential diagnosis and treated appropriately if present.

Aspiration pneumonia (AsP) is assumed to be one of the phenotypes of CAP. AsP demonstrates specific clinical features, such as frequent occurrence in elderly patients, greater severity of pneumonia, and poorer long-term mortality compared with CAP. COPD patients have been reported to have increased risk of dysphagia, which is related to the occurrence of AsP. This dysphagia is due to ageing and also to the presence of cerebrovascular disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease as co-morbidities of COPD. COPD patients have reduced laryngopharyngeal sensitivity and impaired swallowing function compared with healthy age-matched controls. AsP should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis in COPD patients with exacerbation who require hospitalization.

However, there is little information about the clinical features of COPD patients with AsP compared with those with CAP — particularly with respect to in-hospital mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between AsP and CAP in COPD patients using a national inpatient database in Japan. We also aimed to evaluate factors that affect in-hospital mortality in the AsP and CAP patient groups.

### Disorders of swallowing: palliative care [^115jgyzF]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article defines palliative care for swallowing disorders as treatment for severe and chronic dysphagia or intractable aspiration when the recovery of normal swallowing is not anticipated and attempts to restore normal swallowing have been unsuccessful. Palliative treatment for dysphagia is not only for the dying patient because patients with difficulty swallowing can live for a long time. Palliative care for dysphagia is aimed at maximizing swallowing function, maintaining pulmonary health, and supporting healthy nutrition despite the impaired ability to swallow. When despite all attempts at intervention a patient becomes totally unable to swallow, the goal of therapy changes toward finding ways to provide adequate nutrition for the patient.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1122dMS3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) in COPD is reported as an independent risk factor for exacerbations associated with worse health status, and the mechanisms responsible for increased risk of exacerbations are not yet fully established. Proton pump inhibitors are often used for treatment of GERD, one small, single-blind study suggested these agents decrease the risk of exacerbation, yet their value in preventing these events remains controversial and the most effective treatment for this condition in COPD has yet to be established.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the primary care setting: how can we achieve more for our patients? [^116i7scy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating and progressive disease that is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, affecting up to 1 in 10 older adults. Common symptoms, including dyspnea, productive cough, chest tightness, and fatigue, can reduce quality of life, the ability to participate in all types of activities, and overall health status in patients. Minimizing the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life should be a key goal for physicians, and modest changes in current practice could make improvements in patients' lives. Here we review chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, its impact on patients, and how to improve symptom management.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^112Kk8zC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Swallowing impairment observed in ~ 20% of people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and acute exacerbations. We designed a decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Swallowing and Respiratory Sensation Assessment (SwaRSA) tests and swallowing rehabilitation to reduce COPD exacerbations. We believe that swallowing rehabilitation to improve coordination of swallowing and breathing may reduce exacerbations in people with COPD.

From the Australia health system perspective, we assessed the cost effectiveness of four tests relative to standard of care, or no testing, over a time horizon of one year. The SwaRSA tests assessed relative to a standard of care arm of no testing: included the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) score, Swallowing Capacity of Liquids, Tongue Strength Assessment, and Respiratory Sensation Assessment, in people with moderate to severe COPD. Outcome measures were COPD exacerbations per year, which were converted into quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Model inputs including costs, test sensitivities and specificities, COPD exacerbation risks, and exacerbation-related utilities were derived from published sources. Our assumptions on the costs, recovery, and risk reduction are based on the available data on pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD.

Relative to no-SwaRSA, three individual testing strategies were found to be cost-effective at incremental cost effectiveness ratio per QALY ranging from $27,000 to $37,000 AUD assuming a willingness to pay of $50,000 AUD. The EAT-10 and the tongue strength were the two dominant options on the cost-effectiveness frontier. Model results were robust to variations in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

In COPD, SwaRSA modelling suggests that self-assessment with the EAT-10 and subsequent intervention is highly cost-effective relative to no-SwaRSA.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^112zTR8w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Swallowing impairment observed in ~20% of people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and acute exacerbations. We designed a decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Swallowing and Respiratory Sensation Assessment (SwaRSA) tests and swallowing rehabilitation to reduce COPD exacerbations.

### Consequence of dysphagia in the hospitalized patient: impact on prognosis and hospital resources… [^111bPQA9]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Dysphagia has a significant impact on hospital length of stay and is a bad prognostic indicator. Early recognition of dysphagia and intervention in the hospitalized patient is advised to reduce morbidity and length of hospital stay. The consequences of dysphagia can be profound. Although it is appreciated that nutrition, hydration, quality of life issues, and social isolation may arise, aspiration may be the pivotal factor that precipitates a significant decline in a patient's outcome. Our research group1 has previously shown that in patients hospitalized with stroke, only 14% of those without dysphagia required more than 7 days of hospitalization. While the NHDS does not demonstrate a cause-effect relationship between dysphagia and other variables, the association between the presence of dysphagia and mortality risk is not surprising in the rehabilitation population.

Dysphagia is present with a greater number of comorbidities, which may in consort lead to increased mortality risk. Similarly, these debilitated patients have ongoing needs for nutrition and hydration, so the presence of dysphagia has the potential to exacerbate risk of aspiration and its subsequent complications. Unfortunately, the NHDS does not specify admitting diagnoses or time of acquiring dysphagia during the hospitalization. A follow-up study of this cohort may shed vital insight into pivotal moments during the hospitalizations when dysphagia could have been identified and acted on to improve patient outcomes. While dysphagia occurs in only a small portion of hospitalized patients, the impact on hospital resources is substantial. The presence of aspiration often leads to the need for antibiotic use and endotracheal intubation, with their potential risks.

Furthermore, hospital discharge planning is delayed secondary to enteral feeding plans that might include placement of nasogastric or percutaneous gastrostomy tubes. The increased association of dysphagia with mortality is also linked to costs associated with end-of-life care. We recommend early identification of dysphagia in hospitalized patients, particularly in those with high-risk comorbid conditions such as older age, stroke, dehydration, malnutrition, neurodegenerative disease, pneumonia, cardiac disease, and the need for rehabilitation. 9, 10 The plan of care in these patients should include proper assessment, early intervention using appropriate therapy and aspiration precautions, and consideration of enteral feeding or supplementation options in the high-risk population. Further clinical research to address clinical pathways and outcomes in these populations could help to mitigate both the clinical and economic ill effects of this potentially devastating condition.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^117ECEHx]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic throat symptoms, including cough, dysphonia, dysphagia, globus sensation and throat clearing, are frequently encountered in outpatient clinics. Differential diagnoses for these bothersome symptoms intersect multiple specialties, including otolaryngology, gastroenterology and respiratory medicine. However, identifying a definitive organic cause is often challenging for these symptoms, even with extensive evaluations.

Scenarios involving unexplained chronic throat symptoms (UCTS) present a dilemma for clinicians, as they contend with clinical ambiguity and unclear management directions. Their aetiology and pathophysiology though widely postulated continue to have unresolved clinical correlations. Current research frequently polarises rather than unites, with conclusions confounded by diverse clinical taxonomies and specialty concepts. Consequently, cohesive, evidence-driven guidelines for UCTS remain absent.

There is no common terminology adopted for clinical presentations involving UCTS, which hinders precise prevalence estimates. Notwithstanding, UCTS is estimated to constitute a significant burden in primary careand often necessitate additional specialist evaluations. While often overlooked in the absence of clinical red flags, these symptoms are associated with significant morbidity, indicating a potentially under-recognised public health issue.

In response to this area of need, we assembled a collaborative team of otolaryngology and gastroenterology specialists with the goal of providing a concise appraisal of aetiological and pathophysiological concepts in this field, including existing terminologies and their clinical implications. A key objective was to review the evidence and outcomes of existing single specialty-led approaches to UCTS diagnosis and management.

Next, based on the findings of our review, we aimed to provide readers with a practical evidence-based framework for the assessment and management of UCTS presentations.

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia: manifestations and diagnosis [^115g3c5M]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) have been recognized by the WHO as a medical disability associated with increased morbidity, mortality and costs of care. With increasing survival rates and ageing of the population, swallowing disorders and their role in causing pulmonary and nutritional pathologies are becoming exceedingly important. Over the past two decades, the study of oropharyngeal dysphagia has been approached from various disciplines with considerable progress in understanding its pathophysiology. This Review describes the most frequent manifestations of oropharyngeal dysphagia and the clinical as well as instrumental techniques that are available to diagnose patients with dysphagia. However, the clinical value of these diagnostic tests and their sensitivity to predict outcomes is limited. Despite considerable clinical research efforts, conventional diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal dysphagia have limited proven accuracy in predicting aspiration and respiratory disease. We contend that incorporation of measurable objective assessments into clinical diagnosis is needed and might be key in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^1177rf9Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We designed a decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the SwaRSA tool. We modelled the effect of SwaRSA (swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a rehabilitation intervention) to aid in the diagnosis of dysphagia, an independent predictor of COPD exacerbation risk. Since SwaRSA is not part of routine clinical care, the strategy was compared against a strategy of no SwaRSA in the control arm of the model. In our modelling, the SwaRSA arm received an intervention while the no SwaRSA did not.

The model time horizon was limited to 12 months of follow-up, therefore making it most suitable for a relatively simple decision tree rather than a long-term Markov extrapolation, because the underlying clinical data that served as the basis to inform the dysphagia related exacerbation risk was similarly limited to 12 months of follow-up. The model outcomes included in the end nodes of the decision tree included the total expected cost of exacerbation related treatment, exacerbation-dependent quality of life estimates, as well as the cost of SwaRSA related screening and clinical intervention only in the intervention arm of the model. Our model-based economic evaluation and reporting complies with the Consolidated Health Economics Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines.

### Antimicrobial therapies for prevention of recurrent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): beyond the guidelines [^116R3m8D]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with 'frequent exacerbation with emphysema' and 'exacerbator with chronic bronchitis' a thorough evaluation for co-existing bronchiectasis, GORD and sinus disease should be performed.

The prevalence of bronchiectasis ranges from 4 to 72% in patients with severe COPD depending on the study methodology. A high-resolution CT (HRCT) with expiratory images, is critical to further management of this group. This is to confirm the presence of bronchiectasis, evaluate the extent and location and identify mucus plugging, Patients with confirmed bronchiectasis should be referred for PEEP-based physiotherapy and airway clearance education. Sputum cultures are vital for direct antibiotic choice and patients will require extended courses of antibiotics for 10 to 14 days in the event of an exacerbation. Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis and should also be considered for patients with recurrent exacerbations in COPD-Bronchiectasis overlap.

Microbes play a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD and bronchiectasis, particularly Haemophilus and Pa. Microbial dysbiosis associates with more severe disease and frequent sputum surveillance is required to determine if they been colonised with resistant organisms such as Pa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm).

Patients with symptoms suggestive of GORD or aspiration should undergo an evaluation by speech and language therapy and regular dental review to assess for evidence of periodontitis as a provoking factor for exacerbations.

Co-existing obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is also associated with increased exacerbation frequency and more severe exacerbations. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) confers a significant benefit in OSA-COPD overlap patients with a ?observational cohort study by Marin et al. demonstrating a relative risk of hospitalisation with AECOPD of 1.7 times compared with untreated patients. A further matched cohort study of OSA-COPD patients with AECOPD compared to those without an exacerbations history found that worse airflow limitation and lower CPAP usage were strong predictors of COPD exacerbations and reduced survival independently of coexisting cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The disease mechanism is unclear but forced inspirations against a closed upper airway may siphon gastric contents up to the larynx and then into the trachea. Patients with OSA are likely to exhibit an impaired swallowing reflex, probably due to the perturbed neural and muscular function of the upper airways. This suggests patients with OSA may perturb the inspiratory-expiratory transition during deglutition in patients, resulting in increased vulnerability to aspiration.

### Pulmonary complications of chronic neuromuscular diseases and their management [^112ws1rj]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic neuromuscular diseases may affect all major respiratory muscles groups including inspiratory, expiratory, and bulbar, and respiratory complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Untreated, many of these diseases lead inexorably to hypercapnic respiratory failure, precipitated in some cases by chronic aspiration and secretion retention or pneumonia, related to impairment of cough and swallowing mechanisms. Many measures are helpful including inhibition of salivation, cough-assist techniques, devices to enhance communication, and physical therapy. In addition, ventilatory assistance is an important part of disease management for patients with advanced neuromuscular disease. Because of its comfort, convenience, and portability advantages, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has become the modality of first choice for most patients. Patients to receive NPPV should be selected using consensus guidelines, and initiation should be gradual to maximize the chances for success. Attention should be paid to individual preferences for interfaces and early identification of cough impairment that necessitates the use of cough-assist devices. For patients considered unsuitable for noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered, but only after a frank but compassionate discussion between the patient, family, physician, and other caregivers.

### Breathing-swallowing discoordination is associated with frequent exacerbations of COPD [^113L6a78]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that breathing–swallowing discoordination is an independent, strong predictor of exacerbation in patients with COPD. Even in patients without an apparent swallowing disorder, the evaluation and early intervention for breathing–swallowing discoordination may prevent exacerbation and consequently improve the prognosis of patients with COPD.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^112bYVY7]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Upper and Lower Airway Disorders

Upper and lower airway disease reported in association with or as a result of Sjögren's includes xerotrachea, dysphagia, laryngopharyngeal reflux, vocal cord cystic lesions ("bamboo nodules"), OSA, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, obstructive lung disease, and reactive airway disease. Approximately 38% of Sjögren's patients have chronic cough. Interestingly, among patients without an initial Sjögren's diagnosis, an unexplained cough associated with dry eyes led to confirmation of Sjögren's in 36%. An evaluation is warranted in a Sjögren's patient with chronic cough (> 8 weeks), starting with an assessment for common causes (eg, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper airway cough syndrome, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis), followed by evaluation for pulmonary complications of Sjögren's, including xerotrachea, ILD, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary lymphoma.

Small airway disease in the setting of Sjögren's may represent histopathologic follicular or constrictive bronchiolitis. Although there is often overlap on imaging and physiology, these distinctive histologic findings have variable types of inflammation (neutrophilic, lymphocytic, eosinophilic, fibroblast) and bronchiolocentric fibrosis. Bronchiectasis is characterized radiographically by the atypical dilation of the airways larger than the accompanying bronchial artery, or visible to 1 cm of the costal pleural margin. Inhaled corticosteroids, while possibly increasing the risk for candidiasis, have been recommended for inflammatory airway disease by the 2020 EULAR recommendations for managing Sjögren's. Bronchodilators may be tried empirically. And, while no broadly accepted criteria exist for xerotrachea, following exclusion of other causes of cough, empirical humidification in all Sjögren's patients with chronic cough is recommended along with consideration of an empiric trial of a secretagogue and/or guaifenesin. Most of these and other recommendations as listed in Table 3 largely draw upon experience from related airway disorders outside of the specific context of Sjögren's. Figure 2 is a suggested clinical pathway based on these recommendations.

In cases of refractory chronic cough, reflux testing (hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance with dual-PH sensor and high-resolution esophageal manometry) will assist the clinician in determining whether additional reflux treatment steps should be undertaken. It is important to consider all mechanisms of reflux pathophysiology to yield the optimal result in the management of a patient with chronic respiratory disease.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^11358jxU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Choice of model

The decision analytic model was used in this cost-effectiveness analysis as a robust tool to guide policy makers on this essential swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and dysphagia training in COPD in the absence of a costed clinical trial. The one-year time horizon is a crucial component in decision analytic modelling for COPD, especially for evaluating the immediate effects of interventions. It also accounts for seasonal variations in COPD exacerbations, ensuring relevant and actionable insights for decision-makers. By addressing uncertainties through sensitivity analyses, these models provide robust evidence for short-term intervention planning.

Decision analytic modelling is a systematic approach used in health economics, offering a structured methodology to evaluate healthcare interventions for COPD, especially when empirical data is limited. Give the chronic nature of COPD, such models synthesize data from diverse sources such as clinical trials, observational studies, and expert opinions to simulate decision-making processes, assess costs, benefits, and risks, and estimate long-term clinical and economic outcomes. Frameworks like Decision trees, Markov models, and Microsimulations are frequently employed to calculate metrics such as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses further bolster the reliability of decision-making by exploring the robustness of outcomes under varying assumptions. This approach ensures healthcare decision-makers have robust, quantitative evidence to guide resource where other data are limited.

Decision trees are particularly effective for short-term healthcare interventions with discrete outcomes. They provide graphical representations of decision-making processes, allowing for the calculation of expected values by incorporating probabilities, costs, and health outcomes, such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), further enhancing the flexibility of decision analytic modelling. Over decades, such decision analytic models have evolved into indispensable tools, enabling decision-makers to extrapolate short-term clinical data into long-term outcomes, ensure economic efficiency, and enhance the delivery of healthcare services.

Target population and subgroups

Our target population for this decision analytic model were patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD who represent a considerable economic burden despite the current efficacious treatments available from frequent hospitalization many related to exacerbations of the disease.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114KZbLG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — post‑prematurity respiratory disease (PPRD) conclusions and research needs emphasize that PPRD manifests as a spectrum of disease severity, and even those with milder disease are at risk for long‑term respiratory impairment; there are currently no medications or diagnostic testing that are universally indicated for those with PPRD. The guideline states that, given the lack of clinical studies in infants, children, and adolescents with PPRD, this clinical practice guideline will aid primary care providers and specialists in diagnosing and treating respiratory symptoms commonly seen in this population, and as patients with PPRD enter into adulthood, additional clinical and translational research will be critical for determining the risk of cardiopulmonary disease later in life. The recommendations were reviewed by the ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee, and none are considered suitable for performance measure development. Research priorities highlighted include that the utility of an interdisciplinary aerodigestive team approach to conducting formal evaluations of swallowing (including both VFSS and FEES), airway endoscopy, and airway imaging should be studied to determine its clinical benefit and feasibility; studies in areas not specifically addressed by the guideline may also warrant further investigation, including longitudinal assessments of pulmonary function and other novel modalities for measuring respiratory physiology; the management of both acute respiratory exacerbations and chronic care warrants further study; the impact of environmental exposures, including but not limited to inhaled tobacco smoke and air pollution, is an important area for future research; and approaches to prevention of severe, life‑limiting conditions should also be studied in adult cohorts with PPRD.

### A multidisciplinary approach for patients with preexisting lung diseases and immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicities [^116BRg89]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Presence of ComorbidLung Disease

Patients with NSCLC in particular have a high prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute exacerbations of COPD may be frequent and complicate a diagnosis of ICI‐pneumonitis. The severity of COPD at baseline in patients pre‐ICI may help to identify those at greater risk for exacerbations. At particular risk are those COPD patients with frequent inhaler or nebulizer use, recent hospitalizations, and frequent corticosteroid prescriptions. Patients may also have signs of lung obstruction due to tumor‐mediated compression, and selected case reports have shown early ICI‐pneumonitis development in these patients [13]. In these cases, the need to differentiate pulmonary infection (especially distal to the obstruction) from ICI‐pneumonitis is paramount. Patients with cancer suitable for receipt of ICI may also have a higher risk of aspiration, such as those with head and neck cancers, pulmonary resection, or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies [14]. These patients may exhibit resultant interstitial lung changes that complicate the diagnosis of ICI‐pneumonitis. Presence of brain metastases, prior cerebrovascular accident, patulous esophagus on imaging, or asymmetric (right middle and lower lobe‐predominant) infiltrates raise concerns for underlying aspiration. These patients may benefit from a formal swallow assessment, or equivalent study, prior to ICI.

### Dysphagia: evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.

### Association between swallowing dynamics, tongue pressure and pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111EgZT2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Swallowing is a complex process that requires the coordination of over 30 pairs of muscles in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus, with the goal of safely and efficiently transporting the food bolus from the oral cavity to the stomach. The pharynx serves two important and distinct functions: respiration and swallowing. The passage of food from the oral cavity to the pharynx without invading the lower airway is one of the major challenges of swallowing. To ensure safe swallowing, coordination between respiration and swallowing is necessary. Difficulty and/or alteration during the swallowing process is referred to as dysphagia, which can be caused by structural or functional alterations. In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia may increase disease exacerbations. Individuals with COPD are more likely to experience a rapid decline in lung function, leading to a higher number of hospitalizations.

Interstitial lung diseases are characterized by involvement of the lung interstitium. There is activation of fibroblasts located in the interalveolar space and an increase in collagen production, rendering the lungs increasingly less compliant and with progressive impairment in their gas exchange. Among idiopathic interstitial lung diseases, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most frequently diagnosed. Currently, the adjusted global incidence of IPF ranges from 0.09 to 1.30 per 10,000 people, and the prevalence ranges from 0.33 to 4.51 per 10,000 people. Despite being a relatively rare disease, IPF is of great clinical importance due to its severity. The natural history of the disease can vary, but the survival without treatment is of 2–5 years. Between 20% and 40% of individuals survive for 5 years or more. Factors that may negatively impact the nutritional status in the progression of IPF include increased respiratory muscle burden, the release of inflammatory mediators, the presence of hypoxemia, and physical inactivity. Malnutrition is common among individuals with IPF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The nutritional status has been shown to be a predictor of poor outcomes in some lung diseases such as COPD and tuberculosis, but its clinical impact in individuals with IPF is not yet fully understood.

### Study on predictive models for swallowing risk in patients with AECOPD [^1173Kji2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The act of swallowing is a sophisticated biomechanical process that harmonizes with breathing to safeguard the airway. Yet, in older individuals and those with conditions like COPD, this intricate coordination might not function optimally. When swallowing and breathing are not in sync, it can lead to significant negative outcomes. For instance, individuals experiencing laryngeal penetration are up to four times more prone to developing pneumonia. If pulmonary aspiration takes place, the likelihood of pneumonia increases tenfold. In individuals with COPD, aspiration can happen due to malfunctioning safeguards in the upper airway, decreased harmony between swallowing and breathing, and shifts in breathing patterns brought on by COPD. Although difficulties with swallowing and subsequent aspiration have been acknowledged in COPD for some time, research in this area has been constrained. 56% of COPD patients admitted to the hospital showed positive results in a swallowing screening with WST. Consistent with this, in our study, 50% of patients were at risk of swallowing.

During calm breathing, swallowing tends to occur more frequently during the exhale phase, typically with a moderate-to-low volume of air. This synchronized pattern offers significant biomechanical benefits for both swallowing and safeguarding the airway. It aids in actions such as elevating the larynx, closing the laryngeal vestibule and vocal folds, and opening the cricopharyngeal sphincter. The predominant synchronization between breathing and swallowing involved exhaling-swallowing-exhaling. Grasping the mechanisms that govern this interplay is pivotal in assessing how coordination influences the normal swallowing process in individuals with swallowing difficulties.

In normal circumstances when ingesting liquids naturally, there's a balance struck between the speed and regularity of swallowing, the breathing pattern surrounding swallowing, as well as the rate and volume of respiration. This balance serves the purpose of preventing the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Changes in the coordination of swallowing and breathing could account for the occurrence of pulmonary aspiration and the sensation of breathlessness experienced during swallowing, which is commonly observed in patients with COPD or neurological disorders.

Studying the shape changes in rodent swallows through geometric morphometric analysis indicates that the mechanics of swallowing change as animals age. By coupling this with biological tests of age-related adjustments in neuromuscular systems, we can enhance our comprehension of the musculoskeletal issues that underlie swallowing difficulties in the aging process.

### Breathing-swallowing discoordination is associated with frequent exacerbations of COPD [^114267cK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Impaired coordination between breathing and swallowing (breathing-swallowing discoordination) may be a significant risk factor for the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We examined breathing-swallowing discoordination in patients with COPD using a non-invasive and quantitative technique and determined its association with COPD exacerbation.

Methods

We recruited 65 stable outpatients with COPD who were enrolled in our prospective observational cohort study and did not manifest an apparent swallowing disorder. COPD exacerbation was monitored for 1 year before and 1 year after recruitment. Swallowing during inspiration (the I-SW pattern) and swallowing immediately followed by inspiration (the SW-I pattern) were identified.

Results

The mean frequency of the I-SW and/or SW-I patterns (I-SW/SW-I rate) was 21.5% ± 25.5%. During the 2-year observation period, 48 exacerbation incidents (25 patients) were identified. The I-SW/SW-I rate was significantly associated with the frequency of exacerbation. During the year following recruitment, patients with a higher I-SW/SW-I frequency using thicker test foods exhibited a significantly higher probability of future exacerbations (p = 0.002, log-rank test).

Conclusions

Breathing-swallowing discoordination is strongly associated with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Strategies that identify and improve breathing-swallowing coordination may be a new therapeutic treatment for patients with COPD.

### The effects of noninvasive respiratory support on swallowing physiology, airway protection, and respiratory-swallow pattern in adults: a systematic review [^114E7jkM]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The use of noninvasive respiratory support- namely high flow of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) - has been expanding in recent years. The physiologic mechanisms underlying each of these forms of support are generally well understood. In contrast, the effects on the sensorimotor mechanisms of swallowing movements, and of breathing and swallowing coordination ─ critical elements of airway protection and bolus clearance ─ remain unclear. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the existing evidence about the impact of noninvasive respiratory support on swallowing mechanics, airway protection, and respiratory-swallowing patterns in adults.

Methods

Six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched using predetermined terms. Inclusion criteria were: 1) adult humans 2) use of noninvasive respiratory support, and 3) assessment of swallowing.

Results

We identified 8727 articles for screening; 15 met the inclusion criteria. Six studies assessed noninvasive respiratory support in healthy adults, and 9 assessed participants with heterogenous respiratory diagnoses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), acute respiratory failure, and chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified NIH Quality Assessment Tool. In healthy adults, results demonstrated mixed effects of HFNC and CPAP on measures of swallowing function, airway protection, and respiratory swallowing patterns. Negative effects on respiratory-swallowing patterns were reported with NIV. In adults with heterogeneous respiratory diagnoses, six studies reported that HFNC, CPAP, or nasal NIV improved measures of swallowing and respiratory-swallowing patterns. HFNC has mixed effects on swallowing measures in ICU patients. NIV increased atypical respiratory-swallowing patterns in patients with stable COPD.

Conclusions

Due to small sample sizes and the wide variation in study designs, the impact of noninvasive respiratory support on swallowing, airway protection, and respiratory-swallowing patterns cannot be confidently assessed based on the current evidence. Future studies using standardized, validated, and reproducible methods to assess the impact of noninvasive respiratory support on swallowing physiology and airway protection are warranted.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^112bf19H]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement of effectiveness

The tests used in this SwaRSA model were demonstrated to be clinically effective in these published studies, and results for sensitivity and specificity are listed in Table 1. Additional effectiveness measures used in this model were QALYs with a utility at baseline in people living with COPD estimated at 0.65 QALYs (ranging from 0.50 to 0.80), and 0.22 QALYs (range 0.00 to 0.50) for a respiratory exacerbation.

Patients with exacerbations were assigned a QALY of 0.526 calculated by the QALY at baseline plus QALY during exacerbations using the Eq. (0.65*(37/52) + 0.22*(15/52)) with an average of three exacerbations per year and 5 weeks recovery period. From Donaldson et al. study, people with COPD experienced up to 3 exacerbations per year. Further reports revealed that 75% of COPD patients returned to baseline peak respiratory flows after 35 days following exacerbation.

In the model control group, we assumed a 20% prevalence of dysphagia, with the remaining 80% being dysphagia free. The probability of exactly three exacerbations is 87% among COPD patients with dysphagia, with the remaining 13% assumed to experience zero exacerbations. The corresponding probability for patients without dysphagia is 39%. Hence, the weighted average expected number of exacerbations in the control group is 0.2*((0.87*3)+(0.13*0)) + 0.8*((0.39*3)+(0.61*0) = 0.522 + 0.936 = 1.458. In the intervention group, the risk of exacerbation is reduced by 46% among the 20% of patients with dysphagia, hence: 0.54*0.2*((0.87*3)+(0.13*0)) + 0.8*((0.39*3)+(0.61*0) = 0.282 + 0.936 = 1.218.

### Laryngopharyngeal reflux in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-a multi-centre study [^112B2Bv9]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The clinical severity of COPD is determined by comorbidities, one of which is the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a common cause of chronic cough and a potential risk factor for exacerbations of COPD. Frequent exacerbators have a high prevalence of GERD, however approximately 58% of these patients lack typical GERD symptoms.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) represents an extra-esophageal manifestation of GERD. The reflux of gastric contents is fundamental in both LPR and GERD, but the mechanism and the symptoms of the disorders are distinct. LPR occurs when gastric contents pass the upper esophageal sphincter and usually occurs during daytime in the upright position, while GERD occurs when gastric contents pass the lower esophageal sphincter and takes place more often in the supine position at night-time or during sleep. LPR may be a contributing factor in patients with symptomatic COPD however, there are only a few studies analyzing the impact of LPR in patients with COPD. In a large longitudinal study of COPD patients, self-reported GERD or use of PPIs was associated with a 20–60% increased risk of moderate-severe exacerbations and hospitalized exacerbations during 3 years of follow up. Yet, this study was based on a subjective, self-reported history of a physician's diagnosis of GERD and studies based on objective evaluations by laryngeal-pharyngeal pH monitoring in a large COPD cohort are still missing. Here, we investigated the prevalence of LPR and explored its association with clinically relevant outcomes of COPD.

### Proton pump inhibitors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1157qjUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and progressive disease characterised by chronic cough, airflow limitation and recurrent exacerbations. Since COPD exacerbations are linked to rising mortality and reduced quality of life, the condition poses a substantial burden on individuals, society and the healthcare system. Effective management of COPD exacerbations that includes treatment of related conditions in people with COPD is thus recognised as a relevant clinical question and an important research topic. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a known comorbidity of COPD, and pulmonary microaspiration of gastric acid is thought to be a possible cause of COPD exacerbations. Therefore, reducing gastric acid secretion may lead to a reduction in COPD exacerbations. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications and are recommended as first-line therapy for people with GERD because of their inhibitory effects on gastric acid secretion. Treatment with PPIs may present a viable treatment option for people with COPD.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPI administration for people with COPD, focusing on COPD-specific outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Register of Trials and conventional clinical trial registers from inception to 22 May 2020. We also screened bibliographies of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral PPIs versus placebo, usual care or low-dose PPIs in adults with COPD were eligible for inclusion. We excluded cross-over RCTs, as well as studies with a duration of less than two months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors screened search results, selected studies for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodology. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. Primary outcomes of interest were COPD exacerbations, pneumonia and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, lung function test indices, acute respiratory infections and disease-specific adverse events. We extracted data on these outcome measures and entered into them into Review Manager software for analysis.

Main Results

The search identified 99 records, and we included one multicentre RCT that randomised 103 adults with COPD. The 12-month RCT compared an oral PPI (lansoprazole) and usual care versus usual care alone. It was conducted at one tertiary care hospital and three secondary care hospitals in Japan. This study recruited participants with a mean age of 75 years, and excluded people with symptoms or history of GERD. No placebo was used in the usual care arm. Among the primary and secondary outcomes of this review, the study only reported data on COPD exacerbations and acute respiratory infections (the common cold). As we only included one study, we could not conduct a meta-analysis. The included study reported that 12 of the 50 people on lansoprazole had at least one exacerbation over a year, compared to 26 out of 50 on usual care (risk ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.81). The frequency of COPD exacerbations per person in a year was also lower in the PPI plus usual care group than in the usual care alone group（0.34 ± 0.72 vs 1.18 ± 1.40; P < 0.001). The number of people with at least one cold over the year was similar in both groups: 26 people on lansoprazole and 27 people in the usual care group. We judged the evidence to be of low to very low certainty, according to GRADE criteria. The study reported no data on pneumonia and other serious adverse events, quality of life, lung function test indices or disease-specific adverse events. The risk of bias was largely low or unclear for the majority of domains, though the performance bias was a high risk, as the study was not blinded.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence identified by this review is insufficient to determine whether treatment with PPIs is a potential option for COPD. The sample size of the included trial is small, and the evidence is low to very low-certainty. The efficacy and safety profile of PPIs for people with COPD remains uncertain. Future large-scale, high-quality studies are warranted, which investigate major clinical outcomes such as COPD exacerbation rate, serious adverse events and quality of life.

### The coordination of breathing and swallowing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1154p33W]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

During deglutition, a strongly preferred exhale-swallow-exhale pattern has been shown in healthy adults. Disruption of this pattern can provoke prandial aspiration. Impaired coordination of breathing and swallowing has been measured in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the exacerbated state, but no reports describe the coordination of breathing and swallowing in stable patients with COPD during oral intake.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that persons with moderate to severe COPD would show disordered coordination of breathing and swallowing during oral intake when compared with a matched, healthy control group.

Methods

This study used a prospective, repeated measures design using 25 subjects with COPD and 25 control subjects. Respiratory inductance plethysmography and nasal thermistry were used simultaneously to track respiratory signals. Submental surface EMG was used to mark the presence of each swallow within the respiratory cycle. Data were recorded while participants randomly and spontaneously swallowed solids and semi-solids.

Measurements and Main Results

Logistic regression showed that participants with COPD swallowed solid food during inhalation more frequently than normal subjects (P = 0.002) and had a significantly higher rate of inhaling after swallowing semi-solid material (P < 0.001). Subjects with COPD also swallowed pudding at low Vt significantly more often than they did the cookie (P = 0.006). Conversely, the control subjects swallowed cookie at low Vt significantly more often than pudding (P = 0.034). Significant differences in deglutitive apnea durations were also found.

Conclusions

Patients with COPD exhibit disrupted coordination of the respiratory cycle with deglutition. Disrupted breathing-swallowing coordination could increase the risk of aspiration in patients with advanced COPD and may contribute to exacerbations.

### Swallowing transit times and valleculae residue in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116aP2g2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study providing detailed analysis of valleculae residue in stable patients with COPD and with no swallowing complaints. The data suggests that the risk for aspiration in COPD population is not limited to the presence of valleculae residue.

Valleculae residue is an important indicator of swallow efficiency and is a significant part of swallow studies. Where large quantities of valleculae residue exist, the individual is at increased risk of aspirating residue during respiration after swallowing. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies have demonstrated that when there is insufficient contact between base tongue and posterior pharyngeal wall, residue remains in the valleculae. In our study, COPD patients presented longer durations of tongue base contact with the posterior pharyngeal wall. Studies by Mokhlesi et al. reported reduced laryngeal elevation during swallow in COPD and an overall altered swallow physiology in the disease. As COPD patients tend to present delayed swallowing reflex and problems with lingual and pharyngeal peristalsis, we suspect that this mechanism may work as a protective physiologic swallowing maneuver, explaining the absence of swallowing complaints and aspiration in our study.

The same hypothesis could account for the longer duration of the pharyngeal transit times in COPD patients. Because the pharynx is a shared pathway for food and air intake, pulmonary protection necessitates a high level of coordination between respiration and swallowing. Palouski et al. have suggested that longer duration of the pressure waves are related to longer bolus transit times and higher pharyngeal residue. According to the authors, these correlations indicate that longer durations of the pressure waves are associated with worse swallow function, suggesting that a longer duration of pressure is need to initiate and maintain bolus transit in the context of reduced pharyngeal pressure. In our study, the longer pharyngeal transit times could mean, at least in stable patients with COPD, that breathing/swallowing events would have more time to reach coordination before the swallowing reflex itself is triggered. The same would not be true for patients with COPD exacerbations. Since exacerbations of COPD are characterized by acute-on-chronic deterioration in respiration, patients are most likely to have difficulties in prolonging swallowing events especially those events that have a close relationship to bringing respiration to a halt.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114ZYs3o]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Sputum production — COPD patients commonly raise small quantities of tenacious sputum, and the classical definition of chronic bronchitis is regular production of sputum for three or more months in two consecutive years (in the absence of any other conditions that may explain it), although this is somewhat arbitrary and does not capture the full range of sputum production in COPD. Sputum production may be difficult to evaluate because patients may swallow sputum, can be intermittent with flare-ups and remission, large volumes may suggest underlying bronchiectasis, and purulent sputum reflects increased inflammatory mediators and may identify the onset of a bacterial exacerbation though the association is relatively weak.

### Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD [^117Na9Bf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We therefore designed a decision analytic model to assess the cost effectiveness of implementing inexpensive swallowing and respiratory sensation assessments (SwaRSA) to identify high-risk COPD participants. The tests included in this evaluation were part of a larger study to assess neuro-motor impairments in people with COPD and healthy ageing. Before, no regular assessment of swallowing difficulties existed for people with COPD. However, rapid swallowing assessment in stroke or other suspicious cases of aspiration commonly require high tech instrumental swallowing evaluations with expensive equipment like video-fluroscopy or fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, and the presence of a qualified specialized speech therapist.

Our SwaRSA decision analytic model includes bed-side tests and a modelled intervention to prevent AECOPD. We believe that early identification of high-risk patients and swallowing co-ordination training may reduce exacerbations in people with COPD.

### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease increases the risk of intensive care unit admittance and mechanical ventilation use among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^113TATJp]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major problem worldwide and a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity. The vast majority of unscheduled visits and hospitalizations for COPD patients can be attributed to acute exacerbations, which are episodes of increased respiratory compromise that contribute to accelerated lung function decline, impaired quality of life, related morbidity and mortality, and increased economic costs.

To date the etiology of one-third of all acute exacerbations remains unclear. One putative risk factor that has gained attention over the past decade for these idiopathic exacerbations is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Earlier studies have reported a high prevalence of GORD among COPD patients, with preliminary data suggesting that gastro-oesophageal reflux may heighten bronchial reactivity in GORD patients through esophago-bronchial reflux and microaspiration, which in turn may precipitate a greater frequency of COPD exacerbations. Because many COPD patients are simultaneously afflicted with GORD, and because GORD has been suggested to exacerbate COPD symptoms, GORD may thus represent a novel risk factor for exacerbations that is highly prevalent in the COPD patient population.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute respiratory failure — invasive ventilation considerations and outcomes: The use of invasive ventilation in patients with very severe COPD is influenced by the likely reversibility of the precipitating event, the patient's wishes, and the availability of intensive care facilities, and major hazards include the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia, barotrauma and volutrauma, and the risk of tracheostomy with prolonged ventilation; acute mortality among COPD patients with respiratory failure is lower than mortality among patients ventilated for non-COPD causes, and a large study reported in-hospital mortality of 17–49%, with further deaths over the next 12 months particularly among those with poor lung function before invasive ventilation (FEV1 < 30% predicted), a non-respiratory comorbidity, or who were housebound, whereas patients without a previously diagnosed comorbidity, with a potentially reversible cause (such as an infection), or who were relatively mobile and not using long-term oxygen did well after ventilator support.

### Post-extubation dysphagia in the ICU-a narrative review: epidemiology, mechanisms and clinical management (update 2025) [^112NfjWq]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Instrumental tools and confirmation of diagnosis

The diagnostic confirmation of dysphagia, as stated above, requires instrumental assessment. Classical screening tools may fail to detect silent aspiration, which is then revealed only in cases of clinical consequence (i.e. aspiration-induced pneumonia/pneumonitis).

Confirming the diagnosis of PED in critically ill patients is performed using two different approaches: 1) Videofluoroscopic swallowing examination (VFSS) or 2) FEES. Additional instrumental measures addressed in the literature include ultrasonography, tissue Doppler imaging, high-resolution manometry and oropharyngo-esophageal scintigraphy (OPES), currently judged not reliable or feasible in the ICU context.

VFSS, also termed "modified barium swallow", investigates all four stages of swallowing and can reveal evidence for intra-deglutitive aspiration, which is not visible in FEES ("white out"-effect due to velum elevation). The key disadvantage is that it cannot be carried out at the bedside in ICUs and it requires (resource-intense) patient transport to radiological suites (with subsequent radiation exposure).

FEES can be performed at the bedside by trained examiners at any time with little equipment, low cost and is associated with low risks overall. Thus, FEES is currently the diagnostic (confirmatory) gold standard in the ICU. This functional examination allows grading according to the severity of disease through direct observation of the swallowing act. The result of the FEES examination is most often graded using the penetration–aspiration scale (PAS). The PAS score assesses how deep material penetrates into the airways (above, up to the level, below the vocal cords), whether material remains in the airways and how forcefully the patient can or cannot remove the material from the airway (coughing). The PAS score can be used for both the VFSS and the FEES.

One important advantage of FEES is that it allows to assess the mechanism of dysphagia, which may allow to classify neurogenic dysphagia into different phenotypes and correlate each of these phenotypes to specific neurological diseases. FEES possesses the advantage for adjustment in patient's diet according to the result of instrumental evaluation. Some authors propose an "integrated FEES report", a comprehensive multi-step approach to contextualize findings of flexible endoscopic evaluation including specific postural interventions during FEES and immediate assessment of their effects. In order to standardize the interpretation of FEES, Curtis et al. established a rating scale, referred to as "Visual Analysis of Swallowing Efficiency and Safety" (VASES).

### Oropharyngeal swallowing physiology and safety in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a consecutive descriptive case series [^1113hX6M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic life-threatening lung disease, with poor prognosis, characterised anatomically by progressive scarring of the lung and symptomatically by exertional dyspnoea, with irreversible loss of pulmonary function.

While the aetiology is unknown, emerging data suggest an important association with aspiration linked with gastric reflux. The term aspiration refers either to the direct inhalation of secretions or ingested materials from the oesophagus or from the oropharynx into the airways. Aspiration by either route can lead to the presence of damaging agents into the airways and the lungs, which is thought to drive the onset and/or progression of a broad range of pathological diseases that affect the airways and lungs. To date, investigations of IPF and aspiration have been limited to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in which gastric content refluxes up into the oesophagus, with the potential to pass into the airway via the pharynx (microaspiration). Concerns about the potential role of gastro oesophageal reflux-associated aspiration in IPF pathophysiology have been sufficient to prompt an influential multi-centre pilot of fundoplication. A dysregulated lung microbiome has also been implicated in high profile studies.

The pharynx is a shared tube for breathing and swallowing. Because of this, normal swallowing is a complex process, coordinated with breathing to protect the airway. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases are at risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia and swallowing difficulties may go unreported. Early evidence suggests 20% of COPD patients have a swallowing impairment, and subclinical aspiration, identified on Videofluoroscopy Swallow Studies (VFSS). Prior study found 44% of COPD patients reported swallowing difficulties symptoms on a patient-reported outcome measure. The parenchymal lung scarring, and hypoxaemia seen in IPF patients may act to disrupt respiratory-swallow coordination leading to dysfunction. Surprisingly we are unaware of studies investigating swallowing dysfunction in people with IPF. The purposes of this study were to explore the perception of swallowing difficulty and oropharyngeal swallowing physiology in people with IPF. This was carried out in outpatients without known or suspected swallowing problems.

### Prognostic risk factors for moderate-to-severe exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic literature review [^115AEWmA]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Based upon disability-adjusted life-years, COPD ranked sixth out of 369 causes of global disease burden in 2019. COPD exacerbations are associated with a worsening of lung function, and increased disease burden and mortality (of those patients hospitalized for the first time with an exacerbation, > 20% die within 1 year of being discharged). Furthermore, patients with COPD consider exacerbations or hospitalization due to exacerbations to be the most important disease outcome, having a large impact on their lives. Therefore, reducing the future risk of COPD exacerbations is a key goal of COPD management.

Being able to predict the level of risk for each patient allows clinicians to adapt treatment and patients to adjust their lifestyle (e.g. through a smoking cessation program) to prevent exacerbations. As such, identifying high-risk patients using measurable risk factors and predictors that correlate with exacerbations is critical to reduce the burden of disease and prevent a cycle of decline encompassing irreversible lung damage, worsening quality of life (QoL), increasing disease burden, high healthcare costs, and early death.

Prior history of exacerbations is generally thought to be the best predictor of future exacerbations; however, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting other demographic and clinical characteristics, including symptom burden, airflow obstruction, comorbidities, and inflammatory biomarkers, also influence risk. For example, in the prospective ECLIPSE observational study, the likelihood of patients experiencing an exacerbation within 1 year of follow-up increased significantly depending upon several factors, including prior exacerbation history, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, gastroesophageal reflux, and white blood cell count.

Many studies have assessed predictors of COPD exacerbations across a variety of countries and patient populations. This systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify and compile the evidence base regarding risk factors and predictors of moderate-to-severe exacerbations in patients with COPD.

### The use of cough peak flow in the assessment of respiratory function in clinical practice – A narrative literature review [^116ynmKU]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cough peak flow (CPF) is a useful clinical measurement to assess neuromuscular activity and effective coordination, yet it is rarely used in clinical practice outside of the management of patients with neuromuscular disorders. A CPF of above 160 L/min is required for an effective cough and less than 270 L/min is associated with increased secretion retention and risk of infection. Reduced CPF can be due to a number of mechanisms including reduced respiratory muscle strength, lack of co-ordination of glottic closure and opening, airway obstruction and, age and activity related changes. CPF has been shown to be correlated with other measures of pulmonary function in neuromuscular disorders and in predicting extubation failure. Patients with Parkinson's disease have a reduced CPF even at early stages and dedicated expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) has been shown to be beneficial. Sequential studies in patient with stroke-associated dysphagia reported CPF was correlated with risk of respiratory infection and results of formal swallow assessments. Age-related changes in expiratory muscle strength and lung physiology contribute to increased risk of aspiration and pneumonia. EMST may have a role in healthy adults to improve muscle strength and effective cough, potentially reducing risk of respiratory tract infections even in the absence of disease. CPF has potential to be extremely useful in clinical practice in a wide spectrum of diseases. In particular, studies in patients with frequent exacerbations of COPD and recurrent pneumonia are currently lacking and would be of benefit to explore the relationship between ineffective cough and recurrent infection.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: developing comprehensive management [^113VFznA]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

The goals of managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include making the correct diagnosis, avoiding further risk (especially by smoking cessation), controlling symptoms (particularly dyspnea), and treating complications. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can obtain substantial symptom relief from medications, including bronchodilators. Prescription of bronchodilators should be guided by the patient's degree of dyspnea, and response to initial therapy. In patients with severe disease and uncontrolled dyspnea, simultaneous use of multiple classes of bronchodilators provides additional benefit. Controlled investigations have found that patient adherence to prescribed therapies is less than optimal even in the best circumstances. Adherence barriers include factors related to the treatment, to the patient, and to the health care practitioner. Understanding these barriers and addressing patient adherence may improve outcomes. Health care practitioners need to develop an optimal working relationship with each patient and focus on their roles as educators and advocates for the patient's health. A collaborative self-management approach recognizes the patient's role in making his or her own health decisions and the physician's role as an educator and facilitator of the patient's health decisions. When multiple therapies are employed, a comprehensive management plan should be developed to help the patient understand and incorporate all the necessary treatments on an ongoing basis. Disease management programs may be useful in assisting health care practitioners and patients in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^1175DeBf]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — problems associated with management — COPD is described as a progressive disease with systemic manifestations and common comorbidities, and optimal management requires a holistic approach with three necessary components: (1) the recognition and treatment of all aspects of the disease, its systemic effects and co-morbidities; (2) the bringing together of all the dimensions of COPD care in a continuum through the lifetime of the patient; and (3) the integration of medical care among healthcare professionals and across healthcare sectors using a patient-centered approach. The comorbidity burden is highlighted: patients with COPD have, on average, 3.7 other chronic medical conditions, compared with 1.8 for patients with other chronic illnesses, and over half of deaths in patients with COPD are from comorbid conditions; the report adds that focusing therapy solely on reversing airway obstruction is suboptimal care and will likely produce suboptimal outcomes.

### Swallowing transit times and valleculae residue in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1157jeb9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breathing and swallowing are physiologically linked to ensure effortless gas exchange during oronasal breathing and to prevent aspiration during swallowing. Studies have indicated consistent aspiration in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mainly related to delayed swallowing reflex and problems with lingual propulsion and pharyngeal peristalsis as a result of bilateral weakness and incoordination of the related muscles. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate swallowing transit times and valleculae residue characteristics of stable COPD patients who have no swallowing complaints.

Methods

Our study population included 20 stable patients with COPD and no swallowing complaints and 20 healthy controls. Swallowing was assessed through videofluoroscopic examination and involved the analysis of the following parameters: (1) pharyngeal stages of deglutition; (2) the duration of bolus movement through the oral cavity and pharynx (i.e. transit times); (3) valleculae residue ratio; (4) penetration/aspiration.

Results

Participants of the study did not present any signs of penetration-aspiration for any of the tested consistencies. Patients with COPD presented longer pharyngeal transit times during the ingestion of the liquid consistency and during the ingestion of the paste consistency. Regarding the duration of tongue base contact with the posterior pharyngeal wall, COPD patients also presented longer durations for the liquid and paste consistencies. No significant difference was observed for the distribution of individuals among the different valleculae residue severity levels.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that stable COPD patients may present physiological adaptations as a protective swallowing maneuver to avoid aspiration/penetration of pharyngeal contents. Moreover, valleculae residue cannot be seen as an isolated factor when trying to explain swallowing alterations in this population.

### Aspiration-related pulmonary syndromes [^114hND8k]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Aspiration of foreign matter into the airways and lungs can cause a wide spectrum of pulmonary disorders with various presentations. The type of syndrome resulting from aspiration depends on the quantity and nature of the aspirated material, the chronicity, and the host responses. Aspiration is most likely to occur in subjects with a decreased level of consciousness, compromised airway defense mechanisms, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and recurrent vomiting. These aspiration-related syndromes can be categorized into airway disorders, including vocal cord dysfunction, large airway obstruction with a foreign body, bronchiectasis, bronchoconstriction, and diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis, or parenchymal disorders, including aspiration pneumonitis, aspiration pneumonia, and exogenous lipoid pneumonia. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, aspiration has been implicated in disease progression and acute exacerbation. Aspiration may increase the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in patients who have undergone a lung transplant. Accumulating evidence suggests that a causative role for aspiration is often unsuspected in patients presenting with aspiration-related pulmonary diseases; thus, many cases go undiagnosed. Herein, we discuss the broadening spectrum of these pulmonary syndromes with a focus on presenting features and diagnostic aspects.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes between aspiration pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111TQgaC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using a national inpatient database in Japan, we compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between AsP and CAP in patients with COPD. The AsP group was more likely to be older, male, have lower BMI, more severe dyspnea, worse levels of consciousness, worse activities of daily life level, and greater severity of pneumonia than the CAP group. Mortality in the AsP group was significantly higher than in the CAP group — even after adjustment for patient backgrounds.

It is well known that there is a high incidence of aspiration in the elderly, and it is an important risk factor in CAP. One study has reported the incidence of aspiration in elderly CAP patients to be 71%, which was significantly higher than control subjects without acute disease (10%). In addition, COPD patients have been found to have a high incidence of impairment of the swallowing reflex, which is a risk factor for exacerbation of COPD and is related to the presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease as a co-morbidity. Further, COPD patients have increased risk of mild cognitive impairment, which is associated with swallowing difficulties. Moreover, patients with COPD have impaired laryngopharyngeal sensitivity, which leads to inability to detect pharyngeal residue and subsequent aspiration of pharyngeal contents. Thus, COPD patients have increased risk of AsP.

### Post-extubation dysphagia in the ICU-a narrative review: epidemiology, mechanisms and clinical management (update 2025) [^1153hMwe]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Behavioural therapy

Behavioural therapy includes postural changes of the body and head during swallowing, aiming to immediate improvement of dysphagia and optimization of bolus flow and rehabilitative swallowing exercises including muscle training targeting a long-term effect. Among these treatments, respiratory mucle strength training (RMST), chin-tuck against resistance, shaker exercises and swallowing exercises/maneuvers (such as the Mendelsohn maneuver) were proposed.

Respective techniques were developed for patients with delayed swallowing reflex or anatomical changes but were validated for stroke patients. However, there is only limited evidence for critically ill patients. One study described a benefit of speech therapies of various types applied at discretion by the involved physiotherapist. The study shows how such therapies favor early progression of oral intake in patients with PED, improve airway management including cough effectiveness and swallowing outcomes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a delay in initiation of speech and language therapy may be associated with adverse outcomes as aspiration-induced pneumonia, persisting dysphagia and death. A recent systematic review analyzed 10 studies (mostly randomized controlled studies) describing the efficacy of interventions on PED. These studies deal mainly with behavioral therapies which might have beneficial effects, but quality of evidence is low.

Rehabilitative interventions

Behavioral therapies are often compensatory in nature but special swallowing techniques and the adoption of special postures may provide therapeutic benefits. Thus, there is some overlap with rehabilitative interventions aiming to enhance swallowing physiology that are widely used. A good example for a therapeutic benefit is respiratory muscle strength training (RMST) which was originally more a behavioural therapy before it was observed that expiratory muscle strength training improves airway safety in swallowing. Later on, it was shown beneficial in a case series with patients suffering from deconditioning associated with tissue loss and might thus represent an additional treatment approach in future.

Pharmacologic interventions

Few works explore the use of pharmacological therapy. It is known from pre-clinical animal studies that topical application of transient receptor potential (TRP) agonists in peripheral swallowing-related regions helps to initiate swallowing reflexes. A clinical approach was based on Transient-Receptor-Potential-Vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) sensory receptor agonists altering sensory perception in the pharynx and initiating a swallowing reflex.

Since capsaicin is a specific agonist to TRPV1 and mediates a dose dependent local release of substance P, it was shown that this positively influences swallowing biomechanics in healthy subjects. Nonetheless, respective medical therapies are not widely used or recommended due to scarce data availability.

### Oropharyngeal deglutition in stable COPD [^111n43pP]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine deglutition in stable patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation.

Design

Twenty consecutive, eligible COPD patients with an FEV(1) ≤ 65% of predicted and a total lung capacity ≥ 120% of predicted were enrolled prospectively.

Intervention

Patients received a detailed videofluoroscopic evaluation of oropharyngeal swallowing and were compared to 20 age-matched and sex-matched historical control subjects.

Setting

An outpatient pulmonary clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

Measurements and Results

The mean total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume for the patients were 128% of predicted, 168% of predicted, and 218% of predicted, respectively. The mean FEV(1) was 39% of predicted. There was no evidence of tracheal aspiration in either group. The laryngeal position at rest measured relative to the cervical vertebrae was not different between groups. The maximal laryngeal elevation during swallowing was significantly lower in patients with COPD (p < 0.001). Patients with COPD exhibited more frequent use of spontaneous protective swallowing maneuvers such as longer duration of airway closure and earlier laryngeal closure relative to the cricopharyngeal opening than did control subjects (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

We conclude that hyperinflated patients with COPD have an altered swallowing physiology. We suspect that the protective alterations in swallowing physiology (swallow maneuvers) may reduce the risk of aspiration. However, these swallowing maneuvers may not be useful during an exacerbation and may require further research.

### Breathing-swallowing discoordination is associated with frequent exacerbations of COPD [^116kWaBe]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Limitations

First, the number of subjects enrolled in our study was relatively small, and only men were included. Further, the observation period may not have been long enough, as the number of exacerbation events was small (48 exacerbation incidents in 65 patients). However, because the average frequency of exacerbation (0.37 per patient year) was almost the same as in previous reports in Japanese patientsand because we found that GER symptoms had a significant impact on frequent exacerbation, we can assume that our observations were consistent and can be extrapolated to other clinical settings. Nevertheless, a large-scale cohort study is required to establish the significance of breathing–swallowing coordination for COPD exacerbation.

Second, breathing–swallowing discoordination was evaluated only once. We do not know if temporal changes exist for breathing–swallowing coordination, whether exacerbation affects breathing–swallowing coordination and whether pulmonary rehabilitation ameliorates breathing–swallowing coordination. Future studies should focus on interventions to improve breathing–swallowing coordination, and prospective evaluations should be conducted to determine whether the improvement of breathing–swallowing coordination decreases the likelihood of exacerbation.

Third, as mentioned above, we did not compare the patients with healthy subjects in the present study. In addition, we could not find a significant association between the I-SW/SW-I rate and a disease-specific index, such as airflow limitation. Breathing–swallowing discoordination occurs even in healthy subjects, and its frequency may increase in older populations or people with certain disease states (eg, Parkinson's disease). Moreover, we do not know the physiological mechanism of breathing–swallowing discoordination. Thus, further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of breathing–swallowing discoordination in patients with COPD.

### Predictors of aspiration pneumonia and mortality in patients with dysphagia [^116NeuEk]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To identify risk factors for pneumonia incidence in patients with dysphagia undergoing a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) in an outpatient tertiary-care center.

Study Design

Historical cohort study.

Methods

All individuals undergoing a VFSS between 10/02/13 and 07/30/15 were identified and followed historically for 2years. Demographic information, medical history, and fluoroscopic data were collected. The 2-year incidence of pneumonia was obtained from the medical records and telephone interview. The incidence of pneumonia and death were calculated and risk factors for pneumonia and mortality were ascertained.

Results

689 patients were followed for 2years. The mean age (± standard deviation) of the cohort was 65 (± 15.5) years. 49% (338/689) were female. The most common causes of dysphagia were cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (270/689), head and neck cancer (175/689), and neurodegenerative disease (56/689). The incidence of pneumonia was 22% (153/689). The incidence of death was 11%. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD] (odds ratio [OR] = 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–4.19), hypertension (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.23–2.73), tracheotomy status (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.09–7.99), and vallecular residue (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.24–2.85) were all significantly associated with an elevated risk of pneumonia. Kidney disease (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–9.9), COPD (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.65–6.49), vallecular residue (OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.35–4.1), male gender (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.25–3.92), and low body mass index (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.06–1.19) were independent adjusted risk factors for death.

Conclusions

The incidence of aspiration pneumonia (22%) and death (11%) within 2-years of a VFSS was high. The greatest adjusted risk factors for incident pneumonia were tracheotomy (OR = 3.0), COPD (OR = 2.4) and vallecular residue (OR = 1.9). The greatest adjusted risk factors for death were COPD (OR = 3.3), vallecular residue (OR = 2.3), and male gender (OR = 2.2).

Palliative care may also provide therapies to relieve the discomfort of shortness of breath or anxiety, education about lifestyle changes, and medication and disease management, and regardless of disease stage or prognosis, all patients with COPD should have patient-centered, advanced care planning discussions, and shared decision making with their primary care provider.

### Adherence to commercial food thickener in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia [^115oAVgP]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment for OD is complex, requiring a combination of multidisciplinary approaches. As part of the therapeutic strategy, commercial thickener (CT) is used to increase liquid viscosity as it decreases swallowing transit speed. This adaptation of fluids aims to preserve the oral route as much as possible, avoiding dehydration, malnutrition and the risk of aspiration secondary to OD. Its use has been shown to reduce laryngeal vestibule penetrations and tracheo-bronchial aspirations. However, there is a related concern with the dislike of thickened water which is possibly accompanied by poor compliance. In relation to this, adherence to CT is a fundamental part of therapeutic intervention, and has been identified as a problem in its management. It has been demonstrated that non-compliance with instructions in OD is followed by adverse effects. In the 1970s Haynes described the terms of a dherence and compliance which are used to study how well a person follows an indicated health or pharmacological treatment. There is still, no clear terminology around the subject and these terms are interspersed in definitions and in practice are interchangeable. In general, adherence is associated with greater patient involvement together with collaboration from the healthcare provider, and with compliance being associated with more passive patient behaviour linked to health-related obedience. There are yet more terms added in this subject such as persistence, which is defined as the time the patient continues treatment, or implementation of treatment defined as the extent to which the actual guideline reported by the patient matches the prescribed one. Particularly in elderly populations factors influencing adherence increase and medication use is not well described despite being a significant cause of morbidity. Overall, there is found to be poor adherence, of 70% in preventive programmes and up to 50% in chronic treatments. Adherence data in OD varies around 22–52% but studies are notably heterogeneous.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111A8mmz]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Older adults — impaired cough, dysphagia, and aspiration risk are interrelated and clinically important. Impaired cough can occur in older adults and is strongly associated with pathologic states, such as neurologic diseases, and in these conditions there is a strong association of impaired cough mechanics and cough sensitivity with dysphagia. The presence of both dysphagia and impaired coughing has been linked to an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, and co-occurrence of these impairments is thought to lead to increased vocal cord penetration and aspiration of pathogen-laden saliva and food materials while impaired coughing reduces the ability of the subject to expectorate this pathogen-laden material, thereby increasing exposure of the airway mucosa to colonization. A proposed model indicates that age-related cognitive decline is associated with the emergence of dysphagia and later dystussia; further declines lead to loss of ambulation and/or impaired consciousness, silent aspiration, and community-acquired pneumonia, with silent aspiration defined as the lack of coughing in response to intrusion of material into the larynx and/or lower airways, and repeated microaspiration leading to chronic airway inflammation, even in the absence of colonization by pathogens, which could enhance the risk of further dysphagia.

### Post-extubation dysphagia in the ICU-a narrative review: epidemiology, mechanisms and clinical management (update 2025) [^1163V5BC]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dysphagia, this includes but is not limited to post extubation dysphagia (PED), is a relevant medical condition observed in many ICU patients. PED currently seems an overlooked medical problem on many ICUs since it is currently not systematically screened for in all ICU patients following extubation. In dysphagia screening-positive cases, a confirmatory specialist exam with instrumental assessment (ideally FEES) should be performed in a timely manner.

Dysphagia treatment should then be performed by an interdisciplinary team (nursing team, ICU physicians, physiotherapy and speech language therapists) with nutritional adjustment and dietary interventions, physiotherapy and speech therapy measures (including compensatory and rehabilitative management approaches), as indicated. In the future, interventional measures, such as e.g. pharyngeal electrical stimulation, might prove suitable treatments for ICU patients with post extubation dysphagia.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^116556kv]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Mouthpiece ventilation (MPV) — The panel reviewed 44 abstracts and selected four studies for review. The desirable effects of MPV are unknown, but potentially include delaying or avoiding tracheostomy and improving speech, cough effectiveness, and the coordination of breathing and swallowing, while undesirable effects were considered trivial with the balance of risk and benefits probably favoring the intervention with very low certainty of the evidence. MPV or sip ventilation allows ventilatory support as needed through an angled mouthpiece and has been used successfully to avoid tracheostomy; progressive bulbar symptoms may limit the use of this option. Access to MPV is not universal, which may promote health inequities. This is counterbalanced by the possible delay or avoidance of tracheostomy, reducing the burden of care. Immediate availability of a handheld resuscitation bag for manual ventilation may be required for technical or ventilator failure, along with patient and caregiver training.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112Y17C9]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — definition and distinguishing features: COPD comprises a combination of chronic and slowly progressive respiratory disorders including emphysema, small airway disease, and chronic bronchitis, is described clinically as persistent respiratory symptoms with significant airflow limitation as measured by reduced maximal expiratory flow during forced exhalation, and is characterized by incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction, which may differ from asthma where airway obstruction is commonly reversible with bronchodilators.
