## Question

There are 10 girls in a class, all with different heights. They want to form a queue so that no girl stands directly between two girls shorter than her. How many ways are there to form the queue?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many ways 10 girls of distinct heights can form a queue such that no girl stands directly between two girls shorter than her. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the constraint means geometrically and how to rephrase it in terms of local maxima. Then, I should verify whether the tallest girl must occupy a specific position and how that constrains the rest of the arrangement. Next, I will consider recursive decomposition into smaller valid queues and check if a Catalan-like structure emerges. After that, I need to count the number of valid placements for the tallest girl and the number of ways to interleave the left and right subsequences. Finally, I will compute the total and double-check the logic against small cases to ensure correctness.

> Let me first interpret the constraint precisely. "No girl stands directly between two girls shorter than her" means that for any three consecutive positions i, i+1, i+2, the middle girl cannot be strictly taller than both neighbors; in other words, the middle girl must not be a local maximum in that triplet. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is a local condition, but it has global consequences for the shape of valid permutations.

> I will now examine the role of the tallest girl. Let me think about where the tallest girl can stand. If she is anywhere except one of the two ends, she will have a neighbor on both sides, and since she is the tallest, both neighbors must be shorter, which violates the constraint. Therefore, the tallest girl must be at one of the two ends of the queue. Wait, let me verify that this is both necessary and sufficient for her position; yes, at an end she has only one neighbor, so she cannot be sandwiched between two shorter girls, satisfying the condition for her.

> Next, I should review the recursive structure. Once the tallest girl is fixed at an end, the remaining 9 girls must themselves form a valid queue of the same kind, because any local violation among them would still violate the original constraint. Let me consider the base case: with 1 girl, there is 1 valid arrangement, which fits the recursive pattern. So, if f(n) is the number of valid queues for n distinct heights, then f(n) = 2 × f(n−1), because the tallest can be at either end and the remaining n−1 girls can be arranged in f(n−1) ways. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might lead to 2ⁿ, but that would ignore the interleaving of left and right subsequences; hold on, I should verify that point before concluding.

> Hold on, I should verify the interleaving issue. When the tallest girl is at an end, the remaining n−1 girls are split into a left and a right subsequence relative to her, but they are not independent — their relative order is constrained by the original height ordering. Let me reconsider: the recursive decomposition is correct, but I need to ensure I'm not overcounting. The key is that once the tallest is fixed at an end, the remaining n−1 girls must be arranged in a single valid queue of length n−1, which is exactly f(n−1), and there are 2 choices for the end position of the tallest, so f(n) = 2 × f(n−1) is indeed correct. I should double-check that this aligns with small cases; f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 4, which matches 2ⁿ⁻¹ for n ≥ 1, so the closed form is f(n) = 2ⁿ⁻¹.

> Now, I will apply this to n = 10. f(10) = 2¹⁰⁻¹ = 2⁹ = 512. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 2⁹ is indeed 512. Therefore, there are 512 valid queues satisfying the condition. But wait, what if I misapplied the recursion? I should confirm that the logic holds for n = 3: with heights 1 < 2 < 3, the valid queues are 123, 132, 213, 312, which are 4 = 2³−1 arrangements, confirming the pattern.

> In summary, I need to ensure the reasoning is tight: the tallest must be at an end, and the remaining n−1 girls must form a valid subqueue, yielding f(n) = 2 × f(n−1) with f(1) = 1, hence f(n) = 2ⁿ⁻¹. For 10 girls, that gives 512 valid queues. I should confirm there are no edge cases or alternative interpretations that would change this; none appear, and the small-case checks support the result.

---

The number of valid queues is **512**. This is because the tallest girl must be at either end, and the remaining 9 girls must be arranged so that no girl is between two shorter girls. This creates a recursive structure where each step doubles the possibilities, leading to (2⁹ = 512) valid arrangements.

---

## Key insight: tallest girl placement

The tallest girl cannot be in the middle of the queue, because she would be between two shorter girls. Thus, she must be at one of the two ends. This gives **2 choices** for her position.

---

## Recursive structure

Once the tallest girl is placed, the problem reduces to arranging the remaining 9 girls with the same constraint. This creates a recursive pattern: for (n) girls, the number of valid queues is 2 × the number of valid queues for (n-1) girls.

---

## Base case

For 1 girl, there is only **1 valid queue** (the girl herself).

---

## General formula

The number of valid queues for (n) girls is (2ⁿ⁻¹). For (n = 10), this gives (2⁹ = 512).

---

## Verification with smaller cases

- **For (n = 2)**: (2²⁻¹ = 2) valid queues (AB, BA).
- **For (n = 3)**: (2³⁻¹ = 4) valid queues (ABC, ACB, BAC, CBA).
- **For (n = 4)**: (2⁴⁻¹ = 8) valid queues.

These small cases match the formula, supporting its correctness.

---

## Conclusion

The number of valid queues for 10 girls is **512**.

### How sociophenomenology of the body problematises the 'problem-oriented approach' to growth hormone treatment [^2ddcd606]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

This article examines how people who are shorter than average make sense of their lived experience of embodiment. It offers a sociophenomenological analysis of 10 semistructured interviews conducted in the Netherlands, focusing on if, how, and why height matters to them. It draws theoretically on phenomenological discussions of lived and objective space, intercorporeality and norms about bodies. The analysis shows that height as a lived phenomenon (1) is active engagement in space, (2) coshapes habituated ways of behaving and (3) is shaped by gendered norms and beliefs about height. Based on this analysis, the article challenges what we label as the 'problem-oriented approach' to discussions about growth hormone treatment for children with idiopathic short stature. In this approach, possible psychosocial disadvantages or problems of short stature and quantifiable height become central to the ethical evaluation of growth hormone treatment at the expense of first-hand lived experiences of short stature and height as a lived phenomenon. Based on our sociophenomenological analysis, this paper argues that the rationale for giving growth hormone treatment should combine medical and psychological assessments with investigations of lived experiences of the child. Such an approach would allow considerations not only of possible risks or disadvantages of short stature but also of the actual ways in which the child makes sense of her or his height.

### Sex-specific longitudinal modeling of short-term power in 11-to 18-year-olds [^2e61d825]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

The models show that changes in PP and MP with age are associated with sex-specific and maturity status-driven increases in FFM. FFM increases by ~90% and ~40% in boys and girls, respectively, from 11 to 16 yr. The influence of sex-specific maturity status on FFM is evidenced by % changes in FFM being at their peak around the time of peak height velocity (PHV). Boys' FFM increases by ~83% over the period 2 yr pre-PHV to 2 yr post-PHV. The greatest increase in girls' FFM (~31%) occurs over a shorter 2-yr period centered on PHV and then levels-off. Boys' muscle mass reaches ~54% of body mass at 18 yr, whereas, in girls, muscle mass is ~45% of body mass at 13 yr and then, in relative (but not absolute) terms, declines because of fat accumulation in puberty.

Short-term cycling power is primarily developed from the leg muscles and sex differences in PP can, at least partially, be attributed to girls having ~70% of the leg muscle mass of boys by the end of adolescence. The maximum force exerted by a muscle is reliant on the number of sarcomeres arranged in parallel and is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle or the square of the linear dimensions (l²). Power is the product of force (l²) and velocity. The velocity of muscle shortening depends on the number of sarcomeres in series and is directly proportional to the length (l) of the muscle. Power is therefore related to l³ and is likely to be best represented by the active muscle volume. In two multilevel modeling investigations the thigh muscle volume of 10- to 12-yr-olds and 12- to 14-yr-olds, respectively, was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, on two occasions 1 yr apart. One study used the WAnT to determine PP and MP and the other determined OPP. The multilevel models demonstrated that in both boys and girls thigh muscle volume made a significant, additional contribution to explaining sex differences and changes in OPP, PP, and MP with age over and above those attributed to body mass.

### Diminishing benefits of urban living for children and adolescents' growth and development [^a9469af8]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

For the cases in which we have observations for at least two different time points, this improper prior will not lead to an improper posterior because the data will provide information about the mean and slope. In order to enforce the desired orthogonality between the linear and nonlinear portions of the model, we constrained the mean and slope of the's', s and's and ofto be zero.

For the six countries with no height data, and seven countries with no BMI data, we took the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of P, setting to infinity those eigenvalues that correspond to the non-identifiability. This effectively constrained the non-identified portions of the model to zero, as the corresponding variances are set to zero; in this case the Rue and Held correctionis not needed. An intermediate case occurs when data are observed for only one time point in a country. In this case, the full conditional precision has rankbecause the mean but not the linear trend ofis identified by the data. We therefore constrained the linear trend ofto zero by taking the generalized inverse of the full conditional precision. We then constrained the mean ofto zero using the one-dimensional version of the Rue and Held correction.

Age model

To capture sex-specific patterns of growth, especially adolescent growth spurts, we modelled age using cubic splines. The number and position of the knots of the splines were selected on the basis of a combination of physiological and statistical considerations, as described in a national level analysis. For age group h with age z h, in study i, the age effect for height and BMI is given, respectively, as follows:

For height, four spline knots were placed at ages {for girls and at ages {, for boys. For BMI, we used two spline knots (at ages 10 and 15 years) because, at the population level, changes in BMI with age are smoother than those in height. Each of the spline coefficients was allowed to vary across countries, with a hierarchical structure as described in a previous paper, using the equation below, whereis the global intercept, andare the country, region and super-region random intercepts, respectively. The k th age effect coefficients for study i for each age group h, with age z h, are given as follows:

A flat improper prior was placed on each of the's.

Puberty — testosterone trajectory and timing: From the minipuberty period until puberty, testosterone concentrations are similar between the sexes and then diverge with up to 30-fold increases in boys by 18 yr; the onset of puberty typically occurs around age 10 yr for girls (range, 8–13 yr) and at age 11.5 yr in boys (range, 9–14 yr) in the United States; pubertal development before age 7 yr in White girls and before age 6 yr in Black girls is considered precocious or early; puberty features a growth spurt with peak height velocity age 11.5 yr in girls and 13.5 yr in boys.

Understanding training age and the importance of RTSC allows for developmentally appropriate, progressive training, and with earlier participation a 10-year-old girl may already have 3 years of resistance-training experience versus a 14-year-old boy who is a beginner and has a resistance training age of 0.

Sex steroid priming before provocative GH testing — We suggest sex steroid priming prior to provocative GH testing in prepubertal boys older than 11 and in prepubertal girls older than 10 years with AH progressing within −2 SD of the reference population mean in order to prevent unnecessary GH treatment of children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (Conditional recommendation, ●●○○). Best available evidence exists for boys; evidence is extrapolated to girls. A reasonable approach in both boys and girls would be 2 mg (1 mg for body weight < 20 kg) of β-estradiol orally on each of the 2 evenings preceding the test; alternatively, boys can be primed with intramuscular testosterone 50–100 mg of a depot formulation administered 1 week before the test. This recommendation applies to GH-naïve patients; it does not retroactively apply to patients already on GH treatment.

### Height matters-from monogenic disorders to normal variation [^b38b6960]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Height is a classic polygenic quantitative trait with a high level of heritability. As it is a simple and stable parameter to measure, height is a model for both common, complex disorders and monogenic, Mendelian disease. In this Review, we examine height from the perspective of monogenic and complex genetics and discuss the lessons learned so far. We explore several examples of rare sequence variants with large effects on height and compare these variants to the common variants identified in genome-wide association studies that have small effects on height. We discuss how copy number changes or genetic interactions might contribute to the unidentified aspects of the heritability of height. We also ask whether information derived from genome-wide association studies on specific loci in the vicinity of genes can be used for further research in clinical paediatric endocrinology. Furthermore, we address key challenges that remain for gene discovery and for the transition of moving from genomic localization to mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on using next-generation sequencing to identify causative variants of people at the extremes of height distribution.

### The limits of normal approximation for adult height [^3d3f1ac2]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Adult height inspired the first biometrical and quantitative genetic studies and is a test-case trait for understanding heritability. The studies of height led to formulation of the classical polygenic model, that has a profound influence on the way we view and analyse complex traits. An essential part of the classical model is an assumption of additivity of effects and normality of the distribution of the residuals. However, it may be expected that the normal approximation will become insufficient in bigger studies. Here, we demonstrate that when the height of hundreds of thousands of individuals is analysed, the model complexity needs to be increased to include non-additive interactions between sex, environment and genes. Alternatively, the use of log-normal approximation allowed us to still use the additive effects model. These findings are important for future genetic and methodologic studies that make use of adult height as an exemplar trait.

### Child with suspected short stature [^c5f8ec97]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

### Dietary intake and sleep in late childhood-do shorter children have distinct patterns? [^037c23e0]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 111 pre-adolescents participated in the study: 32 boys and 31 girls in the case groups, and 24 boys and 24 girls in the control groups. One girl from the case group was excluded from the analysis due to extremely low caloric intake according to the 3-day food diary (average of 371 Kcal/day), probably due to underreporting.

Table 1 presents clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants. The median ages of the boys and girls in the case groups (11.5 and 10.2 years, respectively) were about one year above those of the control groups (10.2 and 9.7 years, respectively) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). As expected from the group eligibility criteria, height-Z, weight-Z, and BMI-Z scores were lower in the case than the control groups (P < 0.001). The mean values of mid-parental height (MPH) (cm and Z-scores) were also lower in the case than the control groups (P = 0.004 for boys and P < 0.001 for girls). Of note, in the case groups, the MPH Z-scores were higher than the children's height-Z scores (P < 0.001 for both boys and girls); while in the control groups, MPH-Z scores were similar to the children's height-Z scores (P > 0.05 for both boys and girls). The differences between MPH-Z score and the children's height-Z score were significantly higher in the case than the control groups (P < 0.001 for both boys and girls). The SEP index scores were above average and similar in the case and the control groups (P = 0.569 for boys and P = 0.886 for girls).

### Height deficit during and many years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children: a review [^8558b224]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

There are conflicting data on the incidence and severity of height deficits in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This is probably due to: (1) collection of data in different phases of treatment; (2) differences in chemotherapeutic regimens; (3) inclusion or not of children who had received cranial irradiation (CRT); (4) limited numbers of patients; (5) relative numbers of prepubertal and pubertal children; (6) different ways of measuring growth deficits. Twenty-five papers published between 1987 and 2006 were reviewed. These reveal that (1) chemotherapy always causes some height reduction during treatment regardless of whether additional CRT is given; (2) catch-up growth occurs immediately after cessation of treatment; (3) intensive chemotherapy alone significantly decreases height in the long-term but to a lesser extent than with additional CRT; (4) young children develop more severe height loss; (5) girls are reported to have greater height deficits but confounding factors have not been adequately considered; (6) late growth hormone (GH) deficiency has been detected in many children, mostly in those who had CRT; (7) GH replacement therapy seems to be effective. ALL relapse in GH-treated children is not more common than in those not treated with GH.

### Dietary intake and sleep in late childhood-do shorter children have distinct patterns? [^b9b08ca0]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The exceptional growth rate during adolescence demands increased dietary intake. We aimed to compare diet and lifestyle of pre-adolescents with height and weight below the 10 th percentile, with those of pre-adolescents of higher height and weight.

Methods

This case-control study included healthy pre-pubertal girls (≥ 9 years) and boys (≥ 10 years). The case groups included 31 girls and 32 boys with height and weight < 10th percentile, and weight percentile ≤ height percentile. The control groups comprised 24 girls and 24 boys, with height ≥ 25th percentile, BMI 5th–85th percentiles. Participants completed 3-day food diaries and lifestyle-related questionnaires.

Results

Energy intake/estimated-requirement and protein/body-weight were comparable in the case and control groups, both in boys and girls. In boys, fat (P = 0.050) and carbohydrate (P ≤ 0.001) intakes/body-weight were higher in the case group versus controls; and iron (P < 0.001), zinc (P = 0.005), vitamin A (P < 0.001), calcium (P = 0.005), and vitamin C (P = 0.034) consumption were lower. In girls, carbohydrate/body-weight was higher in the case group compared to controls (P = 0.007); micronutrient intake was comparable, and lower than recommended. Compared to controls, short and thin boys reported less sleep during weekdays (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Relatively short, thin pre-adolescents may have distinct dietary intake and sleeping patterns compared to taller peers, especially boys.

Impact

Nutrition is a key environmental determinant of childhood growth. Not much is known about late nutritional impact on growth in children whose anthropometric indices are below the 10th percentile.
We compared food diaries and lifestyle questionnaires of pre-pubertal pre-adolescents with height < 10th percentiles and weight ≤ height for age and sex, with those of peers with indices in higher percentiles.
We found distinct differences in micronutrient intakes and sleep duration in the shorter boys, but no energy deficit in either sex.
We suggest that diet and lifestyle parameters should be evaluated in children with relatively low anthropometric indices, to ensure optimal growth.

### Guidelines for growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I treatment in children and adolescents: growth hormone deficiency, idiopathic short stature, and primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency [^1dec2910]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) — diagnostic testing and assay/priming guidance: We recommend that institutions require laboratories to provide harmonized GH assays using the somatropin standard, IRP IS 98/574, 22k rGH isoform, and adopt uniform calibration standards. Given false positives, inadequate response to two different provocative tests is required for diagnosis of GHD, and GH responses to provocative testing are blunted in obese or overweight individuals. We suggest sex steroid priming prior to provocative GH testing in prepubertal boys older than 11 and in prepubertal girls older than 10 years to avoid unnecessary GH treatment; a reasonable priming approach is 2 mg (1 mg for body weight < 20 kg) of β-estradiol orally on each of the 2 evenings preceding the test, or intramuscular testosterone (50–100 mg) 1 week before the test. This recommendation applies to GH-naive patients.

### Blood pressure tables for Chinese adolescents: justification for incorporation of important influencing factors of height, age and sex in the tables [^c0bc2aeb]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Matching and grouping

Because the relationships of BP with both age and height are nonlinear, the conventional regression model is not suitable to investigate effect of each variable (sex, age and height) on BP. In the present study, we used a matching and a grouping technique to examine the role of sex, age, and height in BP levels, respectively. To assess the effect of sex on BP, each boy was regarded as a potential subject and was individually and randomly matched to a girl of the same age and same height (within ± 1.0 cm). To evaluate the role of age on BP, each student in the 12-year-old group was regarded as a potential subject and was individually and randomly matched to 5 subjects from the 13- to 17-year-old groups with the same sex and same height (within ± 1.0 cm). Height of each sex and each age group was divided into eight height groups - ~5 th, ~10 th, ~25 th, ~50 th, ~75 th, ~90 th, ~95 th, and 95 th ~ percentiles- to estimate its influence on BP.

Statistical analysis

SPSS Statistics 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and Microsoft Excel 2007 software were used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics for height, SBP and DBP were calculated for all age groups in each sex and expressed as mean ± s.d. Before matching, the differences in BP mean values between boys and girls were determined using Student's t -test; and the differences in BP among six age groups were tested using one-way analysis of variance, and between-group differences were analyzed post-hoc using the SNK-q method. After matching, Paired t test was used to compare the differences in BP between boys and girls; and two-way analysis of variance was used to test the differences in BP among six age groups, and SNK-q method was used to analyze between-group differences. In order to investigate the effect of height on BP, Spearman's correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship of height percentile with BP.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with girls and women [^a632214e]. The American Psychologist (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 2 — Psychologists strive to be aware that girls and women form their identities in contexts with multiple, contradictory, and changing messages about what it means to be female, and application guidance states that psychologists strive to recognize and communicate how gender expectations come about and how stereotypes of gender may influence the overall health and well-being of girls and women in the U.S. and internationally. Psychologists endeavor to be attuned to connections with sociocultural factors, multiple and intersecting group memberships, and individual difference variables that may influence the degree to which a girl or woman internalizes societal pressure to regulate her behavior according to often inflexible gender standards. Identity development is described as arising from unique contexts, including country and region of origin, family, neighborhood, and community and multiple group memberships such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, body size, and ability status, and girls and women of color and those raised outside of the U.S. may especially have to integrate a complex and sometimes contradictory set of messages or ideologies related to gender. Examples indicate that Black girls' prescriptive gender roles include both communal characteristics such as nurturance and caretaking and agentic characteristics such as self-reliance and assertiveness; that girls and women who were assigned male at birth, genderqueer girls and women, and other nonbinary girls and women face particular challenges tied to linguistic limitations of the gender binary alongside socially constructed expressions of gender fluidity; and that Black and Latina young women may encounter competing and contradictory messages about being sexy and sexual that are multiplied and quite possibly confusing. In applied practice, a psychologist, in this example, should not only bring nuance to girls' and women's prescriptions for acting female and being sexy but also help clients make conscious choices about their identity, with efforts that work to create identity safety for all girls and women because contexts which recognize and affirm a broad range of identities and differences can offset threats related to negative stereotypes, and a strengths-based approach recognizes that talking about identity, prescriptions, and proscriptions can increase a client's identity safety and enhance the therapeutic relationship.

### CDC newsroom… [^40d59d30]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

She was embarrassed and thought she hadn't done enough to stop it. With her permission, I treated her physical injuries and met with her university about how they could support her and how they can create protective environments within the school. All of these moments have heightened my belief that we must meet youth where they are and provide the tools and resources that are needed for lasting change. These are critical lifelines for students. They are also part of CDC's What Works in Schools program. And research has shown that schools that implement the program see significant benefits for their students, and addresses many of the concerning trends we see in this data. I'd like to now turn it over to Anna King, president of the National PTA, to provide additional perspectives about these findings. She played sports. She ran track and basketball. She was a dancer, and she was a cheerleader. We never knew what signs were, or what to look for. And that was extremely important to us.

I'm urging our families to come together, look for signs, look for ways that you can have these conversations with your children. Operator Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one and record your name. Your name is required to introduce your question. And please limit your question to just one question for today. Our first question does come from Sarah Toy with WSJ, your line is open. Journalist Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to just ask, you know, what makes girls particularly vulnerable to these mental health issues. And what can we do specifically to prevent and treat these issues in young girls. Mr. Haynes Next question, please. Operator Our next question comes from Adrianna Rodriguez with USA Today. Your line is open. Journalist Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I did notice that the survey did not include a question assessing gender identity.

I was wondering why that is or maybe if future reports will include trans and non-binary students. Thank you. Because that takes that whole village of wrapping its arms around our children, especially our girls right now. Our girls are faced with so many things. And it's important that they feel comfortable with speaking because they speak with each other, peer-to-peer. And if you notice that they have friends, and they're talking to their friends instead of you, it's important to get to know their friends' parents as well so you can get together and educate yourself on what to look for to help them.

### Dietary intake and sleep in late childhood-do shorter children have distinct patterns? [^28c96a98]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle parameters

Among the boys, for the case compared to the control group, the median sleep duration was shorter during weekdays (8.8 vs. 9.5 hours/day, P < 0.001). No other differences were found between these two groups, in PAL, and in the quality-of-life questionnaires. Among the girls, such differences were not found between the case and control groups (Table 4). Logistic regression models showed that for boys, being in the case group was associated with shorter sleep duration during weekdays [OR = 0.22, 95%CI (0.06, 0.78)]. For girls, being in the case group was associated with shorter sleep duration during the weekend [OR = 0.30, 95%CI (0.10, 0.87)] (Table 3, model 4).

### Stunting: methodological considerations for improved study design and reporting [^7eeb5ade]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Stunting is a paediatric nutritional disorder characterised by short stature, typically presenting in the first few years of life. In recent decades, stunting has become a subject of worldwide concern and a major focus for global development targets. Stunting is closely associated with important indicators across the lifespan, including early child development, school attainment, adult economic productivity and risk factors for noncommunicable chronic diseases.

BMJ Paediatrics Open receives a large number of submissions on stunting, and we are committed to publishing high-quality research on this critical global health topic.

We have identified several recurring methodological considerations which should be addressed to improve the quality and impact of submissions.

1. The primary stunting measure is a continuous, normally distributed variable: height/length-for-age. Stunting can also be categorically defined as height/length more than 2 SD below the population mean on the WHO Child Growth Standards. We see many observational studies exploring factors associated with stunting which use a categorical stunting definition, as well as randomised clinical trials which use categorically defined stunting as a clinical trial endpoint.
However, in both of these scenarios — where the focus is on determinants of short stature and individual measures are available — categorisation is usually not the best analytical strategy. Converting a continuous into a categorical variable results in significant loss of statistical power. For example, even in a simple linear regression with a linear relationship, n = 100 and R = 0.26, the p value for the independent variable rises from 0.01 to 0.1 when dichotomised. For this reason, it is usually preferable in the scenarios described to use ordinary least squares regression on continuous height/length-for-age.
One common defence of dichotomisation is that the OLS method regresses only on the mean height/length, and we may be more interested in children who are very small (or possibly very large) for their age. One powerful but underused approach in this scenario would be quantile regression, which models the conditional distribution of the continuous stunting variable (similar to OLS regression) but then, importantly, lets us look at any quantiles of height/length-for-age. The resulting models may look quite different at these different quantiles, providing important and fine-grained information across the spectrum of height/length-for-age or, indeed, any other anthropometric indicator. For example, in prior work on low birth weight, one of the authors demonstrated how the predictors of birth weight in the 10th percentile were quite different from those at the mean.
An additional point here is that, for whichever regression method is chosen for continuous height/length, restricted cubic splines of continuous independent variables (such as age) should be considered to allow for curvilinear relationships. These are not intuitive to interpret, but can be very valuable.
Finally, it is important to note that there are multiple scenarios where individual measures of height/length are not the primary focus of analysis, and these remain situations where use of a dichotomised stunting variable is the appropriate choice. Examples might include meta-analyses of changes in stunting rates globally, monitoring of progress toward Sustainable Development Goal targets, and the like.
2. Stunting is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon and the expected impact of any intervention will likely be small, often in the range of a difference of 0.1 SD or less in between-groups comparisons. Given the large body of published scientific evidence on stunting, it is ethically imperative that any new clinical trials be realistically powered to detect meaningful differences. This can be best assured by well-argued sample size and power calculations that take effect size and variance estimates from convincingly similar pilot study populations and intervention conditions. On the other hand, we often see power calculations based on comparisons to populations with fundamentally different demographics or baseline prevalence of stunting.
3. When multiple measurement points are available for subjects in a growth data set, a statistical analytical approach that appropriately incorporates multiple measures should be employed. Often we observe approaches that somewhat arbitrarily compare a single early measure to a later measure, ignoring any growth data that may have been collected at intermediate points. Such an approach may be appropriate under limited circumstances, such as a randomised controlled trial. However, in general and for observational studies in particular, multilevel models and other repeated measure approaches should be used, as they take full advantage of all existing data and are more robust to missing data.
4. Contemporary analyses of stunting should appropriately reference the WHO Child Growth Standards and comparative analyses must account for risk factors considered by the Growth Standards. The WHO's Multicentre Growth Reference Study was a major milestone in global paediatrics, which showed that young children in diverse settings and from diverse backgrounds exhibit similar linear growth in the absence of major risk factors such as extreme poverty, lack of exclusive breastfeeding, etc. The growth standards have been criticised for minimising between-population and between-country variation in child linear growth, and there is some merit to this criticism. However, we frequently review country-specific and region-specific analyses which attempt to contrast to the WHO Growth Standards through convenience or centre-based samples which are neither population representative nor rigorously matched for the relevant risk factors accounted for by the Growth Standards.
5. Height/length deficit may be a useful additional measure for assessing changes in linear growth over time. On the WHO's Child Growth Standards height/length curves, the measurement variance increases significantly from 0 to 5 years of age. Since the z score is calculated as the difference between the measured height/length and the median height/length divided by the population SD, increasing variance with age means that negative z-scores will drift upward towards the median over time even when the absolute height/length deficit remains constant or worsens. Others have argued that absolute height deficit may be a more important measure here, especially when the research question involves the possibility of catch-up growth.
6. Stunting may not be a useful proxy for cognitive development. A major reason for the global focus on stunting is the close associations between stunting and early child development, school attainment and adult cognition and economic productivity. Given the relative ease of measuring linear growth, stunting is therefore often used as a proxy for these outcomes. However, the biological evidence that these outcomes are primarily mediated by stunting is not completely convincing; in fact a recent analysis of multiple birth cohorts has shown that the association between linear growth and adult IQ largely disappears when controlling for child IQ. Therefore, studies of stunting, especially when conducted prospectively, should generally attempt to include a direct measure of early child development.

### Recent progress in the study of the genetics of height [^d4146b01]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Adult height is a classic polygenic trait of high narrow-sense heritability (h² = 0.8). In the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, variation in adult height was used as a model to set the foundation of the fields of statistics and quantitative genetics. More recently, with our increasing knowledge concerning the extent of genetic variation in the human genome, human geneticists have used genome-wide association studies to identify hundreds of loci robustly associated with adult height, providing new insights into human growth and development, and into the architecture of complex human traits. In this review, I highlight the progress made in the last 2 years in understanding how genetic variation controls height variation in humans, including non-Caucasian populations and children.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^64058132]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Growth disorders and their management — growth hormone (GH): We recommend offering GH treatment early, noting it can be offered from as young as 2 years of age when there is evidence of growth failure, short stature, or likelihood of short stature, and GH treatment may be offered later as long as epiphyses remain open (⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest GH treatment may be continued until little growth potential remains, defined as bone age ≥ 14 years and/or height velocity < 2 cm year⁻¹, and there is no physiological rationale for continuing GH treatment into the transition period after epiphyseal closure (⊕⊕⊕○). We recommend a starting GH dose of 45–50 μg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ or (1.3–1.5 mg m⁻² day⁻¹).

### Negotiating uncertainties: care-seeking in an algorithmic society [^822a9835]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

I did a risk assessment. It seems [to be a reliable website]. You can read reviews [from buyers]. It is quite easy on the Internet to get translations from all languages. Other transgender people from other parts of Europe and people in Sweden have ordered from the same place. There is a company number, seems to be a Greek company that exists, and has a postal address. But absolutely it's a gamble.

He ordered the medication online because he knew that many transgender people needed to wait for a long time and go through a tedious assessment process before having the medication prescribed. A reluctance to be at the mercy of the healthcare system is understandable to him. For Eric, gender dysphoria is not a disease but a matter of social category. Being unable to know how much longer one has to wait for a medical intervention and undergoing potentially humiliating assessments, in his opinion, were problematic aspects of transgender care (cf.). He did a background check on the seller's credentials and reviews from other buyers. He could not read Greek but was able to read the millilitres, concentration and some chemical terms thanks to his medical training. As stated in the above quote, he understands that buying testosterone from the internet carries certain risks, because it is difficult to know the medicine quality until they are used. However, an extensive scholarship on narratives of illness has shown that care-seeking is more than finding a medical solution. In Eric's case, there is a choice to be made between staying in a health system where individuals queue to be put into fixed medical categories to receive care services, or looking elsewhere for alternatives to circumvent the rigid formal health system. Eric chose the latter. For him, it is a 'gambling' act, but worth the risk.

### Association between adverse early life factors and telomere length in middle and late life [^d0661a34]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

The body size and height during childhood and adolescence have been rarely linked to TL in adulthood with consistent conclusion in previous studies. A birth cohort study with 832 individuals aged 49 to 51 years old showed a positive correlation between the height at the age of 9 and their TL in adulthood among females but not males. In contrast, an additional cross-sectional investigation encompassing 330 boys and 393 girls aged 5 to 12 years showed a positive correlation between the boys' height, but not girls', and TL at their current age. Based on our findings, it appeared that individuals with a shorter stature at the age of 10 exhibited a shorter TL during middle and late adulthood compared to those with average or greater height at that time. This finding suggested that being shorter than one's peers in childhood and adolescence could potentially be an unfavorable early life factor that was linked to shorter TL in middle and late life. Similarly, individuals who were relatively thinner than their peers at age 10 may experience certain disadvantages in early life that were related to TL in middle to late life, in contrast to those who were plumper or of average weight albeit such relationship was even diminished after controlling for potential confounding factors. A study comprising 406 healthy Chinese children aged 6 to 11 years revealed a positive correlation between skeletal muscle mass and bone mass with leukocyte TL. This finding may provide support for our own that being thinner than peers at the age of 10 was a detrimental factor associated with a shorter TL in middle age and later years. Nevertheless, cross-sectional studies and meta-analyses have indicated a potential correlation between obesity and reduced TL in children and adolescents. Regarding the relationship between height and size in adolescence and TL in middle and late life, there is currently no consensus; therefore, additional extensive and high-quality studies would be warranted in the future.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^3c8f4211]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV₁ (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.
