## Question

can botox be used for bells palsy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Botox (botulinum toxin) can be used for Bell's palsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and phases of Bell's palsy. Then, I should verify the evidence-based acute-phase treatments. Next, I will examine the role of botulinum toxin in chronic sequelae such as synkinesis and asymmetry, including timing and patient selection. After that, I need to review efficacy endpoints, duration of benefit, and injection strategy. Finally, I should assess safety, contraindications, and practical multidisciplinary care to synthesize a clear recommendation anchored to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and trajectory of Bell's palsy so I don't jump to conclusions about when to intervene; most patients have acute unilateral LMN facial weakness that peaks within 72 hours, about 70–80% recover spontaneously by 3 weeks to 3 months, and a meaningful minority develop longer-term sequelae such as synkinesis, contractures, and persistent asymmetry that may justify targeted rehabilitation or chemodenervation later in the course [^113sYirL] [^111PPGVi].

> I should confirm the acute-phase standard of care before discussing Botox; high-credibility guidelines consistently recommend corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset to improve the probability of recovery, and while antivirals have been studied, benefit beyond steroids appears uncertain on rigorous review, so steroids are first-line and time-sensitive, whereas botulinum toxin is not part of acute management protocols [^111YrahE] [^114cDhH1] [^113rL6V2].

> Now, let me consider the specific role of botulinum toxin; wait, I need to be precise here because it treats consequences rather than the underlying neuritis, with evidence supporting its use in chronic or post-recovery sequelae like synkinesis, hyperkinesis, and asymmetry to improve function and quality of life, and multidisciplinary sources explicitly incorporate targeted botulinum toxin injections into comprehensive care for longstanding deficits after incomplete recovery [^1175vDaR] [^114V4evv] [^113j2nSu] [^11731BDP].

> Hold on, I should verify timing and selection so I don't misapply it; I initially thought "Botox is contraindicated in the acute phase", but let me reconsider and be more accurate — there is no evidence-based role for botulinum toxin in the acute inflammatory phase and it is generally avoided early, which is better framed as "not indicated" rather than an absolute contraindication, with consideration emerging in the chronic phase (typically after 3–6 months) for persistent synkinesis, hyperactivity, or asymmetry, and early treatment of synkinesis within about 12 months may yield greater improvements on objective grading, although patient-reported outcomes can improve even later [^114cDhH1] [^112jeEQD] [^113j2nSu].

> I will now examine mechanism and injection strategy; botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release to induce temporary chemodenervation of overactive muscles, and in facial palsy it is often used strategically on the non-paralyzed side to dampen contralateral hyperkinesis and restore symmetry or in targeted synkinetic muscle groups, with product units not interchangeable and dosing individualized by anatomy and goals of symmetry and function [^115TwASn] [^113ceLxn] [^114DiVun].

> Next, I should review expected efficacy and duration so expectations are realistic; objective measures like brow height or teeth show may show modest gains while patient-reported outcomes and social functioning frequently improve, effects typically last around 12 weeks necessitating repeat injections, and flexible intervals tailored to waning of effect are reasonable within safety limits [^11731BDP] [^116RGvJh] [^11594S5v].

> I need to check safety and precautions carefully; local weakness at injection sites is expected, distant spread is rare at therapeutic doses, cumulative adult dosing should stay within label limits, and caution is warranted in neuromuscular junction disorders and in those with preexisting dysphagia, while I initially said "pregnancy is contraindicated", I should correct that — use in pregnancy is not absolutely contraindicated but should be reserved for situations where benefits outweigh potential risks per labeling and animal data [^1157u8tp] [^114DiVun] [^115dE85F] [^116eYYkY].

> Let me verify immunogenicity risk and treatment durability over time; neutralizing antibody formation with BoNT-A across indications is overall low and appears lowest with lower-dose, less frequent aesthetic or focal craniofacial uses compared with high-dose dystonia or spasticity settings, though minimizing unnecessary booster injections and adhering to adequate intervals helps reduce immunogenicity and secondary nonresponse [^115MNuzV] [^114N8JdB].

> But wait, I should also integrate rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care rather than present Botox in isolation; targeted facial physical therapy remains central for movement retraining, eye protection measures are essential early, guidelines caution against electrotherapy and forced exercise, and there is evolving, mixed-quality evidence that structured therapy improves outcomes with some exploratory work combining BoNT-A and therapy in select contexts [^113j2nSu] [^117UbajD] [^111eaaHP].

> I should confirm how we will measure outcomes and decide who benefits; validated scales such as House-Brackmann for global function and the Facial Grading System or synkinesis-specific tools can track change, and notably earlier BoNT-A for synkinesis within a year showed larger improvements on FGS, which supports timely referral once aberrant reinnervation emerges and persists despite conservative measures [^1115ynSS] [^112jeEQD].

> Synthesizing this, my recommendation is as follows — yes, botulinum toxin can be used for Bell's palsy, but not for the acute inflammatory phase; instead, consider it in the chronic phase for troublesome synkinesis, hyperactivity, or asymmetry that impairs function or psychosocial well-being, ideally within a multidisciplinary program that also includes eye care and tailored facial therapy, with realistic expectations about benefit durability, careful dosing by an experienced injector, and adherence to safety guidance and standard acute-phase steroid therapy at onset to optimize overall recovery [^114cDhH1] [^111YrahE] [^113j2nSu] [^114V4evv].

---

Botox (botulinum toxin type A) is used for Bell's palsy, but only for **chronic sequelae** such as synkinesis, facial asymmetry, and hyperkinesis, not for acute paralysis [^113j2nSu] [^112jeEQD]. It is an **adjunct therapy** to improve symmetry and reduce involuntary movements, with effects lasting 3–4 months and repeatable as needed [^1179RdGU] [^114V4evv]. Botox is not a first-line treatment for acute Bell's palsy; corticosteroids remain the primary therapy [^114cDhH1] [^111YrahE] [^113rL6V2].

---

## Clinical rationale for botox use in bell's palsy

Bell's palsy often leads to **chronic sequelae** — such as synkinesis (involuntary muscle contractions), facial asymmetry, and hyperkinesis (excessive muscle activity) — which can impair quality of life through functional and aesthetic concerns [^114V4evv]. Botox injections temporarily weaken overactive muscles, thereby **improving facial symmetry** and reducing involuntary movements [^113j2nSu] [^112jeEQD].

---

## Evidence supporting botox use in bell's palsy

Several studies and reviews demonstrate the **effectiveness of botox** for managing chronic sequelae of Bell's palsy:

- A systematic review by Volk et al. (2020) found that botulinum toxin therapy significantly improved quality of life in patients with facial palsy, including those with Bell's palsy [^114V4evv].

- Botox injections have been shown to effectively reduce synkinesis and improve facial symmetry, leading to enhanced patient satisfaction and social confidence [^112jeEQD] [^11731BDP].

- The effects of botox typically last 3–4 months, and repeated injections are generally safe and well-tolerated [^1179RdGU] [^116RGvJh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the use of **corticosteroids as the primary treatment** for acute Bell's palsy [^114cDhH1]. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommend administering oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset to improve recovery outcomes [^111YrahE]. Botox is **not recommended as a first-line treatment** for acute Bell's palsy and is reserved for managing chronic sequelae such as synkinesis and facial asymmetry [^113j2nSu]. The French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines also emphasize corticosteroids as the primary treatment and do not specifically address botox use in acute Bell's palsy [^115YY7JN].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Botox injections are **generally safe** when administered by experienced clinicians; potential side effects include [^1157u8tp]:

- Localized muscle weakness [^1157u8tp]

- Bruising or swelling at the injection site [^1157u8tp]

- Temporary asymmetry [^1157u8tp]

- Rarely, systemic effects such as generalized muscle weakness or allergic reactions [^115dE85F] [^1136Hn35]

Patients with pre-existing neuromuscular disorders or hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin should be **carefully evaluated before treatment** [^115dE85F] [^114wrLQV].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Botox is primarily used to manage chronic sequelae of Bell's palsy, whereas corticosteroids are the **mainstay treatment** for acute cases. Physical therapy and facial exercises are commonly recommended to improve facial function and symmetry, and Botox is often used in conjunction with therapy to enhance overall outcomes [^111eaaHP] [^113j2nSu].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Botox treatment is most appropriate for patients with **chronic Bell's palsy** who experience persistent synkinesis, facial asymmetry, or hyperkinesis [^113j2nSu]. Candidates should have stable facial nerve function and no contraindications to botulinum toxin therapy, and careful assessment with individualized treatment planning is essential to achieve optimal results [^1175vDaR].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Long-term outcomes with botox for Bell's palsy are generally positive, with **sustained improvements** in facial symmetry and reduced synkinesis [^11731BDP] [^114V4evv]. Recurrence rates of facial paralysis are low, but repeated injections are needed to maintain therapeutic effects [^113j2nSu].

---

Botox is an **effective adjunctive treatment** for managing chronic sequelae of Bell's palsy, such as synkinesis and facial asymmetry. It is not recommended as a first-line treatment for acute Bell's palsy, with corticosteroids remaining the primary therapy. Botox injections are generally safe and well-tolerated, providing significant improvements in facial symmetry and quality of life for patients with chronic Bell's palsy [^114V4evv].

### Does botulinum toxin therapy improve quality of life in patients with facial palsy [^114V4evv]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the literature regarding the efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy in improving the quality of life for patients with facial palsy.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using the Medline, EMBase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases. The study focused on patients with facial palsy who underwent botulinum toxin injection. The primary outcome assessed was the change in quality of life before and after treatment.

- **Results**: Six studies met the inclusion criteria for review. The outcome data could not be subjected to meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures. There was a general trend toward improved quality of life following botulinum toxin therapy, with most studies showing a statistically significant benefit. The specific aspects of life that improved varied across studies. No specific patient factors were identified that could predict which sub-cohort would most benefit from the therapy. While two studies reported common but minor adverse effects.

- **Conclusion**: This review provides contemporary evidence suggesting that botulinum toxin may enhance the quality of life for patients with facial palsy. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to better quantify the therapeutic benefits for these patients.

Bell's palsy is a common cranial neuropathy causing acute unilateral lower motor neuron facial paralysis. Immune, infective, and ischaemic mechanisms are all potential contributors to the development of Bell's palsy, but the precise cause remains unclear. Advancements in the understanding of intra-axonal signal molecules and the molecular mechanisms underpinning Wallerian degeneration may further delineate its pathogenesis, along with in vitro studies of virus-axon interactions.

Recently published guidelines for the acute treatment of Bell's palsy advocate for steroid monotherapy, although controversy exists over whether combined corticosteroids and antivirals may possibly have a beneficial role in select cases of severe Bell's palsy. For those with longstanding sequelae from incomplete recovery, aesthetic, functional (nasal patency, eye closure, speech, and swallowing), and psychological considerations need to be addressed by the treating team.

Increasingly, multidisciplinary collaboration between interested clinicians from a wide variety of subspecialties has proven effective. A patient-centered approach utilizing physiotherapy, targeted botulinum toxin injection, and selective surgical intervention has reduced the burden of long-term disability in facial palsy.

### Botulinum toxin: Evidence-based medicine criteria in rare indications [^111MvPgi]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Presently, there are more than 50 possible indications for the application of botulinum toxin. In some indications, the use of botulinum toxin has already been approved; others are about to be approved. A sufficient number of studies have been published for most of these indications. However, for rare indications, an insufficient number of studies are available, and in part, there are only published case reports. Classification according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine is thus difficult. Here, we attempt to describe the range of possible indications for botulinum toxin A and assess its therapeutic value for rare indications. The number of studies available on botulinum toxin B is still limited.

The recent introduction of botulinum toxin (BTX) into clinical medicine has revolutionized the practice of medicine and surgery. Who would have ever thought that the world's most deadly toxin would be used for therapeutic purposes? The discovery of the beneficial effects of BTX has transformed the lives of many individuals who have suffered from a variety of unrelated disorders, which have been virtually impossible to treat. With the help of BTX, these and hopefully many other ailments will be easily managed with a few simple injections.

### The phenomenon of the late recovered Bell's palsy: Treatment options to improve facial symmetry [^11731BDP]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is an idiopathic neuropathy of cranial nerve VII, and the incidence ranges from 15 to 40 per 100,000. While the majority of patients recover, up to 16 percent experience significant sequelae. The phenomenon of the "late recovered" Bell's palsy has specific features that have not been previously described: tightening of the facial muscles, with a deepening nasolabial fold and reduced palpebral fissure; blepharospasm; and incomplete recovery of peripheral VIIth nerve branches, with ipsilateral forehead paralysis, reduced depressor anguli oris function, and poor excursion of the angle of the mouth on smiling.

- **Methods**: Nonsurgical treatment involved four monthly botulinum toxin injections. Patients received injections to paralyze the ipsilateral orbicularis oculi, contralateral forehead rhytides, and depressor anguli oris and to treat blepharospasm and muscle tightness. The effectiveness of the botulinum toxin injections on facial symmetry and patient appreciation of this were assessed by measuring brow height and teeth exposure before and three weeks after injection.

- **Results**: Twenty-three patients were followed up for a mean period of 37 months. The difference in brow height and teeth exposure after injection was less than preinjection measurements, but this did not reach statistical significance. Patient self-assessments showed improvements in their appreciation of facial symmetry, ability to go out in public, and feelings of self-worth measured by a visual analogue scale. Surgical treatment options include ipsilateral brow lift and division.

Abo, abobotulinumtoxinA; CI, confidence interval; ES, effect size; Inc, incobotulinumtoxinA; NAb, neutralizing antibody; Ona, onabotulinumtoxinA.

Regarding blepharospasm, fewer studies were identified assessing NAb positivity in this indication (three studies; one per toxin formulation) than for CD (12 studies) or spasticity (15 studies). Only patients receiving abobotulinumtoxinA as first‐line treatment were found to have a proportion that were NAb positive (12.5%), whereas no patients receiving incobotulinumtoxinA or onabotulinumtoxinA were NAb positive. This difference was significant for abobotulinumtoxinA versus onabotulinumtoxinA (p = 0.04) and approached significance for abobotulinumtoxinA versus incobotulinumtoxinA (p = 0.07).

### Efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of pediatric upper and lower limb spasticity: Results from 2 open-label, long-term extension trials [^1147KyLb]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The adverse event profile by total body onabotulinumtoxinA dose is summarized in Table 3. Overall, 374 of 580 (64.5%) patients reported a treatment-emergent adverse event during the trials, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection (16.9%) and nasopharyngitis (15.7%). Treatment-emergent adverse events decreased with each treatment cycle. The incidence of serious adverse events across the pooled analysis was 6.7% (n = 39), with no dose response. No serious adverse event was considered treatment-related, no deaths occurred, and there were no reports of suicidal ideation.

- **Decrease in TEAEs by retreatment cycle**: Ten of 580 patients (1.7%) reported a treatment-emergent adverse event that could indicate distant spread of toxin: muscular weakness (n = 7, 1.2%), constipation (n = 2, 0.3%), and facial paralysis (n = 1, 0.2%). The incidence of these events was not dose-dependent. On review of individual cases, the events were found to be either local effects (i.e. near the injection site) or confounded by other factors (e.g. ongoing medical conditions, concomitant medications). None of the possible distant spread of toxin treatment-emergent adverse events were considered true distant spread of toxin effects; none were serious, all were mild or moderate in severity, and all resolved without sequelae.

### Efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of pediatric upper and lower limb spasticity: Results from 2 open-label, long-term extension trials [^112cJtSc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

No muscle atrophy events, such as peroneal muscular atrophy or progressive muscular atrophy, were reported. Reported adverse events that may indicate effects on muscle function included muscular weakness (7 [1.2%]), falls (4 [0.7%]), and contusions (7 [1.2%]). The incidences of these events were low and not dose dependent.

- **Laboratory results**: There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in laboratory indicators of bone metabolism. The frequency of potentially clinically significant postbaseline values for these laboratory parameters was low. The incidence of fracture events, an indicator of poor bone health, was also low and not dose dependent.

The goal must be to eradicate BP as a final diagnosis, as idiopathic can be equated with "not yet explainable". Therefore, further and more detailed research on potential risk factors for disease incidence, treatment options, and recovery rate is needed to provide these specific patients with individualized and successful treatment options.

### Botox [^1157u8tp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Botox and Botox Cosmetic contain the same active ingredient in the same formulation but with different labeled indications and usage. Therefore, adverse reactions observed with the use of Botox Cosmetic also have the potential to be observed with the use of Botox.

In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of Botox and, while generally transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Symptoms associated with flu-like conditions (e.g. nausea, fever, myalgia) have been reported after treatment. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses, including syncope and hypotension, which may require appropriate medical therapy.

Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to the spread of toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### SPL drug information for botulinum toxin type A [^114wrLQV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of botulinum toxin type A IM (also known as Dysport, Protoxin):

- **Diplopia, dysphonia, dysarthria, respiratory illness, congenital ptosis**: Use caution with known or unrecognized neuromuscular disorders or neuromuscular junction disorders. Thoroughly assess patients for any neuromuscular disorders before administering Botulin A, and use lower doses for those at risk. If systemic effects occur, closely monitor the patient's respiratory and neuromuscular function and provide appropriate supportive care, including respiratory assistance if necessary.

- **Dysphagia**: Use extreme caution with smaller neck muscle mass and those who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Closely monitor the patient's swallowing function, provide supportive care, and consider appropriate medical interventions as needed.

- **Myocardial infarction, arrhythmias**: Use extreme caution with cardiac disease. Administer Botulin A cautiously in patients with pre-existing heart conditions, and monitor cardiovascular status during treatment. If arrhythmia or myocardial infarction occurs, promptly provide appropriate medical intervention and support as needed.

- **Ocular hypertension, corneal ulcer**: Use caution with a history of visual disturbance. Careful testing of corneal sensation in eyes previously operated upon, avoidance of injection into the lower lid area to avoid ectropion, and vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed.

### Practical guidance for CD management involving treatment of botulinum toxin: a consensus statement [^11594S5v]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Increasingly, patients and physicians find that an injection schedule with fixed intervals of 12 weeks may not be appropriate for all patients. Thus, the variability in the duration of response to BoNT was studied in 404 patients across 38 centres. Only 49.3% of patients rated the duration of response as ≥ 12 weeks for all BoNT-A preparations. A further study assessed treatment duration (TD) — the time between injection and patient-reported waning of effect — in 59 patients and showed that the mean TD/patient was 7.8 ± 1.4 to 21.0 ± 3.9 weeks. A patient satisfaction survey conducted with patients treated with BoNT-A/Ona or BoNT-A/Abo has also shown that patient satisfaction with treatment declines prior to re-injection, and many (46%) patients would prefer an injection schedule of less than 12 weeks.

Subsequently, Evidente et al. conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of BoNT-A/Inco versus placebo in pre-treated or treatment-naive CD patients. A flexible dosing schedule was evaluated over a 68-week extension to the initial study of pre-treated or treatment-naive patients. In those who received ≥ 2 injections, the median intervals were: 6 to ≤ 10 weeks in 22.5%; > 10 to ≤ 12 weeks in 24.6%; > 12 to ≥ 14 weeks in 19.4%; and > 14 weeks in 33.5%.

This suggests that it might be useful to adopt a flexible dosing schedule. Flexible schedules may require some service adjustment to accommodate, but not necessarily an increase in the number of injections delivered overall, since the mean injection interval seen for these 'flexible' patients was still 12 weeks.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most frequent diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness or paralysis. It presents as a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition results in the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis or paralysis caused by Bell's palsy may lead to significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, thereby risking potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes can occur and may be devastating to the patient.

Treatments generally aim to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, leading to variations in care. Moreover, numerous diagnostic tests are available for evaluating patients with Bell's palsy; however, the benefit of many of these tests is questionable. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies might be misdiagnosed or experience unnecessary delays in diagnosis. Addressing these quality concerns is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

### Bell's palsy: Diagnosis and management [^113sYirL]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is a peripheral palsy of the facial nerve that results in muscle weakness on one side of the face. Affected patients develop unilateral facial paralysis over one to three days with forehead involvement and no other neurologic abnormalities. Symptoms typically peak in the first week and then gradually resolve over three weeks to three months. Bell's palsy is more common in patients with diabetes, and although it can affect persons of any age, incidence peaks in the 40s. Bell's palsy has been traditionally defined as idiopathic; however, one possible etiology is infection with herpes simplex virus type 1.

Laboratory evaluation, when indicated by history or risk factors, may include testing for diabetes mellitus and Lyme disease. A common short-term complication of Bell's palsy is incomplete eyelid closure with resultant dry eye. A less common long-term complication is permanent facial weakness with muscle contractures.

Approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients will recover spontaneously; however, treatment with a seven-day course of acyclovir or valacyclovir and a tapering course of prednisone, initiated within three days of the onset of symptoms, is recommended to reduce the time to full recovery and increase the likelihood of complete recuperation.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^116Q9tHW]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The aims of this paper were to:

1. Conduct a systematic literature review to identify studies assessing immunogenicity after treatment with three commercial BoNT‐A preparations for which long-term data have been published, in three therapeutic indications (CD, spasticity, and blepharospasm).

2. Extract data on the reported number of patients with NAbs and the number of patients with STF.

3. Perform a meta-analysis of these data and explore whether the proportions of patients with STF or NAbs vary between different patient populations and BoNT‐A formulations.

Following informed consent, eligibility checks, and randomization, demographics and relevant clinical information will be collected from the patient, including side of the palsy, onset and associated symptoms, relevant past medical history, and medical evaluations or contacts prior to the ED visit.

Study assessments regarding the severity of facial palsy, as measured by the HB and Sunnybrook scales, and facial imaging (digital video recording and still photographs) will be conducted using standardized instructions based on the study by Sullivan et al. A camera will be provided to all study sites. The images will be assessed at a later time point by assessors blinded to the study treatment assignment for quality control purposes.

Approximately 14 days after randomization, the parent/guardian/participant will receive a phone call from the study team to assess medication compliance, adverse events, and ongoing palsy symptoms, as judged subjectively by the parent/guardian/participant.

### Physical therapy for facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy): An updated and extended systematic review of the evidence for facial exercise therapy [^111eaaHP]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

The six articles rated as medium quality included two randomized controlled trials and four non-experimental observational studies. All reported improvements. Monini et al. completed a small trial of 20 consecutive patients randomly allocated to pre-treatment with Botulinum toxin type-A prior to standard facial therapy. They found that both groups showed improved outcomes on the SunnyBrook scale, but pre-treated patients had significantly better outcomes. Ordahan and Karahan randomized 46 patients with acute idiopathic palsy to physical exercise with or without low-level laser therapy. They reported that therapy alone showed a significant improvement in FDI score from baseline at week 6 but not at week 3. Laser therapy and exercise produced significant improvements from baseline FDI scores at both three weeks and six weeks post onset.

Among the four observational studies rated as medium quality:

- **Barth et al**: Reported a statistically significant increase in SFGS, FDIP, and FDIS when mirror therapy was combined with standard facial rehabilitation. Standard rehabilitation was documented as including massage, stretching, neuromuscular re-education, myofascial release, and postural exercises.
- **Monini et al**: Found that treating all age groups with steroid therapy and physical rehabilitation resulted in a significantly quicker time to recovery than steroid therapy alone. They also highlighted the importance of physical therapy for older patients and those with more severe HBS grading at the onset of their palsy. This followed their previous trial showing standard facial therapy results.

### Botulinum toxin in clinical practice [^115TwASn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin, the most potent biological toxin, has become a powerful therapeutic tool for a growing number of clinical applications. This review draws attention to new findings about the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and briefly reviews some of its most frequent uses, focusing on evidence-based data. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, as well as open-label clinical trials, provide evidence that, when appropriate targets and doses are selected, botulinum toxin temporarily ameliorates disorders associated with excessive muscle contraction or autonomic dysfunction. When injected no more frequently than every three months, the risk of blocking antibodies is slight. Long-term experience with this agent suggests that it is an effective and safe treatment not only for approved indications but also for an increasing number of off-label indications.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Bell's palsy, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend questioning the diagnosis of Bell's palsy in patients who exhibit peripheral facial palsy alongside abnormal otoscopy, parotid or cervical lymph node palpation, ipsilateral hearing loss, dizziness, or other neurological signs.

### Clinical practice guidelines in idiopathic facial paralysis: Systematic review using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE II) instrument [^113ZxCoa]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy, or idiopathic facial paralysis, is a peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause that presents as sudden, unilateral weakness of the muscles of the face. Prompt treatment of Bell's palsy is critical for patients to achieve complete recovery of facial function. Delays in diagnosis and management can result in permanent facial defects. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) exist to guide clinical decision-making in patients presenting with idiopathic facial paralysis. However, at the time of writing, there has been no comprehensive review of the methodological rigor and quality of these CPGs. Thus, the objective of the authors was to appraise the existing CPGs to ensure safe and effective practices.

A total of eight guidelines met the inclusion criteria and were appraised. Only two CPGs achieved an overall rating of 'High', with five or more quality domains scoring > 60%. Across the CPGs, the domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability had the lowest overall scores, with 48.1%, 43.9%, and 43.1%, respectively. Based on the AGREE II instrument, the methodological rigor and quality of CPGs for Bell's palsy is low to average. In particular, future guidelines for Bell's palsy should focus on improving the quality domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability.

### Alternative clinical indications of botulinum toxin [^116JnWWG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) is a powerful neurotoxin that inhibits acetylcholine release from presynaptic vesicles. The potency and safety profile of BoNTA grant the toxin vast therapeutic potential. It has been used off-label for a variety of dermatologic conditions. This review aims to analyze published literature regarding the benefits and risks of the off-label use of BoNTA beyond facial lines, including eccrine hidrocystomas, enlarged pores, keloids and hypertrophic scars, hidradenitis suppurativa, hyperhidrosis, masseter muscle hypertrophy, and salivary gland hypertrophy, among others. A MEDLINE search from January 2000 to December 2019 was conducted on the off-label uses of botulinum toxin in dermatology.

### Some unresolved issues with botulinum toxin [^115tfSeQ]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Issues concerning botulinum toxin still need resolution in the laboratory and clinic. Assay nomenclature is unsatisfactory, and attempts to establish common units and/or equivalents are misguided and dangerous. Optimum toxin concentrations for most indications are unknown. Loss of response is too readily ascribed to antibody formation. New therapeutic indications for the toxin raise the possibility of additional mechanisms of action.

### Comparative pharmacodynamics study of 3 different botulinum toxin type A preparations in mice [^114GM5ZK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A new complexing protein-free botulinum toxin Type A (CBoNT), with the same mechanism of action as the botulinum toxin complex onabotulinumtoxinA (OBoNT) and complexing protein-free incobotulinumtoxinA (IBoNT), was recently developed.

- **Objective**: To compare the local paresis and chemodenervation efficacy of 3 different botulinum toxin Type A preparations in mice.

- **Materials and methods**: Efficacy and duration of action of CBoNT, OBoNT, and IBoNT following a single intramuscular injection to the right gastrocnemius were evaluated by digit abduction score (DAS) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) assays.

- **Results**: Mouse DAS and CMAP responses were comparable between CBoNT and OBoNT, indicating similar paresis and chemodenervation efficacy, as well as duration of action. Both botulinum toxins showed significantly higher efficacy and longer duration of action than IBoNT. Similarly, mean DAS potency of CBoNT (ED 50: 3.85 ± 0.34 U/kg) and OBoNT (ED 50: 4.13 ± 0.07 U/kg) were significantly higher compared with IBoNT (ED 50: 6.70 ± 0.83 U/kg).

- **Conclusion**: CBoNT displays the same efficacy as OBoNT as shown by their comparable chemodenervation and local paretic effects, and demonstrates superior efficacy and duration of action compared with IBoNT. Likewise, CBoNT has comparable DAS potency to OBoNT and is superior to IBoNT.

### PrabotulinumtoxinA vs onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of adult males with moderate to severe glabellar lines: Post-hoc analyses of the Phase III clinical study data [^114XD1Sz]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin injections are not only increasingly popular, but they also continue to be the most common nonsurgical cosmetic procedure performed in both males and females. Among males, a dramatic 381% increase in the number of botulinum toxin injections performed for cosmetic purposes was observed between 2000 and 2018 in the United States. Based on a 2019 global survey, male patients accounted for 13.4% of all botulinum toxin procedures performed by aesthetic plastic surgeons in that year. By a large margin, the top two motivating factors among aesthetically oriented men considering a facial aesthetic injectable treatment were the desire to look good for their age, followed by the desire to look more youthful. Glabellar lines were selected by 60% of these male respondents as the facial area of concern most likely to be treated first.

Given that women have long dominated this market, instructions for the use of botulinum toxins for cosmetic indications have been based on clinical trial efficacy and safety data collected primarily from female patients. Consequently, when deciding the best approach to botulinum toxin applications in men, it is important to consider the facial anatomic differences between males and females. Briefly, compared with women, men typically exhibit greater skeletal muscle mass, including facial muscles that serve as the target for cosmetic botulinum toxin injections. In tandem with larger facial muscle mass, men exhibit greater facial movement and more severe facial lines/rhytids — rhytids that only become more pronounced with age.

### Safety and patient satisfaction of abobotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic use: A systematic review [^114deW8P]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical evidence for systemic toxicity as a result of abobotulinumtoxinA treatment involves examining the phenomenon of distant spread of toxin effect. This refers to the unintended extension of BoNT-A's effect into areas not adjacent to the injection site. It is associated with higher-dose indications and may cause symptoms such as unexpected loss of muscle strength or weakness, blurred vision, and eyelid ptosis, and, rarely, a life-threatening illness with symptoms consistent with botulism.

After focal injection for aesthetic use, BoNT-A should not be present at measurable levels in the peripheral blood. Studies have demonstrated this point and shown that administering the recommended amounts at each treatment does not lead to systemic effects. Only a minuscule quantity of BoNT-A is used for aesthetic purposes, and there have been no reports of distant spread of any of the approved BoNT-A preparations in normal healthy adults. In a systematic review of 11 RCTs on the use of BoNT-A in facial aesthetics dating from 1977 to 2009, Gadhia et al. concluded that the use of BoNT-A treatment had few or no adverse events in the immediate vicinity of the injections and no systemic effects.

There is no evidence from long-term clinical use in humans that BoNT-A injected into peripheral muscles, skin, or other tissues causes clinically detectable effects in the central nervous system.

Despite the safety of the BoNT-A products shown in these studies, the potential safety outcomes of distant spread of toxin effect are serious. In 2009, the FDA required all manufacturers of approved and marketed BoNT-A products to update their warnings to reflect these possibilities.

### Clinical value of botulinum toxin in neurological indications [^1179RdGU]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A) prevents the release of acetylcholine at cholinergic junctions, thereby causing temporary muscle weakness lasting 3–4 months. It is now widely used to treat a broad range of clinical disorders characterized by muscle hyperactivity. BoNT-A has proved effective in the management of several neurological conditions, particularly movement disorders such as blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, laryngeal dystonia, limb dystonia, hemifacial spasm, focal tics, tremor, and other hyperkinetic disorders. As a treatment for spasticity, BoNT-A can improve mobility and dexterity and prevent the development of distressing and costly secondary complications. In cerebral palsy, BoNT-A is valuable as it can delay or even avoid surgery until motion patterns have become established.

### Bell's palsy in children (BellPIC): Protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^111iRUJs]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The secondary outcomes are numerous and encompass various aspects of recovery and wellbeing:

- **Complete recovery assessments**: These evaluations are performed at 1, 3, and 6 months using the Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann (HB) scales to determine complete recovery. This includes assessments according to age, time to treatment, and initial severity.

- **Perception of facial nerve recovery**: Both parents/guardians and participants aged 8 years or older assess facial nerve recovery using a lay translation of the HB scale at 1, 3, and 6 months.

- **Emotional and functional wellbeing**: Assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) scales, and sections of the Harter scale. These assessments occur at 1, 3, and 6 months.

- **Pain assessments**: Pain is evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months using a visual analogue scale (VAS) assigned by the child or the Faces Pain Scale Revised for those aged 5 years and older. A parent-assigned VAS is also used. Both pain scales are graded 0–10.

- **Prevalence of synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction**: Evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months using the Sunnybrook scale augmented by a synkinesis assessment questionnaire (SAQ).

- **Health utilization costs**: Calculated via CHU9D and information capture from the parent/guardian/participant regarding in-patient, out-patient, or emergency department visits, and any other health facility attendances, including general practitioner visits for treatment or investigation throughout the 6 months post-randomization.

For patients who have not recovered by 6 months, recovery is further assessed at 12 months.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^1165fy4Z]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In the present study, the proportion of patients treated for blepharospasm with onabotulinumtoxinA who become NAb positive was also numerically lower (0%) than for patients with spasticity or CD. Conversely, a relatively high proportion of patients treated with abobotulinumtoxinA for blepharospasm (13%) was found. This finding is likely to be a limitation of the data in blepharospasm, with only individual studies per toxin formulation identified and small numbers of patients (n = 8 for the study of abobotulinumtoxinA in blepharospasm). In the meta‐analysis by Rahman et al. and the multiple indication study by Albrecht et al, the incidence and prevalence (respectively) of NAb‐positive patients was higher for CD and spasticity than for blepharospasm. This difference was attributed to the much lower dosing of BoNT for blepharospasm than for spasticity or CD. No patients with blepharospasm treated with incobotulinumtoxinA became NAb positive.

### Botulinum toxin-physiology and applications in head and neck disorders [^1152KFrY]. Head & Neck (2005). Low credibility.

This article is structured around a literature review that was carried out using Ovid and Medline with the keywords "botulinum", "toxin", and "ENT". Botulinum toxin has been used safely in humans for more than 20 years. The effects are transient, necessitating repeated treatments at intervals. Its application in ENT provides a useful tool for treating dystonia, autonomic dysfunction, facial nerve paresis, and hyperfunctional lines. It may also benefit laryngeal rebalancing and headache treatment. Further research is being conducted, and new indications for treatment with botulinum toxin may include sialorrhea and rhinorrhea.

### Botulinum toxin type A timing efficacy in patients with synkinesis after Bell's palsy [^112jeEQD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

This study examines whether the timing of botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) treatments affects outcomes in patients with synkinesis, a sequela of Bell's palsy characterized by disconjugate facial muscle movement.

- **Study design**: A retrospective chart review was conducted.

- **Setting**: The study was carried out at an urban academic medical center.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of synkinesis patients treated from 2016 to 2022. Data included procedural notes, intervention dates, and scores from the House-Brackmann (HB), Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE), Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), and Facial Grading System (FGS).

- **Results**: Sixty-seven patients (median age 54 years, average palsy duration 5.7 years) received BoNTA. Patients treated within 12 months (n = 28), 13 to 24 months (n = 12), and after 24 months (n = 23) showed no significant differences in changes to HB, FaCE, or SAQ scores. However, patients treated within 1 year had significantly higher FGS improvement (36.3) than the other groups (P = 0.03).

In conclusion, while FaCE, HB, and SAQ scores showed no significant differences, early BoNTA treatment within 1 year significantly improved FGS scores, indicating better outcomes. Therefore, early treatment is ideal for optimal response.

### Botulinum toxin type A immunogenicity across multiple indications: An overview systematic review [^115MNuzV]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin type A has been used to treat a wide array of neurologic, medical, and aesthetic indications. Several factors contribute to the formation of neutralizing antibodies, such as shorter intervals of treatment, higher dosage, amounts of antigenic proteins, serotypes, and storage of formulations.

- **Method**: This overview followed the Cochrane guideline for overview reviews. The AMSTAR-2 (revised version of A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) tool was used for the critical appraisal of the selected systematic reviews.

- **Results**: Five systematic reviews consisting of 203 studies (17,815 patients) were included, and their AMSTAR-2 scores were low to critically poor. There was high heterogeneity between the studies. Across the clinical indications, neutralizing antibody prevalence was significantly higher in dystonia, spasticity, and urologic conditions, and nil to insignificant in hyperhidrosis and aesthetic indications. The overall rate for the neutralizing antibody formation across three different formulations — abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA — was 1 to 2.1 percent, with no significant difference between them.

- **Additional results**: Although there is debate on the prevalence rate across the different botulinum toxin type A formulations in individual systematic reviews, the overall frequency of the development of neutralizing antibodies and the immunogenicity of abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA remain low to insignificant.

- **Conclusions**: Properly designed comparative trials are required to explore the immunogenicity differences further.

### Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^113rL6V2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. This review was first published in 2001 and most recently updated in 2015. Since a significant benefit of corticosteroids for the early management of Bell's palsy has been demonstrated, the main focus of this update, as in the previous version, was to determine the effect of adding antivirals to corticosteroid treatment. We undertook this update to integrate additional evidence and to better assess the robustness of findings, taking the risk of bias fully into account.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS in July 2019. We reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that followed-up participants for less than three months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of bias.

### Botox [^114DiVun]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The potency units of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products, and therefore, units of biological activity of Botox cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Description (11)].

Indication-specific dosage and administration recommendations should be followed. When initiating treatment, the lowest recommended dose should be used. In treating adult patients for one or more indications, the maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 400 units in a 3-month interval. In pediatric patients, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 units/kg body weight or 340 units in a 3-month interval [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

The safe and effective use of Botox depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. An understanding of standard electromyographic techniques is also required for treatment of strabismus, upper or lower limb spasticity, and may be useful for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Physicians administering Botox must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease, especially when injecting near the lungs.

Do not use Botox and contact AbbVie (1–800–678–1605) if:

### Comparison of the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA at the 1:3 conversion ratio for the treatment of asymmetry after long-term facial paralysis [^113ceLxn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin A injection into the nonparalyzed side is used to treat asymmetry resulting from facial palsy. OnabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA units are not equivalent. The authors compared the conversion ratio of 1:3 in patients with facial palsy.

- **Methods**: Fifty-five patients (age 16 to 67 years; 43 women) with longstanding facial palsy were randomly treated with either onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 25) or abobotulinumtoxinA (n = 30) injections into the nonparalyzed side. Adverse effects, facial symmetry, subjective satisfaction, and Facial Disability Index were assessed after 1 and 6 months.

- **Results**: The incidence of adverse effects was higher with abobotulinumtoxinA (93.3 percent versus 64.0 percent; p = 0.007). Clinical scores of the nonparalyzed side decreased after 1 month and increased again at 6 months, with no between-group differences. Scores of the paralyzed side were lower in the onabotulinumtoxinA group before treatment, but similar in both groups thereafter. The paralyzed side scores increased after 1 month, and at 6 months were still higher than the pretreatment scores in both groups. Subjective assessment improved at all time points compared with pretreatment scores and differed between the two groups only at 1 month, when the abobotulinumtoxinA group was a bit too paralyzed. The physical function and social/well-being function subscales of the Facial Disability Index did not differ between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Both toxins efficiently reduced asymmetry in patients with facial palsy. Adverse effects were higher with abobotulinumtox…

### Botox [^116RGvJh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Blepharospasm**: Botulinum toxin has been investigated for use in patients with blepharospasm in several studies. In an open-label, historically controlled study, 27 patients with essential blepharospasm were injected with 2 units of Botox at each of six sites on each side. Twenty-five of the 27 patients treated with botulinum toxin reported improvement within 48 hours. One patient was controlled with a higher dosage at 13 weeks post-initial injection and one patient reported mild improvement but remained functionally impaired.

	- In another study, 12 patients with blepharospasm were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients receiving botulinum toxin (n = 8) improved compared with the placebo group (n = 4). The effects of the treatment lasted a mean of 12 weeks.

	- One thousand six hundred eighty-four patients with blepharospasm who were evaluated in an open-label trial showed clinical improvement as evaluated by measured eyelid force and clinically observed intensity of lid spasm, lasting an average of 12 weeks prior to the need for re-treatment.

- **Strabismus**: Six hundred seventy-seven patients with strabismus treated with one or more injections of Botox were evaluated in an open-label trial. Fifty-five percent of these patients improved to an alignment of 10 prism diopters or less when evaluated six months or more following injection.

### Botox [^115dE85F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Serious adverse reactions with unapproved use**: Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, some associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Botox injections for unapproved uses. In these cases, the adverse reactions were not necessarily related to the distant spread of the toxin, but may have resulted from the administration of Botox to the site of injection and/or adjacent structures. In several cases, patients had pre-existing dysphagia or other significant disabilities. There is insufficient information to identify factors associated with an increased risk for adverse reactions related to the unapproved uses of Botox. The safety and effectiveness of Botox for unapproved uses have not been established.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea. If such a reaction occurs, further injection of Botox should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. One fatal case of anaphylaxis has been reported in which lidocaine was used as the diluent; consequently, the causal agent cannot be reliably determined.

- **Increased risk of clinically significant effects with pre-existing neuromuscular disorders**: Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored closely due to an increased risk of significant effects.

### Botulinum toxin type A injection near the stylomastoid foramen: A safe and effective therapeutic modality for tinnitus in patients with hemifacial spasm [^117Qp2C8]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Low credibility.

Given that the stapedius muscle is likely responsible for tinnitus in both idiopathic HFS and HFS secondary to Bell's palsy, this study encompassed not only idiopathic HFS but also cases secondary to Bell's palsy. Other secondary HFS conditions arising from structural intracranial or extracranial lesions, such as tumors and inflammatory diseases, have been reported. However, their pathophysiology is more complex, and BTX-A is not typically the primary treatment choice for these conditions; thus, they were excluded from the present study.

In the present study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from HFS patients who underwent BTX-A injection at our center over the past 14 years, reviewing a total of 869 patients. Among these patients, the mean age was 59.8 ± 12.3 years, and males accounted for 34.8%. Rosenstengel et al. reported a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1 in HFS patients, with a mean age at diagnosis ranging from 45 to 71.7 years, which aligns well with our findings. Among the 869 patients, 5.1% had a history of Bell's palsy, whereas the incidence of postparalytic HFS varies widely across studies, ranging from less than 5% to more than 20%.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^114N8JdB]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT‐A) is a recommended treatment option for several neurological and muscular conditions, including spasticity, cervical dystonia (CD), sialorrhea, and blepharospasm, and is widely used for aesthetic procedures. AbobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA are commercial preparations of BoNT‐A approved for the treatment of CD, spasticity, and blepharospasm that have been available for more than 15 years.

The dose of BoNT‐A, and the frequency and duration of treatment can vary greatly between indications, ranging from low single doses for aesthetic procedures to higher, repeated doses for CD, in some cases for the lifetime of the patient. As with other biological drugs, long-term treatment with BoNT‐A can lead to the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). In some patients, this immunogenicity against the botulinum neurotoxin can limit the efficacy of established treatments, necessitating increased treatment doses to maintain efficacy or causing secondary treatment failure (STF).

The immunogenicity potential of a BoNT‐A varies based on both the amount of active neurotoxin protein and the amount of nontherapeutic accessory clostridial proteins in each formulation. Although not therapeutically active, accessory proteins can induce an immune response and facilitate the development of NAbs. For example, the first commercially available formulation of onabotulinumtoxinA, which contained a relatively high quantity of accessory proteins, was associated with a higher risk of immunogenicity than currently marketed versions.

### Lanbotulinumtoxin-A: Safe for children with cerebral palsy but is it effective [^1164gfZk]. Developmental medicine and child neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Adverse events are a key issue when considering the prescription of medications for children with cerebral palsy. The study by Li et al. is the first large study of adverse events following the injection of Lanbotulinumtoxin‐A in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The rate of adverse events following the injection of Lanbotulinumtoxin‐A was similar to that following the injection of Onabotulinumtoxin‐A (also known as Botox) at 12% versus 14%, respectively. Most adverse events were mild and self‐limiting.

Risk factors for adverse events included a higher Gross Motor Function Classification System level, a history of recent illness, and the total dose of the injected neurotoxin. Animal studies referenced by Li et al. compared the effects of injecting the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle with four different type A toxins to injection with normal saline. The injection of any of the four type A toxins, including both Lanbotulinumtoxin‐A and Onabotulinumtoxin‐A, resulted in comparable muscle atrophy, which had not resolved at 12 weeks post-injection. The take-home message is that type A toxins are similar in both clinical effects and side effects.

These findings are important because Lanbotulinumtoxin‐A is significantly cheaper than Onabotulinumtoxin‐A. The costs of botulinum neurotoxin‐A have posed a significant restraint on the use of the neurotoxin in many countries. The availability of a less-expensive neurotoxin‐A product with a comparable safety profile is potentially good news for children with CP and their parents/guardians who may pay for toxin injections in some jurisdictions, as well as for global health.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^1167Myd5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial paralysis of unknown etiology and should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of any other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology involves swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option; this is ideally performed as soon as possible after onset. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and last updated in 2013, including evidence from one newly identified study.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of surgery in the early management of Bell's palsy.

- **Search methods**: On 20 March 2020, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were searched. Selected conference abstracts were handsearched for the original version of the review.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy were included. Trials compared surgical interventions to no treatment, later treatment (beyond three months), sham treatment, other surgical treatments, or medical treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included complete recovery at three and six months, synkinesis and contracture at 12 months, psychosocial outcomes at 12 months, and side effects.

### Safety and efficacy of repeat open-label abobotulinumtoxinA treatment in pediatric cerebral palsy [^112mc8k9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The long-term utility of botulinum toxin type-A treatment in the management of children with cerebral palsy is well established through years of clinical use. However, the evidence base for botulinum toxin type-A in cerebral palsy has been of variable quality and has primarily been based on studies of single injection cycles. Repeat injections are necessary to achieve a longer-lasting effect, but the results of repeat injections in pediatric cerebral palsy patients have only been evaluated in a few case series and relatively small clinical trials. Where available, such studies have shown repeat injections in children with dynamic equinus foot deformity to be generally safe and efficacious in improving various aspects of gait. A recent systematic review found that children with spastic cerebral palsy show functional gains, especially after the first two injections (i.e. one repeat injection of botulinum toxin type-A). However, the review found that there was insufficient evidence to assess the effect of multiple injections.

The authors have previously reported the results of a large, international, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®; Ipsen Pharma, Wrexham, UK) versus placebo in children with dynamic equinus foot deformity due to cerebral palsy. This trial was the first large trial specifically designed to assess the multidimensional efficacy of botulinum toxin type-A treatment via a broad variety of outcome measures, from muscle tone and spasticity assessments to overall clinical status.

### Beyond botox: Contemporary management of nonflaccid facial palsy [^111KnRr3]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Many transient facial nerve insults, including Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Lyme-associated facial paralysis, and temporal bone fractures, ultimately lead to nonflaccid facial palsy (NFFP). NFFP is associated with significant functional, aesthetic, psychological, and social impairments. However, algorithms for comprehensive management of this entity are not well developed and are rapidly evolving. Herein, we present our approach to NFFP, with the goal of providing a framework that may be applied to this complex patient population.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy executive summary [^114oshwv]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new clinical practice guideline on Bell's palsy. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations developed encourage accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitate patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy.

There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy; some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, there are numerous diagnostic tests available for evaluating patients with Bell's palsy, though many are of questionable benefit. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or experience unnecessary delays in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: A review [^111PPGVi]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy (BP), named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most frequent diagnosis linked to facial nerve palsy/paralysis and is the most common acute mono-neuropathy. It affects individuals across various ages and both sexes, with an annual incidence ranging from 11.5 to 53.3 per 100,000 persons across different populations. Typically, BP results in a partial or complete inability to move the affected side of the facial muscles automatically. Although it usually resolves within weeks or months, BP may cause severe temporary oral insufficiency and an inability to close the eyelids, potentially leading to permanent eye injury. In approximately 25% of BP patients, moderate-to-severe facial asymmetry may persist, frequently impairing their quality of life. These are among BP's long-term adverse consequences, which can be devastating for patients.

Despite its severe effects, the exact etiology of BP remains unclear. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) has identified the diagnosis of BP as one of exclusion, requiring the careful clinical elimination of other potential causes of facial paralysis/paresis, such as trauma, neoplasms, congenital or syndromic problems, post-surgical facial paralysis/paresis, or infection by agents including zoster and Lyme disease. This diagnosis also fails to address cases of recurrent facial paresis/paralysis. The GDG has also acknowledged the "acute" or "rapid onset" nature of BP, and that the occurrence of paralysis/paresis usually reaches its maximum severity rapidly.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^114L2RU4]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for botulism, specifically concerning antitoxin therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend administering botulinum antitoxin to patients with suspected botulism who have progressing symptoms or signs, such as paralysis, regardless of the time elapsed since symptom onset. Patients with suspected botulism who exhibit non-progressing symptoms and no remaining voluntary muscle function are less likely to benefit from antitoxin treatment, particularly if more than seven days have passed since symptom onset, as the toxin is infrequently detected beyond this stage of illness.

### Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^1171VQCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve are implicated in causing Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action that should minimize nerve damage. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy in people with Bell's palsy.

- **Search methods**: On 4 March 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials and contacted known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished trials. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing different routes of administration and dosage schemes of corticosteroid or adrenocorticotrophic hormone therapy versus a control group receiving no therapy considered effective for this condition, unless the same therapy was given in a similar way to the experimental group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodology. The main outcome of interest was incomplete recovery of facial motor function (i.e. residual facial weakness). Secondary outcomes were cosmetically disabling persistent sequelae, development of motor synkinesis or autonomic dysfunction (i.e. hemifacial spasm, crocodile tears), and adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy manifested during follow-up.

- **Main results**: We identified seven trials.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^1136ePSz]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The reported frequencies of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) following botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections are generally higher among conditions usually treated with higher BoNT doses, such as urological conditions, spasticity, and especially dystonia. In some studies, NAb formation was reported to be lower with both abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA injections for glabellar lines than for cervical dystonia (CD). Regarding the injection site, injections into anatomical regions rich in lymph nodes, such as the neck, appear more likely to produce an immune response than injections into other locations in some studies, but not in others. In addition, injection guidance techniques improve precision but are not always used or available, especially ultrasound guidance. This may also contribute to the variance in secondary treatment failure (STF) and NAb incidence reported between studies.

In this meta-analysis, the incobotulinumtoxinA group had zero patients with persistent NAbs (despite all identified studies of incobotulinumtoxinA using the sensitive MHDA, increasing the chance of finding NAb-positive patients) or STF, regardless of indication. Patients with CD treated with first-line abobotulinumtoxinA had relatively higher proportions with NAbs (≤ 4%) and STF (≤ 9%). Rahman et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 43 studies involving 8,833 patients from 2000 to 2020 and reported an overall incidence of NAbs after BoNT-A treatment of 1.8% (all indications). Our study indicated NAb rates after first-line abobotulinumtoxinA as high as 5% and 2% after first-line abobotulinumtoxinA in patients treated for CD or spasticity.

### Botulinum toxin treatment in cerebral palsy: Evidence for a new treatment option [^1133JtDG]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) have increasingly been used to reduce spasticity in specific muscle groups in children with cerebral palsy. The targets of therapeutic efforts include the improvement of gross motor function, alleviation of pain, and facilitation of hygienic care. Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the local and functional effectiveness of BTX-A for the treatment of dynamic pes equinus. Whether long-term treatment with BTX-A improves motor development and delays contractures remains under investigation.

### Consensus panel's assessment and recommendations on the use of 3 botulinum toxin type A products in facial aesthetics [^115H5ruT]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In this summary article, the authors discuss the characteristics of abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA. With three neuromodulators available in the U.S. market, comparisons between and among products will invariably be made. The article presents arguments for the most effective facial aesthetic uses of each neuromodulator.

- **Topics addressed in this article**: Patient expectations, toxin reconstitution and preparation, patient positioning, differences among products, the role of complexing proteins, and dosing and injection strategies.

- **Recommendations**: Provided by treatment area.

### Significantly lower antigenicity of incobotulinumtoxin than abo- or onabotulinumtoxin [^112oGheA]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

For a variety of indications, repetitive injections are necessary to maintain a certain level of benefit from BoNT/A therapy, which increases the risk of developing immune resistance against the botulinum toxin molecule. Several risk factors for the induction of NABs have been suggested, such as booster injections, short interinjection intervals, high dose per session, BoNT/A preparation, and the duration of treatment. The risk of developing NABs against BoNT/A may become markedly enhanced when a patient receives repetitive injections for multiple indications (e.g. to treat migraine and dystonia, or spasticity of extremities and bladder dysfunction) due to increased dose and shortened interinjection intervals from various injections applied to a single patient.

Both onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT/A; Botox®, Allergan, USA) and abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT/A; Dysport®, Ipsen, France) preparations contain proteins from the entire botulinum toxin type A complex, composed of the botulinum neurotoxin molecule as well as hemagglutinins and non-hemagglutinin proteins. These proteins are necessary for surviving the acidic environment of the stomach and penetrating the gastrointestinal wall. However, these bacterial proteins are unnecessary for the muscle-relaxing action when BoNT/A is directly injected into the indicated muscles. In contrast, they may stimulate the immune system, acting as adjuvant substances, and may be more of a hindrance than help in terms of botulinum toxin efficacy.

### Botox [^1136Hn35]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Postmarketing experience: During post-approval use of BOTOX, the following adverse reactions have been identified. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include:

- **Gastrointestinal and nutritional disturbances**: Abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea
- **Neurological and sensory issues**: Brachial plexopathy, denervation/muscle atrophy, hypoacusis, hypoesthesia, localized muscle twitching, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, tinnitus, visual disturbances
- **Dermatological reactions**: Alopecia (including madarosis), dry eye, eyelid edema (following periocular injection), hyperhidrosis, malaise, erythema multiforme, dermatitis psoriasiform, psoriasiform eruption
- **Other reactions**: Mephisto sign, strabismus

There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors, including cardiovascular disease. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established.

New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established.

### Onabotulinum toxin A injection as an adjunct in the treatment of posterior shoulder subluxation in neonatal brachial plexus palsy [^116Lq7YE]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin A is used to treat contractures in children with spasticity by temporarily interfering with neural transmission at the motor end plate. In infants with brachial plexus palsy, posterior shoulder subluxation and dislocation result from muscle imbalance, where neurologic recovery is evolving and spasticity is not a deforming force. We postulated that temporary weakening of the shoulder internal rotator muscles with botulinum toxin A would facilitate the reduction of the glenohumeral joint in such infants with early posterior shoulder subluxation or dislocation.

- **Methods**: Thirty-five infants with posterior subluxation or dislocation of the shoulder due to brachial plexus palsy were treated with botulinum toxin A between January 1999 and December 2006 and were followed for a minimum period of one year. Records were reviewed for the severity of the palsy, age at the time of treatment, recurrence of subluxation or dislocation, and the subsequent need for further treatment to reduce the glenohumeral joint.

- **Results**: The average age at the time of shoulder reduction and botulinum toxin A injection was 5.7 months. Six patients had a second injection. Reduction of the shoulder was maintained in twenty-four (69%) of the thirty-five patients. There were no complications related to the use of botulinum toxin A.

- **Conclusions**: Although there may be specific risks associated with its use, botulinum toxin A injection into the internal rotator muscles is a useful adjunct to the treatment of early posterior subluxation or dislocation of the shoulder in infants.

### Facial nerve grading system [^1115ynSS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (1985). High credibility.

The House-Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of facial nerve dysfunction, specifically in patients with facial paralysis. This scale is widely used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, or other conditions causing facial nerve paralysis. The House-Brackmann scale grades facial function from I (normal) to VI (total paralysis), taking into account parameters such as symmetry at rest, voluntary movement, and synkinesis (involuntary movement).

- **Clinical utility**: The clinical utility of this scale lies in its ability to provide a standardized method for assessing the degree of facial nerve damage. This can guide treatment decisions and allow for consistent tracking of patient progress over time. There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the House-Brackmann scale, but it may be less accurate in patients with partial facial nerve palsy or in those with dynamic facial asymmetry due to causes other than facial nerve dysfunction.

- **Grading system**: The House-Brackmann facial paralysis scale allows clinicians to assess the degree of facial paralysis a patient is experiencing by evaluating the characteristics of facial function. The scale assigns a grade from 1 to 6, which corresponds to varying levels of facial movement and symmetry, as outlined below:
	- "Normal facial function in all areas" results in "Grade 1" (normal). This represents no noticeable issues with facial movement.
	- "Slight weakness on close inspection"; mouth is slight asymmetr…

### PrabotulinumtoxinA vs onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of adult males with moderate to severe glabellar lines: Post-hoc analyses of the Phase III clinical study data [^116EuN93]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). High credibility.

Clinical experience in treating males with various botulinum toxins is growing, and numerous publications have been written within the last 10 years to guide clinicians in the aesthetic treatment of men. However, there is a lack of direct comparative efficacy and safety data between toxins in this population. To the best of the authors' knowledge, only one comparator study of this type has been published — a pilot study conducted in 12 male patients to compare four toxins for the treatment of forehead lines.

The absence of comparative data in males may be due to the fact that few clinical studies have been conducted solely in male patients and that only a limited number of direct comparator studies have been published in this field regardless of gender. This is compounded by the knowledge that, historically, the overall number of male participants in aesthetic clinical studies of botulinum toxins has been relatively small. In a systematic review published in 2020, Roman and Zampella reported that men, on average, represented only 13.9% of all participants in the randomized controlled clinical trials conducted on botulinumtoxinA for cosmetic indications.

The 900-kDa botulinum toxin type A, prabotulinumtoxinA (Jeuveau, Evolus, Inc, Newport Beach, CA), is the most recent neuromodulator approved for use in the United States for the treatment of glabellar lines; it is marketed as Nuceiva in Europe and Canada. Results from the multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (EVB-003, n = 540) conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries are anticipated to provide valuable insights into its efficacy and safety.

### Botulinum toxin treatment for facial palsy: A systematic review [^1175vDaR]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Facial palsy may be complicated by ipsilateral synkinesis or contralateral hyperkinesis. Botulinum toxin is increasingly used in the management of facial palsy; however, the optimum dose, treatment interval, adjunct therapy, and performance compared to alternative treatments have not been well established. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for the use of botulinum toxin in facial palsy.

- **Method**: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2015), and Embase Classic + Embase (1947 to September 2015) were searched for randomized studies using botulinum toxin in facial palsy.

- **Results**: Forty-seven studies were identified, and three were included. Their physical and patient-reported outcomes are described, and observations and cautions are discussed.

- **Discussion**: Facial asymmetry has a strong correlation to subjective domains such as impairment in social interaction and perception of self-image and appearance. Botulinum toxin injections represent a minimally invasive technique that is helpful in restoring facial symmetry at rest and during movement in chronic, and potentially acute, facial palsy. Botulinum toxin in combination with physical therapy may be particularly helpful. Currently, there is a paucity of data; areas for further research are suggested. A strong body of evidence may allow botulinum toxin treatment to be nationally standardized and recommended in the management of facial palsy.

### Clinical recovery and circulating botulinum toxin type F in adult patient [^113G9wZQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Botulism is a disease characterized by cranial nerve palsies and descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis. Seven serologically distinct botulinum toxins, designated A through G, are known; virtually all human cases are caused by types A, B, E, and rarely, F. Clostridium botulinum produces all seven toxin types. Toxin type E may also be produced by C. butyricum, and type F by C. baratii.

Botulism type F causes approximately 1% of botulism cases in the United States. Two outbreaks have been reported — one in the United States and the other in Europe. A recent review described all 13 cases of botulism type F from the United States between 1981 and 2002. Clinical signs included respiratory failure within 24 hours of symptom onset, complete or near complete quadriplegia by the fifth day, and neuromuscular recovery beginning on the eighth day. On average, patients received mechanical ventilation for 24 days and were hospitalized for 30 days. These features represent a more precipitous initial course than is typical for type A or type B botulism but a more rapid recovery. We describe a case of botulism type F in an adult who recovered despite the continued presence of toxin in the blood.
