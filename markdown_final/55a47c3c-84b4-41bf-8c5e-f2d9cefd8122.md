## Question

Why do macrophages require iron?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why macrophages require iron. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cell-intrinsic metabolic requirements for iron in macrophages. Then, I should verify their systemic role in erythrocyte clearance and iron recycling. Next, I will examine how iron availability shapes macrophage polarization and function. After that, I need to assess iron's dual roles in host defense and pathogen exploitation. Finally, I will consider macrophage-mediated local trophic support and how dysregulation leads to disease states, before summarizing the integrated model with hepcidin–ferroportin regulation in mind [^115hWJSy] [^113czup6].

> Let me first confirm the cell-intrinsic need for iron. Macrophages depend on iron for mitochondrial respiration via iron–sulfur clusters and heme in the electron transport chain, for ribonucleotide reductase in DNA synthesis, and for numerous redox enzymes that shape antimicrobial and signaling functions, so iron scarcity bottlenecks activation and proliferation programs in immune cells, even when viability is preserved [^115hWJSy] [^111W5Esw]. Wait, let me verify if iron is also needed for differentiation itself; yes, iron deprivation impairs monocyte differentiation into macrophages and dendritic cells through failure of p21 induction, confirming a developmental dependency [^1179roLf]. I should also note that heme handling is vital for macrophage survival during erythrophagocytosis; in the absence of heme oxygenase-1, erythrophagocytosis triggers macrophage death and pathologic iron redistribution, underscoring iron–heme metabolism as a survival axis in these cells [^115fbhTF].

> Next, I should review their systemic mandate in iron recycling. Hold on, I should verify the daily flux; macrophages recycle roughly 20–25 mg of iron per day from senescent erythrocytes, which supplies the majority of iron required for erythropoiesis, whereas only 1–2 mg is absorbed from the gut, so macrophage export via ferroportin fundamentally sustains transferrin-bound iron delivery to the marrow [^113czup6]. I need to ensure I'm precise about regulation; hepcidin binds ferroportin to internalize and degrade it, throttling iron export from enterocytes and macrophages in response to iron load or inflammation, while autophagy and endosomal trafficking modulate ferroportin abundance and localization within erythrophagocytic macrophages, linking cell-autonomous pathways to systemic iron homeostasis [^111iSbZv]. Let me also confirm in human macrophages that ferroportin is rapidly downregulated by hepcidin and cycles through endocytic compartments to the plasma membrane, consistent with direct control of iron egress at the cell surface [^117AAQRr].

> I will now examine how iron status functions as a molecular switch for macrophage polarization. In vitro and ex vivo data indicate that classically activated M1 macrophages adopt an iron sequestration profile with higher ferritin and lower transferrin receptor and ferroportin, whereas alternatively activated M2 macrophages exhibit higher transferrin receptor, larger labile iron pools, and enhanced ferroportin-mediated export, favoring iron recycling phenotypes that support tissue repair [^114oG2P4]. Wait, let me verify signaling links; mitochondrial ROS appears to couple iron status to polarization decisions in murine macrophages, and manipulating mitochondrial redox can shift cells toward an M2 program with altered iron metabolism, suggesting a redox–iron–phenotype axis [^112USmNa]. I should also confirm that tissue cues can instruct iron-recycling macrophage programs; IL-33 cooperates with heme to drive the red pulp macrophage phenotype, upregulating genes like SPIC and HMOX1, integrating cytokine and heme signals to specify iron-handling identity [^111jai5v] [^114W7CGZ]. But wait, what if in vivo contexts diverge from the canonical M1/M2 model? In adipose tissue, iron-rich, M2-like resident macrophages display an iron-recycling signature yet can lose iron-handling capacity and shift phenotype in obesity, highlighting that tissue environment and metabolic stress reshape iron–polarization coupling in situ [^112xaRG6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about iron being uniformly beneficial for antimicrobial function; iron is both a weapon and a liability. Macrophages enact nutritional immunity by limiting microbial access to iron via TLR-driven hepcidin induction and ferroportin suppression, and by phagosomal metal withdrawal through Nramp1, thereby starving intracellular pathogens of essential micronutrients [^114qw62j] [^113gqKTt]. I should double-check the counterpoint; pathogens have evolved siderophores and iron-scavenging systems, and some even alter their intracellular life cycle in response to iron limitation, as seen with Legionella triggering early egress under iron stress, illustrating the dynamic iron tug-of-war [^1111J7n3]. Let me consider the oxidative killing arm; iron participates in ROS-dependent antimicrobial pathways, yet excess iron in airway macrophages correlates with impaired bacterial uptake and increased growth of pathogens, and systemic hepcidin-driven hypoferremia can selectively protect against siderophilic microbes by restricting non–transferrin-bound iron, underscoring context-dependent effects [^111v9hyH] [^112NhqcE] [^111Wa6yw]. But wait, I should verify fungal contexts too; restriction of iron within alveolar macrophages is pivotal to controlling Rhizopus, where phagosomal maturation arrest and iron availability shape outcomes, reinforcing iron withholding as central in antifungal defense [^1119Z5ma].

> Next, I should review macrophages as local iron suppliers for tissue homeostasis and repair. Let me first confirm the skin data; when macrophage ferroportin is deleted, local epithelial and stromal proliferation falters, hair cycling is impaired, and wound healing is delayed despite preserved systemic iron, demonstrating a trophic requirement for macrophage-derived iron at repair sites [^117PmCSe]. I need to check intestinal regulation; duodenal lamina propria macrophages control transferrin availability via protease-mediated degradation under mTORC1 activation, dynamically tuning local iron absorption during feeding and infection, and thereby linking mucosal immunity to systemic iron handling through transferrin control [^116946qH] [^114NxHrM]. Let me also reconsider adipose tissue; resident iron-rich macrophages in lean adipose tissue appear to buffer and distribute iron to support adipogenesis and protect against oxidative stress, whereas obesity perturbs this axis, altering tissue iron distribution and metabolic homeostasis [^112xaRG6] [^114u8gqb].

> I should now connect dysregulation to clinical phenotypes. During inflammation, IL-6 and related cytokines induce hepcidin, internalizing ferroportin, trapping iron in macrophages, and driving hypoferremia and anemia of inflammation, a conserved host defense that unfortunately restricts erythropoiesis when sustained [^115vV5N3] [^115v9B9Y]. Wait, let me verify pulmonary implications; iron-laden airway macrophages are linked to increased infective exacerbations in COPD, suggesting that maldistributed iron can impair phagocytic function and favor pathogen growth in the airways [^1122iW3t]. I need to ensure I mention cell death pathways; iron excess and lipid peroxidation can trigger ferroptosis, which immune cells can both undergo and induce, adding another layer where macrophage iron handling may influence tissue injury and immune regulation across infection, autoimmunity, and cancer [^115u5HkF]. Hold on, I should verify acute-phase modulation; therapeutic strategies that modulate the hypoferremic response to inflammation further highlight the centrality of hepcidin–ferroportin dynamics at the macrophage interface in disease [^112mrkdh].

> In summary, let me reconsider and integrate. Macrophages require iron to sustain mitochondrial metabolism, DNA synthesis, and differentiation; to execute their non-redundant systemic role as the body's iron recycling hub; to toggle phenotypic programs that govern iron sequestration versus export; to prosecute nutritional immunity while avoiding pathogen exploitation; and to deliver localized trophic iron that supports tissue proliferation and repair, all under the governance of hepcidin–ferroportin and tissue instructive cues such as IL-33 and mTORC1 signaling [^113czup6] [^115hWJSy] [^111jai5v] [^116946qH]. I should double-check that I did not overstate uniformity across tissues; contexts like obesity, lung disease, and infection illustrate that iron–macrophage coupling is highly niche-specific, but the unifying principle remains that precise iron handling is foundational to macrophage biology and to systemic and local homeostasis alike [^112xaRG6] [^111v9hyH] [^114NxHrM].

Macrophages need iron because it is **essential for erythrophagocytosis and recycling** [^115hWJSy] of iron from senescent red blood cells [^113czup6], supplying most of the daily iron for erythropoiesis [^113LWocX]. Iron is also **critical for antimicrobial defense**, enabling ROS/RNS production [^111v9hyH] [^113gqKTt] and supporting nutritional immunity by sequestering iron from pathogens [^111Wa6yw] [^116omJmL]. Additionally, iron supports macrophage metabolism [^112USmNa], differentiation [^1179roLf], and polarization [^114oG2P4], and is required for tissue repair [^117PmCSe] via iron export to proliferating cells [^112JyxrS]. Thus, macrophage iron handling integrates erythropoiesis, host defense, and tissue homeostasis [^115hWJSy].

---

## Iron recycling and erythrophagocytosis

- **Erythrophagocytosis**: Macrophages phagocytose senescent erythrocytes [^113czup6], degrade heme via HO-1 [^115fbhTF], and recycle iron for new erythrocytes [^113LWocX].

- **Ferroportin-mediated iron export**: Ferroportin exports iron to transferrin [^111SQon3]; hepcidin [^115vV5N3] regulates this by binding ferroportin, causing its internalization and degradation [^117AAQRr] [^113LWocX].

- **Systemic iron homeostasis**: Macrophage recycling supplies ~80% of daily iron for erythropoiesis [^113czup6], maintaining systemic iron balance [^113LWocX].

---

## Antimicrobial defense and nutritional immunity

- **Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species**: Iron-dependent enzymes [^113gqKTt] generate ROS/RNS for pathogen killing [^115hWJSy].

- **Nutritional immunity**: Macrophages sequester iron to limit pathogen growth [^111Wa6yw]; pathogens evolve countermeasures to access host iron [^116omJmL] [^116xXoDL].

- **Iron sequestration during infection**: Hepcidin-induced ferroportin degradation [^112NhqcE] traps iron in macrophages, restricting extracellular pathogens [^114qw62j].

---

## Macrophage metabolism and differentiation

Mitochondrial function depends on iron for **Fe-S cluster enzymes** and the **electron transport chain** [^115hWJSy], supporting macrophage metabolism [^112USmNa]. Iron availability also shapes **differentiation and polarization**, influencing immune responses [^114oG2P4] [^1179roLf] [^112USmNa].

---

## Tissue repair and regeneration

Wound healing is supported by macrophage **iron export** [^112JyxrS], which promotes **stromal cell proliferation** [^117PmCSe] and **tissue repair** [^112dAcH1]. Hair follicle cycling likewise requires macrophage **iron release** [^1159GkFY] to drive **follicle growth and cycling** [^111X5pkf] [^112JyxrS] [^1175ZbBo].

---

## Regulation of macrophage iron homeostasis

- **Hepcidin-ferroportin axis**: Hepcidin [^113czup6] regulates ferroportin [^115v9B9Y], controlling macrophage iron export [^113LWocX].

- **Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)**: IRP1/2 control intracellular iron by regulating ferritin and transferrin receptor expression [^117RktSr] [^115hWJSy].

- **Cytokine signaling**: IL-6 [^115vV5N3] and IL-1β [^116UX9M9] induce hepcidin, altering macrophage iron handling during inflammation [^112mrkdh].

---

## Consequences of dysregulated iron metabolism

Iron overload causes **oxidative stress**, impairs macrophage function [^1122iW3t], and increases **susceptibility to infection** [^116xXoDL], whereas **iron deficiency** impairs macrophage function, reducing antimicrobial capacity and tissue repair.

---

Macrophages need iron to coordinate **erythrophagocytosis**, **antimicrobial defense**, **metabolism**, and **tissue repair**; dysregulation of iron handling disrupts these functions and contributes to disease [^116xXoDL].

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^113czup6]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Iron trafficking is an example of a circular economy. Only 1–2 mg of iron are absorbed daily in the gut, compensating for an equal loss. Most iron (20–25 mg daily) is recycled by macrophages upon phagocytosis of erythrocytes. The site of regulated non-heme iron uptake is the duodenum, where non-heme iron is imported from the lumen by the apical divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) after it is reduced from ferric to ferrous iron by duodenal cytochrome B reductase (DCYTB). Although absorption of heme exceeds that of non-heme iron, the mechanisms remain obscure. In enterocytes, non-utilized iron is stored in ferritin and lost with mucosal shedding or exported to plasma by basolateral membrane ferroportin according to the body's needs.

- **The iron cycle**: Iron (Fe) circulates bound to transferrin to be released to all organs and tissues through transferrin receptor 1. Most iron (20–25 mg), recycled by macrophages that phagocytize senescent red blood cells (RBC), is supplied to the bone marrow for RBC production. The daily uptake of dietary iron by duodenal enterocytes is 1–2 mg, and the same amount is lost through cell desquamation and blood loss. Excess iron is stored in the liver and macrophages as a reserve.

	- **Focus on intestinal iron absorption**: The metal transporter DMT1 takes up ferrous iron, reduced by DCYTB, on the luminal side of the enterocyte. Iron not used inside the cell is either stored in ferritin (FT) or exported to circulating transferrin (TF) by ferroportin (FPN).

### Glia maturation factor-γ regulates murine macrophage iron metabolism and M2 polarization through mitochondrial ROS [^112USmNa]. Blood Advances (2019). Low credibility.

In macrophages, cellular iron metabolism status is tightly integrated with macrophage phenotype and associated with mitochondrial function. However, how molecular events regulate mitochondrial activity to integrate the regulation of iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype remains unclear. Here, we explored the important role of the actin-regulatory protein glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype.

We found that GMFG was downregulated in murine macrophages by exposure to iron and hydrogen peroxide. GMFG knockdown altered the expression of iron metabolism proteins and increased iron levels in murine macrophages, concomitantly promoting their polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. GMFG-knockdown macrophages exhibited moderately increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which were accompanied by decreased expression of some mitochondrial respiration chain components, including the iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold protein ISCU as well as the antioxidant enzymes SOD1 and SOD2.

Importantly, treatment of GMFG-knockdown macrophages with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reversed the altered expression of iron metabolism proteins and significantly inhibited the enhanced gene expression of M2 macrophage markers, suggesting that mtROS is mechanistically linked to cellular iron metabolism and macrophage phenotype. Finally, GMFG interacted with the mitochondrial membrane ATPase ATAD3A, suggesting that GMFG knockdown-induced mtROS production might be attributed to alteration of mitochondrial dynamics.

### Iron in innate immunity: Starve the invaders [^111Wa6yw]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Iron is essential for nearly all living organisms. Innate immunity effectively restricts iron availability to microbial invaders. Some microbes have evolved effective countermeasures that blunt the effect of iron restriction. Recent epidemiologic studies have highlighted the potentiating effect of iron on microbial infections. Laboratory studies have focused on specific immune mechanisms that mediate iron withholding from microbes constitutively and in response to infections. Specialized inflammation-regulated proteins chelate iron, trap siderophores, and transport iron or modulate its transport to alter its tissue distribution during infections.

### Iron trapping in macrophages reshapes the homeostasis of the haematopoietic system [^113LWocX]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Iron is required for key physiological processes, such as oxygen transport, energy production, and cell proliferation. Body iron homeostasis is primarily regulated by the erythroferrone (ERFE)–hepcidin–ferroportin (FPN) axis. Hepcidin binding leads to internalization and degradation of FPN, the only known mammalian iron exporter, thereby inhibiting iron release, particularly from iron‐absorbing duodenal cells and macrophages that recycle iron from red blood cell (RBC) breakdown, which provides 80% of the iron required by erythroblasts. Increased iron needs for higher haemoglobin (HGB) synthesis and erythroid cell proliferation are met by inhibiting hepcidin expression, enhancing FPN activity and iron availability. In these settings, hepcidin is downregulated by ERFE, synthesized by bone marrow (BM) erythroblasts in response to erythropoietin, and/or by the hepatokine FGL1. Conversely, hepcidin induction by elevated iron levels or inflammatory mediators leads to decreased levels of circulating iron and lower transferrin saturation.

### Iron in airway macrophages and infective exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111v9hyH]. Respiratory Research (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by partially reversible airflow limitation and frequent exacerbations. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are among the most common reasons for hospital admission, with infections estimated to be the underlying etiology in 50–70% of cases.

Iron is a ubiquitous element and an essential nutrient to nearly all organisms. It is necessary for the generation of reactive oxygen species, which is crucial for cellular bactericidal capacity. As a growth essential nutrient, increased iron may create a favorable environment for bacterial growth and increased virulence. Systemic iron regulation, which occurs primarily by cellular sequestration, has been well described. IL-6 acts on hepatocytes and macrophages to stimulate the release of hepcidin, which subsequently causes the degradation of membrane-bound ferroportin. As the only known exporter of iron, the degradation of ferroportin leads to iron being trapped intracellularly. In the respiratory tract, these mechanisms are poorly understood, with the evidence almost exclusively from murine models.

Chronic inflammation can lead to the over-accumulation of iron, best described in anemia or chronic disease in hemodialysis patients. Excess iron has also been implicated in the development of chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, excess pulmonary iron has been shown to potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and asthma. Iron accumulation also appears to be…

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^117PmCSe]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Iron recycling by macrophages is essential for erythropoiesis and may also be relevant for iron redistribution to neighboring cells at the local tissue level. Using mice with iron retention in macrophages due to targeted inactivation of the iron exporter ferroportin, we investigated the role of macrophage iron release in hair follicle cycling and wound healing, a complex process that can lead to major clinical problems if impaired. Genetic deletion of ferroportin in macrophages resulted in iron deficiency and decreased proliferation in epithelial cells, which consequently impaired hair follicle growth and caused transient alopecia. This hair loss was not related to systemic iron deficiency or anemia, indicating the necessity of local iron release from macrophages.

Inactivation of macrophage ferroportin also led to delayed skin wound healing with defective granulation tissue formation and diminished fibroplasia. Iron retention in macrophages had no impact on the inflammatory processes accompanying wound healing, but it affected stromal cell proliferation, blood and lymphatic vessel formation, and fibrogenesis. Our findings reveal that iron/ferroportin plays a largely underestimated role in macrophage trophic function in skin homeostasis and repair.

### Iron trapping in macrophages reshapes the homeostasis of the haematopoietic system [^1151Tra7]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

We also showed that the local deficiency of iron released by myeloid cells impacts virtually all the cell types involved in RBC development, starting from HSCs, triggering iron avidity through increased TFR1 expression, but without perturbing their frequencies. Upregulation of TFR1 in response to low intracellular iron is a known phenomenon activated by developing cells with high iron demand like erythroid precursors. We here show that the mechanism is much broader, involving cell development throughout the haematopoietic system beyond erythroid cells, in accordance with the essential role of iron for haematopoiesis, as also highlighted by the phenotype of conditional knockout mice with HSC‐specific loss of TFR1. Increased TFR1 cell surface presentation in HSCs and progenitors has been recently shown in response to acute iron limitation in vitro in response to an iron chelator. In vivo, intermittent treatment with an iron chelator over 1 year increased HSC regenerative capacity, indicating that low iron is indeed beneficial for HSCs, in line with the known detrimental effects of iron overload in these cells. We did not formally test HSC regenerative capacity through transplantation assays; nevertheless, the occurrence of anaemia with ageing, the HSC bias towards the Mk differentiation and the reduction of HSC and myeloid precursor numbers that we observe upon continuous (not intermittent) lack of iron supply from myeloid cells owing to a genetic defect suggest that having a local source of iron is indeed necessary for proper HSC regeneration.

### Human macrophage ferroportin biology and the basis for the ferroportin disease [^114Vsaey]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Ferroportin (FPN1) is the sole iron exporter in mammals, yet its cell-specific function and regulation remain elusive. This study examined FPN1 expression in human macrophages, the cells primarily responsible for daily plasma iron turnover and central in the pathogenesis of ferroportin disease (FD), which is attributed to lack-of-function FPN1 mutations. We characterized FPN1 protein expression and traffic through confocal microscopy, western blotting, gel filtration, and immunoprecipitation studies in macrophages from control blood donors and patients with either FPN1 p. A77D, p.G80S, and p. Val162del lack-of-function or p. A69T gain-of-function mutations.

In normal macrophages, FPN1 cycles in the early endocytic compartment, does not multimerize, and is promptly degraded by hepcidin (Hepc), its physiological inhibitor, within 3–6 hours. In FD macrophages, endogenous FPN1 showed a similar localization, except for greater accumulation in lysosomes. However, unlike previous studies using overexpressed mutant protein in cell lines, FPN1 could still reach the cell surface and be normally internalized and degraded upon exposure to Hepc. When FD macrophages were exposed to large amounts of heme iron, in contrast to donor and p. A69T macrophages, FPN1 could no longer reach the cell surface, leading to intracellular iron retention.

In conclusion, FPN1 cycles as a monomer within the endocytic/plasma membrane compartment and responds to its physiological inhibitor, Hepc, in both control and FD cells. However, in FD, FPN1 fails.

### Macrophage physiological function after superparamagnetic iron oxide labeling [^111w1q2m]. NMR in Biomedicine (2008). Low credibility.

Our goal was to analyze the changes in morphology and physiological function — phagocytosis, migratory capabilities, humoral and cellular response, and nitric oxide secretion — of murine macrophages after labeling with a clinically used superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), ferucarbotran. In SPIO-treated macrophages, nanoparticles were taken up in the cytoplasm and accumulated in a membrane-bound organelle. Macrophage proliferation and viability were not modified after SPIO labeling. Phagocytic function decreased after labeling with only 10 microg Fe/mL SPIO, whereas other functions, including migration and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide, increased at the highest SPIO concentration (100 microg Fe/mL).

The study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Animal Welfare Office of the Italian Health Ministry (Authorization n° 250/2020‐PR).

### Obesity alters adipose tissue macrophage iron content and tissue iron distribution [^114u8gqb]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Adipose tissue (AT) expansion is accompanied by the infiltration and accumulation of AT macrophages (ATMs), as well as a shift in ATM polarization. Several studies have implicated recruited M1 ATMs in the metabolic consequences of obesity; however, little is known regarding the role of alternatively activated resident M2 ATMs in AT homeostasis or how their function is altered in obesity.

Herein, we report the discovery of a population of alternatively activated ATMs with elevated cellular iron content and an iron-recycling gene expression profile. These iron-rich ATMs are referred to as MFe(hi), and the remaining ATMs are referred to as MFe(lo). In lean mice, approximately 25% of the ATMs are MFe(hi); this percentage decreases in obesity owing to the recruitment of MFe(lo) macrophages.

Similar to MFe(lo) cells, MFe(hi) ATMs undergo an inflammatory shift in obesity. In vivo, obesity reduces the iron content of MFe(hi) ATMs and the gene expression of iron importers as well as the iron exporter, ferroportin, suggesting an impaired ability to handle iron. In vitro, exposure of primary peritoneal macrophages to saturated fatty acids also alters iron metabolism gene expression.

Finally, the impaired MFe(hi) iron handling coincides with adipocyte iron overload in obese mice. In conclusion, in obesity, iron distribution is altered both at the cellular and tissue levels, with AT playing a predominant role in this change. An increased availability of fatty acids during obesity may contribute to the observed changes in MFe(hi) ATM phenotype and their reduced capacity to handle iron.

### Interleukin-33 signaling controls the development of iron-recycling macrophages [^114W7CGZ]. Immunity (2020). High credibility.

Here, we sought to clarify sources of IL-33 required for RPM development. We have discovered that native erythrocytes accumulate IL-33 and that erythrocyte-associated IL-33 is sufficient for RPM development in vivo. Erythrocytes have been shown to play a role in the storage and release of cytokines, although IL-33 was not investigated. At the time of writing, evidence for expression of IL-33 on hematopoietic cells is very limited; however, it is noteworthy that platelets and in vitro cultured CD34+ erythroid progenitors were reported to express IL-33. Here, we have provided evidence for the existence of IL-33 in erythrocytes, using multiple techniques and supported by specificity controls, including samples from IL-33-deficient mice and highly purified erythrocyte preparations. In contrast to the detection of full-length IL-33 in murine erythrocytes, we found that IL-33 in human erythrocyte preparations was highly susceptible to proteolytic processing. Full-length IL-33 is biologically active; however, it is possible that proteolytic processing might regulate IL-33 activity. We could not rule out that this processing might have occurred during ex vivo handling, and further work is required to understand the nature of this processing and its biological relevance.

### Obesity alters adipose tissue macrophage iron content and tissue iron distribution [^112xaRG6]. Diabetes (2014). High credibility.

MFe hi are alternatively activated. In light of recent data suggesting that M2 polarization induces an iron recycling phenotype, we sought to determine the polarization of MFe hi ATMs. While all ATMs from lean AT are expected to be M2-like, the expression of M2 markers such as stabilin-1 (Stab1), macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 1 (MGL1 [Clec10a]), and IL-10 (Il10) were significantly increased in MFe hi compared with MFe lo ATMs. In contrast, the M1 markers, CD11c (Itgax), CCR7 (Ccr7), and Il-1β (Il1b) were significantly reduced in MFe hi cells. Flow cytometry also revealed that a significantly greater proportion of MFe hi ATMs are CD163 and MGL1/2 positive, whereas a significantly reduced proportion of MFe hi ATMs express the M1 markers CD11c and CCR2.

- **FACS analysis**: Flow cytometry was used to measure MFe lo and MFe hi ATM expression of M2 markers (CD163 and MGL1/2) and M1 markers (CD11c and CCR2) from the SVF of NCD mice. The top row depicts the initial gating on viable F4/80 hi CD11b hi MFe lo and MFe hi ATMs. Isotype controls used to gate for M2 and M1 markers are shown in the left column. The rightmost column compares the number of MFe lo and MFe hi ATMs positive for each M2 or M1 marker as a percentage of viable F4/80 hi CD11b hi ATMs (n = 3–4/group for each marker). ✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01.

### Polarization dictates iron handling by inflammatory and alternatively activated macrophages [^114oG2P4]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Macrophages play a key role in iron homeostasis. In peripheral tissues, they polarize into classically activated (M1) macrophages and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. There is limited knowledge on whether the polarization program influences the ability of macrophages to store or recycle iron and the molecular machinery involved in these processes.

- **Design and methods**: Inflammatory/M1 and alternatively activated/M2 macrophages were propagated in vitro from mouse bone-marrow precursors and polarized in the presence of recombinant interferon-γ or interleukin-4. Their ability to handle radioactive iron, the characteristics of intracellular iron pools, and the expression of molecules involved in the internalization, storage, and export of the metal were characterized and compared. The influence of iron on the relative ability of polarized macrophages to activate antigen-specific T cells was also verified.

- **Results**: M1 macrophages have low iron regulatory protein 1 and 2 binding activity, express high levels of ferritin H, low levels of transferrin receptor 1, and internalize iron only when its extracellular concentration is high, albeit with low efficiency. In contrast, M2 macrophages have high iron regulatory protein binding activity, express low levels of ferritin H, and high levels of transferrin receptor 1. M2 macrophages have a larger intracellular labile iron pool, effectively take up and spontaneously release iron at low concentrations, and have limited storage ability. Iron export correlates with the expression of ferroportin, which is higher in M2 macrophages.

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^112dAcH1]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Tissue-resident macrophages play an important role in tissue homeostasis by supporting neighboring parenchymal cells with trophic signals and nutrients, as well as in tissue repair following injury. In the context of the skin, macrophages are critical regulators of hair follicle growth and cutaneous wound healing, two events with many similarities. Perifollicular macrophages prompt the entry of hair follicle stem cells into the anagen phase of growth, while selective ablation of macrophages impairs the wound healing response. Although wound macrophages display a mixed phenotypic and functional profile, the initial phase of an injury is characterized by the prevalence of pro-inflammatory, classically activated M1 macrophages, which are associated with the production of oxygen radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, at later stages during resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, alternatively polarized M2 macrophages, oriented to tissue repair and remodeling, predominate. This M1 to M2 switch is required for normal healing.

Macrophages are also at the crossroads of iron traffic. Iron-recycling macrophages provide iron for erythropoiesis by clearing senescent erythrocytes. Conversely, iron sequestration by pro-inflammatory macrophages is a well-known mechanism of efficient bacteriostasis in host defense. In line with their different functions in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, polarized macrophages show considerable differences in their transcriptional profiles, including a distinct regulation of genes related to iron metabolism.

### Iron and the immune system [^116xXoDL]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Iron is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes and biochemical processes that support cellular metabolism across the kingdoms of life. Because of this, the host and pathogen compete for iron as a vital resource. Moreover, research has shown that iron acquisition and iron trafficking have substantial effects on the immune system. This is especially important because iron-related disorders — both deficiency and overload — are common worldwide. In this review, we describe how immune cells acquire and use iron, which branches of the immune system are most affected by iron, and how changes in iron availability can affect infectious diseases, autoinflammatory disorders, and antitumor immunity. We also discuss key unanswered questions and potential therapeutic opportunities to manipulate immunity by controlling iron trafficking.

### Hepcidin, a putative mediator of anemia of inflammation, is a type II acute-phase protein [^115vV5N3]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Hepcidin is a liver-made peptide proposed to be a central regulator of intestinal iron absorption and iron recycling by macrophages. In animal models, hepcidin is induced by inflammation and iron loading, but its regulation in humans has not been studied. We report that urinary excretion of hepcidin was greatly increased in patients with iron overload, infections, or inflammatory diseases. Hepcidin excretion correlated well with serum ferritin levels, which are regulated by similar pathologic stimuli.

In vitro iron loading of primary human hepatocytes, however, unexpectedly down-regulated hepcidin mRNA, suggesting that in vivo regulation of hepcidin expression by iron stores involves complex indirect effects. Hepcidin mRNA was dramatically induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vitro, but not by IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), demonstrating that human hepcidin is a type II acute-phase reactant. The linkage of hepcidin induction to inflammation in humans supports its proposed role as a key mediator of anemia of inflammation.

### Interleukin-33 signaling controls the development of iron-recycling macrophages [^114b7wuG]. Immunity (2020). Low credibility.

The development of tissue-resident macrophages from yolk-sac-derived pre-macrophages or bone marrow-derived monocytes requires local specification by instructive signals coming from the tissue microenvironment. This is the case for some locally generated metabolites like retinoic acid, which is required for the polarization of peritoneal macrophages, and heme, which plays an essential role in the commitment of monocytes to a pre-red pulp macrophage (RPM) phenotype, dependent on the transcription factor SPIC. An important physiological function of RPMs is the regulation of iron metabolism through erythrocyte clearance and iron recycling. RPMs phagocytose other blood-borne particulates and express several innate immune receptors, and may therefore be involved in the regulation of immune-inflammatory responses. RPMs are also involved in type I interferon production in response to parasites (P. Chabaudi) and are able to cross-prime early effector T cell responses against viruses, and may therefore play a role in the defense against infections.

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^111MUSTy]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Macrophages with different functional orientations play specific roles in the overlapping phases of wound repair. Since iron accumulation in macrophages might favor the expression of inflammatory mediators, we evaluated the levels of inflammatory cytokines in wound lysates. However, we did not detect significant differences between the two mouse lines at any time-point (Online Supplementary Figure S5). Since iron accumulation in macrophages of Fpn1 fl/fl LysCre +/− mice could affect the polarization of these cells during the healing process, we investigated the distribution of the different polarized macrophages. As expected, an increase in MHCII+/CD206− M1 macrophages was detected already in the middle-proliferative phase, while a significant increase in MHCII−/CD206+ M2 macrophages was evident only in the late-remodeling phase. However, no difference was found between Fpn1 fl/fl LysCre +/− mice and their control littermates (Figure 5A).

Moreover, we evaluated the expression of polarization markers in bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed in vitro to polarization stimuli, but again no difference was observed in markers for both M1 (iNOS and TNFα) and M2 (Arg1 and YM1) macrophages (Figure 5B). The expression of iron-related genes in bone marrow-derived macrophages of Fpn1 fl/fl LysCre −/− mice mirrored the pattern previously observed in human polarized macrophages, with elevated expression of FPN, TfR1, and the hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex receptor CD163 in M2 macrophages. This finding aligns with the prominent expression of FPN in macrophages during the late phase of repair.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^116j6HP9]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

CD68+ LP macrophages restrict iron absorption through regulation of protease activity. To understand how LP macrophages affect transferrin (Tf) levels, we further characterized the duodenal macrophages. Macrophages in the villous LP regions of cre/+ mice expressed higher levels of CD68, a macrophage activation marker (Figure 6 A), whereas F4/80+ expression was similar between +/+ and cre/+ mice (supplemental Figure 6 A). In cre/+ mice, CD68 levels decreased after everolimus treatment, indicating mTORC1-dependent activation of duodenal macrophages (supplemental Figure 6 B). Furthermore, we discovered an increased phosphorylation of S6 (pS6), a marker of activated mTORC1 signaling, in the villous LP regions of cre/+ mice, as expected (Figure 6 B). To elucidate whether duodenal macrophages directly regulate Tf levels, we sorted macrophages from the LP and performed a bulk RNA-seq analysis (supplemental Figure 6 C). We found that the number of CD64+ LP macrophages was similar and only a few genes were altered (supplemental Figure 6 D-E). Furthermore, we could not detect significant differences in the expression of known iron metabolism genes (supplemental Figure 6 F). Recently, the involvement of mTOR signaling in the regulation of hepcidin via BMP-SMAD signaling was described; however, none of the target genes were altered in our transcriptomics data (supplemental Figure 6 G). Nevertheless, pathway analysis of RNA-seq data revealed a significant enrichment of protein digestion pathways and genes encoding various proteases such as elastase-like proteases (Cela2a and Cela3b), carboxypeptidases.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^114NxHrM]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

- **Macrophages regulate**: Macrophages regulate transferrin (Tf) iron availability in the duodenum to control systemic iron metabolism.
- **Transferrin levels**: Tf levels are controlled in the duodenum by digestive proteases during inflammation.

### Characterization of global gene expression, regulation of metal ions, and infection outcomes in immune-competent 129S6 mouse macrophages [^117DxhnH]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Nutritional immunity involves cellular and physiological responses to invading pathogens, such as limiting iron, increasing exposure to bactericidal copper, and altering zinc to restrict the growth of pathogens. Here, we examine the infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages from 129S6/SvEvTac mice by *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium. The 129S6/SvEvTac mice possess a functional Slc11a1 (Nramp-1), a phagosomal transporter of divalent cations that plays an important role in modulating metal availability to the pathogen.

We carried out global RNA sequencing upon treatment with live or heat-killed *Salmonella* at 2 h and 18 h postinfection and observed widespread changes in metal transport, metal-dependent genes, and metal homeostasis genes, suggesting significant remodeling of iron, copper, and zinc availability by host cells. Changes in host cell gene expression suggest infection increases cytosolic zinc while simultaneously limiting zinc within the phagosome. Using a genetically encoded sensor, we demonstrate that cytosolic labile zinc increases 45-fold at 12 h postinfection. Further, manipulation of zinc in the medium alters bacterial clearance and replication, with zinc depletion inhibiting both processes.

Comparing the transcriptomic changes to published data on the infection of C57BL/6 macrophages revealed notable differences in metal regulation and the global immune response. Our results reveal that 129S6 macrophages represent a distinct model system compared to C57BL/6 macrophages. Further, our results indicate that manipulation of zinc at the host-pathogen interface is critical for understanding pathogen control.

### Iron deficiency causes aspartate-sensitive dysfunction in CD8T cells [^111W5Esw]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Iron is an irreplaceable co-factor for metabolism. Iron deficiency affects over one billion people, and decreased iron availability impairs immunity. Nevertheless, how iron deprivation impacts immune cell function remains poorly characterized. We interrogate how physiologically low iron availability affects CD8+ T cell metabolism and function, using multi-omic and metabolic labeling approaches.

Iron limitation does not substantially alter initial post-activation increases in cell size and CD25 upregulation. However, low iron profoundly stalls proliferation (without influencing cell viability), alters histone methylation status, gene expression, and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. Glucose and glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle is limited and partially reverses to a reductive trajectory.

Previous studies identified mitochondria-derived aspartate as crucial for the proliferation of transformed cells. Despite aberrant TCA cycling, aspartate is increased in stalled iron-deficient CD8+ T cells but is not utilized for nucleotide synthesis, likely due to trapping within depolarized mitochondria. Exogenous aspartate markedly rescues expansion and some functions of severely iron-deficient CD8+ T cells.

Overall, iron scarcity creates a mitochondrial-located metabolic bottleneck, which is bypassed by supplying inhibited biochemical processes with aspartate. These findings reveal molecular consequences of iron deficiency for CD8+ T cell function, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for immune impairment during iron deficiency.

### Targeted autophagy disruption reveals the central role of macrophage iron metabolism in systemic iron homeostasis [^111iSbZv]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Iron homeostasis depends on both intracellular control through iron-responsive proteins and the systemic level of iron through the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. Indeed, the hormone hepcidin downregulates the ferroportin iron exporter to control iron recycling from macrophages and iron uptake from enterocytes. Here, we focused on the role of autophagy in macrophage iron metabolism and systemic iron homeostasis. Mice deficient in autophagy in macrophages (LysM-Atg5-/-) mimicked a primary iron overload phenotype, resulting in high ferroportin expression in both macrophages and enterocytes that correlated with marked parenchymal iron overload. Furthermore, LysM-Atg5-/- mice exhibited increased hematopoietic activity with no signs of anemia, but rather high plasma iron levels.

Compared with wild-type cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages from LysM-Atg5-/- mice had significantly increased ferroportin expression and decreased iron content, confirming high iron export. In erythrophagocytic macrophages, autophagy regulates hemosiderin storage mechanisms as well as the degradation of ferroportin and subsequently its plasma membrane localization and iron export. Furthermore, ferroportin colocalization with hepcidin indicates hepcidin autocrine activity. Relatively high hepatic hepcidin expression and decreased hepcidin levels in the spleen of LysM-Atg5-/- mice, correlating with low hemosiderin iron storage, as well as in erythrophagocytic Atg5-/- macrophages were evidenced. Therefore, our results highlight the critical role of autophagy in macrophages for iron trafficking and systemic iron homeostasis.

### Iron limitation triggers early egress by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila [^1111J7n3]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates in alveolar macrophages, causing a severe form of pneumonia. Intracellular growth of the bacterium depends on its ability to sequester iron from the host cell. In the L. pneumophila strain 130b, one mechanism used to acquire this essential nutrient is the siderophore legiobactin. Iron-bound legiobactin is imported by the transport protein LbtU. Here, we describe the role of LbtP, a paralog of LbtU, in iron acquisition in the L. pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1.

Similar to LbtU, LbtP is a siderophore transport protein and is required for robust growth under iron-limiting conditions. Despite their similar functions, however, LbtU and LbtP do not contribute equally to iron acquisition. The Philadelphia-1 strain lacking LbtP is more sensitive to iron deprivation in vitro. Moreover, LbtP is important for L. pneumophila growth within macrophages, while LbtU is dispensable. These results demonstrate that LbtP plays a dominant role over LbtU in iron acquisition.

In contrast, the loss of both LbtP and LbtU does not impair L. pneumophila growth in the amoebal host Acanthamoeba castellanii, demonstrating a host-specific requirement for the activities of these two transporters in iron acquisition. The growth defect of the ΔlbtP mutant in macrophages is not due to alterations in growth kinetics. Instead, the absence of LbtP limits L. pneumophila replication and causes bacteria to prematurely exit the host cell. These results demonstrate the existence of a preprogrammed exit strategy in response to iron limitation.

### Role of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in pathogen-mediated intracellular iron sequestration in human phagocytic cells [^114qw62j]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Upon infection, pathogen and host compete for the same iron pool because this trace metal is a crucial micronutrient for all living cells. Iron dysregulation in the host is strongly associated with poor outcomes in several infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria, and inefficient iron scavenging by pathogens severely affects their virulence. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis in vertebrates, responsible for diminishing iron export from macrophages during iron overload or infection.

Hepcidin regulation in hepatocytes is well characterized and mostly dependent on interleukin-6 signaling during inflammation. However, in myeloid cells, hepcidin induction and the mechanisms leading to intracellular iron regulation remain elusive. Here we show that activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by their respective ligands leads to increased iron sequestration in macrophages. By measuring the transcriptional levels of iron-related proteins (e.g. hepcidin, ferroportin, and ferritin), we observed that TLR signaling can induce intracellular iron sequestration in macrophages through two independent but redundant mechanisms.

Interestingly, TLR2 ligands or infection with Listeria monocytogenes lead to direct ferroportin transcriptional downregulation, whereas TLR4 ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide, induce hepcidin expression. Infection with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin promotes intracellular iron sequestration through both hepcidin upregulation and ferroportin downregulation.

This is the first study in which TLR1–9-mediated iron sequestration pathways have been detailed, highlighting their role in pathogen-host interactions during infections.

### Human macrophage ferroportin biology and the basis for the ferroportin disease [^111SQon3]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Ferroportin (FPN1) is the sole iron exporter in mammals, but its cell-specific function and regulation are still elusive. This study examined FPN1 expression in human macrophages, the cells that are primarily responsible for plasma iron turnover and are central in the pathogenesis of ferroportin disease (FD), the disease attributed to lack-of-function FPN1 mutations.

We characterized FPN1 protein expression and traffic using confocal microscopy, western blotting, gel filtration, and immunoprecipitation studies in macrophages from control blood donors and patients with either FPN1 p. A77D, p.G80S, and p. Val162del lack-of-function or p. A69T gain-of-function mutations. In normal macrophages, FPN1 cycles in the early endocytic compartment, does not multimerize, and is promptly degraded by hepcidin (Hepc), its physiological inhibitor, within 3–6 hours.

In FD macrophages, endogenous FPN1 showed a similar localization, except for greater accumulation in lysosomes. However, in contrast with previous studies using overexpressed mutant protein in cell lines, FPN1 could still reach the cell surface and be normally internalized and degraded upon exposure to Hepc. When FD macrophages were exposed to large amounts of heme iron, in contrast to donor and p. A69T macrophages, FPN1 could no longer reach the cell surface, leading to intracellular iron retention.

- **Conclusion**: FPN1 cycles as a monomer within the endocytic/plasma membrane compartment and responds to its physiological inhibitor, Hepc, in both control and FD cells. However, in FD, FPN1 fails…

### Iron restriction inside macrophages regulates pulmonary host defense against Rhizopus species [^1119Z5ma]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Herein, we analyze physiological immune responses in the lungs of immunocompetent mice during Rhizopus infection and identify an essential role of macrophages during host–Rhizopus interplay. In particular, we demonstrate that Rhizopus spp. subvert physiological killing mechanisms of macrophages and establish prolonged intracellular dormancy via melanin-induced phagosome maturation arrest. Furthermore, we discover that inhibition of Rhizopus growth inside macrophages is a central host defense mechanism that depends on nutritional immunity via iron starvation. Finally, dual RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and functional studies identify critical host and fungal modulators of iron homeostasis inside macrophages that promote invasive fungal growth. Our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of mucormycosis with potential therapeutic implications in the management of this devastating disease and provide a mechanistic link between iron homeostasis inside macrophages and immune responses to Mucorales.

### Sequestration and scavenging of iron in infection [^116omJmL]. Infection and Immunity (2013). Low credibility.

The proliferative capability of many invasive pathogens is limited by the bioavailability of iron. Consequently, pathogens have developed various strategies to obtain iron from their host organisms. In response, host defense strategies have evolved to sequester iron from these invasive pathogens. This review explores the mechanisms employed by bacterial pathogens to gain access to host iron sources, the role of iron in bacterial virulence, and the critical iron-related genes required for the establishment or maintenance of infection. Additionally, host defenses to limit iron availability for bacterial growth during the acute-phase response and the consequences of iron overload conditions on susceptibility to bacterial infection are examined. The evidence summarized herein demonstrates the importance of iron bioavailability in influencing the risk of infection and the ability of the host to clear the pathogen.

### Apolipoprotein E deficiency leads to the polarization of splenic macrophages towards M1 phenotype by increasing iron content [^112ZYk8K]. Genes and Immunity (2024). Low credibility.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis in the body, while macrophages are the principal cells responsible for handling iron in mammals. However, it is unknown whether ApoE can affect the functional subtypes and the iron handling capacity of splenic macrophages (SM). Here, we investigated the effects of ApoE deficiency (ApoE -/-) on the polarization and iron content of SM and its potential mechanisms.

- **Expression changes in macrophages**: ApoE -/- was found to induce a significant increase in the expressions of M1 marker genes CD86, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, and iNOS, and a reduction in M2 marker genes CD206, Arg-1, IL-10, and Ym-1 in SM of mice aged 28 weeks.

- **Iron content alterations**: Meanwhile, ApoE -/- caused a significant increase in iron content and expression of ferritin, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and a reduction in ferroportin1 (Fpn1) in the spleen and/or SM of mice aged 28 weeks.

It was concluded that ApoE -/- can increase iron content through increased iron uptake mediated by TfR/IRPs and decreased iron release mediated by Fpn1, leading to the polarization of the SM to the M1 phenotype.

### Tissue iron promotes wound repair via M2 macrophage polarization and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 17 and 22 [^1175ZbBo]. The American Journal of Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Macrophages are important for effective iron recycling and erythropoiesis, but they also play a crucial role in wound healing, orchestrating tissue repair. Recently, we demonstrated a significant accumulation of iron in healing wounds and a requirement of iron for effective repair. Herein, we sought to determine the influence of iron on macrophage function in the context of wound healing. Interestingly, wound macrophages extensively sequestered iron throughout healing, which was associated with a pro-healing M2 phenotype. In delayed healing diabetic mouse wounds, both macrophage polarization and iron sequestration were impaired.

In vitro studies revealed that iron promotes differentiation while skewing macrophages toward a hypersecretory M2-like polarization state. These macrophages produced high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 17 and 22, promoting wound reepithelialization and extracellular matrix deposition in a human ex vivo wound healing model. Together, these findings reveal a novel, unappreciated role for iron in modulating macrophage behavior to promote subsequent wound repair. These findings support therapeutic evaluation of iron use to promote wound healing in the clinic.

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^1159GkFY]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Iron recycling by macrophages is essential for erythropoiesis and may also be relevant for iron redistribution to neighboring cells at the local tissue level. Using mice with iron retention in macrophages due to targeted inactivation of the iron exporter ferroportin, we investigated the role of macrophage iron release in hair follicle cycling and wound healing, a complex process leading to major clinical problems if impaired. Genetic deletion of ferroportin in macrophages resulted in iron deficiency and decreased proliferation in epithelial cells, which consequently impaired hair follicle growth and caused transient alopecia. Hair loss was not related to systemic iron deficiency or anemia, thus indicating the necessity of local iron release from macrophages.

Inactivation of macrophage ferroportin also led to delayed skin wound healing with defective granulation tissue formation and diminished fibroplasia. Iron retention in macrophages had no impact on the inflammatory processes accompanying wound healing but affected stromal cell proliferation, blood and lymphatic vessel formation, and fibrogenesis. Our findings reveal that iron/ferroportin plays a largely underestimated role in macrophage trophic function in skin homeostasis and repair.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^116946qH]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

Iron is an essential cellular metal important for many physiological functions, including erythropoiesis and host defense. It is absorbed from the diet in the duodenum and loaded onto transferrin (Tf), the main iron transport protein. Inefficient dietary iron uptake promotes many diseases, but mechanisms regulating iron absorption remain poorly understood. By assessing mice that harbor a macrophage-specific deletion of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), a negative regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), we found various defects in iron metabolism, including defective steady-state erythropoiesis and reduced saturation of Tf with iron. This iron deficiency phenotype was associated with an iron import block from the duodenal epithelial cells into the circulation.

Activation of mTORC1 in villous duodenal CD68+ macrophages induced serine protease expression and promoted local degradation of Tf, whereas the depletion of macrophages in mice increased Tf levels. Inhibition of mTORC1 with everolimus or serine protease activity with nafamostat restored Tf levels and Tf saturation in the Tsc2-deficient mice. Physiologically, Tf levels were regulated in the duodenum during the prandial process and Citrobacter rodentium infection. These data suggest that duodenal macrophages determine iron transfer to the circulation by controlling Tf availability in the lamina propria villi.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^115HCMBM]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

Our results demonstrate that macrophages directly control transferrin (Tf) levels in the duodenum, as the deletion of macrophages in the intestine increased duodenal Tf. Starvation of mice also increased local Tf levels in the duodenum, whereas refeeding decreased Tf, suggesting regulation of iron absorption during the prandial process. During C. rodentium infection in mice, Tf levels were increased and were negatively associated with the presence of CD68+ macrophages. This indicates a potential new role of duodenal macrophage conditions in intestinal infectious disease, involving the alteration of Tf-iron availability as a host defense mechanism.

Chronic inflammation and infection cause functional iron deficiency as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of nutritional immunity, aimed at restricting iron availability to invading pathogens. Given the high binding affinities of Tf, our finding that Tf levels in lamina propria (LP) increase with intestinal infections aligns with the host's strategy of restricting iron availability to intestinal bacteria, highlighting the importance of macrophage iron control for host immune defense against invading microbes.

Our findings show that Tsc2-deficient macrophages increase the expression of enzymatic proteases in the LP. In line with this, the inhibition of protease activity by nafamostat restored Tf levels in the duodenum, induced the release of storage iron from enterocytes, and increased serum Tf saturation in the cre/+ mice. These findings imply that mTORC1 activation in LP macrophages affects Tf.

### Iron restriction inside macrophages regulates pulmonary host defense against Rhizopus species [^112oCFTT]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Mucormycosis is a life-threatening respiratory fungal infection predominantly caused by Rhizopus species. The pathogenesis of mucormycosis is not completely understood, particularly concerning how abnormalities in iron metabolism compromise immune responses. Here, we show how, as opposed to other filamentous fungi, Rhizopus spp. establishes intracellular persistence inside alveolar macrophages (AMs).

Mechanistically, the lack of intracellular swelling of Rhizopus conidia results in the surface retention of melanin, which induces phagosome maturation arrest through inhibition of LC3-associated phagocytosis. Intracellular inhibition of Rhizopus is an important effector mechanism, as the infection of immunocompetent mice with swollen conidia, which evade phagocytosis, results in acute lethality. Concordantly, AM depletion markedly increases susceptibility to mucormycosis.

Host and pathogen transcriptomics, iron supplementation studies, and genetic manipulation of iron assimilation pathways of the fungi demonstrate that iron restriction inside macrophages regulates immunity against Rhizopus. Our findings shed light on the pathogenetic mechanisms of mucormycosis and reveal the role of macrophage-mediated nutritional immunity against filamentous fungi.

### Infection with Mycobacterium avium differentially regulates the expression of iron transport protein mRNA in murine peritoneal macrophages [^115UMHCa]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Iron is an important element for the growth of microorganisms as well as in the defense of the host by serving as a catalyst for the generation of free radicals via the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions. The iron transporter natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) confers resistance to the growth of a variety of intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium. Recently, several other proteins involved in iron transport, including the highly homologous iron transporter Nramp2 and the transferrin receptor-associated protein HFE (hereditary hemochromatosis protein), have been described. The relationship of these proteins to host defense and to the growth of intracellular pathogens is not known.

Here, we report that infection with M. avium differentially regulates mRNA expression of the proteins associated with iron transport in murine peritoneal macrophages. Both Nramp1 and Nramp2 mRNA levels increase following infection, while the expression of transferrin receptor mRNA decreases. The level of expression of HFE mRNA remains unchanged. The difference in the expression of the mRNA of these proteins following infection or cytokine stimulation suggests that they may play an important role in host defense by maintaining a delicate balance between iron availability for host defense and, at the same time, limiting iron availability for microbial growth.

### Differentiation of functional dendritic cells and macrophages from human peripheral blood monocyte precursors is dependent on expression of p21 (WAF1/CIP1) and requires iron [^1179roLf]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Iron is required for the monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60 leukaemia cells. This differentiation process necessitates the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (WAF1/CIP1) and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint. In conditions of iron depletion, both p21 induction and differentiation are blocked. To further elucidate the roles of iron and p21 in normal monocyte/macrophage differentiation, we examined the generation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages from peripheral monocytes.

Monocytes were cultured with interleukin 4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), then treated with lipopolysaccharide to produce DCs or with M-CSF to produce macrophages. Iron deprivation was induced by desferrioxamine (DF).

- **Characteristic phenotype and stimulation**: Monocyte-derived DCs had a characteristic phenotype and morphology and stimulated the proliferation of naïve allogeneic T lymphocytes. In contrast, DCs generated under iron deprivation were phenotypically undifferentiated and did not stimulate T cells. Similarly, macrophages also expressed a characteristic phenotype and morphology and were capable of phagocytosing latex beads. However, macrophages generated under iron deprivation failed to develop a mature phenotype and exhibited impaired phagocytosis.

- **Role of iron and p21 induction**: Iron deprivation blocked the induction of p21 (WAF1/CIP1) expression in both DC and macrophage cultures. Additionally, the use of p21 antisense oligonucleotides, as opposed to sense oligonucleotides, inhibited both DC and macrophage differentiation. These findings indicate that a key role of iron in haematopoiesis is to support the induction of p21, which is crucial for DC and macrophage differentiation.

### The regulation of hepcidin and its effects on systemic and cellular iron metabolism [^115v9B9Y]. Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic iron homeostasis depends on the regulated expression of hepcidin, a peptide hormone that negatively regulates iron egress from intestinal cells and macrophages by altering the expression of the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. In doing so, hepcidin can control both total body iron by modulating intestinal iron absorption and promote iron available for erythropoiesis by affecting the efficiency with which macrophages recycle iron from effete red blood cells. This review focuses on the systemic and cellular physiology of hepcidin regulation in relation to iron stores, erythropoiesis, inflammation, and hypoxia, and how hepcidin regulation and dysregulation contribute to normal iron homeostasis and iron metabolism disorders.

### Obesity alters adipose tissue macrophage iron content and tissue iron distribution [^1157LqHc]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The results of the study raise several important questions regarding the physiological relevance of ATM iron metabolism to AT function, as well as the mechanisms underlying impaired MFehi ATM iron handling in obesity. Adequate control of iron availability appears crucial to AT homeostasis. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that heme-associated iron induces preadipocyte differentiation and is required to support adipogenesis. In contrast to its role in supporting adipogenesis, in vitro iron treatment induces lipolysis and insulin resistance in mature adipocytes.

Gabrielsen et al. recently used a series of dietary and genetic manipulations to induce adipocyte iron overload, demonstrating that adipocyte iron regulates adiponectin expression and systemic glucose homeostasis. In agreement with these findings, we observed a significant decrease in adipocyte Adipoq gene expression following obesity-induced adipocyte iron accumulation. Interestingly, the occurrence of adipocyte iron overload in our study coincided with a reduction in MFehi ATM iron content and iron-recycling gene expression.

In light of our findings and existing literature on AT iron metabolism, we propose a working model whereby resident MFehi ATMs fulfill dual roles. They provide an adequate supply of iron to support adipogenesis, similar to the role of macrophages as a source of iron for proliferating lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, and protect adipocytes from oxidative stress by scavenging extracellular heme. Thus, impaired MFehi ATM iron handling in the setting of hyperinsulinemia may have significant implications.

### Iron and intestinal immunity [^115EbrZN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the study of iron metabolism have led to a better understanding of the molecular basis for the interactions between iron and the inflammatory response. We will review this new information in the context of the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Recent findings**: The effects of iron on microbial enteropathogens are well known. Recent work has demonstrated that iron also has potentially important effects on the intestinal microbiota. On the host side, hepcidin, a key regulator of mammalian iron metabolism, has emerged as an important mediator of the cross-talk between iron homeostasis and inflammation. Hepcidin-dependent changes in iron flux can influence the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and conversely, inflammatory cytokines can induce hepcidin expression and alter iron homeostasis. Hepcidin levels have been found to be elevated in some studies of inflammatory bowel disease, while manipulating hepcidin expression in animal models of this condition has beneficial effects on both inflammation and dysregulated iron metabolism.

- **Summary**: The information on iron metabolism that has become available in recent years has shed new light on the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and is also starting to suggest new approaches to treating such diseases.

### Iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 in human monocytes, macrophages and duodenum: Expression and regulation in hereditary hemochromatosis and iron deficiency [^117RktSr]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

The functions of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2), which control cellular iron homeostasis, are similar but not identical. As an inappropriate up-regulation of total IRP activity has been found in the duodenum and monocytes of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), we investigated the respective roles of IRP1 and IRP2 in these settings.

Specific antibodies were used in RNA-supershift, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry assays to evaluate IRP1 and IRP2 separately in monocytes, macrophages, and the duodenum of control subjects, as well as patients with HH or iron-deficiency anemia.

The activity of both IRP1 and IRP2 and the levels of IRP2 were observed as follows:

- **Higher levels in monocytes and macrophages**: In HH patients compared to control subjects.
- **Increased levels in duodenal samples**: Observed in patients with HH and iron-deficiency anemia. IRP2 levels increased when monocytes differentiated to macrophages. Under all examined conditions, IRP2 was induced to a greater extent.

In the duodenum of HH and anemic patients, IRP1 was shifted from the aconitase form (present in controls) to the apoform, whereas IRP1 in monocytes/macrophages was always in the apoform in both the patients and controls. The RNA-bound fraction of IRP1 was small in all of the samples. Both IRPs were expressed more in the villi than in the crypts of the duodenum, with no differences in localization or expression between the patients and controls.

These findings represent the first extensive investigation of the comparative roles of IRP1 and IRP2 in HH and iron deficiency.

### Dysfunction of the heme recycling system in heme oxygenase 1-deficient mice: Effects on macrophage viability and tissue iron distribution [^115fbhTF]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

To better understand the tissue iron overload and anemia previously reported in a human patient and mice that lack heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), we studied iron distribution and pathology in HO-1 (Hmox1)(-/-) mice. We found that resident splenic and liver macrophages were mostly absent in HO-1(-/-) mice. Erythrophagocytosis caused the death of HO-1(-/-) macrophages with in vitro experiments, supporting the hypothesis that HO-1(-/-) macrophages died of exposure to heme released on erythrophagocytosis. Rupture of HO-1(-/-) macrophages in vivo and release of non-metabolized heme probably caused tissue inflammation.

In the spleen, initial splenic enlargement progressed to red pulp fibrosis, atrophy, and functional hyposplenism in older mice, recapitulating the asplenia of an HO-1-deficient patient. We postulate that the failure of tissue macrophages to remove senescent erythrocytes led to intravascular hemolysis and increased expression of the heme and hemoglobin scavenger proteins, hemopexin and haptoglobin. Lack of macrophages expressing the haptoglobin receptor, CD163, diminished the ability of haptoglobin to neutralize circulating hemoglobin, and iron overload occurred in kidney proximal tubules, which were able to catabolize heme with HO-2. Thus, in HO-1(-/-) mammals, the reduced function and viability of erythrophagocytosing macrophages are the main causes of tissue damage and iron redistribution.

### Interleukin-33 signaling controls the development of iron-recycling macrophages [^1121m7ar]. Immunity (2020). Low credibility.

We explored mechanisms underlying the accumulation of IL-33 in erythrocytes. IL-33 localizes to the nucleus in nucleated cells, and it is unclear how IL-33 is stored in erythrocytes lacking a cell nucleus. We have found evidence for IL-33 gene transcription in bone-marrow-derived erythrocyte precursors consistent with studies in related hematopoietic cell precursors. We also observed a partial role for IL1RL1 in acquiring and/or maintaining IL-33 in erythrocytes. However, overall, our data are inconsistent with IL-33 detected in mature erythrocytes being maintained on the cell surface by IL1RL1.

The ELISA used to measure IL-33 in erythrocyte lysates does not detect IL-33 in complex with IL1RL1 (I.C.S. and E.S.C. unpublished data), and we were unable to detect endogenous IL-33 on the surface of erythrocytes or erythrocyte precursors. We demonstrated the expression of IL1RL1 with binding activity on erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. Although the function of IL1RL1 during erythrocyte development is poorly understood, there is evidence for a role for IL-33 signaling in enucleation of erythroid precursors. Still, additional studies will be required to elucidate mechanisms by which erythrocytes maintain a store of IL-33 in the absence of a nucleus and to further investigate the role of IL1RL1 in the bone marrow during the development of erythrocytes.

In conclusion, we have shown that IL-33 is unique in its local requirement for the development and specification of a tissue-resident macrophage phenotype, and in its cooperation with an essential biochemical signal.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^11199Pfc]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

Activation of lysosomal digestive proteases in endosomes is dependent on lysosomal acidification, which is regulated via vacuolar-H+-adenosine triphosphatases (vATPases). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment helped identify the pathways associated with upregulated vATPases in cre/+ mice (Figure 6 E-F; supplemental Figure 7 G). The macrophage-specific vATPase subunit Atp6v0d2 was one of the most differentially expressed genes in the cre/+ macrophages in the bulk RNA-seq experiment (supplemental Figure 6 E). Atp6v0d2 immunostaining confirmed the significantly increased expression of the subunit in the duodenal LP macrophages in the cre/+ mice (Figure 6 G).

Analysis of LP macrophages revealed increased mRNA expression of TfR1 (CD71) in the duodenal LP (Figure 6 H; supplemental Figure 7 H). In cluster 1 of the cre/+ animals, expression of Zfp36, which encodes thymidine 5′-triphosphate (TTP) and has been shown to induce TfR1 expression in an mTORC1-dependent manner, was significantly higher (fold change = 2.1; adjP = 1.29E−10). Consistently, LP macrophages from the cre/+ mice were able to engulf more Tf iron ex vivo, whereas the lysosomal pH-disrupting drug hydrochloroquine reduced Tf-iron uptake (Figure 6 I).

Because our data indicated increased protease expression and activity in the duodenum of cre/+ mice, we wanted to confirm this with an activity-based protease probe in situ. We found increased elastase-like and chymotrypsin activity in cre/+ mice (Figure 6 J; supplemental Figure 7 I-J). Finally, to examine the contribution of protease activities downstream of mTORC1 in macrophages, further investigation is warranted.

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^112JyxrS]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

We also report here a similar role for macrophage-derived iron during skin wound healing, a complex tissue repair process consisting of overlapping phases of inflammation and tissue remodeling in which macrophages play a key role. The use of mice lacking FPN selectively in cells of the myeloid lineage allowed us to define the role of macrophage iron in wound healing in the absence of the systemic iron overload and large local iron accumulation present in other models. In the present setting, the disruption of iron export from local macrophages delayed wound healing, apparently by preventing neighboring mesenchymal and stromal cells from receiving the iron supply necessary for growth and differentiation.

In line with the higher FPN expression in M2 than in M1 macrophages, the lack of macrophage FPN exerts its major effects in the middle-late phase of repair when the M1 to M2 switch occurs. Indeed, in the late stages, normal M2 skin macrophages export iron through enhanced FPN expression, whereas FPN-deficient macrophages accumulate iron with concomitant induction of ferritin and repression of TfR1. The lower fibrosis score and the decreased expression of collagen-1 and αSMA show that the stromal component is compromised, as the absence of macrophage FPN resulted in iron deprivation and impaired proliferation of stromal cells. In this context, fibroblasts may not receive enough iron, which can be among the paracrine factors secreted by M2 macrophages to favor cell multiplication. A detrimental effect on collagen synthesis and assembly may occur.

### Ironing out an approach to alleviate the hypoferremia of acute inflammation [^112mrkdh]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

In the steady state, iron levels in the plasma are regulated by the recycling of iron from senescent red blood cells by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. In systemic infections and inflammatory states, perturbation of this process can result in hypoferremia (a decrease in circulating iron levels), which may represent a host defense mechanism to limit iron availability to pathogens. Because hypoferremia restricts the availability of iron to erythroid precursors, if sustained, it contributes to the development of the anemia of inflammation. In this issue of Haematologica, Agoro et al. report that the acute hypoferremic response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is modulated in mice by pretreatment with a truncated, C-terminal fragment of the hormone fibroblast growth factor 23.

During inflammatory states, iron is sequestered in cells due to a reduction in activity of ferroportin, the major cellular iron exporter that is expressed by multiple cell types, including macrophages. Activity of the ferroportin transporter on cell membranes is regulated by hepcidin, the key iron regulatory hormone synthesized primarily by the liver. Hepcidin occludes the ferroportin transporter and triggers its endocytosis and degradation. Hepcidin expression is induced in response to several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β, as well as LPS. In addition to its post-translational regulation by hepcidin, ferroportin expression is regulated at the mRNA level by inflammatory stimuli.

### Ironing out the role of ferroptosis in immunity [^115u5HkF]. Immunity (2024). High credibility.

Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that drives the pathophysiology of many diseases. Oxidative stress is detectable in many types of regulated cell death, but only ferroptosis involves lipid peroxidation and iron dependency. Ferroptosis originates and propagates from several organelles, including the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and lysosomes. Recent data have revealed that immune cells can both induce and undergo ferroptosis. A mechanistic understanding of how ferroptosis regulates immunity is critical to understanding how ferroptosis controls immune responses and how this is dysregulated in disease. Translationally, more work is needed to produce ferroptosis-modulating immunotherapeutics.

This review focuses on the role of ferroptosis in immune-related diseases, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. We discuss how ferroptosis is regulated in immunity, how this regulation contributes to disease pathogenesis, and how targeting ferroptosis may lead to novel therapies.

### Interleukin-33 signaling controls the development of iron-recycling macrophages [^111jai5v]. Immunity (2020). High credibility.

We used previously validated assays of hemin-mediated induction of monocyte differentiation into an iron-recycling macrophage phenotype to survey potential roles of type 1 and type 2 cytokines on this process in the presence and absence of heme. We found that only IL-33 produced a significant increase in gene expression of markers of the RPM phenotype (Figures 1A and S1A). IL-33 alone had a limited impact. However, co-stimulation of macrophages with IL-33 and hemin led to a substantial increase in hemin-induced expression of Spic (Figure 1A). Other prototypic genes of iron-recycling macrophages, including Treml4, Vcam1, and Hmox1, were significantly upregulated (Figure 1A), whereas the expression of Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of Spic, was not altered (Figure 1A). Of note, IL-33 alone substantially induced the expression of Lcn2 (Figure 1A), which encodes a protein (Lipocalin-2) that regulates iron transport and limits microbial growth through sequestration of iron-containing siderophores, further supporting a role for IL-33 in the induction of an iron-recycling RPM phenotype. We obtained similar results with IL-33 in human CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure S1B).

### Activated macrophages induce hepcidin expression in HuH7 hepatoma cells [^116UX9M9]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

Hepcidin is an iron regulatory peptide produced by the liver in response to inflammation and elevated systemic iron. Recent studies suggest that circulating monocytes and resident liver macrophages — Küpffer cells — may influence both basal and inflammatory expression of hepcidin.

- **Design and methods**: We used an in vitro co-culture model to investigate hepatocyte hepcidin regulation in the presence of activated THP1 macrophages. HuH7 hepatoma cells were co-cultured with differentiated THP1 macrophages for 24 hours prior to the measurement of HuH7 hepcidin (HAMP) mRNA expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and HAMP promoter activity using a luciferase reporter assay. Luciferase assays were performed using the wild type HAMP promoter and constructs containing mutations in BMP/SMAD4, STAT3, C/EBP, and E-BOX response elements. Neutralizing antibodies against interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta, and the bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor noggin were used to identify the macrophage-derived cytokines involved in the regulation of HAMP expression.

- **Results**: Co-culturing HuH7 cells with differentiated THP1 cells induced HAMP promoter activity and endogenous HAMP mRNA expression maximally after 24 hours. This induction was fully neutralized in the presence of an interleukin-1beta antibody and fully attenuated by mutations of the proximal C/EBP or BMP/SMAD4 response elements.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that the interleukin-1beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways are central to the regulation of HAMP expression by macrophages in this co-culture.

### Macrophages and iron metabolism [^115hWJSy]. Immunity (2016). High credibility.

Iron is a transition metal that, due to its inherent ability to exchange electrons with a variety of molecules, is essential to support life. In mammals, iron exists mostly in the form of heme, enclosed within an organic protoporphyrin ring and functioning primarily as a prosthetic group in proteins. Paradoxically, free iron also has the potential to become cytotoxic when electron exchange with oxygen is unrestricted, catalyzing the production of reactive oxygen species. These biological properties demand that iron metabolism is tightly regulated so that iron is available for core biological functions while preventing its cytotoxic effects. Macrophages play a central role in establishing this delicate balance. Here, we review the impact of macrophages on heme-iron metabolism and, reciprocally, how heme-iron modulates macrophage function.

### Macrophage ferroportin is essential for stromal cell proliferation in wound healing [^111X5pkf]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

The role of erythrophagocytic macrophages as a source of iron for erythropoiesis is well established. However, macrophages may also be involved in iron redistribution at a local tissue level, thus affecting neighboring cells. We previously showed that FPN-mediated iron release from human macrophages supports in vitro cell proliferation. In the present study, we demonstrated that a steady supply of iron released by macrophage FPN is essential for tissue homeostasis in two conditions: follicular development and wound healing. Both conditions share many similarities, including a fast cell growth rate. Our study, therefore, highlights a new iron-related function of macrophages in tissue homeostasis and regeneration, aligning with the increasing recognition of these cells' considerable functional polyvalence and trophic role, in addition to their established immunological functions. We did not address the effect of FPN gene deletion in other myeloid cells affected in the LysM conditional model adopted here, as their contribution to iron storage and release is negligible compared to that of macrophages.

### Cytokine-mediated regulation of iron transport in human monocytic cells [^115WHWbZ]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Under chronic inflammatory conditions, cytokines induce a diversion of iron traffic, leading to hypoferremia and retention of the metal within the reticuloendothelial system. However, the regulatory pathways underlying these disturbances of iron homeostasis are poorly understood. We investigated transferrin receptor (TfR)-dependent and -independent iron transport mechanisms in cytokine-stimulated human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937.

Combined treatment of cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduced TfR mRNA levels, surface expression, and iron uptake, and these effects were reversed by interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus stimulating TfR-mediated iron acquisition. IFN-gamma and LPS dose-dependently increased the cellular expression of divalent metal transporter-1, a transmembrane transporter of ferrous iron, and stimulated the uptake of nontransferrin bound iron (NTBI) into cells. At the same time, IFN-gamma and LPS down-regulated the expression of ferroportin mRNA, a putative iron exporter, and decreased iron release from monocytes. Preincubation with IL-10 partly counteracted these effects.

Our results demonstrate that the proinflammatory stimuli IFN-gamma and LPS increase the uptake of NTBI via stimulation of divalent metal transporter-1 expression and cause retention of the metal within monocytes by down-regulating ferroportin synthesis. Conversely, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 stimulates TfR-mediated iron uptake into activated monocytes. The regulation of iron transport by cytokines is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of anemia of inflammation.

### Presence of the iron exporter ferroportin at the plasma membrane of macrophages is enhanced by iron loading and down-regulated by hepcidin [^117AAQRr]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Ferroportin, the only mammalian iron exporter identified at the time of writing, is highly expressed in duodenal enterocytes and macrophages. Several lines of evidence indicate that in enterocytes, the iron export mediated by ferroportin occurs and is regulated at the basolateral cell surface, where the transporter is strongly expressed. In contrast, in macrophages, ferroportin has been shown in intracellular vesicles. We used a high-affinity antibody to specify the localization of endogenous ferroportin expressed in primary culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages, in both basal and induced conditions.

Our observations indicate that ferroportin is expressed in vesicular compartments that can reach the plasma membrane of macrophages. Importantly, when ferroportin expression was up-regulated through iron treatment or erythrophagocytosis, ferroportin expression was strongly enhanced at the plasma membrane of macrophages. Furthermore, hepcidin dramatically reduced macrophage ferroportin protein levels. At the subcellular level, hepcidin was shown to induce rapid internalization and degradation of the macrophage iron exporter. These data are consistent with a direct iron export by ferroportin through the plasma membrane of macrophages and strongly support an efficient posttranscriptional down-regulation of ferroportin by hepcidin in these cells.

### Liver X receptor activation stimulates iron export in human alternative macrophages [^117DaYxi]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

In atherosclerotic plaques, iron preferentially accumulates in macrophages where it can exert pro-oxidant activities.

The objective of this study was to better characterize the iron distribution and metabolism in macrophage subpopulations in human atherosclerotic plaques, and to determine whether iron homeostasis is under the control of nuclear receptors, such as the liver X receptors (LXRs).

- **Methods and results**: We report that iron depots accumulate in human atherosclerotic plaque areas enriched in CD68 and mannose receptor (MR)-positive (CD68(+)MR(+)) alternative M2 macrophages. In vitro IL-4 polarization of human monocytes into M2 macrophages also resulted in a gene expression profile and phenotype favoring iron accumulation. However, M2 macrophages exposed to iron acquire a phenotype favoring iron release through a strong increase in ferroportin expression, illustrated by a more avid oxidation of extracellular low-density lipoprotein by iron-loaded M2 macrophages. In human atherosclerotic plaques, CD68(+)MR(+) macrophages accumulate oxidized lipids, which activate LXRα and LXRβ, resulting in the induction of ABCA1, ABCG1, and apolipoprotein E expression. Moreover, in iron-loaded M2 macrophages, LXR activation induces nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 expression, thereby increasing ferroportin expression, which, together with a decrease of hepcidin mRNA levels, promotes iron export.

These data identify a role for M2 macrophages in iron handling, a process regulated by LXR activation.

### Obesity alters adipose tissue macrophage iron content and tissue iron distribution [^115QRwG7]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Recent studies describing the in vitro influence of polarization on macrophage iron handling suggest that M2 polarization induces an iron-recycling phenotype characterized by elevated Tfrc, Cd163, Hmox 1, and Fpn expression and an increased capacity for iron uptake and release. In contrast, M1 polarization elicits an iron sequestration phenotype. Our in vivo data agree with this model insofar as MFe hi ATMs present an iron-recycling gene expression profile (i.e. upregulation of iron importers and the exporter, ferroportin) and elevated expression of M2 markers. However, important differences exist with respect to MFe hi ATM phenotype and the published in vitro model of M1/M2 macrophage polarization and iron metabolism.

The in vitro model suggests that M2 polarized macrophages have a reduced capacity for iron storage and that M1 macrophages display an iron sequestration phenotype with an associated increase in ferritin heavy-chain expression. This stands in stark contrast to our finding of elevated iron content in alternatively activated MFe hi ATMs. Likewise, based on the published model, one would predict that inflammation would lead to iron sequestration by M1 ATMs. On the contrary, our in vivo data suggest that obesity-associated inflammation does not increase recruited M1 ATM iron stores; rather, we observed a selective decrease in the iron content of MFe hi ATMs coinciding with a shift toward an inflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that treatment of macrophages with saturated fatty acids reduced genes and proteins associated with iron storage.

### Duodenal macrophages control dietary iron absorption via local degradation of transferrin [^112WwBod]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

Iron is an essential metal that plays a key role in many basic cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, cellular metabolism, cell growth, and oxygen transport in erythrocytes. Because of the lack of a regulated mechanism for iron excretion in the body, iron absorption is critical to the control of iron homeostasis.

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are major health problems associated with various pathophysiological conditions of gastrointestinal diseases and inflammatory conditions. Iron absorption is known to be impaired in a range of these pathophysiological complications, which also limits the success of oral iron supplementation therapies, necessitating a better understanding of iron uptake physiology.

Dietary iron is absorbed at the brush border of duodenal epithelial cells. After the iron is absorbed from the diet, its export from the epithelial cells into circulation is facilitated by the iron exporter SLC40A1 (also known as ferroportin-1 [FPN1]) and the major iron transport protein transferrin (Tf), which safely carries iron to the target tissues. Tf has two high-affinity binding sites for the metal, and iron-saturated holo-Tf is internalized by target cells through TfR1-mediated endocytosis. Current knowledge suggests that iron export from the duodenal epithelial cells is mainly controlled by the concerted expression and degradation of FPN1 as a consequence of the circulating iron hormone hepcidin, whereas Tf is mainly expressed in the liver and reportedly not critical to the control of iron absorption.

### Metalloreductase Steap3 coordinates the regulation of iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses [^112MwYHZ]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Iron and its homeostasis are intimately related to inflammatory responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the role of Steap3 in regulating iron homeostasis in macrophages and the effects of Steap3 depletion on host inflammatory responses.

- **Design and methods**: We analyzed bone marrow-derived macrophages and primary cultured hepatocytes from Steap3(-/-) mouse models to investigate the roles of Steap3 in coordinately regulating iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses. First, we examined iron distribution and iron status in cells deficient in Steap3, as well as the requirement for the Steap3 gene during inflammatory responses. Secondly, we analyzed the regulation of Steap3 expression by inflammatory stimuli and the influence of these stimuli on iron distribution and homeostasis.

- **Results**: We found that Steap3 mRNA was expressed at high levels in macrophages and hepatocytes. Steap3 deficiency led to impaired iron homeostasis, causing abnormal iron distribution and decreased availability of cytosolic iron in macrophages. Among STEAP family members, Steap3 mRNA was uniquely down-regulated in macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides. To determine whether Steap3 regulated iron homeostasis during inflammatory stress, we treated Steap3(-/-) mice with lipopolysaccharide, which produced greater iron accumulation in the vital tissues of these mice compared to the tissues of wild-type controls. Furthermore, Steap3 depletion led to impaired induction of interferon-β and monocyte chemoattractant protein-5.

### Iron in airway macrophages and infective exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1122iW3t]. Respiratory Research (2022). Low credibility.

Excess pulmonary iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung disease, including asthma and COPD. An association between higher iron content in sputum macrophages and infective exacerbations of COPD has previously been demonstrated.

- **Objectives**: To assess the mechanisms of pulmonary macrophage iron sequestration, test the effect of macrophage iron-loading on cellular immune function, and prospectively determine if sputum hemosiderin index can predict infectious exacerbations of COPD.

- **Methods**: Intra- and extracellular iron was measured in cell-line-derived and freshly isolated sputum macrophages under various experimental conditions, including treatment with exogenous IL-6 and hepcidin. Bacterial uptake and killing were compared in the presence or absence of iron-loading. A prospective cohort of COPD patients with defined sputum hemosiderin indices was monitored to determine the annual rate of severe infectious exacerbations.

- **Results**: Gene expression studies suggest that airway macrophages have the requisite apparatus of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. IL-6 and hepcidin play roles in pulmonary iron sequestration, though IL-6 appears to exert its effect via a hepcidin-independent mechanism. Iron-loaded macrophages had reduced uptake of COPD-relevant organisms and were associated with higher growth rates. Infectious exacerbations were predicted by sputum hemosiderin index (β = 0.035, p = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrate in-vitro and population-level evidence that excess iron in pulmonary macrophages may contribute to airway infection in COPD.

### Endogenous hepcidin and its agonist mediate resistance to selected infections by clearing non-transferrin-bound iron [^112NhqcE]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin is induced early in infection, causing iron sequestration in macrophages and decreased plasma iron; this is proposed to limit the replication of extracellular microbes but could also promote infection with macrophage-tropic pathogens. The mechanisms by which hepcidin and hypoferremia modulate host defense and the spectrum of microbes affected are poorly understood.

Using mouse models, we show that hepcidin was selectively protective against siderophilic extracellular pathogens, such as _Yersinia enterocolitica_ O9, by controlling non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) rather than iron-transferrin concentration. NTBI promoted the rapid growth of siderophilic, but not nonsiderophilic, bacteria in mice with either genetic or iatrogenic iron overload and in human plasma. Hepcidin or iron loading did not affect other key components of innate immunity, did not indiscriminately promote intracellular infections like _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, and had no effect on extracellular nonsiderophilic _Y. enterocolitica_ O8 or _Staphylococcus aureus_.

Hepcidin analogs may be useful for the treatment of siderophilic infections.

### Nramp1 phagocyte intracellular metal withdrawal defense [^113gqKTt]. Microbes and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (Nramp) are multispecific symporters that facilitate the proton-dependent import of divalent metals. Nramp1 restricts microbial access to essential micronutrients, such as iron and manganese, within professional phagosomes. An increased understanding of Nramp1 roles in human phagocytes will be useful for future therapeutic approaches against selected infectious and immune diseases.
