## Question

And the Her 2 score 3?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a HER2 score of 3+ means, how it is defined, how it differs from 2+ and 1+/0, what the clinical implications are for prognosis and therapy, and what pitfalls and special scenarios pathologists and clinicians should consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the HER2 scoring framework and the exact IHC criteria that define 3+. Then, I should verify how 3+ differs from 2+ and 1+/0 in both biology and clinical implications. Next, I will review prognostic and therapeutic consequences, including the role of ISH testing and the emergence of HER2-low. After that, I need to check for exceptions, discordances, and quality assurance issues that can mimic or obscure 3+ status. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer anchored to current ASCO/CAP and NCCN guidance [^115yPqMb] [^116ydVur].

> Let me first confirm the scoring framework so I don't misstate thresholds. HER2 IHC in breast cancer is reported on a 0 to 3+ semiquantitative scale, where 3+ indicates unequivocal protein overexpression, 2+ is equivocal, and 0/1+ are negative; this is the backbone of ASCO/CAP and UK guidance and remains the standard in 2023 updates [^115yPqMb] [^1163fFXD] [^117FApsi].

> Now, I should define 3+ precisely. Wait, let me verify the percentage threshold because older literature sometimes cites 30%. The current ASCO/CAP definition requires circumferential, complete, intense membrane staining in more than 10% of invasive tumor cells, and importantly, only membranous staining of invasive carcinoma is scored; cytoplasmic staining and in situ components are not considered, and normal epithelium should be negative [^115yPqMb] [^116QEDUy] [^117FApsi]. Hold on, I should also confirm that the 2018 update aligned the IHC threshold to > 10% rather than > 30%, which it did, and that remains affirmed in 2023 [^117YRg5Z] [^113TFLwe].

> Next, I will contrast 3+ with 2+ and 1+/0 so I don't conflate categories. IHC 2+ is weak to moderate complete membrane staining in more than 10% of invasive tumor cells and is considered equivocal, mandating reflex ISH testing to determine amplification status; IHC 1+ is faint or barely perceptible incomplete membrane staining in more than 10% of cells, and IHC 0 is no staining or only very focal, barely perceptible staining in 10% or fewer cells; both 0 and 1+ are considered HER2-negative for conventional anti-HER2 therapy decisions [^115yPqMb] [^116QEDUy] [^117FApsi]. Let me double-check that the algorithm still requires ISH for all 2+ cases; yes, that remains a universal reflex requirement in current guidance [^115yPqMb] [^115SA5fX].

> I will now examine the biological meaning of 3+. A 3+ IHC result correlates tightly with HER2 gene amplification and with high HER2 copy number, typically far exceeding the thresholds used in ISH algorithms; this amplification drives aggressive tumor biology and historically conferred worse prognosis in the absence of targeted therapy, which is why 3+ is considered the archetypal HER2-positive phenotype [^111eohsQ] [^115HNjDd]. Hold on, I should verify that 3+ cases generally have higher ISH copy numbers than 2+/ISH+ cases; indeed, comparative data show higher copy numbers and better outcomes in IHC 3+ versus IHC 2+/ISH+ cohorts, reinforcing the biological gradient behind the scoring system [^115HNjDd].

> Next, I should review clinical implications so I don't overgeneralize. Clinically, HER2 3+ is an indication for HER2-targeted therapy across settings, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, with treatment selection tailored to disease stage, hormone receptor status, and prior therapies; in early disease, adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens incorporating anti-HER2 therapy are standard, and in metastatic disease, multiple lines of HER2-directed therapy are recommended by ASCO and NCCN [^115LnKf9] [^112iUxpf]. Let me verify that 3+ status alone suffices for eligibility without ISH confirmation; yes, 3+ is definitive for HER2-positive and does not require reflex ISH in routine practice [^115yPqMb] [^116QEDUy].

> But wait, what about the newer HER2-low paradigm and antibody–drug conjugates like trastuzumab deruxtecan; does 3+ still carry the same implications? I need to ensure I separate conventional HER2-positive therapy from ADC indications. The 2023 ASCO/CAP update recognizes that trastuzumab deruxtecan has efficacy in HER2-low disease (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH not amplified) and advises reporting IHC 0 versus 1+ because eligibility can hinge on that distinction; however, 3+ tumors remain in the HER2-positive category and are treated with standard anti-HER2 regimens, with ADCs often considered later-line options rather than replacements for first-line HER2-positive therapy [^115cVewA] [^113TFLwe]. Hold on, I should verify that the footnote language explicitly flags IHC 1+ and 2+/ISH− for ADC eligibility; yes, the guideline update includes that reporting comment to support treatment selection [^115cVewA].

> I should confirm prognostic distinctions so I don't overstate uniformity. Compared with IHC 2+/ISH+ disease, IHC 3+ disease tends to have higher HER2 copy numbers and, in some cohorts, better survival after adjustment, suggesting that the intensity of HER2 overexpression tracks with both biology and outcomes; nonetheless, in the absence of anti-HER2 therapy, HER2 positivity confers worse prognosis, which is reversed with targeted treatment [^115HNjDd] [^111vhU3s]. Let me reconsider whether 3+ itself modifies baseline risk; yes, HER2-positive tumors generally have higher recurrence risk without targeted therapy, and modern outcomes are driven largely by receipt and intensity of anti-HER2 treatment rather than IHC category alone [^111vhU3s] [^115LnKf9].

> Next, I should review pitfalls and special scenarios so we don't jump to conclusions from a lone 3+ call. Discordant scenarios include rare 3+ IHC with non-amplified ISH, often due to heterogeneity or technical issues; in such cases, pathologists should review the IHC and ISH on the same tissue, consider targeted ISH recounting, and correlate with morphology, because discordant results may warrant repeat testing or alternative blocks to resolve heterogeneity [^112yZPFh] [^112YKyL3]. I need to check for histologic discordance too; a 3+ result in a grade 1, pure tubular, mucinous, or cribriform carcinoma should prompt re-review of both grade/histotype and the HER2 assay, as this pattern is uncommon and may reflect testing error or unusual biology [^116ydVur] [^112yZPFh]. Hold on, I should verify that the 2018 update also addressed ISH groups with ratio ≥ 2.0 but low copy number; yes, those are handled by integrated IHC–ISH review and are not automatically called amplified without supportive IHC, which helps avoid overcalling amplification in biologically discordant cases [^112YKyL3].

> I will now examine quality assurance and testing practices that influence accurate 3+ calls. Validated IHC assays with appropriate positive and negative controls, adherence to fixation and processing standards, and participation in proficiency testing are essential; when results are borderline or controls are atypical, repeating IHC or performing ISH on the same or a new specimen is recommended to avoid misclassification, particularly around the 0/1+ and 1+/2+ boundaries that now have therapeutic implications in the ADC era [^112kMfC6] [^117QucdW] [^115cVewA]. Let me double-check that CAP also supports preferential use of FDA-cleared assays; yes, that remains a best-practice recommendation to reduce analytic variability [^117QucdW].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A HER2 score of 3+ on IHC means there is strong, complete, circumferential membrane staining in more than 10% of invasive tumor cells, indicating HER2 protein overexpression that almost always reflects underlying gene amplification; clinically, it establishes the tumor as HER2-positive and confers eligibility for standard anti-HER2 therapies across neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings, with prognosis now largely determined by access to and intensity of HER2-targeted treatment rather than the IHC category alone [^117YRg5Z] [^115LnKf9] [^112iUxpf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform outcomes; while 3+ generally predicts benefit from anti-HER2 therapy, careful attention to assay quality, tissue heterogeneity, and discordant ISH patterns ensures we do not misclassify edge cases and that patients receive appropriate, guideline-concordant care [^112P8srW] [^112yZPFh].

---

A HER2 score of 3+ means **strong, complete membrane staining** [^116QEDUy] in more than 10% of invasive tumor cells [^117YRg5Z], indicating HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification [^notfound]. This result is **considered HER2-positive** and qualifies patients for anti-HER2 therapies such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab deruxtecan [^115rm3qA] [^115cVewA]. HER2 3+ tumors are typically aggressive but respond well to targeted therapy, improving outcomes [^111eohsQ] [^115HNjDd].

---

## Definition and criteria for HER2 3+

According to ASCO/CAP guidelines, **HER2 3+** is defined by the following criteria:

- **Intensity**: Strong, complete, circumferential membrane staining [^116QEDUy].
- **Percentage**: More than 10% of invasive tumor cells show this staining pattern [^116QEDUy].
- **Pattern**: Uniform, contiguous staining readily appreciated at low power [^116QEDUy].

---

## Clinical significance of HER2 3+

HER2 3+ status is **clinically significant** because it indicates HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification, which drive tumor growth and proliferation [^111UAoUr]. This molecular phenotype is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, higher recurrence rates, and poorer prognosis without targeted therapy [^111eohsQ]. However, HER2 3+ tumors are highly responsive to HER2-targeted therapies, which have significantly improved outcomes [^111vhU3s].

---

## Prognostic implications

HER2 3+ tumors generally have a **poorer prognosis** than HER2-negative tumors, particularly in the absence of targeted therapy [^111eohsQ]. They exhibit higher recurrence rates and increased metastatic potential. However, the development of HER2-targeted therapies has substantially improved prognosis for patients with HER2 3+ tumors, reducing recurrence and improving survival [^111vhU3s].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Patients with HER2 3+ tumors are eligible for **HER2-targeted therapies**, including:

- **Trastuzumab**: A monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, commonly used in adjuvant and metastatic settings [^115LnKf9].
- **Pertuzumab**: Often combined with trastuzumab for enhanced therapeutic effect [^112iUxpf].
- **Trastuzumab deruxtecan**: An antibody-drug conjugate effective in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer [^112iUxpf].

These therapies have **significantly improved survival** and reduced recurrence rates in patients with HER2 3+ tumors [^111vhU3s].

---

## Comparison with other HER2 scores

| **Her2 score** | **Definition** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | No staining or incomplete, faint membrane staining in ≤ 10% of cells | HER2-negative; no benefit from HER2-targeted therapy |
| 1+ | Faint or barely perceptible membrane staining in > 10% of cells | HER2-negative; no benefit from HER2-targeted therapy |
| 2+ | Weak to moderate complete membrane staining in > 10% of cells | Equivocal; requires ISH testing to confirm HER2 status |
| 3+ | Strong, complete membrane staining in > 10% of cells | HER2-positive; eligible for HER2-targeted therapy |

---

## Testing methods and validation

HER2 status is **typically assessed** using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as the initial test, followed by in situ hybridization (ISH) — fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) — for equivocal cases (IHC 2+) [^115yPqMb]. Strict quality control, validation, and standardized protocols are essential to ensure accurate and reproducible results [^112kMfC6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from ASCO/CAP and NCCN emphasize the importance of **accurate HER2 testing** and provide clear criteria for interpreting HER2 scores. They recommend that all new primary or metastatic breast cancers undergo HER2 testing, with repeat testing considered in cases of discordant results or suboptimal initial samples [^116ydVur].

---

A HER2 score of 3+ indicates **strong HER2 overexpression** and gene amplification, qualifying patients for effective HER2-targeted therapies that have markedly improved outcomes.

### Biology, prognosis and response to therapy of breast carcinomas according to HER2 score [^111eohsQ]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The standardization of the HER2 score and recent changes in therapeutic modalities points to the need for a reevaluation of the role of HER2 in recently diagnosed breast carcinoma.

Patients and Methods

A multicenter, retrospective study of 1794 primary breast carcinomas diagnosed in Italy in 2000/2001 and scored in HER2 four categories according to immunohistochemistry was conducted.

Results

Ductal histotype, vascular invasion, grade, MIB1 positivity, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression differed significantly in HER2 3+ tumors compared with the other categories. HER2 2+ tumors almost showed values intermediate between those of the negative and the 3+ subgroups. The characteristics of HER2 1+ tumors were found to be in between those of HER2 0 and 2+ tumors. With a median follow-up of 54 months, HER2 3+ status was associated with higher relapse rates in node-positive and node-negative subgroups, while HER2 2+ only in node positive. Analysis of relapses according to type of therapy provided evidence of responsiveness of HER2-positive tumors to chemotherapy, especially taxanes.

Conclusions

The present prognostic significance of HER2 is correlated to receptor expression level and points to the need to consider HER2 2+ and HER2 3+ tumors as distinct diseases with different outcomes and specific features.

### Updated UK recommendations for HER2 assessment in breast cancer [^117FApsi]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Scoring immunohistochemistry

Only membrane staining of the invasive tumour should be considered when scoring HER2. Cytoplasmic staining and staining of in situ disease should not be scored, and normal epithelium should be negative. The HER2 IHC scoring method is a semiquantitative system based on the intensity of reaction product and percentage of membrane positive cells, giving a score range of 0–3+ (figure 1). Samples scoring 3+ are regarded as unequivocally positive, and those scoring 0/1+ as negative. Borderline scores (2+) are regarded as equivocal and mandate further assessment using ISH (figure 1). Appropriate controls featuring different scores (3+, 2+ and 1+/0) should be included in every test run. Some centres also include an on-slide positive control section. The HER2 test should be reported as indeterminate, and repeated where possible, if technical issues prevent one or both tests (IHC and ISH) from being reported as positive, negative or equivocal. Examples include, inadequate specimen handling, artefacts (eg, crush or marked edge artefacts) that make interpretation difficult, analytical testing failure or if controls are not as expected (ie, sample shows strong membrane staining of normal breast tissue). In such a case, an alternative test, or another specimen if available, should be used to determine HER2 status. These guidelines revert to the previously used IHC criterion of > 10% cells staining for HER2instead of the > 30% cut-off used in the previous guidelines.

### HER2 immunohistochemical scores provide prognostic information for patients with HER2-type invasive breast cancer [^115HNjDd]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Invasive breast cancer patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemical (IHC) scores of 3+ or 2+ with reflex in-situ hybridisation (ISH) positivity are suitable for anti-HER2 therapies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the prognoses between IHC 3+ patients and IHC 2+/ISH+ patients are different.

Methods and Results

We analysed the clinicopathological information of 886 consecutive cases of HER2-positive early breast cancer. The influences of the patients' age, cancer stage, hormone receptor status and anti-HER2 treatment were adjusted using a multivariate Cox regression model. Both HER2 copy numbers and HER2 ISH ratios of the IHC 3+ group were significantly higher than those of the IHC 2+/ISH+ group. The outcomes of IHC 3+ patients were significantly better than those of IHC 2+/ISH+ patients in the univariate and multivariate analyses. HER2 copy numbers of ≥ 8 represented the best prognostic value, and it was chosen to be the cut-off value. The reflex ISH for IHC 2+ patients with high HER2 copy numbers (≥ 8) predicted a better overall survival than that for those with low HER2 copy numbers.

Conclusion

HER2 IHC scores and HER2 copy numbers can provide prognostic information for patients with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. Both IHC 3+ and IHC 2+ patients with high HER2 copy numbers had a better prognosis.

ASCO-CAP HER2 testing algorithm — definitions and repeat testing triggers: IHC 2+ (equivocal) is defined as invasive breast cancer with weak to moderate complete membrane staining observed in > 10% of tumor cells. If an initial core needle biopsy HER2 test is negative, a new HER2 test may be ordered on the excision specimen on the basis of some criteria (including a tumor grade 3).

### Distinguishing score 0 from score 1 + in HER2 immunohistochemistry-negative breast cancer: clinical and pathobiological relevance [^11257Cd1]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical and pathobiological significance of distinguishing score 0 and score 1+ within the group of immunohistochemistry (IHC)-negative invasive breast cancers.

Methods

We studied HER2 status using both IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 150 consecutive breast tumors submitted to our laboratory after a negative IHC result in local testing centers.

Results

We were able to discern a group of score 0 tumors that had a lower HER2 copy number than the group consisting of score 1+ tumors. In contrast with the group of score 1+ tumors, HER2 FISH was consistently negative for both copy number-based and ratio-based tumors without equivocal results.

Conclusions

In a setting with stringent quality assurance, score 0 and score 1+ tumors emerge as distinct and clinically important subgroups within the HER2 IHC-negative population.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: ASCO-college of American pathologists guideline update [^115cVewA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO–College of American Pathologists (CAP) HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing in breast cancer — the 2018 recommendations are affirmed, and HER2 testing should still be optimized for the predictive purpose of identification of breast cancers with protein overexpression and/or gene amplification who could benefit from therapies aimed at disrupting HER2 signaling pathways. Pathology labs should include a footnote in their HER2 testing reports with the recommended comment that "Patients with breast cancers that are HER2 IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH amplified may be eligible for several therapies that disrupt HER2 signaling pathways", that invasive breast cancers testing "HER2-negative" (IHC 0, 1+, or 2+/ISH not-amplified) are "HER2-negative for protein overexpression/gene amplification", and that "Patients with breast cancers that are HER2 IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH not-amplified may be eligible for a treatment that targets non-amplified/non-overexpressed levels of HER2 expression for cytotoxic drug delivery (IHC 0 results do not result in eligibility currently)". HER2 IHC 1+ or 0 results are still both interpreted as HER2-negative, and the semiquantitative IHC score must always be reported to ensure patients who meet eligibility criteria for trastuzumab deruxtecan can be identified. Since eligibility for trastuzumab deruxtecan (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH not-amplified) may hinge around the IHC 0/IHC 1+ threshold, pathologists can make best practice efforts to distinguish IHC 1+ from 0 by examining HER2 IHC at high power (40×) when discriminating 0 from 1+ staining and considering second pathologist review when results are close to the 0 versus 1+ interpretive threshold (> 10% of cells with incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible). Medical oncologists can also consider HER2 IHC results on prior or concurrent primary samples (or other metastatic sites) because there may be heterogeneity in HER2 expression levels between samples and because metastatic cancer tissue samples may suffer from preanalytic conditions that are not as well monitored as in primary breast tissue samples.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116u8Ry9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring in gastric cancer — criteria and reflex testing: Surgical specimens are scored as follows — 0: no reactivity or membranous reactivity in < 10% of cancer cells; 1+: faint or barely perceptible membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells, with cells reactive only in part of their membrane; 2+: weak to moderate complete, basolateral, or lateral membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells; 3+: strong complete, basolateral, or lateral membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells. Biopsy specimens are scored as follows — 0: no reactivity or membranous reactivity in any cancer cell; 1+: cluster of five or more cancer cells with a faint or barely perceptible membranous reactivity irrespective of percentage of cancer cells positive; 2+: cluster of five or more cancer cells with a weak to moderate complete, basolateral, or lateral membranous reactivity irrespective of percentage of cancer cells positive; 3+: cluster of five or more cancer cells with a strong complete, basolateral, or lateral membranous reactivity irrespective of percentage of cancer cells positive. The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends that HER2 IHC be ordered/performed first, followed by ISH methods in cases showing 2+ (equivocal) expression by IHC; positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing, and cases with HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2 or an average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals/cell are considered positive by ISH/FISH.

Breast cancer HER2 IHC QIA — examples of unusual HER2 IHC staining with panel guidance include the following: for "Strong cytoplasmic staining only" pathologists should "consider calling equivocal (2+) and sending for ISH testing". For "Heterogeneous staining (separate clustered areas with different staining patterns)" laboratories should "ensure that ROIs scored were in the strongest areas of staining", "Report results based on correlation with the overall percentage of the invasive cancer with a similar staining pattern", and "If there is more than 10% 3+ staining, the case should be considered positive for HER2 overexpression", with "Pathologists should document the percentage that is positive and not that heterogeneity was present". For "Discordant result with histology (eg, grade 1 or pure tubular or mucinous carcinoma that is HER2 3+)" the panel advises to "consider reevaluating the grade/histologic subtype as well as the HER2 test" and notes that "Additional testing on subsequent specimens may be required to resolve this discordant finding".

HER2 testing algorithm in GEA — Strong Recommendation: When GEA HER2 status is being evaluated, laboratories/pathologists should perform/order IHC testing first followed by ISH when the IHC result is 2+ (equivocal); positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing (Quality of evidence: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). In the ToGA trial, high HER2 expression was defined as HER2 score 3+ by IHC or HER2 score 2+ by IHC and HER2 positivity (amplified) by FISH; HER2-positive results by FISH were observed in 11% of cases with an IHC score of 0 and 12% of cases with an IHC score of 1+, and other studies have shown HER2 positivity by ISH in up to 14% to 24% of tumors with IHC scores of 0 or 1+. These patients did not significantly benefit from the addition of trastuzumab to the chemotherapy regimen in the ToGA trial, and subsequent studies and reviews demonstrated that ISH positivity alone does not correlate with response to trastuzumab therapy in GEA.

Validation requirements for HER2 QIA — Validation is described as a formal system to gather and document evidence ensuring a method consistently meets predetermined acceptance criteria, applies to both new and existing assays, and varies by assay type. There are 2 major types of QIA systems: FDA-cleared/approved or laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). For FDA-cleared/approved assays, validation must be performed on a minimum of 20 positive and 20 negative samples independently scored by several pathologists. Equivocal samples examined by both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) should also be included for completeness. Regarding scoring, a schema matching the ASCO/CAP guideline is preferable, with score 0 and 1+ = negative, score 2+ = equivocal, and score 3+ = positive.

IHC–ISH interpretive thresholds and testing sequence in GEA: Specimens with 3+ overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or FISH positivity (HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2) are considered positive, whereas specimens having an IHC score of 0 or 1+ are considered negative and do not warrant further testing; the concordance between IHC 3+ and ISH positivity was high, with 94% concordance in the ToGA trial and 62% to 100% in the literature, with most reporting concordance of 90% or higher; initial HER2 testing should be performed by IHC, and in situ hybridization (ISH) should be reserved for IHC 2+ cases; ISH-positive results have been observed in 30% to 50% of IHC 2+ tumors; if the IHC score is borderline and the distinction between 1+ and 2+ is challenging, HER2 ISH can be considered, but this approach is not recommended for cases that show an obvious 1+ IHC score and, in most cases, ISH is not indicated if IHC scores are 0, 1+, or 3+.

HER2 (ERBB2) test reporting — key elements for pathology reports are outlined in a synoptic template that lists essential reporting elements, with element selection and reporting at the discretion of the medical professional, and the report to include a brief Methods section describing the kit or critical reagents and instruments used. For a gene test, include the correct gene symbol (ERBB2) following the colloquial synonym (HER2 [ERBB2]), and document the number of observers as defined. Report elements include immunohistochemistry (IHC) result categories Negative (score 0), Negative (score 1+), Equivocal (score 2+), Positive (score 3+), or Indeterminate, and in situ hybridization (ISH) result categories Negative (not amplified), Positive (amplified), or Indeterminate. Methods fields for HER2 protein expression by IHC include whether testing was FDA cleared or laboratory-developed and the primary antibody (4B5, HercepTest, A0485, SP3, CB11 or other), and the reporting professional is responsible for ensuring quality via analytic interpretation and validated protocols. Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of recommendation: Strong.

IHC scoring criteria and image analysis considerations in GEA: The immunohistochemistry (IHC) is subjectively scored on a four-tiered scale as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+, with scores of 0 and 1+ considered negative, 3+ as positive, and 2+ as equivocal; similar to breast cancer, only membranous staining, but not cytoplasmic staining, is considered for HER2 scoring, and unlike breast carcinoma, complete membranous staining is not required for positivity; only luminal surface staining in the absence of lateral and basal staining is considered negative; scoring using automated image analysis or virtual microscopy can be objective but has not been shown to improve reproducibility, and although a few studies show good concordance of image analysis with a visual method for scoring HER2 IHC results, at this time, there are limited data to make a specific recommendation for or against using image analysis for scoring HER2 in clinical practice.

Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

HER2 testing in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma — clinical question 2 specifies topics to ensure optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of established assays, including analytic performance of IHC and ISH with parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, gold standard, and consensus among testing laboratories, and the correlation between IHC scores (0–3) and ISH results. It addresses acceptable methodologies for HER2 IHC and ISH and the optimal testing algorithm for assessment of HER2 status, validation steps for a laboratory developed HER2 gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma assay and whether validation should differ for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and breast specimen. It also asks whether HER2 copy numbers plus chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) ratios can define HER2 status in ISH testing including cases with apparent polysomy, whether scoring criteria should be the same for biopsy versus resection specimen, how to interpret and report HER2 heterogeneity, when a specimen should be reported as indeterminate, and further topics of how HER2 results should be reported, specimen handling and morphologic correlation for ISH, quality assurance/quality control standards, and the role for HER2 genomic testing.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison of FISH Groups, FDA Guidelines Status, and ASCO-CAP Guidelines Status, and Associations With Outcomes in BCIRG Clinical Trials

Although cancers in group 3 are designated as ISH positive by ASCO-CAP guidelines, our results suggest that this group is a mixture of HER2 not amplified and amplified breast cancers, with the majority being not amplified on the basis of criteria described previously. These categorizations are supported by associations with HER2 expression (Data Supplement Table S1), as well as similar findings from a clinical consultation practice where breast cancers with high average HER2 gene copy number per cell are associated with HER2 protein overexpression (IHC2+ and IHC3+), whereas those with lower average HER2 copy number per cell are associated with low HER2 protein expression by IHC. Nevertheless, we did not have a sufficient number of cases in these subgroups in the BCIRG trials to separately evaluate their association with clinical outcomes.

Because the HER2 -not amplified BCIRG-005 trial completed accrual in February 2003 and the HER2 -amplified BCIRG-006 trial continued accrual until March 2004 with local laboratory IHC prescreening for approximately 60% of breast cancers submitted to the central laboratories, the prevalence of HER2 amplification in the screened population increased from 26% while both trials were in the accrual stageto 40% when BCIRG-006 completed accrual a year later. Nevertheless, the distribution of cases in groups 2, 3, and 4 are similar to those in our consultation practice where the ASCO-CAP group 1, or HER2 amplification, rate is 18%.

There are now nearly three decades of accumulated experience and published data studying this alteration in human breast cancers. Although guidelines are helpful, diagnostic judgment and long-term outcome data remain important in the evaluation of testing criteria.

### Anticipating changes in the HER2 status of breast tumours with disease progression-towards better treatment decisions in the new era of HER2-low breast cancers [^114mX3yP]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The observed HER2 expression changes may be explained by a number of factors associated with the tumour and/or the diagnostic process. Firstly, they could be partly explained by intra-tumoral heterogeneity which was reported by several authors and which is probably associated with resistance to HER2-targeted therapy. Indeed, HER2 expression seems to be non-uniform in some breast tumours due to the co-existence of multiple cancer cell subpopulations in the same tumour area or in different areas of a single tumour, and so lead to discrepant HER2 status results, depending on the analysed region. Then, BC treatments, whether surgical or systemic (including chemotherapy, hormone therapy or conventional anti-HER2 therapies), could modify (upregulate) the HER2 expression levels in tumour cells during the course of the disease. Furthermore, many cases of the presumed HER2 expression change may be due to the evolution of HER2 immunohistochemistry protocols, including labelling heterogeneity depending on the reagents and antibodies used, and the introduction of quality controls over time. Indeed, before the development of ADC therapies, HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ scores were both considered to be HER2-negative. Since discriminating between the 0 and 1+ IHC score had no clinical implications, some laboratories may have used protocols which did not reliably differentiate between these two categories, and so it is possible that some of the 1+ specimens were simply misclassified. For example, the fact that no on-slide quality controls were used in the early 2000's may have led to false negative results. These controls, progressively emerging over time with the improvement of staining protocols, are considered to be essential today. Indeed, both negative (0), positive (3 +), or even — ideally — multiple (0; 1+; 2+; 3+) internal or external controls are now required to be used for all HER2 immunohistochemistry stainings as essential for result interpretation. Finally, some of the discordances in the HER2 status between the primary and recurrent tumours we observed in our study may be due to inter-observer variability, i.e. variations in the interpretation of HER2 testing results, especially when it comes to differentiating between HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ scores, which can be very challenging. In a recent study, Schettini and colleagues evaluated the reproducibility of HER2 IHC scoring by five pathologists specialised in breast cancer, coming from different institutions, on a hundred cases, and showed that the reproducibility was suboptimal, with 35% of discordant cases, especially in the HER2-low subgroup. However, in the era of anti-HER2 ADC therapies which are indicated for patients with HER2-low BCs, it is essential to develop more sensitive assays for HER2 evaluation, to harmonise scoring practices by training pathologists, and to strongly incite pathology laboratories to apply stringent quality control systems in order to better discriminate HER IHC 0 and 1+ specimens and so correctly identify HER2-low tumours so as to give a chance of treatment to all eligible patients.

HER2 Protein Expression by IHC in Each ASCO-CAP FISH Group

We determined whether HER2 ISH-positive breast cancers, categorized by the new ASCO-CAP guidelines as groups 1, 2, and 3, were correlated with HER2 protein overexpression or, alternatively, low expression. As described in the Data Supplement, we found that only breast cancers in group 1 (FISH ratio ≥ 2.0, average HER2 copy number/cell ≥ 4.0) were significantly associated with HER2 overexpression (IHC3+), with 75% of these showing either IHC2+ (28%) or IHC3+ (47.3%) immunostaining (P < .0001; Table 2).

In contrast, breast cancers from group 2 (FISH ratio ≥ 2.0, average HER2 copy number/cell < 4.0) were associated with low HER2 expression, not overexpression (P = 0.007), as > 90% showed either IHC0 or IHC1+ immunostaining (Table 2), whereas breast cancers in group 3 (FISH ratio < 2.0, average HER2 copy number/cell ≥ 6.0) were not significantly (P = 0.3881) associated with either overexpression or low expression. Breast cancers in ASCO-CAP ISH groups 4 and 5 — ISH equivocal and ISH negative, respectively — were also significantly associated with low HER2 expression (both P < .0001; Table 2).

Breast cancers of group 3 (FISH ratio < 2.0, average HER2 copy number/cell ≥ 6.0) were composed of two different groups of breast cancers, a substantial majority (76%) of which were associated with low HER2 expression, whereas a minority (Data Supplement, Table S1 and Fig S2) showed HER2 overexpression.

Clinical Outcomes by ASCO-CAP ISH Groups

Because HER2 amplification is a known adverse prognostic marker for shorter DFS and OS and predictive of improved outcomes with trastuzumab therapy, we used these outcomes to determine whether ASCO-CAP FISH groups were associated with particular end points, as expected for either HER2-positive disease or HER2-negative disease. Because the natural history of HER2 gene amplification and overexpression in patients with breast cancer is associated with worse DFS and OS in the absence of HER2-targeted therapy, and with significantly improved DFS and OS with HER2-targeted therapy, -, we have used these clinical outcomes to support the assignment of the various FISH groups as either amplified or not amplified as summarized below.

### Outcomes in premenopausal patients with HR + / HER2-Breast cancer and lymph node micrometastasis based on the 21-gene recurrence score [^116yEahK]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This study identified that lymph node micrometastasis is not rare in HR+/HER2− early breast cancer, and yet real-world data on patterns of practice reflect a lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment of patients with this staging. The 21-gene recurrence score is a valid biomarker prognosticating overall survival in patients with micrometastasis. While an overall survival benefit was identified in patients receiving chemoendocrine therapy in the context of low recurrence scores and macro-metastasis to 1–3 lymph nodes, there was no significant difference in the node-negative nor micrometastatic setting.

### A multivariable prognostic score to guide systemic therapy in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a retrospective study with an external evaluation [^116ySNw4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

In early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, escalation or de-escalation of systemic therapy is a controversial topic. As an aid to treatment decisions, we aimed to develop a prognostic assay that integrates multiple data types for predicting survival outcome in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer.

Methods

We derived a combined prognostic model using retrospective clinical-pathological data on stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, PAM50 subtypes, and expression of 55 genes obtained from patients who participated in the Short-HER phase 3 trial. The trial enrolled patients with newly diagnosed, node-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer or, if node negative, with at least one risk factor (ie, tumour size > 2 cm, histological grade 3, lymphovascular invasion, Ki67 > 20%, age ≤ 35 years, or hormone receptor negativity), and randomly assigned them to adjuvant anthracycline plus taxane-based combinations with either 9 weeks or 1 year of trastuzumab. Trastuzumab was administered intravenously every 3weeks (8mg/kg loading dose at first cycle, and 6mg/kg thereafter) for 18 doses or weekly (4mg/kg loading dose in the first week, and 2mg/kg thereafter) for 9weeks, starting concomitantly with the first taxane dose. Median follow-up was 91·4 months (IQR 75·1–105·6). The primary objective of our study was to derive and evaluate a combined prognostic score associated with distant metastasis-free survival (the time between randomisation and distant recurrence or death before recurrence), an exploratory endpoint in Short-HER. Patient samples in the training dataset were split into a training set (n = 290) and a testing set (n = 145), balancing for event and treatment group. The training set was further stratified into 100 iterations of Monte-Carlo cross validation (MCCV). Cox proportional hazard models were fit to MCCV training samples using Elastic-Net. A maximum of 92 features were assessed. The final prognostic model was evaluated in an independent combined dataset of 267 patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer treated with different neoadjuvant and adjuvant anti-HER2-based combinations and from four other studies (PAMELA, CHER-LOB, Hospital Clinic, and Padova) with disease-free survival outcome data.

Findings

From Short-HER, data from 435 (35%) of 1254 patients for tumour size (T1 vs rest), nodal status (N0 vs rest), number of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (continuous variable), subtype (HER2-enriched and basal-like vs rest), and 13 genes composed the final model (named HER2DX). HER2DX was significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival as a continuous variable (p < 0·0001). HER2DX median score for quartiles 1–2 was identified as the cutoff to identify low-risk patients; and the score that distinguished quartile 3 from quartile 4 was the cutoff to distinguish medium-risk and high-risk populations. The 5-year distant metastasis-free survival of the low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk populations were 98·1% (95% CI 96·3–99·9), 88·9% (83·2–95·0), and 73·9% (66·0–82·7), respectively (low-risk vs high-risk hazard ratio [HR] 0·04, 95% CI 0·0–0·1, p < 0·0001). In the evaluation cohort, HER2DX was significantly associated with disease-free survival as a continuous variable (HR 2·77, 95% CI 1·4–5·6, p = 0·0040) and as group categories (low-risk vs high-risk HR 0·27, 0·1–0·7, p = 0·005). 5-year disease-free survival in the HER2DX low-risk group was 93·5% (89·0–98·3%) and in the high-risk group was 81·1% (71·5–92·1).

Interpretation

The HER2DX combined prognostic score identifies patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer who might be candidates for escalated or de-escalated systemic treatment. Future clinical validation of HER2DX seems warranted to establish its use in different scenarios, especially in the neoadjuvant setting.

### Amplification of the HER2 gene in breast cancers testing 2 + weak positive by hercepTest immunohistochemistry: false-positive or false-negative immunohistochemistry? [^114Rsrm6]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of cases of breast cancer scoring HER2 weak positive (2+) on immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the HercepTest are not associated with amplification of the HER2/neu gene.

Aim

To examine the reproducibility of IHC in cases scoring 2+ subsequently shown to have gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH).

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 153 cases referred for FISH confirmation of a weak positive HercepTest (2+) result was performed. Repeat IHC was undertaken in cases with weak positive (2+) referral IHC and amplification of the HER2 gene by FISH.

Results

Amplification of the HER2 gene was confirmed in 29/153 cases (19%) scoring 2+ on IHC. Repeat IHC was carried out on 25 IHC 2+ cases: 7 (28%) scored 2+ on repeat IHC, 18 (72%) scored 3+ and were reclassified as strong positive. A heterogeneous expression pattern was present in 3/17 cases scoring 3+.

Conclusions

The majority of HercepTest 2+ results are not accompanied by gene amplification and represent "false positive" IHC in terms of prognostic or therapeutic relevance. A small proportion of HercepTest 2+ scores represent true 2+ IHC positive cases accompanied by gene amplification: a category probably biologically related to 3+ IHC cases. The remainder of cases of HercepTest 2+ accompanied by gene amplification represent a category of referral IHC 2+ weak positive, FISH amplified, repeat IHC 3+ strong positive, best described as "false negative 2+ IHC". This has implications for selection of cases for FISH analysis where weak positive (2+) IHC score is used as a triage for FISH testing, and for testing strategies in referral laboratories undertaking FISH analysis.

NCCN invasive breast cancer — 50-gene (Prosigna) risk categories and implications list node-negative Low (0–40), Intermediate (41–60), and High (61–100), and state that for patients with T1 and T2 HR-positive, HER2-negative, pN0 tumors a low-range risk of recurrence score places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a–T1b, N0, M0. For node-positive disease (Low [0–40]), in HR-positive, HER2-negative, pN+ tumors (1–3 positive lymph nodes) treated with endocrine therapy alone, the distant recurrence risk was less than 3.5% at 10 years and no distant recurrence was seen at 10 years in the TransATAC study in a similar group.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111Miduz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Colon Cancer — HER2 testing and anti-HER2 therapy indications are defined as follows: Diagnostic testing is via immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Positive by IHC is defined as 3+ staining in more than 50% of tumor cells, and those with a HER2 score of 2+ should be reflexed to FISH testing; HER2 amplification by FISH is considered positive when the HER2:CEP17 ratio is ≥ 2 in more than 50% of the cells, and NGS is another methodology for testing for HER2 amplification. Anti-HER2 therapy with signal transduction inhibition (for example, trastuzumab/pertuzumab, trastuzumab/tucatinib, or trastuzumab/lapatinib) is indicated for patients with HER2 IHC 3+, IHC2+/ISH+, or NGS amplified cancer that are also RAS and BRAF wild-type, and Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is only indicated in HER2-amplified tumors (IHC 3+). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112RXsuN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

HER2 testing in gastric cancer — immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring definitions and in situ hybridization (ISH) criteria are as follows: A score of 0 (membranous reactivity in < 10% of cancer cells) or 1+ (faint membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells) is considered HER2-negative, whereas a score of 2+ (weak to moderate membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells) is considered equivocal and should be additionally examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other ISH methods. FISH/ISH results are expressed as an ERBB2:CEP17 ratio within the nucleus counted in at least 20 cancer cells, or as the average ERBB2 copy number per cell. Cases with IHC 3+ (strong membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells) or IHC 2+ with FISH/ISH positivity (ERBB2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 or average ERBB2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/cell) are considered HER2 overexpression positive, and positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing.

### HER2DX and survival outcomes in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: an individual patient-level meta-analysis [^1162VZBn]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Background

HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for 15–20% of all breast cancers and is characterised by HER2 (also known as ERBB2) amplification. Although HER2-targeted therapies have markedly improved outcomes, current clinical-pathological variables and pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy are insufficient to fully capture biological heterogeneity and guide personalised treatment. HER2DX is a genomic test that integrates tumour biology and clinical data to stratify risk. Here, we conducted an individual patient-level meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the HER2DX risk score and survival outcomes in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and individual patient-level meta-analysis using data from studies of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancer, incorporating HER2DX risk scores, clinical information, and survival outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed on Dec 15, 2024, and complemented by a review of in-house databases to identify eligible studies with HER2DX testing and patient-level data. Eligible studies were required to include more than 50 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 therapy, with available survival outcomes, and HER2DX testing performed. Individual-level data were requested from study investigators or accessed through public repositories. HER2DX risk score was evaluated as continuous score and as a risk group using pre-established cutoffs (low vs high). The primary endpoint of the study was event-free survival, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable stratified Cox models were used to estimate stratified hazard ratios (HRs). The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42025634137).

Findings

11 studies met the inclusion criteria (APT, ATEMPT, CALGB40601, DAPHNe, GOM-HGUGM-2018–05, NEOHER, SOLTI-PAMELA, PHERGain, HUAC, SCAN-B, and DFCI-14–409) and were selected for the meta-analysis. Of 3244 patients identified across the selected studies, 2518 were included in the analysis (those with available HER2DX clinical data and survival outcomes). The median follow-up was 6·1 years (95% CI 6·0–6·3). Of 2518 patients, 891 (35·4%) had stage 1 disease, 1133 (45·0%) stage 2 disease, and 494 (19·6%) stage 3 disease. Hormone receptor-positive disease was present in 1660 (65·9%) of 2518 patients and 1259 (50·0%) of 2518 patients had a high HER2DX risk score. In the multivariable analysis, HER2DX as a continuous variable was independently associated with event-free survival (stratified HR per 10-unit increment 1·25, 95% CI 1·14–1·38; p < 0·0001). Patients classified as HER2DX low risk had a 6-year event-free survival rate of 93·6% (95% CI 92·0–95·2), compared with 82·9% (80·0–85·5) for the HER2DX high-risk group, representing a 10·7% absolute difference (stratified HR 2·72, 95% CI 1·97–3·76; p < 0·0001). This association was consistent across subgroups, regardless of tumour stage, nodal stage, pathological complete response, or hormone receptor status.

Interpretation

HER2DX provides clinically meaningful prognostic stratification in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, beyond standard clinical-pathological variables and pathological response. These results support its use in tailoring treatment intensity and guiding clinical decision making.

### Clinicopathologic features and genomic profile of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-ultralow invasive breast carcinomas [^116RzsGt]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Recent clinical trials have identified significant benefits of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting antibody conjugates in invasive breast carcinomas with HER2-low and HER2-ultralow expression, challenging the conventional binary HER2 status.

Objective —

To examine the clinicopathologic features and genomic profile of HER2-low and HER2-ultralow invasive breast carcinomas.

Design —

Two hundred thirteen cases were identified with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) reported as 0, 1+, and 2+/in situ hybridization-negative with Oncotype DX results from 2017–2022. One hundred seventy-eight cases with hematoxylin-eosin and HER2 slides available were independently scored by 5 pathologists blinded to the reported HER2 results as HER2 0, 0–1, 1+, 2+, using light microscopy. For each HER2 IHC score, patient age, tumor characteristics, and HER2 mRNA expression scores were compared. Additionally, each hormone receptor IHC score was compared to its respective mRNA expression scores.

Results —

The overall interobserver agreement of HER2 IHC scoring was substantial, with a κ value of 0.689 (0.658–0.710; P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in age and tumor characteristics by HER2 IHC scores. HER2 IHC scores were significantly associated with median HER2 mRNA expression scores (P < .001). However, for all 3 biomarkers, significant overlaps in mRNA expression scores existed between the different IHC scores.

Conclusions —

In our study, there were no significant differences in clinicopathologic features among HER2 IHC scores. In addition, there was considerable overlap in HER2 and hormone receptor mRNA scores across different IHC categories, limiting their utility as predictors of HER2 and hormone receptor IHC scores.

### The clinical and biological significance of HER2 over-expression in breast ductal carcinoma in situ: a large study from a single institution [^115gAgqN]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess HER2 in DCIS using in situ hybridisation. In this study, similar to a previous study, but in invasive tumour, the concordance between 3+ IHC and CISH-amplified cases was 100%, denoting all HER2 over-expressing cases as having HER2 gene amplification. In contrast, the proportion of 2+ IHC that were HER2 amplified, as detected by CISH, was 73.5%, which is lower than previously reported (93%). The 26.5% (26/98) IHC-equivocal/ HER2 non-amplified tumours in this study, all of which had 2+ IHC scores, is higher than the result obtained by other studies on invasive tumours. – The concordance between 0/1+ IHC and HER2 non-amplified tumours was 99.7%. A similar finding was reported by Zhao and colleagues and they considered that there is a small undetermined percentage of amplified HER2 without protein over-expression. The same study and other FISH studies on invasive carcinoma also reported rare 3+ IHC tumours that were non-amplified, – however, we did not detect any such cases.

The low-amplified HER2 category (≥ 4 to < 6 CISH signals) was the most difficult to interpret, requiring an accurate enumeration of gene copy and addition of more tumour cells to assess the final status. This step was particularly important because these cases could either resolve as amplified (4/7) or non-amplified (3/7). Signal clustering, more probably a result of intra-chromosomal amplification of homogeneously staining regions, was immediately evident in highly amplified cases and was easily evaluated.

We observed a lower HER2 expression in DCIS compared to the previously published literature. This might be related to the increasing detection of low- and intermediate-grade DCIS by screening mammography. In support of this the HER2 positivity was higher (30%) in the earlier period of the study and declined over time to 20% (Fig. 2).

### Prognostic and predictive values of EGFR overexpression and EGFR copy number alteration in HER2-positive breast cancer [^1133V59s]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Epidermal growth factor receptor alterations occur at an advanced stage of malignancy characterised by metastatic competence, and EGFR is thought to promote cancer cell migration and invasion. In the present study, we have shown that EGFR overexpression is a poor prognostic factor in two independent sets of HER2-positive primary breast cancer patients. In the first set, patients with EGFR-overexpressing tumours showed poor disease-free survival, and the poor prognostic impact of EGFR overexpression (3+) was also applied to the subgroup not receiving trastuzumab. Furthermore, in the second set, EGFR overexpression was associated with poor disease-free and overall survival of the patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. Therefore, these results indicate that EGFR overexpression has a prognostic and predictive value in HER2-positive primary breast cancers.

However, there are, at present, no validated scoring systems for EGFR protein overexpression assessed by IHC. We therefore analysed the clinical significance of EGFR overexpression using two different cutoff values (3+, 2+ or more). We found that prognostic impact of EGFR overexpression using two different criteria was similar, although not same. Previous studies that showed prognostic significance of EGFR overexpression in HER2-positive breast cancer also used different cutoff values for EGFR expression, and even any membranous staining was found to be significant. However, they used different clones and different staining methods for EGFR IHC. In this study, we used EGFR pharmDx Kit, which is approved for the identification of colorectal cancer patients eligible for treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab, but any membranous staining or expression of 1+ or more had no prognostic impact on the survival of the patients. Thus, most reliable cutoff values for EGFR overexpression and its standard staining method should be determined to predict the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer patients, but, in the study, EGFR overexpression of 3+ was found to be most predictive.

### HER2 gene amplification testing by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): comparison of the ASCO-college of American pathologists guidelines with FISH scores used for enrollment in breast cancer international research group clinical trials [^1162K7Ae]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

ASCO-CAP guidelines changed the HER2 -to-CEP17 ratio used for amplification from ≥ 2.0 to ≥ 2.2 in 2007, then changed the ratio back to ≥ 2.0 in 2013and 2014with the addition of formalized categories using average HER2 copy numbers per tumor cell. Because these new criteria for amplification by ISH are likely to select somewhat different patient populations for HER2-targeted therapies, we retrospectively re-evaluated these issues with breast cancers that had annotated long-term clinical outcomes from our clinical trials.

Because HER2 amplification is accepted as directly associated with protein overexpression, a worse DFS and OS in the absence of HER2-targeted therapy, and with improved outcomes with HER2-targeted therapy, -, we used these as criteria for assessment of each newly defined ASCO-CAP group (Table 5). In these analyses, most patients experienced no change in HER2 amplification status as determined by FISH, as ASCO-CAP groups 1 and 5 represent the vast majority of patients (approximately 95%) and because the status as amplified (group 1) and not amplified (group 5) is not changed by the new guidelines (Table 5). Although we find only a small minority of patients (approximately 5%) are affected by the new ASCO-CAP guidelines changes, our findings contradict the designations of these guidelines for groups 2, 3, and 4. Groups 2 and 4, designated ISH positive and ISH equivocal, respectively, by the ASCO-CAP guidelines, seem to be HER2 not amplified on the basis of associations with a lack of protein overexpression (groups 2 and 4), a lack of response to trastuzumab treatment (group 2), and similar prognosis as group 5 for patients (group 4) treated with chemotherapy alone (Table 5). Overall, we observe approximately 99.3% agreement with initial FDA-approved guidelines and 94.7% agreement with current ASCO-CAP guidelines (Table 5). The 4.6% differential is related to the only two groups, groups 3 and 4, introduced by ASCO-CAP that lead to different assessments of HER2 status compared with FDA criteria. Finally, our observations indicate group 2, which represents 0.7% of breast cancers, is misclassified by both the FDA and ASCO-CAP guidelines as amplified and ISH positive (Table 5).

### Esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112rTyP1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

HER2 assessment in esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers uses an immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring system with scores ranging from 0 (negative) to 3+ (positive); in resection specimens the cut-off is greater than or equal to 10% immunoreactive tumor cells, and for biopsy specimens a cluster with 5% immunoreactive tumor cells is sufficient for scoring. A score of 0 (membranous reactivity in < 10% of cancer cells) or 1+ (faint membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells) is considered to be HER2-negative, whereas a score of 2+ (weak to moderate membranous reactivity in ≥ 10% of cancer cells) is considered equivocal and should be additionally examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other in situ hybridization (ISH) methods. FISH/ISH results are expressed as the ERBB2:CEP17 ratio within the nucleus counted in at least 20 cancer cells, and HER2 positive is defined by either IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ with FISH/ISH positivity, specifically ERBB2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2 or average ERBB2 copy number ≥ 6 signals/cell; positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) IHC results do not require further ISH testing.

### UK recommendations for HER2 assessment in breast cancer: an update [^1163fFXD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

The last UK breast cancer (BC) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing guideline recommendations were published in 2015. Since then, new data and therapeutic strategies have emerged. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) published a focused update in 2018 that reclassified in situ hybridisation (ISH) Group 2 (immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 2+and HER 2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP 17) ratio ≥ 2.0and HER 2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell), as well as addressed other concerns raised by previous guidelines. The present article further refines UK guidelines, with specific attention to definitions of HER2 status focusing on eight key areas: (1) HER2 equivocal (IHC 2+) and assignment of the ASCO/CAP ISH group 2 tumours; (2) the definition of the group of BCs with low IHC scores for HER2 with emphasis on the distinction between IHC score 1+ (HER2-Low) from HER2 IHC score 0 (HER2 negative); (3) reporting cases showing HER2 heterogeneity; (4) HER2 testing in specific settings, including on cytological material; (5) repeat HER2 testing, (6) HER2 testing turnaround time targets; (7) the potential role of next generation sequencing and other diagnostic molecular assays for routine testing of HER2 status in BC and (8) use of image analysis to score HER2 IHC. The two tiered system of HER2 assessment remains unchanged, with first line IHC and then ISH limited to IHC equivocal cases (IHC score 2+) but emerging data on the relationship between IHC scores and levels of response to anti-HER2 therapy are considered. Here, we present the latest UK recommendations for HER2 status evaluation in BC, and where relevant, the differences from other published guidelines.

### Impact of the 2018 ASCO / CAP HER2 guideline focused update [^114GbJpT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) guideline focused update revises the HER2 scoring criteria. We evaluated the impact on HER2 rates in breast carcinoma diagnosed at our center.

Methods

In a retrospective series of breast core biopsies with invasive carcinoma diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 (n = 1,350), HER2 status was classified according to 2013 and 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines and changes in HER2 status identified.

Results

The 2018 guidelines reclassified the HER2 status of 6% of patients. Most changed from HER2 equivocal status (equivocal by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization under the 2013 guidelines) to HER2-negative status (2018 guidelines). The HER2-positive rate decreased by 0.4%.

Conclusions

The 2018 guidelines decrease the rate of HER2 equivocal and positive breast cancer and reduce repeat HER2 testing on excision specimens. Approximately 0.4% of patients will become newly ineligible for anti-HER2 therapy.

### Prosigna risk of recurrence score and intrinsic subtypes are associated with adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy benefit in high-risk breast cancer [^117LE1Rp]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The ROR scores were, according to predefined cutpoints dived into three categories and 470 (41%) were in the low risk, 443 (39%) in the intermediate risk and 227 (20%) in the high-risk group, with a higher ROR score in patients with HER2-positive disease (Table 3). Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence for distant recurrence according to the ROR score categories for each of the treatment regimens (Fig. 2A CMF and Fig. 2B CEF) and HER2 status. A clear distinction according to ROR score category within HER2-negative and HER2-positive patients is shown for the CMF but not for the CEF group. A statistically significant heterogeneity in treatment effect according to ROR score category is shown in the multivariable analysis (Fig. 3) for DR (P interaction = 0.004), and TR (Supplemental Fig. 1, P interaction = 0.002), but not for OS (Supplemental Fig. 2, P interaction = 0.20) although with a similar trend of better effect with higher ROR score. Univariable results are shown in Supplemental Fig. 3, 4 and 5. A subdivision of the patients according to HER2 status did not show a differential treatment versus ROR score category interaction comparing patients with HER2-negative disease and HER2-positive disease; an increasing treatment effect with increasing ROR score category is present for both HER2-negative and HER2-positive disease, and a better treatment effect across all 3 ROR groups for HER2-positive (data not shown), following the results for ROR continuous score.

HER2: Binary Versus Quantitative Biomarker

Presently, it is unclear what and if a minimum expression of HER2 is important to portend therapeutic benefits with T-DXd.HER2 expression is progressively moving from being a "binary biomarker" with dualistic implications to be a "quantitative biomarker" across a spectrum, that deserves a continuous scoring system, highlighting the need to find trustworthy methods for the precise quantification of its expression to better guide treatment choices (Fig. 3).

HER2 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

HER2 molecular alterations can be also found in NSCLC. HER2 amplification is present in 1%-3% of cases, while HER2 hyperexpression in 2%-38%. HER2 mutations are reported in 1%-4% of NSCLCs, the most common involving the intracellular domain and being in-frame insertion mutations in exon 20 (eg, A775_G776insYVMA). Both pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and selective TKIs have limited use in HER2-mutant NSCLCs, due to the poor efficacy showed by the former and the major toxicity brought by the latter. Similarly, anti-HER2 mAb have limited efficacy when used in monotherapy, with some activity shown only in association with chemotherapy.

Interest in targeting HER2 alterations in NSCLC made a comeback thanks to ADCs.T-DM1 was evaluated in HER2-overexpressing NSCLC with unsatisfying results, especially in patients with HER2 IHC 2+, while promising results were seen in patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC (ORR: 44%), irrespectively of the mutation subtypes and HER2-protein expression levels.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists guideline recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer [^112kMfC6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a guideline to improve the accuracy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in invasive breast cancer and its utility as a predictive marker.

Methods

The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists convened an expert panel, which conducted a systematic review of the literature and developed recommendations for optimal HER2 testing performance. The guideline was reviewed by selected experts and approved by the board of directors for both organizations.

Results

Approximately 20% of current HER2 testing may be inaccurate. When carefully validated testing is performed, available data do not clearly demonstrate the superiority of either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) as a predictor of benefit from anti-HER2 therapy.

Recommendations

The panel recommends that HER2 status should be determined for all invasive breast cancer. A testing algorithm that relies on accurate, reproducible assay performance, including newly available types of brightfield ISH, is proposed. Elements to reliably reduce assay variation (for example, specimen handling, assay exclusion, and reporting criteria) are specified. An algorithm defining positive, equivocal, and negative values for both HER2 protein expression and gene amplification is recommended: a positive HER2 result is IHC staining of 3+ (uniform, intense membrane staining of > 30% of invasive tumor cells), a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) result of more than six HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a FISH ratio (HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 signals) of more than 2.2; a negative result is an IHC staining of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than 4.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or FISH ratio of less than 1.8. Equivocal results require additional action for final determination. It is recommended that to perform HER2 testing, laboratories show 95% concordance with another validated test for positive and negative assay values. The panel strongly recommends validation of laboratory assay or modifications, use of standardized operating procedures, and compliance with new testing criteria to be monitored with the use of stringent laboratory accreditation standards, proficiency testing, and competency assessment. The panel recommends that HER2 testing be done in a CAP-accredited laboratory or in a laboratory that meets the accreditation and proficiency testing requirements set out by this document.

### Optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy for early breast cancer-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update [^115jYGH9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Abemaciclib with endocrine therapy in high–risk early breast cancer — A 2022 update recommended 2 years of abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) plus endocrine therapy (ET) for patients with node–positive, hormone receptor–positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence and a Ki–67 score of ≥ 20% as determined by a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved test. The FDA expanded the approval of abemaciclib on March 3, 2023; this expanded approval eliminates the Ki–67 testing requirement, acknowledging the benefits observed across the intention–to–treat (ITT) population. At a median follow–up of 54 months, abemaciclib plus ET showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.680 (95% CI, 0.599 to 0.772) for invasive disease–free survival (IDFS), with 5–year absolute improvement in IDFS of 7.6% and distant relapse–free survival of 6.7% compared with ET alone; although fewer deaths have been reported in the abemaciclib–treated arm, statistical significance has not been reached.

### Predicting response to antibody drug conjugates: a focus on antigens' targetability [^111UAoUr]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2

The receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2, or HER2, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. HER2 homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with other receptors of the same family (eg, human epidermal growth factor receptor 3, HER3), favoring the autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine residues of the heterodimer and then triggering signaling pathways responsible for cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Owing to its oncogenic role, HER2 has been widely studied as a therapeutic target.

HER2 in Breast Cancer

Around 15–20% of all breast cancers (BCs) overexpress HER2. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines, BCs are defined as "HER2-positive" if HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is scored 3+ or 2+ with gene amplification detected by in situ hybridization (ISH). Tumors that do not meet these criteria are considered "HER2-negative". Given the results of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial, ASCO/CAP guidelines on HER2 testing in BC were recently updated recommending the addition of a footnote to HER2 testing reports to underline the need for recognizing tumors expressing low levels of HER2: although "HER2-low" (IHC scores 1+ or 2+ and negative ISH) and "HER2-ultra low" (IHC score 0 with incomplete and faint staining in less than 10% of tumor cells) BCs, are still not classified as new categories, they should be distinguished from tumors completely lacking HER2 expression (ie, no cell membrane staining) due to therapeutical implications in terms of eligibility for T-DXd. Considering the biological and clinical relevance of HER2 as a driver in BC, several HER2 targeting agents are currently approved for the treatment of HER2-positive BC, including ADCs.

### Are there more HER2 FISH in the sea? An institution's experience in identifying HER2 positivity using fluorescent in situ hybridization in patients with HER2 negative immunohistochemistry [^115rm3qA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in women. Breast cancer is a diverse disease with several biologic subtypes that have distinct behavior, each necessitating a different treatment. One of these subtypes is defined by an overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene, previously called HER2/neu or ERBB-2. This gene plays a critical role in controlling epithelial cell growth, differentiation, and possibly angiogenesis. Approximately 15–20% of primary invasive breast cancers are HER2 positive.HER2 gene amplification is associated with a relatively poor prognosis with increased risk of recurrence and metastasis, but is also a predictive factor for response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy and treatment benefit with anti-HER2 therapies such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab.

Since the development of anti-HER2 therapy, outcomes for HER2-positive patients have improved significantly. The accurate identification of HER2 status and initiation of disease-specific therapy can decrease the risk of death and alter the prognosis of a patient who has HER2-positive breast cancer.HER2 status is assessed in all newly diagnosed, invasive, or recurrent breast tumors. However, the best method for determining the HER2 status continues to be a source of controversy. Standard methods involve immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC is most often used as the initial HER2 screening test because of its low cost, availability, and ease of implementation. However, certain aspects of quality control, such as the timing and process of tissue fixation, can impact the accuracy of the test. Grading of IHC staining ranges from 0 to 3+, with an IHC grading of 3+ considered HER2 positive, 2+ considered HER2 equivocal, and 1+ or 0 considered HER2 negative. Current guidelines set forth by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists recommend reflex FISH testing when the grade of IHC is 2+ (equivocal). FISH testing evaluates the number of HER2 gene copies within the nucleus using fluorescence labeled nucleic acid probes. The result is then interpreted on the basis of the HER2/centromere enumerator probe 17 (CEP17) ratio and HER2 copy number per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines, last updated in 2018. Although FISH testing may not be as susceptible to the same errors as IHC, the testing method is more complicated and expensive.

### The frequency and clinical significance of centromere enumeration probe 17 alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 immunohistochemistry-equivocal invasive breast cancer [^117TsKKf]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Chromosome 17 alterations affect the assessment of HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer (BC), but its clinical significance remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of centromere enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) alterations, and its correlation with response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in BC patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry-equivocal score.

Methods and Results

A large BC cohort (n = 6049) with HER2 immunohistochemistry score 2+ and florescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) results was included to assess the prevalence of CEP17 alterations. Another cohort (n = 885) with available clinicopathological data was used to evaluate the effect of CEP17 in the setting of NAT. HER2-amplified tumours with monosomy 17 (CEP17 copy number < 1.5 per nucleus), normal 17 (CEP17 1.5- < 3.0) and polysomy 17 (CEP17 ≥ 3.0) were observed in 16, 59 and 25%, respectively, compared with 3, 74 and 23%, respectively, in HER2-non-amplified tumours. There was no significant relationship between CEP17 alterations and pathological complete response (pCR) rate in both HER2-amplified and HER2-non-amplified tumours. The independent predictors of pCR were oestrogen (ER) negativity in HER2-amplified tumours [ER negative versus positive; odds ratio (OR) = 11.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.37–102.00; P = 0.02], and histological grade 3 in HER2 non-amplified tumours (3 versus 1, 2; OR = 5.54; 95% CI = 1.61–19.00; P = 0.007).

Conclusion

The impacts of CEP17 alterations are not as strong as those of HER2/CEP17 ratio and HER2 copy number. The hormonal receptors status and tumour histological grade are more useful to identify BC patients with a HER2 immunohistochemistry-equivocal score who would benefit from NAT.

### BlurryScope enables compact, cost-effective scanning microscopy for HER2 scoring using deep learning on blurry images [^112YptPP]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The scanned tissue images corresponding to different HER2 scores (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) for individual patient cores are compared in Fig. 2. Figure 2a shows the results from a traditional pathology scanner, yielding sharp, well-defined images for each HER2 score. In contrast, Fig. 2b presents the results from BlurryScope, with images exhibiting opposing directions of blur. Despite the smearing of various details, some correspondence between the two image descriptions is still discernible. Lower-scored HER2 images exhibit fewer brown hues and less geometrical heterogeneity compared with higher-scored ones. This suggests how HER2 classification tasks may still be successful on such compromised data. It is important to note that the interpretation of IHC stains is dependent on both cellular location and intensity. Most IHC stains highlight the cell nucleus and have only two levels, distinguishing between positive and negative staining. However, HER2 staining is different as it follows a four-level scoring system (0 to 3+) and is evaluated based on membrane expression rather than nuclear staining and variable levels of stain intensity. This distinction introduces greater inter- and intra-observer variability among pathologists, as the assessment depends on both stain intensity and continuity across the membrane. Additionally, the quantification of HER2 positivity is limited to invasive tumor cells, explicitly excluding carcinoma in situ, even when these cells exhibit a similar HER2 staining pattern. These aspects of the HER2 evaluation add further complexity to the interpretation process.

### Benchmarking a large regional UK HER2 testing service against current practice guidelines [^1131eXKX]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To critically evaluate HER2 testing data for 3500 consecutive cases over 28months for a single laboratory and review these findings in the light of current UK reporting guidelines.

Methods

We have reviewed all data relating to the HER2 testing service including reagents and analytical machine, HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) scoring profiles. We have examined the place of double counting and rapid screening of FISH and when it is and is not safe to do so. This analysis has been facilitated greatly by the inclusion of custom scripts embedded in a spreadsheet used for recording the data.

Results

There were no differences in scoring profiles in relation to testing machine or reagent batch for both HER2 IHC and FISH. There was excellent concordance in scoring by the biomedical scientists and pathologists providing the service. There is a significant difference between the proximity of scores in double-scored cases with HER2 copy number > 6.0 compared with those with copy number < 6.00. It is safe to single score with rapid screening of HER2 FISH following a first count with a HER2/CEP17 ratio < 1.5 and a HER2 copy number < 3.5.

Conclusions

Single counting of HER2 FISH supported by a second rapid screen is safe and practicable within strict parameters. Any assessment of proximity of scores in double-scored cases should take into account the HER2 copy number, with greater spreads experienced at higher copy numbers. Centralising HER2 testing in a regional centre allows detailed audit of the entire analytical process.

### Best practices for achieving consensus in HER2-low expression in breast cancer: current perspectives from practising pathologists [^114E7xn8]. Histopathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is an important biomarker in breast cancer (BC). Most BC cases categorised as HER2-negative (HER2-) express low levels of HER2 [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in-situ hybridisation not amplified (ISH-)] and represent a clinically relevant therapeutic category that is amenable to targeted therapy using a recently approved HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. A group of practising pathologists, with expertise in breast pathology and BC biomarker testing, outline best practices and guidance for achieving consensus in HER2 IHC scoring for BC.

Methods and Results

The authors describe current knowledge and challenges of IHC testing and scoring of HER2-low expressing BC and provide best practices and guidance for accurate identification of BCs expressing low levels of HER2. These expert pathologists propose an algorithm for assessing HER2 expression with validated IHC assays and incorporate the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologist guideline update. The authors also provide guidance on when to seek consensus for HER2 IHC scoring, how to incorporate HER2-low into IHC reporting and present examples of HER2 IHC staining, including challenging cases.

Conclusions

Awareness of BC cases that are negative for HER protein overexpression/gene amplification and the related clinical relevance for targeted therapy highlight the importance of accurate HER2 IHC scoring for optimal treatment selection.

### HER2DX genomic assay in HER2-Positive early breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab: a correlative analysis from the PHERGain phase II trial [^1145T1xJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

In HER2-positive (HER2+) early breast cancer, there is a critical need to identify patients eligible for dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab–pertuzumab (HP) without chemotherapy. The PHERGain trial revealed the HER2DX genomic assay's robust ability to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) during neoadjuvant HP therapy, independent of chemotherapy, hormone receptor status, and early imaging response. HER2DX pCR score significantly correlated with pCR, offering a quantitative measure. Notably, HER2DX's low-risk designation demonstrated a promising trend toward improved 3-year invasive disease-free survival, establishing its importance as a prognostic indicator. The assay provides insights into tumor responsiveness to HP and recurrence risk, potentially guiding personalized HP-based therapies, possibly with reduced or without chemotherapy, for HER2+ early breast cancer.

### Applying the new guidelines of HER2 testing in breast cancer [^111nDJU8]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important prognostic and predictive biomarker in the breast cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathology (ASCO/CAP) has published HER2 testing guidelines in breast cancer. We herein reviewed the HER2 testing guidelines in breast cancer with a focus on the application of the current guidelines.

Recent Findings

The continual investigation of HER2 testing in breast cancer has resulted in updates in the HER2 testing guidelines. The current guidelines focus on the uncommon clinical scenarios and emphasize the coordination between immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization results, in an effort to improve clarity and accuracy. The ASCO/CAP guidelines provide valuable recommendations to ensure the accurate evaluation of HER2 status in breast cancer patients through standardization. Additional studies, particularly those with long-term outcome data are still needed to validate the guideline recommendations, especially the uncommon cases.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: ASCO-college of American pathologists guideline update [^112P8srW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO-CAP HER2 testing — interpretive footnotes for uncommon in situ hybridization (ISH) patterns advise using IHC to complement ISH and specify when to consider cases HER2 negative. For cases with a HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number of < 4.0 per cell, evidence of benefit is limited and, if the IHC result is 3+ positive, it is recommended that the specimen be considered HER2 negative. When the HER2 ratio is < 2.0 and concurrent IHC is negative (0 or 1+), it is recommended that the specimen be considered HER2 negative. For cases with ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 HER2 signals per cell and a HER2/CEP17 ratio of < 2.0, benefit is uncertain; if the result is close to the ISH ratio threshold, repeat testing may vary by chance, and when IHC results are not 3+ positive, it is recommended that the sample be considered HER2 negative without additional testing on the same specimen.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic advances for HER2-expressing or amplified gynecologic cancers [^114jNSNR]. Gynecologic Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

There is considerable debate currently regarding which scoring criteria is best for patients with endometrial cancer. Until clinical trial data reports on treatment outcomes that differ based on scoring system, we cannot claim that one method is better than another. For example, ancillary results from the TOGA trial, which tested trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy for patients with advanced GEJ cancer, showed that trastuzumab improved outcomes for patients with HER2 positive disease based on IHC testing, but not for those patients who were HER2 positive based on ISH only. This then informed the 2016 ASCO/ CAP gastric HER2 testing guidelines.

Given that no such clinical trial data has been reported in gynecologic malignancies, there is a lack of high quality evidence that one scoring system is better than others. However, in practice, there is an emerging consensus that all advanced stage and recurrent USC should have HER2 IHC performed and reported using the modified 2007 ASCO/CAP breast criteria from the Fader et al. clinical trial, with reflex FISH for cases with 2+ (equivocal) expression. Although this criterion has been endorsed by the College of American Pathologists for USC, many labs continue to use the 2018 ASCO/CAP breast criteria. For non-USC gynecologic cancers, HER2 testing requests are derived from results of the DESTINY-PanTumor02 trial; therefore, in those cases, pathologists are advised to perform testing using HER2 IHC scored using the 2016 ASCO/CAP gastric criteria, without reflex FISH testing. HER2 IHC of all recurrent gynecologic cancers is now widely accepted as standard of care, given the accelerated FDA approval of T-DXd for recurrent HER2 IHC 3+ solid tumors. Communication between pathologists and medical oncologists is helpful to ensure HER2 is reported using a system which corresponds with the therapy under consideration. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to institute testing of all early stage gynecologic cancers, given the concomitant cost and workload requirements, and as standard first-line therapies do not currently incorporate HER2-directed agents. However, as ongoing and future clinical trials examine upfront treatment with HER2-directed therapies, HER2 testing of early stage gynecologic cancers may eventually become standard of care. At this time, it is recommended to obtain HER2 testing in early stage cancers if enrollment into a HER2-targeting clinical trial is under consideration (see Author Opinions on HER2 Testing).

### The frequency and clinical significance of centromere enumeration probe 17 alterations in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 immunohistochemistry-equivocal invasive breast cancer [^112DSpa2]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Chromosome 17 alterations affect the assessment of HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer (BC), but its clinical significance remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of centromere enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) alterations, and its correlation with response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in BC patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry‐equivocal score.

Methods and results

A large BC cohort (n = 6049) with HER2 immunohistochemistry score 2+ and florescent in‐situ hybridisation (FISH) results was included to assess the prevalence of CEP17 alterations. Another cohort (n = 885) with available clinicopathological data was used to evaluate the effect of CEP17 in the setting of NAT. HER2‐ amplified tumours with monosomy 17 (CEP17 copy number < 1.5 per nucleus), normal 17 (CEP17 1.5– < 3.0) and polysomy 17 (CEP17 ≥ 3.0) were observed in 16, 59 and 25%, respectively, compared with 3, 74 and 23%, respectively, in HER2 ‐non‐amplified tumours. There was no significant relationship between CEP17 alterations and pathological complete response (pCR) rate in both HER2 ‐amplified and HER2 ‐non‐amplified tumours. The independent predictors of pCR were oestrogen (ER) negativity in HER2‐ amplified tumours [ER negative versus positive; odds ratio (OR) = 11.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.37–102.00; P = 0.02], and histological grade 3 in HER2 non‐amplified tumours (3 versus 1, 2; OR = 5.54; 95% CI = 1.61–19.00; P = 0.007).

Conclusion

The impacts of CEP17 alterations are not as strong as those of HER2 /CEP17 ratio and HER2 copy number. The hormonal receptors status and tumour histological grade are more useful to identify BC patients with a HER2 immunohistochemistry‐equivocal score who would benefit from NAT.

### HER2 testing and clinical decision making in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma: guideline from the college of American pathologists, American Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology [^116zUnWE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Medium credibility.

HER2 testing in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma — immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring and in situ hybridization (ISH) correlation are defined as follows: IHC categories are Negative 0 (no reactivity, specifically no membranous reactivity is seen in any of the tumor cells; cytoplasmic staining is disregarded), Negative 1+ (tumor cells with faint/barely perceptible membranous staining), Equivocal 2+ (tumor cells with weak to moderate, complete, basolateral, and lateral membranous staining), and Positive 3+ (tumor cells with a strong, complete, basolateral, and lateral membranous reactivity). For ISH quality control and interpretation, failure to detect probe signals in nonmalignant cells serves as an indicator of poor-quality hybridization, at least some nonmalignant cells are expected to have up to two copies per cell of HER2 and CEP17 discrete signals as a quality check, in malignant-appearing cells discrete signals are enumerated or estimated when clusters are present, correlation of the scored region(s) on the ISH slide with the tumor cell population marked on the IHC slide is essential, and if technical issues prevent reporting as positive or negative, interpret the HER2 test result as indeterminate.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists 2018 focused update of breast cancer HER2 FISH testing guidelinesResults from a national reference laboratory [^115yd2bU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review impact of the ASCO/CAP 2018 update on HER2 testing.

Methods

HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test requests from primary and metastatic breast cancers between August 2018 and January 2019 were included. FISH results requiring a changed algorithm under the new guidelines (groups 2, 3, and 4) were identified and HER2:CEN17 ratios, average HER2, CEN17 signals/cell, and HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) results were recorded.

Results

Of the HER2 FISH cases 176/812(21.7%) fell within groups 2, 3, or 4; 0/12, 1/12, and 2/152 cases were positive (3+) by IHC, and 1/12, 2/12, and 6/152 cases were positive after targeted scoring from groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Following 2018 updates, 8.3%, 25%, and 5.3% of the groups 2, 3, and 4 were positive, respectively.

Conclusions

Groups 2, 3, and 4 constituted over 20% of HER2 FISH tests in a reference laboratory. The 2018 ASCO/CAP update significantly decreased the HER2 positivity rate.

### Impact of American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists guideline recommendations on HER2 interpretation in breast cancer [^117JKqwX]. Human Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is critical for the management of patients with breast cancer. We set out to study the impact of the 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines on the interpretation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 IHC results and its correlation with fluorescence in situ hybridization results. Invasive breast carcinomas with IHC HercepTest 3+ were retrieved from the archive of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 slides were rereviewed, and results were recorded as percentage of invasive tumor cells with 3+, 2+, 1+, and 0 staining intensity. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on all tumors with 3+ staining in 70% or less of tumor cells. Of the 141 cases studied, 12 cases showed intense membrane staining in 11% to 30% of the invasive tumor cells and would have been scored as 2+ according to the new American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines. Of these 12 cases, 6 were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (ratio > 2.2), 4 cases were negative (HER2/CEP17 ratio of < 1.8), and 2 cases were equivocal (ratio of 1.8–2.2). One human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive case showed dramatic intratumoral heterogeneity with high-level amplification (ratio of 12.2) in the IHC 3+ area and no amplification (ratio of 1.0) in the IHC 1+/2+ areas. The 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines down-scored 2.8% of tumors from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (IHC 3+) to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (IHC 2+ equivocal and fluorescence in situ hybridization negative) in this study. Clinical studies are needed to determine whether the updated guidelines are better at predicting response to anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy.

### Molecular characterization of mixed-histology endometrial carcinoma provides prognostic and therapeutic value over morphologic findings [^112XSQdr]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional molecular and transcriptional data provide biologic insight and potential therapeutic implications

HER2 IHC scores for the MEC cohort were 12.5% (n = 9) 3 +, 32% (n = 23) 2+, 40% (n = 29) 1+, 15% (n = 11) 0. Seven tumors were noted to have differential HER2 expression per histotype (5 endometrioid/serous, 2 serous/clear cell). Numerical HER2 IHC score was significantly associated with molecular class, where those tumors that had a score of 3+ were most likely to be p53abnl (77.8%), as opposed to POLE -mutated (11.1%), MSI-high/MMRd (11.1%), or NSMP (0%) (p = 0.042; Supplementary Table 4). A HER2 IHC score of 2–3+ was noted in 20% (n = 2) of POLE -mutated tumors, 42% (n = 8) of MSI-high/MMRd tumors, 45% (n = 16) of p53abnl tumors, and 75% (n = 6) of NSMP tumors (Fig. 3A). Numerical HER2 IHC score was not associated with histology (p = 0.885; Table 3). HER2 IHC score was significantly associated with PFS (3-year PFS 90% for score 0–1+ vs 74% for score 2+ vs 37.5% for score 3+; p = 0.021; Fig. 3B). HER2 IHC score remained predictive of PFS on multivariable analysis when controlling for molecular class, stage, and adjuvant treatment (p = 0.018; Table 3).

### Incorporation of biologic factors for the staging of de novo stage IV breast cancer [^1125caAd]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of biological factors, including histological grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status in de novo stage IV breast cancer. Based on eligibility, patient data deposited between 2010 and 2014 were collected from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. The receiver operating characteristics curve, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used for analysis. We included 8725 patients with a median 3-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of 52.6%. Higher histologic grade, HER2-negative, ER-negative, and PR-negative disease were significantly associated with lower BCSS in the multivariate prognostic analysis. A risk score staging system separated patients into four risk groups. The risk score was assigned according to a point system: 1 point for grade 3, 1 point if hormone receptor-negative, and 1 point if HER2-negative. The 3-year BCSS was 76.3%, 64.5%, 48.5%, and 23.7% in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 points, respectively, with a median BCSS of 72, 52, 35, and 16 months, respectively (P < 0.001). The multivariate prognostic analysis showed that the risk score staging system was an independent prognostic factor associated with BCSS. Patients with a higher risk score had a lower BCSS. Sensitivity analyses replicated similar findings after stratification according to tumor stage, nodal stage, the sites of distant metastasis, and the number of distant metastasis. In conclusion, our risk score staging system shows promise for the prognostic stratification of de novo stage IV breast cancer.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: ASCO-college of American pathologists guideline update [^113TFLwe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO–College of American Pathologists (CAP) HER2 testing update — recommendations and implications of IHC categories are as follows: The 2018 ASCO–CAP recommendations for HER2 testing are affirmed, and the evidence review found no signal to revise them after a search identified 173 abstracts and review of five potential publications. The update acknowledges a new indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan when HER2 is not overexpressed or amplified but is immunohistochemically (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without amplification by in situ hybridization, while clinical trial data on tumors that tested IHC 0 are limited. Although current data do not support a new IHC 0 versus 1+ prognostic or predictive threshold for response to trastuzumab deruxtecan, this threshold is now relevant because of the trial entry criteria that supported its new regulatory approval, and best practices to distinguish IHC 0 from 1+ are now clinically relevant. The update affirms prior HER2 reporting recommendations and offers a new HER2 testing reporting comment to highlight the current relevance of IHC 0 versus 1+ results.

### Does using a higher cutoff for the percentage of positive cells improve the specificity of HER-2 immunohistochemical analysis in breast carcinoma? [^1128QwGU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

This study was performed to determine whether using a 30% cutoff for the proportion of HER-2+ cells would increase the specificity of HER-2 immunohistochemical analysis. Blinded to the HER-2 amplification status, 3 pathologists retrospectively reviewed HER-2-stained sections of breast carcinoma and considered cases to be positive for protein overexpression (3+) using 3 cutoff levels, 10%, 30%, and 50%, for the proportion of cells with intense uniform staining. Of 98 cases, 27 (28%) were positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 32 (33%), 28 (29%), and 26 (27%) were considered positive for overexpression using cutoffs of 10%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. The specificity values of HER-2 immunohistochemical analysis were 82%, 86%, and 87% for the different cutoffs, and the concordance rates of 3+ cases with FISH were 59%, 64%, and 65%, for the cutoffs of 10%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. These findings seem to somehow support the recently proposed American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guideline recommendations for HER-2 testing; nevertheless further studies are suggested.

### HER2 gene amplification testing by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): comparison of the ASCO-college of American pathologists guidelines with FISH scores used for enrollment in breast cancer international research group clinical trials [^113mRKyx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Fig 2.
Schematic diagram of the ASCO and College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) algorithm for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as published by the ASCO-CAP guidelines committee, modified here by introduction of the numbers 1 to 5 to identify the various ASCO-CAP FISH groups categorized, followed by FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) photomicrographs of representative cases from each of the five groups. (A) Breast cancers with HER2 -to-chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) ratios ≥ 2.0 are divided in two groups, one with an average HER2 gene copy number per tumor cell ≥ 4.0 (in situ hybridization [ISH] positive; our group 1) and one with an average HER2 gene copy number per tumor cell < 4.0 (ISH positive; our group 2). Breast cancers with HER2 -to-CEP17 ratios < 2.0 are separated into three additional groups: one with average HER2 gene copy number per tumor cell ≥ 6.0 (ISH positive; our group 3), another with average HER2 gene copy number per tumor cell ≥ 4.0 but < 6.0 (ISH equivocal; our group 4), and one with breast cancers that contained an average HER2 gene copy number per tumor cell < 4.0 (ISH negative; our group 5). Therefore, according to the ASCO-CAP guidelines, breast cancers in groups 1, 2, and 3 are interpreted as ISH positive, group 4 as ISH equivocal, and group 5 as ISH negative. (B-M) ASCO-CAP guidelines algorithm ISH groups compared with observed HER2 gene amplification status by FISH and HER2 protein expression status by IHC staining using the DAKO HercepTest IHC assay. ASCO-CAP guidelines algorithm identification of subdivisions by HER2 FISH ratios and average HER2 gene copy number into group 1 is categorized as ISH positive, with results as illustrated in panels B (FISH) and C (IHC); group 2 is also categorized as ISH positive, but with our contradictory results as illustrated in panels D (FISH) and E (IHC); group 3 is categorized as ISH positive, but with mixed results as illustrated in panels F (FISH), G (IHC), H (FISH), and I (IHC); group 4 is categorized as ISH equivocal, but with contradictory results as illustrated in panels J (FISH) and K (IHC); and group 5 is categorized as ISH negative, with confirmatory results as illustrated in panels L (FISH) and M (IHC). (B) ASCO-CAP group 1 breast cancer with HER2 gene amplification by FISH, consistent with the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive (and Breast Cancer International Research Group [BCIRG] designation of HER2 amplified). Average HER2 gene copy number for this case was 16.85 copies per tumor cell, and the CEP17 copy number per cell was 2.28 with a HER2 -to-CEP17 FISH ratio of 7.38. HER2 signals are sufficiently numerous and are not captured in a single plain of focus in this photomicrograph so that some appear out of focus. Computer enhancement was not used for any image (BCIRG01661, original photomicrograph at 1,000×). (C) ASCO-CAP group 1 breast cancer case with HER2 protein overexpression, IHC3+ by the HercepTest IHC assay (BCIRG01661, original magnification, ×400). (D) ASCO-CAP group 2 breast cancer. Average HER2 gene copy number for this breast cancer was 3.75 copies per tumor cell, with a CEP17 copy number of 1.80 per cell and a HER2 -to-CEP17 FISH ratio of 2.08. This breast cancer was evaluated in the BCIRG/Translational Research in Oncology (TRIO) central laboratory as HER2 not amplified by FISH, which contradicted the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive, and the patient was accrued to the BCIRG-005 trial. Of 52 patients whose breast cancers were in this group, three were accrued to BCIRG-005 and 46 were accrued to BCIRG-006 (BCIRG02899, original magnification, ×1,000). (E) ASCO-CAP group 2 breast cancer, corresponding to the breast cancer in panel D, with HER2 protein expression determined as IHC0 with HercepTest IHC assay, which contradicted the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive (BCIRG02899, original magnification, ×400). (F) ASCO-CAP group 3 breast cancer. One of our group 3N cases was reported to have a lack of HER2 gene amplification by FISH in the BCIRG/TRIO central laboratory, contrary to the current ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive. Average HER2 gene copy number for this breast cancer was 7.35 copies per tumor cell, average CEP17 copy number was 4.20 per cell, and, therefore, there was a HER2 -to-CEP17 FISH ratio of 1.75 (BCIRG04086, original magnification, ×1,000). (G) ASCO-CAP group 3 breast cancer. Our Group3N, with low HER2 protein expression by IHC (IHC0/1+), reported previously as HER2 not amplified, contrary to the current ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive (BCIRG04086, original magnification, ×400). (H) ASCO-CAP group 3 breast cancer, one of the BCIRG group 3A cases, with an average HER2 gene copy number of 27.50 per tumor cell, an average CEP17 copy number of 20.67 per tumor cell, and, therefore, a HER2 FISH ratio of only 1.33. Please note that the HER2 gene signals (orange) and CEP17 signals (green) are aggregated together in a limited geographic area of the nucleus, making assessment of individual signals challenging without the aid of single band-pass filters (Data Supplement Figure S1). This breast cancer was reported as HER2 amplified in the BCIRG/TRIO central laboratory, and the patient was accrued to BCIRG-006. This case is consistent with the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive (BCIRG00575, original magnification, ×1,000). (I) ASCO-CAP group 3 breast cancer, the same group3A in panel H, with HER2 protein overexpression by IHC (IHC3+ by HercepTest), consistent with the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH positive (BCIRG00575, original magnification, ×400; Data Supplement Figure S1E). (J) ASCO-CAP group 4 breast cancer, referred to by the current ASCO-CAP guidelines as ISH equivocal. BCIRG/TRIO central laboratory reported the case as HER2 not amplified by FISH, with an average HER2 gene copy number of 4.22 per tumor cell, an average CEP17 copy number of 2.23 per tumor cell, and, therefore, an HER2 -to-CEP17 FISH ratio of 1.89. The patient was randomly assigned to BCIRG-005 (BCIRG01911, original magnification, ×1,000). (K) ASCO-CAP group 4 breast cancer, as in panel J, with low HER2 protein expression by HercepTest (IHC0; BCIRG01911, original magnification, ×400). (L) ASCO-CAP group 5 breast cancer, consistent with the guidelines designation of ISH negative, which was reported by the BCIRG/TRIO central laboratory as HER2 not amplified by FISH. The case had an average HER2 gene copy number of 1.35 per tumor cell, with 1.50 CEP17 copies per cell and an HER2 -to-CEP17 ratio of 0.90 (BCIRG04095, original magnification, ×1,000). (M) ASCO-CAP group 5 breast cancer, see panel L, with low HER2 protein expression by IHC with HercepTest (IHC0), consistent the ASCO-CAP guidelines designation of ISH negative (BCIRG04095, original magnification, ×400).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^117G11K7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Rectal cancer — HER2 testing and treatment indications state that diagnostic testing is via immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Positive by IHC is defined as 3+ staining in more than 50% of tumor cells; 3+ staining is an intense membrane staining that can be circumferential, basolateral, or lateral, and tumors with a HER2 score of 2+ should be reflexed to FISH testing. HER2 amplification by FISH is considered positive when the HER2:CEP17 ratio is ≥ 2 in more than 50% of the cells; NGS is another methodology for testing for HER2 amplification. Anti-HER2 therapy with signal transduction inhibition (eg, trastuzumab/pertuzumab, trastuzumab/tucatinib, trastuzumab/lapatinib) is indicated for patients with HER2 IHC 3+, IHC2+/ISH+, or NGS amplified cancer that are also RAS and BRAF wild-type, and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is only indicated in HER2-amplified tumors (IHC 3+).

How does one select or develop an appropriate QIA algorithm for interpretation? How does one determine the performance of a QIA algorithm? What training and competency assessments are required over time? How should HER2 QIA results be reported? Evidence was identified via database searches of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Scopus for articles published from January 1, 2006, through March 31, 2016, supplemented by additional searches and study identification, and all identified articles were managed in DistillerSR.

Interpretation of FISH Assays According to ASCO-CAP Guidelines

We re-evaluated HER2 status of all samples for the current study by using FISH according to the new ASCO-CAP guidelines, which separates in situ hybridization (ISH) into five groups (Fig 2). Three of these groups identify breast cancers that are ISH positive, one ISH equivocal, and one ISH negative. Breast cancers with HER2 -to-CEP17 ratios of ≥ 2.0 are divided in two groups, one with an average HER2 gene copy number of ≥ 4.0/tumor cell (our group 1) and one with an average HER2 gene copy number of < 4.0/tumor cell (our group 2). Breast cancers with HER2 -to-CEP17 ratios of < 2.0 are divided into three additional groups: one with average HER2 gene copy number of ≥ 6.0/tumor cell (our group 3), which is also classified as ISH positive; another with average HER2 gene copy number of ≥ 4.0 but < 6.0/tumor cell (our group 4), which is classified as ISH equivocal; and one with breast cancers that contain an average HER2 gene copy number of < 4.0/tumor cell (our group 5), which is classified as ISH negative. According to the newly proposed ASCO-CAP guidelines, breast cancers in groups 1, 2, and 3 are interpreted as ISH positive, group 4 as ISH equivocal, and group 5 as ISH negative (Fig 2).

ASCO/CAP low ER expression cases — prevalence and reporting focus: Although uncommon, cancers with 1% to 10% cells staining for ER account for only 2%–3% of ER-positive cancers and present particular clinical challenges, such as whether a high-grade cancer with 1% to 10% ER expression, 0% PgR expression, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) –negative results should be considered for treatments designed for triple-negative cancers. Cases with weak or low ER or PgR staining are also noted to be particular challenges for test reproducibility due to threshold scoring reproducibility and sensitivity to preanalytic and analytic factors. Clinical Question 2 focuses on strategies to promote optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of all cases, and new recommendations for interpreting and reporting cases with weak or ≤ 10% ER expression are provided.

### Detailed reanalysis of 500 breast cancers with equivocal HER2 immunohistochemistry and borderline ERBB2 fluorescence in situ hybridization results [^1143g29L]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We investigated the impact of our laboratory's reflex testing process for resolving ERBB2 (HER2) status on breast cancer samples that require additional workup after fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), per guideline recommendations published in 2018 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP).

Methods

In total, 500 breast cancer specimens with ERBB2 FISH results in groups 2 through 4 (all reported as immunohistochemistry [IHC] equivocal [2+] at external laboratories) were resubmitted for IHC testing in our laboratory. Per the ASCO/CAP guideline, FISH was rescored when internal IHC was also equivocal (2+), targeted to tumor areas demonstrating more intense IHC staining, if observed.

Results

Reflex IHC/FISH testing changed the final reported ERBB2 status in 185 of 500 (37.0%) samples. Result changes included discordant IHC (n = 4 score 0, n = 132 score 1+, and n = 16 score 3+) and discordant FISH (n = 33). Numerical differences in FISH scores were comparable for targeted vs nontargeted FISH rescoring (P = 0.086 for ERBB2 copy number; p = 0.49 for ERBB2 ratio). Two cases showed larger differences in FISH scores, suggesting heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Retesting of breast cancer samples with equivocal IHC frequently changes IHC results, but targeted reanalysis of borderline FISH results rarely identifies significant differences in ERBB2 copy number or ratio.

HER2 testing evidence quality assessment — after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, an assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed for all retained studies, and studies deemed to be of low quality would not be excluded but retained with methodological strengths and weaknesses discussed where relevant. Studies were assessed by confirming items related to internal and external validity associated with methodological rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias, and items were scored as yes, no, partial, not reported (NR), or not applicable (N/A). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were assessed for quality using Institute of Medicine attributes, including a multidisciplinary panel, consideration of patient preferences and important patient sub-types, well-described and reproducible methods, disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, assessment of the quality and strength of the evidence, and disclosure of funding sources. Meta-analyses were assessed in a similar fashion to SRs with requirements such as being based on a systematic review, well-described and reproducible methods, quality of the evidence assessed, any planned pooling stated a priori, limitations discussed, and sources of funding disclosed. Randomized Control Trials and Quasi-RCTs were assessed for quality according to reporting of a fully described randomization method, treatment allocation concealment, sufficient sample size, validated and reliable measures, and details on any blinding.

### Breast cancers with a HER2 / CEP17 ratio of 2.0 or greater and an average HER2 copy number of less than 4.0 per cell: frequency, immunohistochemical correlation, and clinicopathological features [^116d35ss]. Human Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines classified breast cancers with a fluorescence in situ hybridization dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2 or greater as "amplified", inclusive of cases with a HER2 copy number less than 4. The 2018 ASCO/CAP update assigns HER2/neu status for the latter group in a fashion that is highly dependent on the associated immunohistochemical findings. Herein, the authors define the frequency, immunohistochemical correlates, and other clinicopathological features of breast cancers with HER2/CEP17 ratio of 2 or greater and HER2/neu copy number less than 4 (group A), based on an analysis of an institutional cohort assessed for HER2/neu status by both florescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry and scored using 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria. Group A cases were compared with a group B of HER2/neu-amplified breast cancers with a HER2/neu copy number of 4 or greater regarding a variety of clinicopathological features. One hundred sixty-nine (14%) of 1201 cases were HER2/neu amplified, 18 (10.7%) in group A and 151 (89.3%) in group B. By immunohistochemistry, 61.1% of group A cases were HER2/neu negative, 7 (38.9%) were equivocal, and none were positive. In contrast, 66.9% of group B cases were HER2 positive (3+). We could not demonstrate statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding standard clinicopathological variables. In summary, our group A cases account for 1.5% of breast cancers, and 10.7% of all HER2/neu-amplified cancers classified as such based on 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria. They are predominantly HER2/neu negative by immunohistochemistry, which suggests that they are biologically different from classically HER2/neu-amplified cases and which validates the 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline against automatically classifying such cases as HER2/neu amplified.

### Clinical outcomes in ER + HER2-node-positive breast cancer patients who were treated according to the recurrence score results: evidence from a large prospectively designed registry [^117CbQAU]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The Recurrence Score® is increasingly used in node-positive ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer. This retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed registry evaluated treatments/outcomes in node-positive breast cancer patients who were Recurrence Score-tested through Clalit Health Services from 1/2006 through 12/2011 (N = 709). Medical records were reviewed to verify treatments/recurrences/survival. Median follow-up, 5.9 years; median age, 62 years; 53.9% grade 2; 69.8% tumors ≤ 2cm; 84.5% invasive ductal carcinoma; 42.0% N1mi, and 37.2%/15.5%/5.2% with 1/2/3 positive nodes; 53.4% Recurrence Score < 18, 36.4% Recurrence Score 18–30, and 10.2% Recurrence Score ≥ 31. Overall, 26.9% received adjuvant chemotherapy: 7.1%, 39.5%, and 86.1% in the Recurrence Score < 18, 18–30, and ≥ 31 group, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for distant recurrence were 3.2%, 6.3%, and 16.9% for these respective groups and the corresponding 5-year breast cancer death estimates were 0.5%, 3.4%, and 5.7%. In Recurrence Score < 18 patients, 5-year distant-recurrence rates for N1mi/1 positive node/2–3 positive nodes were 1.2%/4.4%/5.4%. As patients were not randomized to treatment and treatment decision is heavily influenced by Recurrence Score, analysis of 5-year distant recurrence by chemotherapy use was exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously: In Recurrence Score < 18, recurrence rate was 7.7% in chemotherapy-treated (n = 27) and 2.9% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 352); P = 0.245. In Recurrence Score 18–30, recurrence rate in chemotherapy-treated patients (n = 102) was significantly lower than in untreated patients (n = 156) (1.0% vs. 9.7% P = 0.019); in Recurrence Score ≤ 25 (the RxPONDER study cutoff), recurrence rate was 2.3% in chemotherapy-treated (n = 89) and 4.4% in chemotherapy-untreated patients (n = 488); P = 0.521. In conclusion, our findings support using endocrine therapy alone in ER+ HER2-negative breast cancer patients with micrometastases/1–3 positive nodes and Recurrence Score < 18.

HER2 IHC interpretation caveats — unusual staining patterns "can be encountered that are not covered by these definitions" and "if encountered should be considered IHC 2+ equivocal", with examples including staining that is "moderate to intense but incomplete (basolateral or lateral) and can be found to be HER2 amplified", and circumferential membrane IHC staining that is "intense but within ≤ 10% of tumor cells (heterogeneous but very limited in extent)". "Such cases can be considered 2+ equivocal but additional samples may reveal different percentages of HER2-positive staining", and results assume "there is no apparent histopathologic discordance observed by the pathologist".

### Best pathology practices for HER2 testing interpretation, including HER2-low and ultralow, in the era of HER2-directed antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), aligned with the 2018 CAP / ASCO HER2 guidelines [^1145mHuG]. Human Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

With the emergence of studies showing clinical response to novel human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2)-targeted treatments among HER2-low and HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer patients, this gives hope to patients failing to respond to conventional treatment. Hence, the interest in identifying these group of patients is becoming important. Pathologists' interpretation and scoring of HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was challenged from a dichotomous way to a ternary way of reporting. But HER2 IHC testing is affected by a number of pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic challenges that could affect interpretation at the lower HER2 protein expression range. Interobserver variability among pathologists and inter-assay variabilities likewise posses a challenge since prior guidelines' emphasis were focused on recognizing HER2-overexpressed from HER2-non-overexpressed tumours. In consideration of these clinical trials, the American Society of Clinical Oncologists and College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) updated and reaffirmed the guideline on HER2 testing in 2018 and in 2023, with the criteria for HER2 categories redefined. Here, we reviewed the definition and differences among HER2-low, HER2-ultralow and HER2-null breast cancer cases as well as the different challenges on HER2 IHC testing encountered and reported, including best pathology practice recommendations to avaoid or minimize these challenges.

### HER2 / neu extracellular domain shedding in uterine serous carcinoma: implications for immunotherapy with trastuzumab [^114Pj7nf]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our research group has recently examined Her2/neu expression, gene amplification, and its association with outcome in USC, the most aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant variant of endometrial carcinoma. Her2/neu overexpression and c-erbB2 gene amplification were detected in a significant number of USC patients and found to be associated with a more aggressive biological behaviour and poorer prognosis. Importantly, these findings have led to consideration of Her2/neu as a potential marker for trastuzumab-based therapy. As reported in breast cancer, where trastuzumab has been demonstrated to have significant therapeutic effect in patients with strong (i.e. score 3+ by IHC) or FISH-positive disease, USC patients refractory to standard treatment modalities may potentially benefit from Her2/neu-targeted therapy. Consistent with this hypothesis, a prospective randomised clinical trial comparing the efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel vs carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in advanced/recurrent USC patients overexpressing Her2/neu is currently recruiting patients at Yale University.

### The updated ASCO / CAP guideline recommendations for HER2 testing in the management of invasive breast cancer: a critical review of their implications for routine practice [^111GQJQN]. Histopathology (2014). Low credibility.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists have issued joint updated comprehensive guideline recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer. The update not only provides guidelines for the test performance parameters, with the aim of improving test accuracy, reproducibility, and precision, but also provides comprehensive recommendations on the post-analytical interpretation of the results, and requires improved communication among healthcare providers. The updated guidelines are targeted at testing laboratories, pathologists, oncologists, surgeons, and, indirectly, other healthcare providers. Although the guidelines contribute to the improved analytical validity and clinical utility of laboratory assays required for successful molecularly targeted therapy in the era of personalized medicine, the implications of such recommendations have to be acknowledged. Certain recommendations, particularly those related to repeating the test and pathological concordance, have lower levels of supportive evidence than existing key recommendations, and the associated workload implications will be challenging to support in most healthcare systems. In this commentary, we critically address the key updated recommendations and their impact on service provision and patient care.

### Prognostic index for predicting outcomes of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer: a real-world multicenter study [^114SEEPb]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Prognosis index for T-DXd efficacy in HER2-positive cohort

According to the univariate analysis, several clinical factors were found to significantly predict poor rwPFS in the HER2-positive cohort, including treatment lines ≥ 3, the prior treatment with tubulin-inhibitor-payload ADCs, received prior taxel-based chemotherapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score ≥ 2. Conversely, having HER2 3+ was associated with superior rwPFS. After multivariate analysis, 3 variables were identified to maintain a negative prognostic impact on rwPFS: HER2 2+, treatment lines ≥ 3, and an ECOG PS score ≥ 2. Further details of these prognostic factors are presented in Table S4. The forest plot for multivariate analysis is shown in Figure S9.

Regarding the rwOS, univariate analysis revealed that treatment lines ≥ 3, an ECOG PS ≥ 2, the prior treatment with tubulin-inhibitor-payload ADC were associated with an inferior survival. According to the multivariate analysis, treatment lines ≥ 3 and an ECOG PS ≥ 2 were significantly associated with inferior rwOS. Detailed results are presented in Table S5 and Figure S10. Nomograms showing their predictive performance for rwPFS and rwOS in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were shown in Figures S11 and S12.

### The updated 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists guideline on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 interpretation in breast cancer: comparison with previous guidelines and clinical significance of the proposed in situ hybridization groups [^114UVojt]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the updated 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guideline on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) interpretation in breast cancer compared with that of the previous guidelines and also the significance of in situ hybridization (ISH) groups proposed by the updated guideline. HER2 ISH reports and immunohistochemistry (IHC) data from 1,348 invasive breast cancers diagnosed at a single institution were included in this study. HER2 IHC was reassessed using the 2018 guideline, and HER2 ISH status was determined by the 2007, 2013, and 2018 guidelines. When applying the updated guideline, most of the HER2 ISH-equivocal cases as per the previous guidelines were reclassified as ISH negative, and 0.8% of HER2 ISH-positive tumors as per the 2007 guideline and 2.5% of those as per the 2013 guideline were changed to ISH negative. Accordingly, the negative HER2 ISH results significantly increased in the 2018 guideline compared with the 2013 guideline. HER2 ISH-positive tumors in ISH group 3 (HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 [CEP17] ratio < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 per cell) were characterized by equivocal HER2 protein expression, CEP17 copy number gain, and low HER2 copy numbers compared with classic HER2 ISH-positive tumors in ISH group 1 (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 and average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 per cell). HER2 ISH-negative tumors in ISH group 4 (HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0 with average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 per cell) revealed more aggressive clinicopathologic features and poorer clinical outcomes than those in ISH group 5 (HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number < 4.0 per cell), especially in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup. In conclusion, implementation of the updated 2018 ASCO/CAP guideline leads to a significant increase in HER2 ISH-negative results compared with the 2013 guideline, mainly via reclassification of the ISH-equivocal cases to ISH-negative ones. ISH groups proposed by the updated guideline provide additional information on the clinicopathologic characteristics of the tumors.

Uterine neoplasms — pathology and biomarker testing outlines that ER and PR testing is recommended in the setting of stage III, IV, or recurrent endometrioid carcinoma, and evaluation of HER2 overexpression should also be considered. The Panel recommends HER2 IHC testing (with reflex to HER2 FISH for equivocal IHC) for possible treatment for advanced-stage or recurrent serous endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma, and HER2 IHC testing should also be considered in TP53-aberrant endometrial carcinoma regardless of histotyping. Supporting data report that 16% of 80 gynecologic carcinosarcomas showed HER2 overexpression and amplification when using the 2013 ASCO/CAP scoring system. For intraoperative gross assessment of myometrial invasion, one study accurately determined depth in 87.3% of grade 1 lesions, 64.9% of grade 2 lesions, and 30.8% of grade 3 lesions, and studies show that in 15% to 20% of cases the preoperative grade is upgraded on final hysterectomy pathology.

### Biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111hJDbG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — biomarkers for adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer — clinicians may use Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are postmenopausal or age ≥ 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative (ER+ and HER2–) breast cancer that is node-negative or with 1–3 positive nodes. Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2– breast cancer. In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Oncotype in patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2– breast cancer. Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1–3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result. There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ≥ 4 positive nodes. Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy decisions. BCI may be offered to patients with 0–3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine therapy. None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage, comorbidities, and patient preferences.

IHC-based classification

Tumors were divided into HR-positive (i.e. ER and/or PgR ≥ 1%) or TNBC, defined as ER < 1% and PgR < 1%. In addition, tumors were classified into HER2 0, in case of an IHC score of 0, and HER2-low, defined as HER2 IHC of 1+ or 2+ with an HER2 amplification negative result by in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ were considered HER2 0 and HER2-low, respectively, unless ISH-based data was available and reported as HER2-amplified. HER2 status in each cohort had been previously determined using standard FDA-approved antibodies and ISH-techniques and classified according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines. Whenever available, we interpreted ISH-derived HER2/CEP17 ratio value and ERBB2 copy number results jointly with HER2 IHC score, according to last ASCO/CAP guidelines. More specifically, tumors with an average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell, were considered HER2-negative, and also HER2-low in case of an IHC score of 1+ or 2+, irrespective of the HER2/CEP17 ratio. However, if the HER2/CEP17 ratio was ≥ 2.0 and HER2 IHC 3+, tumors were considered HER2-positive and excluded.

In case of available average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals/cell without HER2/CEP ratio and an IHC 3+, the tumor was considered positive and excluded. In case of IHC 0 or 1+, the tumor was considered HER2-negative, and also HER2-low in the latter case. In case of IHC 2+, considering the unfeasibility of a retesting, in our case, if the categorization HER2-positive/negative was available from the original dataset, it was adopted and the tumor was considered HER2-negative and HER2-low. If the categorization was not provided, the sample was excluded.

In case of IHC score 0, 1+ or 2+, and a concurrent average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals/cell, with HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0, the tumor was considered HER2-negative, and HER2-low in the last two cases. On the contrary, if the HER2/CEP17 watio was ≥ 2.0, the tumor was considered HER2-positive and excluded.
