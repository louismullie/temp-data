## Question

with a premenopausal woman with Z-score -2 point 7 at the hip would treatment be recommended with no other risk factors except ulcerative colitis that has well-controlled

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a premenopausal woman with a hip DXA Z-score of -2.7 and well-controlled ulcerative colitis, with no other reported risk factors, should receive pharmacologic therapy for low bone density or be managed non-pharmacologically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct interpretation of bone density metrics in premenopausal women. Then, I should evaluate ulcerative colitis–specific and general fracture risk factors, including glucocorticoid exposure and fracture history. Next, I will review guideline thresholds for initiating pharmacologic therapy in premenopausal patients. Finally, I will outline an evidence-based management plan, including lifestyle, supplementation, and monitoring, and clarify what changes would prompt reconsideration of pharmacologic treatment.

> Let me first confirm the correct metric. In premenopausal women, Z-scores, not T-scores, are the appropriate index; a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is interpreted as "below the expected range for age", which does not, by itself, establish a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the absence of fragility fractures or a high-risk secondary cause, so I need to be careful not to overcall this finding [^114CLE53]. Hold on, I almost defaulted to postmenopausal T-score criteria; in premenopausal women, pharmacologic therapy is generally reserved for those with fragility fractures or compelling high-risk conditions rather than low Z-score alone, which aligns with expert consensus nuances in this age group [^113jwu3i].

> Next, I should review ulcerative colitis–specific risk. The disease is described as well-controlled, which makes me think inflammation is low and systemic corticosteroid exposure is unlikely; this matters because fracture risk in UC appears modest overall and is strongly influenced by active inflammation and steroid use, with a population-based UC cohort not showing a significant fracture excess versus controls, whereas broader inflammatory disease datasets show only a modest IBD-associated increase in fractures that is likely driven by those factors [^112ToQmt] [^1153G4dV]. I should also remember that maintaining remission is a key strategy for bone health in IBD, so ongoing control of UC remains central to prevention efforts here [^112dSBBR].

> I need to check for other major contributors. There is no mention of prior fragility fractures, hypogonadism, very low BMI, smoking, or alcohol excess; in the absence of such risk amplifiers, a low Z-score alone in a premenopausal woman should prompt evaluation for secondary causes but not automatic drug therapy, and I should confirm there is no fracture history before proceeding further [^114CLE53]. Wait, let me verify I am not missing occult vertebral fractures; without symptoms or risk markers, routine vertebral imaging is not mandated here, particularly since postmenopausal thresholds and FRAX-driven indications do not apply to this patient profile.

> Now, treatment thresholds. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions by importing postmenopausal thresholds; AACE/ACE treatment triggers based on T-scores and FRAX apply to postmenopausal or older men and are not appropriate for premenopausal women without fractures, so those do not support pharmacologic therapy in this case. I should double-check IBD-specific guidance: prophylactic bisphosphonates are suggested for patients over 65 years when starting glucocorticoids, which does not fit a younger premenopausal patient in remission without steroid exposure, further arguing against medication now [^112dSBBR]. But wait, what if the very low Z-score itself warranted therapy? Consensus statements emphasize that in premenopausal women, low Z-scores should trigger evaluation for causes and monitoring, reserving pharmacologic therapy for those with fragility fractures or major secondary drivers, not for Z-score alone, so medication is still not indicated here [^111bMsST].

> Given that, I will now examine non-pharmacologic management. I need to ensure adequate calcium intake around 1000 mg/day and vitamin D intake 400–800 IU/day, with dietary counseling, weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking avoidance, and moderation of alcohol; these are foundational in IBD bone health and fracture prevention, and they carry favorable risk-benefit in a young woman [^112dSBBR]. I should confirm vitamin D status and replete if deficient, as recommended in IBD care, because deficiency is common and associated with low BMD and possibly worse disease outcomes, even if causality is not fully established [^111bMsST].

> Next, I should review monitoring and secondary evaluation. Let me first confirm the plan to reassess bone density; repeating DXA in about 2–3 years to assess trajectory is reasonable, with earlier reassessment if new risk factors or clinical changes arise, and I should evaluate for secondary causes of low BMD where indicated, such as hyperparathyroidism or hypogonadism, per diagnostic workups recommended after an abnormal BMD in younger patients [^114CLE53]. I also need to ensure continued UC control following treat-to-target principles, as sustained remission reduces systemic inflammatory burden that adversely affects bone, reinforcing the non-pharmacologic strategy here [^115FP6i9].

> Hold on, I should verify what would prompt reconsideration of drug therapy. Pharmacologic treatment would be appropriate if she sustains a fragility fracture, if she requires prolonged systemic glucocorticoids at meaningful doses, or if there is progressive bone loss on follow-up despite optimized lifestyle and correction of reversible factors; in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis settings, antiresorptives like denosumab or bisphosphonates have demonstrated efficacy, though those data are derived from older or higher-risk populations and would need careful individual risk-benefit assessment in a premenopausal woman [^111gGuWz]. Let me also acknowledge that bisphosphonates have demonstrated benefit in postmenopausal IBD populations, but that evidence does not directly justify use in a young premenopausal patient without fractures or steroid exposure, underscoring the current conservative approach [^114Z5gHt].

> Final decision and self-check. I should confirm that no current guideline compels pharmacologic therapy solely for a Z-score of -2.7 in a premenopausal woman with well-controlled UC and no fractures, and that the balance of benefits and potential risks favors non-pharmacologic management, surveillance, and secondary-cause evaluation at this stage; if her clinical risk profile changes, I would reassess accordingly, including consideration of pharmacologic options with attention to reproductive plans and shared decision-making [^114CLE53] [^112dSBBR] [^111bMsST].

> Bottom line: No, pharmacologic osteoporosis therapy is not recommended now; prioritize calcium and vitamin D optimization, lifestyle measures, vitamin D assessment and repletion, maintenance of UC remission, evaluation for secondary causes, and repeat DXA in 2–3 years, escalating to medication only if fractures occur, steroids are required, or bone loss progresses despite these measures [^112dSBBR] [^113jwu3i] [^114CLE53] [^112ToQmt].

Pharmacologic treatment is not recommended for a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of -2.7 and only well-controlled ulcerative colitis as a risk factor. Current guidelines **advise against pharmacologic therapy** in premenopausal women without fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use, even with low BMD. Instead, **implement lifestyle measures** (weight-bearing exercise, calcium/vitamin D, smoking/alcohol avoidance) [^112dSBBR] [^113jwu3i], reassess BMD in 1–2 years, and treat only if fractures occur or new risk factors emerge.

---

## Clinical significance of Z-score -2.7 in premenopausal women

In premenopausal women, a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is "below the expected range for age" but **does not alone indicate osteoporosis** or mandate pharmacologic therapy [^111bMsST]. Low BMD without fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use typically reflects low peak bone mass [^1114ZsfP] rather than high fracture risk [^114CLE53] [^111bMsST].

---

## Impact of ulcerative colitis on bone health

Ulcerative colitis is associated with an **increased risk of osteoporosis**, driven by chronic inflammation, corticosteroid exposure [^116vtya8], malabsorption, and nutritional deficits [^113jwu3i] [^1153G4dV]. When the disease is well controlled with minimal corticosteroid exposure and adequate nutrition, bone-loss risk is lower than during active disease [^112dSBBR].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Not recommended in premenopausal women with low BMD unless there are fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use.

- **Lifestyle measures**: Emphasize weight-bearing exercise, adequate calcium/vitamin D, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall prevention [^112dSBBR] [^113jwu3i].

- **Monitoring**: Repeat DXA in 1–2 years to track BMD and reassess risk.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Population data indicate **no significant increase in overall or osteoporotic fractures** in UC compared with controls, particularly when the disease is well controlled [^112ToQmt]. Evidence supporting pharmacologic therapy in premenopausal women without fractures or glucocorticoid exposure is limited, and the risks may outweigh the benefits.

---

## Potential risks and benefits of pharmacologic treatment

Pharmacologic therapy may increase BMD and reduce fractures in high-risk patients, such as those with fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use [^111gGuWz] [^114Z5gHt]. However, risks include atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and unknown reproductive effects; thus, **caution is advised in premenopausal women**.

---

## Recommended management approach

Given this profile (Z-score -2.7, well-controlled UC, no other risk factors), the **recommended approach** is:

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight-bearing/resistance exercise, calcium 1000–1200 mg/day, vitamin D 800–1000 IU/day, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall prevention [^112dSBBR] [^113jwu3i].

- **Monitoring**: Repeat DXA in 1–2 years; initiate pharmacologic therapy only if fragility fractures occur or new risk factors develop.

- **UC management**: Maintain remission and minimize corticosteroid exposure to reduce bone loss risk [^116vtya8].

---

Pharmacologic therapy is **not indicated** for a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of -2.7 and only well-controlled UC; prioritize lifestyle measures and monitoring, and treat only if fractures occur or new risk factors arise.

### Endocrine and metabolic manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease [^112dSBBR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The primary aim of treatment is the prevention of fractures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications, including fall prevention, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, avoidance of excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, and engagement in regular weight-bearing exercise. It is essential to control the underlying disease and maintain remission.

Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be prescribed if necessary to ensure a daily calcium intake of 1000 mg for younger patients and 1200 to 1500 mg for postmenopausal women and men over 55, alongside a daily vitamin D intake of 400 to 800 IU. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who have extensive small bowel disease may require larger amounts of vitamin and calcium.

Hypogonadal patients should receive hormone replacement therapy. Premenopausal women with IBD and amenorrhea are typically treated with combined estrogen-progestin replacement using an oral contraceptive pill or transdermal estradiol plus oral progestin administered cyclically.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause hypogonadism by suppressing gonadotropins. Therefore, men on long-term GC treatment should have periodic assessments of their morning serum testosterone and gonadotropins and should commence testosterone replacement therapy if they become hypogonadal. The use of GCs should be minimized when possible, and alternative therapies such as appropriate and early use of immunomodulators, budesonide, elemental or polymeric diet, or surgery for resistant disease should be considered.

IBD patients receiving GCs should also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonate prophylaxis is recommended for patients over 65 years at the commencement of GC therapy.

Diagnosis and evaluation

Osteoporosis can be diagnosed either when there is a history or evidence of fragility fractures (regardless of BMD) or according to the BMD as measured by DXA. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends DXA screening of IBD patients with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis and fracture: history of previous fragility fracture, postmenopausal, male over 50 years, corticosteroid therapy for more than three months, or hypogonadism. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends DXA screening for IBD patients with continuing active disease, weight loss over 10%, body mass index below 20 kg/m², men over 70 years, and those on corticosteroid therapy for more than three months. BMD can be expressed as the number of standard deviations (SD) above or below either the mean BMD for young adults (T-score) or the mean BMD for age-matched controls (Z-score). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), osteoporosis in peri- and post-menopausal women or men over 50 years of age can be defined as a T-score at the spine or hip of less than -2.5 SD. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 is defined as osteopenia. For premenopausal women or men under 50, however, Z-scores, not T-scores, should be used; a Z-score of ≤ -2.0 should be interpreted as "below the expected range for age". If BMD is within the normal range, DXA should be repeated in two to three years. In patients with abnormal BMD measurements, further clinical and laboratory evaluation is required to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as primary hyperparathyroidism.

### A 55-year-old woman with osteopenia [^114Z9bEx]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

About half of postmenopausal women have a bone density T score at the femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5. Bone density in this range was termed "osteopenia" by a World Health Organization working group. Osteopenia is not a disease, and the label can cause unnecessary anxiety. Osteopenia encompasses a wide range of fracture risks; an individual patient's risk can be estimated from her age, bone mineral density, and clinical risk factors. Regardless of bone mineral density, regular exercise and adherence to vitamin D and calcium intake may reduce the risk of hip fracture. Osteopenia by itself is not an indication for treatment. Decisions about pharmacological treatment to prevent fractures should be based on the patient's risk of fractures, evidence about the efficacy and nonskeletal effects of the specific treatment, and the patient's preferences.

### Severity of inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in ulcerative colitis [^112YnMk1]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of colorectal cancer, which is widely believed to be secondary to colonic inflammation. However, the severity of colonic inflammation has never been previously shown to be a risk factor.

- **Aims**: We devised a case-control study of patients with long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis to examine various potential risk factors for neoplasia. All cases of colorectal neoplasia detected from our surveillance program between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 2002, were studied (n = 68). Each patient was matched with two control patients from the same surveillance population (n = 136). Matching was for sex, colitis extent, age at onset, duration of colitis, and year of index surveillance colonoscopy. Segmental colonoscopic and histological inflammation was recorded using a simple score (0, normal; 1, quiescent/chronic inflammation; and 2, 3, and 4, mild, moderate, and severe active inflammation, respectively). Other data collected included history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of colorectal cancer, and smoking and drug history (mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and folate).

- **Results**: Univariate analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the colonoscopic (odds ratio, 2.5; P = 0.001) and histological (odds ratio, 5.1; P < 0.001) inflammation scores and the risk of colorectal neoplasia. No other factors reached statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, only the histological inflammation score remained significant (odds ratio, 4.7; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The study identifies the severity of histological inflammation as a significant risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis, suggesting that inflammation control may be critical in managing long-term cancer risk.

### Daclizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25), for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging trial [^113HY2JL]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

An uncontrolled pilot study demonstrated that daclizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25), might be effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.

- **Methods**: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daclizumab induction therapy in patients with active ulcerative colitis. A total of 159 patients with moderate ulcerative colitis were randomised to receive induction therapy with daclizumab 1 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0 and 4, or 2 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6, or placebo. The primary endpoint was induction of remission at week 8. Remission was defined as a Mayo score of 0 on both endoscopy and rectal bleeding components and a score of 0 or 1 on stool frequency and physician's global assessment components. Response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score of at least 3 points.

- **Results**: Two percent of patients receiving daclizumab 1 mg/kg (p = 0.11 v placebo) and 7% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg (p = 0.73) were in remission at week 8, compared with 10% of those who received placebo. Response occurred at week 8 in 25% of patients receiving daclizumab 1 mg/kg (p = 0.04) and in 33% of patients receiving 2 mg/kg (p = 0.30) versus 44% of those receiving placebo. Daclizumab was well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events in daclizumab treated patients compared with placebo treated patients were nasopharyngitis (14.6%) and pyrexia (10.7%).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with moderate ulcerative colitis who are treated with daclizu

### Increased fracture risk in patients with rheumatic disorders and other inflammatory diseases — a case-control study with 53,108 patients with fracture [^1153G4dV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

To identify the risk of hip and vertebral fractures in patients with rheumatic disorders (RD) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a population-based case-control study was conducted. This study assessed the fracture risk among patients suffering from various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis (UC). The cohort comprised 53,108 patients with fractures (66% women) and 370,602 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed, and results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

There was a statistically significant increased fracture risk for all rheumatic disorders and for inflammatory bowel diseases compared with controls. The magnitude of fracture risk was higher for patients with rheumatic disorders (OR 3, 95% CI 2.9–3.2) than for those with inflammatory bowel diseases (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4–1.8). The OR in rheumatic disorders ranged from 2.6 (95% CI 1.3–4.9) for systemic sclerosis to 4 (95% CI 3.4–4.6) for ankylosing spondylitis. The largest increased fracture risk for vertebral fractures was seen in ankylosing spondylitis (OR 7.1, 95% CI 6–8.4) and for hip fractures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4–6.9).

These results highlight the existence of an increased fracture risk from a variety of underlying causes in patients with rheumatic disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases. In many inflammatory diseases, implementation of fracture prevention strategies may be beneficial.

### Delzicol [^116jJfgT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Delzicol have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of these studies for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, as well as the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	- **Adults**: Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration involving 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed-release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in the sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048). Additionally, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day group showed improvement.

- **Pregnancy**:

- **Risk summary**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose.

- **The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage**: For the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk**: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

### Physical activity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: Prospective study from the Nurses' Health Study cohorts [^113UrF4X]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Through 2010, we documented 284 incident cases of Crohn's disease and 363 incident cases of ulcerative colitis among 194,711 women who contributed 3,421,973 person-years of follow-up. Compared with women in the lowest fifth of physical activity, women in the highest fifth were less likely to be obese (body mass index ≥ 30) or smokers (Table 1). There were no significant differences according to age, history of appendicectomy, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, or postmenopausal hormone therapy according to fifths of physical activity.

Table 1

Baseline characteristics of participants in Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II according to fifths of physical activity. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise.

MET h/wk = metabolic equivalent task hours per week.

Values are standardized to the age distribution of the study population. All variables are derived from baseline questionnaires (1986 in Nurses' Health Study and 1989 in Nurses' Health Study II), with the exception of geographic location (1992 and 1993, respectively), oral contraceptive use (1984 and baseline, respectively), and appendicectomy (baseline and 1995, respectively).

Percentages presented are among postmenopausal women.

The age-adjusted risk of Crohn's disease decreased with increasing levels of physical activity compared with women in the lowest fifth of overall physical activity. The risk was not significantly altered after adjusting for known and potential risk factors for Crohn's disease, including body mass index, smoking, and appendicectomy.

### Duavee [^1137KwqY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of DUAVEE for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in Study 1 and Study 2.

- **Study 1**: This was a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple combinations of conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene, including conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg, compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at Year 1. Bone mineral density change at the lumbar spine at Year 2 was the key secondary endpoint, assessed in two subsets of patients: Substudy I and Substudy II.

	- Substudy I required patients to be more than 5 years postmenopausal, have a lumbar spine or total hip T-score of -1 to -2.5, and have at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis (e.g. Caucasian race, family history of osteoporosis, early menopause, thin/small frame, inactive lifestyle, tobacco abuse).

	- Substudy II included patients who were 1–5 years postmenopausal with at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis.

A total of 3,397 women aged 40–75 years (mean age of 56 years) were enrolled in the overall study. Substudy I enrolled 1,454 women, including 182 women receiving DUAVEE, with mean baseline T-scores of -1.43 for DUAVEE and -1.52 for placebo groups. Substudy II enrolled 861 women, including 111 women receiving DUAVEE, with mean baseline T-scores of -0.81 for DUAVEE and -0.94 for placebo groups. Women also took…

### Effectiveness of risedronate in osteoporotic postmenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective, parallel, open-label, two-year extension study [^114Z5gHt]. Menopause (2008). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of risedronate in osteoporotic postmenopausal patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The design was a prospective, parallel, open-label, two-year extension study following a randomized, double-blind, one-year clinical trial. Eighty-one osteoporotic postmenopausal women with IBD were treated with risedronate (n = 40) or placebo (n = 41). Bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical bone turnover markers, and vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were assessed throughout the study. Data were analyzed using the intent-to-treat principle.

Results showed significant (P < 0.05) differences between risedronate and placebo groups at one-, two-, and three-year follow-up visits in bone turnover markers and in lumbar spine, trochanter, and femoral neck BMD. In participants treated with risedronate, the percentage of changes from baseline in bone turnover markers and in lumbar spine, trochanter, and femoral neck BMD were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at two- and three-year follow-up compared to baseline and one-year follow-up, with a significant (P < 0.05) difference between the two- and three-year follow-up visits. At the end of the study, the cumulative risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the risedronate group than in the placebo group. The relative risk for new vertebral fractures was 0.456 (95% CI: 0.134–1.559, P = 0.211) and 0.296 (95% CI: 0.121–0.721, P = 0.007), while for new nonvertebral fractures it was 0.209 (95% CI: 0.023–1.867, P = 0.161) and 0.137 (95% CI: 0.030–0.620, P = 0.010) after two and three years, respectively.

### Uceris [^114bN1UP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fourteen clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the induction of remission in active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies included a total of 970 adult patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) of ≥ 4 and ≤ 10. Eight hundred ninety-nine of these patients had histology consistent with active UC, considered the primary analysis population. The UCDAI is a four-component scale (total score of 0 to 12) that includes clinical assessments of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, and physician's rating of disease activity (score of 0 to 3 for each component).

The baseline median UCDAI score in both studies was 7.

- **Study 1 demographic information**: 56% of patients were male, with a median age of 42 years. In terms of ethnicity, 50% of patients were Caucasian, 7% African American, and 34% Asian.

- **Study 2 demographic information**: 57% of patients were male, with a median age of 44 years. More than 99% of patients were Caucasian.

Both studies compared UCERIS 9 mg and 6 mg with placebo and included an active reference arm (mesalamine 2.4 g in Study 1 and budesonide 9 mg not approved for the treatment of UC in Study 2). The primary endpoint was the induction of remission after 8 weeks of treatment. Remission was defined as a UCDAI score of ≤ 1, with subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and mucosal appearance, in addition to a ≥ 1 point reduction in an endoscopy-only score.

### Prolia [^111gGuWz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis were assessed in a 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study (NCT 01575873). The study involved 795 patients, consisting of 70% women and 30% men, aged 20 to 94 years, with a mean age of 63 years. These patients were treated with ≥ 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for less than 3 months prior to study enrollment and planned to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or for ≥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation; n = 505).

Patients under 50 years old were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Meanwhile, patients aged 50 years or older in the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation were required to have a baseline BMD T-score of ≤ -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD T-score ≤ -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck along with a history of osteoporotic fracture.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5 mg once daily) (n = 397) or Prolia 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Randomization was stratified by gender within each subpopulation. All patients received at least 1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation daily.

### Risk of fracture in ulcerative colitis: a population-based study from Olmsted County, Minnesota [^112ToQmt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Osteopenia is common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but less is known about fracture risk. Previously, we were unable to demonstrate increased fractures in a population-based cohort with Crohn's disease.

Methods

Medical records of 273 Olmsted County, Minnesota residents initially diagnosed with UC from 1940 to 1993 were reviewed for evidence of subsequent fractures. Records of a control cohort of county residents matched on age and gender were also reviewed. Cumulative fracture incidence after diagnosis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio of fracture in cases relative to control subjects was estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression, which was also used to evaluate potential risk factors for fracture.

Results

The median follow-up was 13 years (range, 1 day to 53 years). The cumulative incidence of any fracture from time of diagnosis was 40% at 25 years versus 42% in control subjects (P = 0.615). The hazard ratio in cases compared to control subjects was 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.8–1.6) for any fracture and 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.8) for any osteoporotic fracture (hip, spine, or wrist as a result of moderate trauma). Other causes of secondary osteoporosis were associated with increased fracture risk, whereas estrogen use was protective. One hundred three cases received any corticosteroids (38%), and 34 (12%) had taken corticosteroids for 6 months or longer. Corticosteroids and bowel resection were not associated with fracture risk.

Conclusions

In this population-based cohort of patients with UC, fracture risk was not conclusively demonstrated due to similar fracture rates in controls. Further research is necessary to elucidate specific risk factors in this population.

### Hormone therapy increases risk of ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's disease [^111yf8Qf]. Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Estrogen has been proposed to modulate gut inflammation through an effect on estrogen receptors found on gastrointestinal epithelial and immune cells. The role of postmenopausal hormone therapy on the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 108,844 postmenopausal US women (median age, 54 years) enrolled in 1976 in the Nurses' Health Study without a prior history of CD or UC. Every two years, we updated information on menopause status, postmenopausal hormone use, and other risk factors. Self-reported diagnoses of CD and UC were confirmed through medical record review by two gastroenterologists who were blinded to exposure information. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Through 2008, with more than 1.8 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 138 incident cases of CD and 138 cases of UC. Compared with women who never used hormones, the multivariate-adjusted HR for UC was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.07–2.74) among women who currently used hormones and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.03–2.66) among past users. The risk of UC appeared to increase with longer duration of hormone use (P(trend) = .04) and decreased with time since discontinuation. There was no difference in risk according to the type of hormone therapy used (estrogen vs. estrogen plus progestin). In contrast, we did not observe an association between hormone use and risk of CD (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.78–1.82).

### Prempro [^1176fxqK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years. Forty-five percent were 65 to 69 years of age, 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 19 percent were 75 years of age and older. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.

After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. The study defined probable dementia to include Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in both the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- **Relative risk findings**: When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19–2.60). Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Mesalamine [^112oYiVk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release capsules have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	**Adults**: Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

	- In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed-release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included an assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in the sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048).

### International consensus on the prevention of venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114BSHXS]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021).

- **Control of disease activity**: Control of disease activity is a critical factor in reducing the risk of venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A consensus was reached with 93% agreement, where 40% fully agreed and 53% mostly agreed. The evidence level is 4.

	- Moderate to severe IBD activity is identified as a risk factor for both venous thromboembolism (VTE) (see Statements 3 and 5) and arterial thrombotic events (see Statement 7). Disease activity should be considered a modifiable risk factor. Aggressive control of inflammation may reduce the risk of thrombosis in IBD patients. Physicians should aim for combined clinical and endoscopic remission, as persistent subclinical inflammation can also increase the risk of events. In the general population, elevated inflammatory markers, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), are associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). IBD therapies can reduce these risks by mitigating inflammation, thus potentially reducing thrombotic events. However, some IBD therapies might have a pro-thrombotic effect that could increase the risk of venous and/or arterial events (see Statements 13 to 19).

- **Cardiovascular disease risk factors**: Established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors should be actively investigated and controlled in patients with IBD. A consensus was reached with 100% agreement, with 73% fully agreeing and 27% mostly agreeing. The evidence level is 4.

	- Patients with IBD should be screened for CVD risk factors, as atherosclerosis is responsible for most arterial thrombotic events.

### Raloxifene hydrochloride [^1124MkbJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The effects of raloxifene hydrochloride on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women were examined in three randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind osteoporosis prevention trials. The North American trial enrolled 544 women, the European trial involved 601 women, and the international trial included 619 women who had undergone hysterectomy. In these trials, all women received calcium supplementation (400 to 600 mg/day). The participants had a median age of 54 years and a median time since menopause of 5 years, ranging from less than 1 year up to 15 years postmenopause. The majority of the women were White (93.5%). Participants were included if they had spine BMD between 2.5 standard deviations below and 2 standard deviations above the mean value for healthy young women. The mean T scores (number of standard deviations above or below the mean in healthy young women) for the three trials ranged from -1.01 to -0.74 for spine BMD, including women with both normal and low BMD. Raloxifene hydrochloride, administered at 60 mg once daily, resulted in increases in bone mass versus calcium supplementation alone, as demonstrated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric (DXA) measurements of hip, spine, and total body BMD.

### Meaning attribution to intimate partner violence by counselors who support women with intimate partner violence experiences in Greece [^111YcCVT]. Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intimate partner violence:

- **Definition**: Intimate partner violence is defined as any form of aggression or harmful behavior within a romantic relationship. This can include physical, sexual, or psychological harm, as well as controlling behaviors by a current or former partner.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of intimate partner violence is complex and multifaceted, involving an interplay of individual, relational, and societal factors. Substance abuse, mental health issues, and societal norms can also contribute to the occurrence of intimate partner violence.

- **Epidemiology**: Intimate partner violence is a significant global issue and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide within their lifetime.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for intimate partner violence include individual factors such as a history of violent behavior, substance misuse, and the presence of specific personality disorders. Relationship-related factors encompass marital discord, dominance and control dynamics within the relationship, and financial stress. Societal factors include societal norms endorsing male authority over female behavior, rigid gender role distinctions, and the existence of community groups that legitimize male violence.

- **Disease course**: Intimate partner violence can manifest in various forms, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Physical abuse often results in injuries, with musculoskeletal injuries being the second most common manifestation. These injuries can range from minor bruises and cuts to severe fractures and burns.

### Prolia [^1126wWmM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis were demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled women had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease, or on therapies that affect bone, were excluded from this study. The 7808 enrolled women were aged 60 to 91 years, with a mean age of 72 years. Overall, the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.8, and 23% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (N = 3906) or Prolia 60 mg (N = 3902) once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.

The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Vertebral fractures were diagnosed based on lateral spine radiographs (T4-L4) using a semiquantitative scoring method. Secondary efficacy variables included the incidence of hip fracture and nonvertebral fracture, assessed at 3 years.

- **Effect on vertebral fractures**: Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.

### Lack of relationship of calcium and vitamin D intake to bone mineral density in premenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease [^114JpUVn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Low bone mineral density has been widely reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The exact etiology of this condition is not entirely understood, but it is suggested to be multifactorial, possibly including low calcium and vitamin D intake. The objective of this study was to assess calcium and vitamin D intake and its relationship to bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women with IBD.

A total of 70 premenopausal women with IBD (mean age 33.3 years, range 18–44 years), drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry, participated in the study. Calcium and vitamin D intake were determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and compared to the Dietary Reference Intake values for adequacy. BMD of the total body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

Of the 70 subjects, 66 successfully completed the study. Inadequate calcium intake (< 1000 mg/day) was found in 69.7% of the subjects, with this low intake group having a mean calcium intake of 508 mg/day. Inadequate vitamin D intake (< 200 IU/day) was found in 53% of the subjects, with a mean vitamin D intake of 76 IU/day in this group. Calcium and vitamin D intake correlated with each other with R² = 0.57, p < 0.00001. Daily calcium intake was not significantly different for subjects with T scores greater than -1 (901 mg) and for subjects with T scores less than -1 (875 mg, p = 0.44). Daily vitamin D intake was not significantly different for subjects with T scores greater than -1 (297 IU).

### Prempro [^112RqfJM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies. These studies aimed to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) at 0.625 mg, either alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at 2.5 mg, compared to placebo, in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE alone on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: This substudy was stopped early according to the predefined stopping rule. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, it was found that the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

	- For those outcomes in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were as follows: 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers. Meanwhile, the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer other conditions.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^117MYr9p]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) interpretation:

Absolute BMD values differ between vendors due to inherent differences in how each technology works. However, for diagnostic classification, this value is converted into a T-score and/or Z-score, which represents a patient's BMD in standard deviations compared to a reference population, with a precision of one decimal place. The ISCD guidance recommends that T-scores are preferred in postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women, and men over the age of 50 years, whereas Z-scores are recommended for younger individuals. Conversely, the International Osteoporosis Foundations (IOF) supports the use of T-scores in premenopausal women and men under the age of 50 years as well.

As described in Part I, the standard skeletal sites for DXA measurement are the hip (total hip and femoral neck), with the femoral neck being designated by the IOF as the reference site for epidemiological studies, the L1-L4 region of the lumbar spine, and the radius. However, in chronic arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, BMD should not be measured at the radius, because there is local, juxta-articular bone loss resulting in a lower BMD than in other parts of the skeleton. BMD expressed in g/cm2 is primarily used for input into fracture risk algorithms (e.g. FRAX) and to monitor the skeletal effects of osteoporosis. Incorporating ethnicity into FRAX (US, South Africa, and Singapore versions) aims to help calibrate interventions appropriately, addressing racial disparities in fracture risk assessment and intervention thresholds. It is important to note that the significance of ethnicity variables…

### Bone density in a population-based cohort of premenopausal adult women with early onset inflammatory bowel disease [^1114ZsfP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in a population-based sample of women with inflammatory bowel disease who were diagnosed before age 20 years and who are currently premenopausal and less than 45 years. The University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Research Registry was accessed to find eligible women. Of 171 eligible subjects, 82 agreed to participate, and 70 appeared for dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. All subjects completed demographic, clinical, and lifestyle questionnaires and underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry with analyses for both areal and volumetric BMD.

The mean areal T scores at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body were -0.14 ± 1.05, -0.15 ± 1.04, -0.25 ± 1.17, and +0.09 ± 1.04, respectively. Forty-five subjects had normal BMD, and 25 had a T score < -1. There were no significant differences between these groups for predictive variables. Only three (4%) had osteoporosis (T score < -2.5 at any site). There were 12 with disease onset before puberty and 58 after puberty. There were no differences between these groups for BMD. Volumetric BMD was slightly higher than areal BMD at the lumbar spine (p < 0.0002), femoral neck (p < 0.01), and total hip (p < 0.001).

In a population-based sample of women diagnosed with IBD before 20 years of age and who are currently premenopausal, their average BMD is normal, and the prevalence of osteoporosis is very low. Despite the potential for children with IBD to develop osteoporosis…

### AGA clinical practice update on noncolorectal cancer screening and vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: Expert review [^114szqvQ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to screening for osteoporosis, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering obtaining bone densitometry in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, regardless of age, when risk factors for osteopenia and osteoporosis are present, including:

- **Low BMI**: 3 months of cumulative corticosteroid exposure
- **Smoking**
- **Postmenopausal status**
- **Hypogonadism**

Risk summary

Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association between mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with the administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk**: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

- **Data**:

	- **Human data**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^111Um91k]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. The objective of the study was to assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

The design involved the estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial with a planned duration of 8.5 years. The trial recruited 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline, from 40 US clinical centers between 1993–1998.

- **Interventions**: Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in one tablet (n = 8506) or a placebo (n = 8102).

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the two primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

On May 31, 2002, following a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect, and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002.

### Hormonal replacement therapy after menopause is protective of disease activity in women with inflammatory bowel disease [^115UNkhe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following menopause has not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of menopause on disease activity and identify possible modifiers of disease activity.

Methods: This was a retrospective study of women followed at the University of Chicago IBD Clinic. Disease activity was assessed using clinical scoring systems during the pre- and postmenstrual periods of subjects. Variables of interest included history of smoking, use of oral contraceptives (OCP) prior to onset of menopause, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Results: Sixty-five women were included, 20 with ulcerative colitis and 45 with Crohn's disease. The median age of menopause was similar to historical controls. Twenty-three patients (35%) experienced active symptoms in the premenopausal time period and 25 patients (38%) had disease indices consistent with a flare within the first two years after menopause (P > 0.05). There was no relation between those who had a pre- versus postmenstrual flare as a group (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant protective effect on disease activity with postmenopausal HRT use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–0.72). There was also a dose-response effect noted with an HR with longer duration of use (0.20, 0.07–0.65).

Conclusions: The likelihood of having a flare postmenopause is not different from having it premenopause. However, HRT may provide a protective effect for disease activity in the postmenopausal period.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114TgzZq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF commissioned a review of the literature to update evidence about the benefits and harms of using menopausal hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions, as well as whether the benefits and harms of hormone therapy differ by population subgroups defined by age; the presence of comorbid medical conditions; and the type, dose, and method of hormonal delivery.

- **Population**: This recommendation applies to postmenopausal women who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to women younger than 50 years who have had surgical menopause.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women (Grade D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy (Grade D recommendation).

### Prempro [^1175MgDv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated equine estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE alone on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

	- For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.

### Metabolic bone disease in patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from Spain [^117KZEf1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 1619 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 1152 from Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM) and 467 from Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real (HGUCR), were evaluated between 2002 and 2014. Out of these, 612 eligible patients with risk factors for metabolic bone disease (MBD) and at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were included in the study. Of these patients, 43.1% were male, and the mean (SD) age was 44.9 (14.7) years. Crohn's disease (CD) was diagnosed in 359 (58.6%) patients, ulcerative colitis (UC) in 238 (38.9%), and indeterminate colitis (IC) in 15 (2.4%) patients, with a mean evolution time from diagnosis of 9.7 years.

Clinical characteristics, and previous and active treatments of patients at the moment of basal DXA, are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Patients diagnosed with CD were significantly younger [42.1 (13.9) years versus 48.6 (15) years, p < 0.001] and had a significantly higher rate of active smoking (34.3% versus 15.6%, p < 0.001). They also had higher rates of immunomodulators (IMM) use (49.7% versus 37.8%, p = 0.011), biologic treatment (27.9% versus 14.7%, p < 0.001), hospital admissions (51.4% versus 38.6%, p = 0.026), and previous surgery (42.1% versus 9.7%, p < 0.001) compared to those diagnosed with UC. A higher proportion of menopausal women was found among UC compared with CD patients (24.6% versus 16%, p = 0.004).

A total of 439 patients (71.7%) received at least one tapered dosage of corticosteroids before DXA, with a mean (SD) cumulative dose of 4021.5 (2979) mg of prednisone or equivalent. Furthermore, 143 patients received calcium and vitamin D treatment at least 3 months before the first DXA, and 19 patients received bisphosphonates.

The objective of these guidelines is to ensure standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees. The development adheres to published AACE protocols.

- **Methods**: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of the clinical evidence, transparently incorporating subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines.

- **Results**: The Executive Summary of this 2020 update includes 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations facilitate nuanced clinical decision-making addressing multiple aspects of real-world patient care. The Appendix presents supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update references 368 citations: 123 (33.5%) at evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest).

New or updated topics in this CPG include: clarification of osteoporosis diagnosis, stratification of patients according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, introduction of a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions between therapeutic options. This guideline serves as a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Increased histologic inflammation is an independent risk factor for nonconventional dysplasia in ulcerative colitis [^112s7khn]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

Several types of nonconventional dysplasia have been described in inflammatory bowel disease. Hypermucinous, goblet cell-deficient, and crypt cell dysplasias are considered high-risk subtypes, as they often have molecular features of advanced neoplasia (e.g. aneuploidy) and are more frequently associated with advanced neoplasia than conventional dysplasia. This study investigated if increased colonic inflammation is a risk factor for nonconventional dysplasia.

- **Methods and results**: A cohort of 125 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated dysplasia was analyzed and compared with 50 control UC patients without a history of neoplasia. For each patient, all biopsies prior to the initial detection of dysplasia were scored using a 4-point inflammatory activity score. Both mean and maximum scores from all biopsies taken during each colonoscopy were derived. Inflammation burden was calculated by multiplying the average maximum score between each pair of surveillance episodes by the length of the surveillance interval in years. The average scores of all colonoscopies were used to calculate overall mean, maximum, and inflammation burden scores. In multivariate analyses, higher maximum (odds ratio [OR] 3.4) and inflammation burden (OR 4.2) scores were significantly associated with the detection of dysplasia (P < 0.05). Similarly, higher mean and maximum scores increased the odds of nonconventional dysplasia by 2.7 and 4.9, respectively (P < 0.05). There was a stronger association between these two scores and high-risk subtypes (ORs 4.0 and 7.5, respectively, P < 0.05).

The study concludes that increased histologic inflammation is an independent risk factor for nonconventional dysplasia in ulcerative colitis.

### ACG clinical guideline update: Ulcerative colitis in adults [^1147Viaq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically in maintaining remission for moderate-to-severe disease, including advanced therapy, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend measuring serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies. This is particularly advised for patients with moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who are responders to anti-TNF therapy but are now losing response. If there is insufficient drug present, this assessment helps identify the reason for the loss of response.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114cs6Gh]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle and is confirmed retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, refers to the few-year period preceding a person's final menstrual period. It is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability, periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age, and individuals who reach menopause are expected, on average, to live more than another 30 years.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aimed to update its 2017 recommendation. It commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (i.e. oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons, assessing whether outcomes vary by age or by the timing of intervention after menopause.

Asymptomatic postmenopausal persons considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions form the population under examination. The USPSTF concludes, with moderate certainty, that the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal individuals with an intact uterus has no net benefit. Similarly, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that using estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal individuals who have had a hysterectomy also has no net benefit.

The AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines emphasize the importance of classification and risk stratification in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Specifically, they recommend identifying patients at very high fracture risk under the following conditions:

- **Recent fracture**: Occurrence within the past 12 months.
- **Fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy**: A patient experiences fractures despite receiving treatment.
- **Fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm**: Such as long-term corticosteroid use.
- **Multiple fractures**: Presence of more than one fracture.
- **Very low T-score**: As measured by bone density scans.
- **Use of validated fracture risk algorithms**: For example, an FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk > 30% or hip fracture risk > 4.5%.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113jwu3i]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D

- **Statement 103**: We suggest that vitamin D levels should be measured and deficiency corrected in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

In a multicultural UK IBD cohort, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significant. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with low bone mineral density. Vitamin D is important in some immune-mediated diseases, although its role in IBD inflammation is not fully elucidated. Retrospective studies have shown an association between higher levels of vitamin D and remission rates, as well as the durability of response to anti-TNF therapy. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by increased disease activity associated with lower vitamin D levels.

### Assessment and management of low bone density in inflammatory bowel disease and performance of professional society guidelines [^116vtya8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an increased prevalence of osteoporosis, leading to guideline recommendations for bone mineral density (BMD) testing. The study aimed to identify predictors of BMD testing and treatment and assess guideline effectiveness in identifying IBD patients with osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: Records of all IBD patients at seven medical facilities were reviewed for clinical data and BMD testing from January 1996 through October 2006.

- **Results**: A total of 2035 patients had 317 bone density tests performed. Osteopenia was found in 48% of patients and osteoporosis in 26%. Among patients meeting guideline criteria for BMD testing and with ≥ 1 year of follow-up, 23.3% underwent testing. The strongest predictors of testing were menopause (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 3.02) and receiving care at a tertiary center (AHR 2.56). Testing rates were low in patients aged ≥ 60 years, those with ulcerative colitis, and those with a history of inpatient IBD treatment. Osteoporotic patients received calcium/vitamin D and bisphosphonates in 59% and 75% of cases, respectively. Osteoporotic males had a 37% rate of hypogonadism. Guideline criteria did not distinguish patients with osteoporosis, with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 84%, 23%, 27%, and 81% for osteoporosis in the tested population, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Osteoporosis is highly prevalent in the IBD population, but BMD testing and osteoporosis treatments are underutilized. Male hypogonadism is common in osteoporotic IBD patients. Guidelines do not adequately identify all patients at risk.

### Humira [^115jLWSe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Ulcerative colitis**: For adult patients with ulcerative colitis, the recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira is 160 mg initially on Day 1, which can be given in one day or split over two consecutive days. This is followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks thereafter (Day 29), the dosage continues at 40 mg every other week. It is advised to discontinue Humira in adult patients without evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (Day 57) of therapy. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be maintained during treatment with Humira. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) may also be continued during treatment if necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- **Pediatrics**: For pediatric patients aged 5 years and older with ulcerative colitis, the recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira is based on body weight.

- **Plaque psoriasis or adult uveitis**: For adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) or uveitis (UV), the recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The use of Humira in moderate to severe chronic Ps beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies.

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: For adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), the recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira is an initial dose of 160 mg, which can be given in one day or split over two consecutive days, followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29), begin dosing with 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week.

	- **Adolescents**: The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira for adolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa is not fully detailed.

### Bone health across a woman's lifespan [^111bMsST]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

There is a lack of international consensus regarding appropriate diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis in premenopausal women. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Calcified Tissue Society together recommend the diagnosis of osteoporosis in premenopausal women with vertebral and/or multiple fragility fractures with low aBMD, defined by the IOF as a Z‐score ≤ ‐2 prior to 20 years of age, and a T‐score < ‐2.5 in older premenopausal women who have attained peak bone mass.

The IOF also recognizes aBMD T‐score < ‐2.5 at the spine or hip in a premenopausal woman with an underlying chronic disease affecting bone metabolism as consistent with osteoporosis. The IOF recommends the use of T‐scores in premenopausal women to maintain consistency with the World Health Organisation criteria for postmenopausal osteoporosis but acknowledges the recommendations by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry to report Z‐scores rather than T‐scores in premenopausal women. For Z‐scores, a comparison to average age‐matched and sex‐matched BMD, a score ≤ ‐2 is classified as 'below the expected range for age'.

This is particularly relevant when assessing younger adults, as factors other than osteoporosis may also contribute to low bone density, such as low peak bone mass and osteomalacia due to an underlying chronic disease or other factors described above. For clarity and to maintain consistency with much of the published literature, we have used the term osteoporosis in premenopausal women presenting with fracture (regardless of bone density).
