## Question

4 year old with agenesis of corpus callosum. expected prognosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what prognosis to expect for a 4-year-old with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the ACC is truly isolated versus associated with other anomalies. Then, I should determine if the agenesis is complete or partial. Next, I need to review the genetic evaluation and its yield because etiology drives outcome. After that, I will quantify age-appropriate neurodevelopmental risks at 4 years, consider the validity of assessments at this age and the possibility of later-emerging issues, check prenatal versus postnatal diagnostic concordance, and finally synthesize a prognostic estimate with concrete counseling and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the isolation status, because isolation versus complex ACC is the single most important prognostic determinant, and I need to ensure we are not missing subtle cortical malformations or extra-CNS anomalies that would worsen outlook [^115H4Fdi]. Wait, let me verify the imaging pathway: prenatal ultrasound can suggest ACC, but fetal and especially postnatal MRI often reveal additional malformations, with about 22.5% of "apparently isolated" cases showing extra findings postnatally, so re-imaging matters for prognosis [^111RYq5g]. I should also recall that large series show roughly 70% of prenatally detected ACCs have coexisting anomalies when comprehensively evaluated, which uniformly worsens outcomes, so thorough postnatal workup is critical before giving a firm prognosis at age 4 [^115LyFvC].

> Next, I should review whether this is complete versus partial agenesis, because extent modestly modifies risk even within isolated cases [^112ofNxC]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative risks: meta-analysis suggests isolated complete ACC carries abnormal cognition in roughly 15%, gross motor deficits around 4%, fine motor around 11%, and epilepsy about 7%, whereas partial ACC shows slightly higher cognitive and epilepsy rates in pooled data, though heterogeneity and short follow-up in some cohorts limit confidence at preschool ages [^112ofNxC] [^115PwfA1]. Let me double-check prenatal-postnatal concordance here too, because fetal subtyping (complete versus partial) is only confirmed postnatally in about three-quarters of cases, so postnatal MRI classification at 4 years should be the anchor for prognostication [^11129fxu].

> I will now examine the genetic evaluation, since etiology strongly influences neurodevelopment. I need to check the expected diagnostic yield: CMA explains up to about 12.5% and exome up to about 30% in isolated and as high as about 47% in non-isolated cases, while larger prenatal exome cohorts report an overall yield near 23%, with the highest in dysgenesis rather than classic agenesis [^115H4Fdi] [^113EJohh] [^116EwagB]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially attributed favorable outcomes in DCC-related ACC to the KIDINS220 report, but that was a mistake; KIDINS220 has been linked to callosal hypoplasia and aqueductal stenosis in a case report, not the favorable isolated ACC phenotype, so I should correct that and cite DCC from the prenatal exome cohort and the neuropsychological series instead, where DCC variants are specifically associated with isolated ACC and comparatively better outcomes when truly isolated [^115wNvA8] [^116EwagB] [^117VmAkK]. I should also consider that USP7-related disorders commonly feature white matter paucity and significant neurodevelopmental issues, which would worsen prognosis if present, and that de novo CNVs are enriched among ACC patients with developmental disability, reinforcing the importance of a negative genetic workup as a favorable sign in an otherwise isolated case [^116SKtwq] [^116rTBzR].

> Now, let me quantify expected outcomes at around age 4 for truly isolated ACC confirmed on postnatal MRI with negative genetics. I should double-check the summary proportions: integrative and meta-analytic data suggest roughly 65–75% normal or near-normal outcomes, approximately 13–22% mild-to-moderate impairment, and about 8–15% severe disability, with better outcomes when isolation is stringently confirmed postnatally [^115H4Fdi] [^111RYq5g] [^111xm8ZZ]. But wait, let me verify domain-specific risks in the preschool window: early longitudinal work shows about 29% have delays in at least one domain by 24 months with relative prominence of motor and communication vulnerabilities, meta-analytic data suggest cognitive impairment in about 15–17% and epilepsy around 7–16% depending on completeness, and clinical series highlight that language delay is a frequent presenting concern even when global intelligence is normal [^116cJtAS] [^112ofNxC] [^11129fxu]. I should confirm that many children with "normal" preschool testing still exhibit subtle learning, attention, or social cognition difficulties later, which tempers reassurance at age 4 despite reassuring milestones [^117WuC6z].

> Next, I should review the validity and timing of assessments at this age, because a normal 4-year evaluation is encouraging but not definitive. Let me consider standardized tools: Wechsler Preschool scales, Bayley, and Vineland are appropriate for capturing subtle deficits in adaptive, cognitive, and language domains at 4 years, but some executive and social cognition weaknesses emerge more clearly at school age through adolescence, warranting longitudinal neuropsychological follow-up even in apparently normal preschoolers [^116cJtAS] [^117WuC6z]. Hold on, I should verify the trajectory evidence: recent reviews emphasize that about two-thirds of children with isolated complete ACC do well initially, yet neuropsychological and behavioral differences can become more apparent in later childhood and adolescence, reinforcing the need for periodic reassessment into the teen years [^113EJohh].

> I need to ensure the original diagnosis was accurate by revisiting prenatal-postnatal concordance, since misclassification can skew prognosis. Prenatal diagnosis frequently changes after birth, with about 39% reclassification in one clinic cohort, second-trimester screening sensitivity near 73% in a single-center series, and only about 73% agreement on ACC subcategory between fetal and postnatal MRI, so postnatal MRI is the standard for finalizing type and associated anomalies before prognostication at 4 years [^111xm8ZZ] [^112zhfHG] [^11129fxu]. Let me also confirm that best practice includes a midsagittal plane evaluation on fetal ultrasound and comprehensive postnatal imaging to exclude subtle cortical malformations that would shift the child from "isolated" to "complex" risk strata [^114YM3Hf].

> Synthesizing this for a 4-year-old with confirmed isolated ACC, normal or near-normal outcomes are most likely, on the order of roughly 65–75%, with the child expected to walk independently, develop functional language, and attend mainstream school, albeit with an elevated risk for subtle executive, processing speed, language pragmatics, or fine-motor vulnerabilities that may warrant classroom accommodations and targeted therapies [^115H4Fdi] [^111RYq5g]. I should double-check that the moderate-risk group remains material: about 20–25% may need speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, or educational supports for mild-to-moderate delays, while roughly 8–15% may experience significant disability or epilepsy, a risk that rises if any additional anomalies or pathogenic variants are identified on re-evaluation at 4 years [^111RYq5g] [^112ofNxC] [^111xm8ZZ]. Given these distributions, counseling should emphasize comprehensive postnatal MRI confirmation, updated genetics with at least CMA and consideration of exome if not previously done, multidisciplinary developmental surveillance through school age, and family education about the possibility of later-emerging challenges even after a normal preschool evaluation, aligning with contemporary reviews and follow-up frameworks for high-risk children [^115H4Fdi] [^113EJohh] [^1111Hj4b].

> Final reasoning and verification: Without isolation status, detailed MRI, and genetic results, any prognosis at age 4 remains provisional; when any associated brain anomaly or syndromic etiology is present, outcomes are significantly worse than in isolated cases, and the proportion achieving normal development drops well below the roughly two-thirds observed in truly isolated ACC, necessitating individualized estimates anchored in the specific comorbidity profile [^112ofNxC] [^115LyFvC]. Let me reiterate that a normal assessment at age 4 is reassuring but should be paired with planned school-age neuropsychology to detect executive, attention, and social-communication issues that often surface later, which is supported by 10-year follow-up data and recent prognostic reviews emphasizing adolescent emergence of deficits [^117WuC6z] [^113EJohh].

The prognosis for a 4-year-old with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is highly variable and depends on whether it is isolated or accompanied by other anomalies [^115H4Fdi]. In isolated ACC, approximately **65–75% have normal or near-normal cognitive outcomes**, though subtle learning, language, or social difficulties are common; **25–35% have mild to moderate delays**, and about 10% have severe impairment. In non-isolated ACC, the risk of significant intellectual disability, epilepsy, and motor impairment is much higher [^114RcKZv]. Early intervention and ongoing developmental monitoring are **essential**, as challenges may emerge with age [^1111Hj4b].

## Neurodevelopmental outcomes

| **Attribute** | **Isolated ACC** | **Non-isolated ACC** |
|-|-|-|
| Cognitive and intellectual outcomes | Approximately 65–75% of children have normal or near-normal cognitive outcomes, though subtle deficits in executive function, processing speed, and problem-solving are common [^111RYq5g] | When ACC is associated with other brain anomalies or genetic syndromes, the risk of significant intellectual disability increases substantially [^114RcKZv] |
| Motor development | Most children achieve independent ambulation, but mild motor coordination difficulties and delayed motor milestones are common | Motor impairment, including cerebral palsy and significant motor delays, is more frequent [^11129fxu] |
| Language and communication | Language development is often delayed, with difficulties in pragmatic language, comprehension, and expressive language skills [^115H4Fdi] | Severe language impairment is common, particularly when associated with other brain anomalies or genetic syndromes [^114RcKZv] |
| Behavioral and social outcomes | Behavioral issues, including attention deficits, social communication difficulties, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) features, are common [^117A77RF] | Behavioral and social impairments are more severe and frequent, often requiring specialized interventions [^111mNmCi] |

## Neurological complications

### Seizures and epilepsy

Isolated ACC is associated with approximately **10–15%** of children developing seizures or epilepsy, typically manageable with medication; **Non-isolated ACC** has more frequent and often refractory seizures, particularly in syndromic forms such as Aicardi syndrome [^112ofNxC] [^116om8nk].

---

### Hydrocephalus

Isolated ACC is rarely associated with **hydrocephalus**, whereas **Non-isolated ACC** commonly presents with hydrocephalus, particularly when interhemispheric cysts or other brain malformations are present, often requiring surgical intervention [^115cFWn4] [^117PaFfG].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence the prognosis** of children with ACC:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Presence of additional brain anomalies | Strongly associated with poorer cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes [^11129fxu] |
| Genetic syndromes | Significantly increase risk of intellectual disability, seizures, and motor impairment [^114RcKZv] |
| Type of ACC (complete vs. partial) | Complete ACC generally associated with more severe outcomes than partial ACC |
| Early intervention | Early therapeutic interventions improve developmental outcomes significantly |

---

## Long-term functional independence

Regarding long-term functional independence, **Isolated ACC** often allows many children to achieve independence — including independent ambulation, basic self-care, and participation in mainstream education — though subtle cognitive and social difficulties may persist [^111RYq5g]. In contrast, **Non-isolated ACC** is frequently associated with limited independence, and many children require ongoing support for daily activities, mobility, and communication [^114RcKZv].

---

## Recommended interventions and therapies

Early and ongoing interventions are **critical for optimizing outcomes** [^116cJtAS]:

- **Early intervention programs**: Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy to address developmental delays.
- **Educational support**: Individualized education plans (IEPs) and specialized educational support.
- **Behavioral therapy**: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) and social skills training for behavioral and social difficulties.
- **Medical management**: Antiepileptic medications for seizures, surgical interventions for hydrocephalus or other structural anomalies.

---

## Conclusion

The prognosis for a 4-year-old with ACC is highly variable and depends on whether the condition is isolated or associated with other anomalies [^112ofNxC]. Isolated ACC generally has a favorable prognosis, with many children achieving normal or near-normal cognitive and motor outcomes, though subtle deficits may persist [^111RYq5g]. Non-isolated ACC carries significantly poorer outcomes, including intellectual disability, seizures, and motor impairment. Early intervention and ongoing developmental monitoring are **essential** for optimizing outcomes [^1111Hj4b].

### Neurodevelopment after prenatal diagnosis of isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum: An integrative review [^111RYq5g]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

To systematically review published data on the neurodevelopment of children diagnosed prenatally with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, a study was conducted.
- **Study design**: Medline and Scopus searches (1960-July 2011) were used alongside cross-referencing of retrieved articles.
- **Results**: Sixteen reports, totaling 132 cases of apparently isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, were analyzed. The normal outcome rate was 94/132 (71.2%; 95% confidence interval, 63.0–78.3). The rates of borderline or moderate disability and severe disability were 18/132 (13.6%; 95% CI, 8.8–20.5) and 22/132 (15.2%; 95% CI, 10.0–22.2), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging identified additional cerebral abnormalities in 22.5% (95% CI, 12.3–37.5) of the apparently isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum cases. In cases of truly isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, the normal neurodevelopment rate was 52/69 (75.4%; 95% CI, 64.0–84.0), and the severe disability rate was 8/69 (11.6%; 95% CI, 6.0–21.2).
- **Conclusion**: It was concluded that prenatally diagnosed, isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum is usually associated with a favorable outcome. However, larger prospective series are required, as current data are limited, inconsistent, and prevent subgroup analyses, such as comparisons between complete and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: What to tell expecting parents [^115H4Fdi]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). High credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is one of the most common brain malformations, with an incidence estimated to range from 0.5 to 70 in 10,000 among the general population. Prenatal diagnosis is made via ultrasound; however, fetal MRI is useful to confirm or exclude the presence of associated cerebral abnormalities — mostly cortical malformations — that may affect the postnatal prognosis. When no additional central nervous system (CNS) or extra-CNS anomalies are identified and no genetic cause is found, an isolated ACC is diagnosed.

Overall, in cases of ACC, an underlying genetic cause can be identified in up to 12.5% with chromosomal microarray (CMA) and up to 47% with whole exome sequencing (WES). In cases where ACC is the only anomaly detected, the yield of WES is 30%. Postnatal outcomes are variable and depend on whether the condition is isolated or not. In truly isolated ACC, outcomes range from normal in 65% of cases through mild to severe neurodevelopmental impairments in 35% of cases.

An interdisciplinary team of medical experts is key in guiding parents toward informed decision-making in pregnancies complicated by ACC. Considering expected advancements in genetic testing and imaging technologies in upcoming years, we herein summarize recommendations for the management and prenatal counseling of expecting parents of fetuses with ACC. Our review pertains primarily to expecting parents of fetuses with complete ACC.

### Agenesis of corpus callosum: A clinical study of complete versus partial agenesis in a 20-year retrospective cohort [^115PwfA1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) presents a wide spectrum of anatomical manifestations associated with incompletely understood clinical variability. In this retrospective cohort study, 161 children with ACC were classified into complete ACC and partial ACC groups. Partial and complete ACC diagnoses were confirmed by postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and further classified as isolated or complex (associated with other brain abnormalities or genetic diagnoses). Clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and co-occurring genetic variations were collected through chart review.

The median age at the last neurologic evaluation for the complete and partial ACC cohorts was 2.8 years and 2.3 years, respectively. Therefore, an average of 2–3 years of follow-up data were analyzed per patient. Results showed that children with complete and partial ACC had similar birth characteristics. Children with complete ACC were more frequently diagnosed prenatally and had lower rates of cerebral palsy.
- **Clinical comparisons**: When comparing complex complete ACC and complex partial ACC to isolated complete ACC and isolated partial ACC, respectively, the complex subcohorts had a higher level of motor delay, assistive device use, cerebral palsy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, epilepsy, language delay, and cognitive delay than the isolated subcohorts.

Approximately 50% of children had genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in this cohort. Additionally, over 50% of our patients with motor and non-motor developmental delays, as well as over 60% of patients requiring assistive devices, had.

### Pathogenic variants in USP7 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with speech delays, altered behavior, and neurologic anomalies [^116SKtwq]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

White matter paucity is the most common MRI finding in patients with USP7 pathogenic variants. The corpus callosum size is a reliable way to assess general myelination and the presence of white matter throughout the brain. Measurements of the corpus callosum's fronto-occipital diameter (FOD), anteroposterior diameter (APD), genu thickness (GT), isthmus thickness (IT), splenium thickness (ST), body thickness (BT), and the APD/FOD ratio were taken following procedures described in previous studies and compared with age-matched reference values.

It is important to note that data for patient 18 (17 years of age at the time of the scan) were compared with reference values for 15-year-old children due to the unavailability of reference values for older children. In this cohort, APD was significantly smaller, with a mean Z-score ± standard deviation of −1.16 ± 1.17 (p = 0.0144). Similarly, ST and BT were significantly decreased, with Z-score means of −0.98 ± 0.82 (p = 0.0034) and −1.18 ± 0.63 (p < 0.0001), respectively. While FOD also appeared somewhat smaller, its comparison with reference values did not achieve statistical significance.

Notably, Z-scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean for FOD, APD, and BT in patient 16, and for APD and IT in patient 18 (17 years of age at time of scan) [Fig. 3h], indicating severe corpus callosum dysmorphism. The FOD measurement for patient 14 was also more than two standard deviations below the mean.

Additionally, patients 3, 13, and 15 (5 years of age at the time of the scan) [Fig. 3e] all exhibited larger total white matter tracts.

### Clinical outcome of children with corpus callosum agenesis [^111xm8ZZ]. Pediatric neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a rare congenital brain malformation that can be associated with other cerebral malformations and/or underlying genetic causes. Prenatal counseling is hampered due to the lack of reliable long-term data on neurodevelopmental outcome.
- **Methods**: Since 2010, a total of 23 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum (mean age 3.8 years, range 0.7 to 9.7 years) were registered in our ACC outpatient clinic and diagnosed in a standardized manner; the data were analyzed retrospectively. Prenatal and postnatal imaging, associated malformations, genetic and clinical findings, and psychological testing (Bayley Scales, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children II, Snijders-Oomen Non-verbal Test, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale I-III) were included. The clinical outcome was classified as "normal" (intelligence quotient 85 to 115, unremarkable motor skills), "moderate developmental delay" (intelligence quotient 70 to 85, mild motor abnormalities), and "severe developmental delay" (intelligence quotient less than 70, severe movement disorder).
- **Results**: Isolated corpus callosum malformation was diagnosed in 15 of 23 (65%), associated cerebral malformations in four of 23 (17%), and associated cerebral malformations plus intracranial cyst in four of 23 (17%) children. Prenatal diagnosis changed in nine of 23 (39%) cases. Overall, a normal outcome or moderate or severe developmental delay was present in 15 of 23 (65%) or five of 23 (22%) or three of 23 (13%) children, respectively. Also, six of eight children with associated cerebral malformations had a normal outcome.

### Outcome of prenatally diagnosed agenesis of the corpus callosum [^115LyFvC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate the natural history, associated abnormalities, and outcomes in fetuses diagnosed prenatally with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), a retrospective study was conducted. This study included all cases of prenatally detected ACC in patients referred to two tertiary units between January 1993 and October 2003. Associated abnormalities, pregnancy outcomes, and infant follow-up data were recorded.

ACC was diagnosed in 117 cases. In 82 cases (70%), there were other fetal structural (n = 49) or chromosomal abnormalities (n = 33) present. ACC was classified as an isolated prenatal finding in 35 cases (30%). Assuming normal development in all cases lost to follow-up, significant developmental delay was present in 36% (95% CI, 15–65%) of isolated ACC cases. Furthermore, developmental delay was present in all cases with ventriculomegaly of at least 15 mm and in one of four cases with ventricular measurements less than 15 mm.

The outcome of prenatally detected ACC is mainly dependent on the presence or absence of associated anomalies. A full assessment of fetal ACC requires karyotyping, MRI, and a search for more subtle ultrasound features of certain genetic syndromes. In this series, at least 36% (95% CI, 15–65%) of cases with isolated ACC exhibited significant developmental delay when assessed postnatally.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum and Aicardi syndrome: A neuroimaging and clinical comparison [^116om8nk]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum can occur in individuals with epilepsy, either in isolation or as part of various neurological conditions such as Aicardi syndrome. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and neuroradiological differences between children with nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum and those with Aicardi syndrome.
- **Methods**: We evaluated 31 children with epilepsy and agenesis of the corpus callosum (11 males, 20 females), 14 of whom had Aicardi syndrome (all females). We compared their clinical evaluations, radiological and electrophysiological findings, treatments, and outcomes.
- **Results**: The median age at seizure onset was lower in the Aicardi syndrome group compared with nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum (two versus five months, P = 0.006). The developmental impairment in terms of verbalization and ambulation was significantly worse in patients with Aicardi syndrome. The severity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and glucose metabolism positron emission tomography (PET) involvement was more extensive in children with Aicardi syndrome than in nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum. In both groups, the PET scan showed a much more extensive area of involvement than suggested by the MRI scan. Four children underwent epilepsy surgery with significant improvement but were not seizure free. The outcome was worse in those with PET showing abnormalities in the nonsurgical hemisphere despite normal appearance on MRI. All children who did not undergo surgery also continued to have seizures at last follow-up.
- **Conclusions**: Children with Aicardi syndrome show more severe clinical and radiological findings compared to those with nonsyndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum, and the outcome is generally poorer.

### Hallermann-Streiff syndrome associated with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum [^115ySFby]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is a rare clinical entity with unknown etiology characterized by a birdlike face, microphthalmia, a beaked nose, hypotrichosis, and proportional small stature. We present a case of a 4-year-old boy in whom magnetic resonance imaging showed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, a finding not previously reported in the literature.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum with interhemispheric cyst: Clinical implications and outcome [^115cFWn4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We describe two cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) with interhemispheric cyst (IHC).
- **Case 1**: A male infant was born at 36 weeks gestation with a history of second-trimester fetal ultrasound (US) scan and MRI showing ACC with IHC. His head circumference at birth and at 5 months was at the 90th percentile. He developed infantile spasms, and an electroencephalogram showed hypsarrhythmia at 5 months of age. Seizures were controlled, and he is under evaluation for surgical treatment.
- **Case 2**: ACC with a midline cyst was reported in the mid-trimester US scan of another male infant. Subsequent fetal scans showed an increasing size of the cyst. At birth, he had macrocephaly with a head circumference above the 97th percentile. MRI of the brain confirmed ACC with IHC. The parents refused a cystoperitoneal shunt. The child displayed gross neurodevelopmental delay with progressive hydrocephalus on follow-up and succumbed to aspiration pneumonia at 22 months of age.

### Both rare and de novo copy number variants are prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum but not in cerebellar hypoplasia or polymicrogyria [^117A77RF]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Given the co-occurrence of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and autism in numerous prior reports, we asked whether copy number variants (CNVs) observed in ACC and those in autism overlapped, meaning that at least 50% of the genes in autism CNVs were also found in ACC CNVs. De novo CNVs in autism were compiled from several studies and are listed in Table S6. We found that 13 out of 34 (38.24%) de novo CNVs, but only 5 out of 66 (7.58%) inherited CNVs in ACC patients, overlapped with de novo CNVs reported in autism (p = 3.06×10⁻⁴; OR = 7.55; 95% CI = 2.40–23.72). The observed overlap may partly be explained by the co-occurrence of autism in our ACC cohort, as 47 out of 172 (27.3%) ACC patients evaluated were diagnosed with this condition, as detailed in Table S7, and partly by the presence of a shared genetic risk between ACC and autism.

### Kidins220 variant associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and aqueduct stenosis [^115wNvA8]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

- **What's already known about this topic**: Aberrant expression of KIDINS220 has been associated postnatally with neurodevelopment abnormalities and SINO syndrome. Most individuals with SINO syndrome present postnatally with macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly. Prenatal presentation and neuropathological findings are rarely reported.
- **What does this study add**: We report a case with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, aqueduct stenosis, and dilation of the anterior horns secondary to a de novo, likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in KIDINS220. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prenatal report of these brain anomalies associated with the KIDINS220 variant.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^114JL9jU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is a hypoechoic structure located between the cavum septi pellucidum and the cingulate gyrus. It can be visualized in the cranial sagittal section between 18 and 20 weeks of gestation and reaches its final form by 20 weeks. In the literature, the mean detection time of corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) ranges from 22 to 24 weeks; the median detection time in our study was 21 weeks, which is consistent with existing literature. The incidence of CCA varies widely in literature, between 0.5 and 70 per 10,000, but was calculated as 19 per 10,000 in our study. This variation in reported incidence rates may be due to differences in prenatal diagnosis and termination rates, the failure to diagnose mild or asymptomatic cases postnatally, variations in study methodologies, and differences in study population characteristics. The incidence of CCA, although within the reported range, is indeed low, possibly because our patient population is largely unselected.

Fetal MRI is a valuable tool for assessing CCA following a suspected diagnosis is confirmed through antenatal ultrasound. Additional central nervous system (CNS) anomalies are detected on MRI in 20% of isolated CCA cases identified by ultrasound. In our series, 66% (20/30) of patients underwent antenatal MRI evaluation. An additional cranial anomaly was detected in three patients (15%): the absence of CSP was observed in two patients, and septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) was detected in one patient. Additionally, postnatal MRI evaluation was performed in several cases.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^1141xrna]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Thirteen (43%) of 30 fetuses with corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) were terminated. Three (23%) of the terminated pregnancies were partial CCA, and 10 (77%) were complete CCA. In addition, three of these fetuses were isolated CCA, while 10 (77%) were non-isolated CCA, with six having additional cranial anomalies and four having extracranial anomalies. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in two of them through antenatal karyotyping.

- **Case 1**: A fetus presenting with tetralogy of Fallot, cleft palate-lip, single umbilical artery, and vermian agenesis was diagnosed with trisomy 13 through amniocentesis.
- **Case 2**: Another fetus with alobar holoprosencephaly, aortic stenosis, and polydactyly was confirmed to have trisomy 13 via amniocentesis. This pregnancy was carried to 28 weeks of gestation; however, the patient declined termination, resulting in intrauterine fetal death. Additionally, a fetus with absence of the cavum septum pellucidum, suspicion of septo-optic dysplasia, and partial CCA experienced placental abruption, leading to fetal demise at 28 weeks of gestation.

The number of children followed up postnatally was 14, with a median follow-up period of 62 months (minimum: 28 months, maximum: 120 months). Among these 14 children, five (35.7%) had normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. These five patients were all isolated CCA, with two being partial CCA and three being complete CCA. The neurodevelopmental outcomes, including motor development delay, cognitive development de…

### Screening performance for callosal agenesis in prenatal life. Single center study [^112zhfHG]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The study aimed to analyze the screening performance of the second trimester scan for agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), evaluate the agreement between ultrasound and MRI, and compare prenatal and postnatal diagnoses. This prospective observational study involved referring all patients with fetuses suspected of ACC to prenatal MRI (pMRI).

The results indicated that one case was not confirmed by pMRI with the initial diagnosis of ACC. This particular case exhibited partial ACC in neonatal MRI (nMRI). The study concluded that the second trimester scan for callosal agenesis demonstrated a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 99%. Both prenatal MRI and ultrasound showed a similar number of misdiagnoses.

### Outcomes associated with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum: A meta-analysis [^112ofNxC]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

Antenatal counseling in cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is challenging. The objective of this study was to ascertain the outcome in fetuses with isolated complete ACC and partial ACC. The data sources used were Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases.

Studies selected reported a prenatal diagnosis of ACC. The outcomes observed included chromosomal abnormalities at standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis, additional anomalies detected only at prenatal MRI and at postnatal imaging or clinical evaluation, concordance between prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, and neurodevelopmental outcome.

Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data. Twenty-seven studies were included. In cases of complete ACC (cACC), chromosomal anomalies occurred in 4.81% (95% confidence interval, 2.2–8.4) of the cases. Gross and fine motor control were abnormal in 4.40% (95% CI, 0.6–11.3) and 10.98% (95% CI, 4.1–20.6) of the cases, respectively, whereas 6.80% (95% CI, 1.7–14.9) presented with epilepsy. Abnormal cognitive status occurred in 15.16% (95% CI, 6.9–25.9) of cases.

In cases of partial ACC, the rate of chromosomal anomalies was 7.45% (95% CI, 2.0–15.9). Fine motor control was affected in 11.74% (95% CI, 0.9–32.1) of the cases, and 16.11% (95% CI, 2.5–38.2) presented with epilepsy. Cognitive status was affected in 17.25% (95% CI, 3.0–39.7) of cases.

However, the study has limitations due to the different neurodevelopmental tools and time of follow-up of the included studies. The conclusions indicate that children with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated ACC show several degrees of impairment in motor control and cognitive status.

### Monozygotic twins with trisomy 21 and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum [^111mNQJa]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Trisomy 21 is the most common viable trisomy. Although it is invariably associated with mild to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, no gross central nervous system malformation has been consistently identified in individuals with trisomy 21. We present the case of a monozygotic twin pregnancy in which both fetuses were identified as having trisomy 21 and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. We discuss this rare association in the context of an emerging understanding of the neurobiology of trisomy 21.

### Clinical and diagnostic profile of agenesis of the corpus callosum [^117VhEnt]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

This study reports the clinical profile, etiologies identified, and outcomes for a consecutive series of children with partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified in a comprehensive computerized database of all patients seen in a single pediatric neurology practice over an 11-year interval. Medical records were then systematically reviewed. Twenty-four children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified out of a total of 6911 children in the database (0.35%). Fifteen were male (62.5%); 9 (37.5%) had presented antenatally, 6 (25%) neonatally, and 9 (37.5%) postneonatally.

Eight (33.3%) were microcephalic, 12 (50%) were dysmorphic, 11 (45.8%) had coexisting epilepsy, and 9 (37.5%) had a cerebral palsy variant. Investigations revealed an etiology in 11 (45.8%): 3 chromosomal abnormality, 3 metabolic disorder, 3 cerebral dysgenesis, and 2 genetic syndromes (Aicardi, Andermann). Outcomes identified included normal or mild developmental delay in 7 (29.2%) and moderate-severe developmental delay in the remaining 17 (70.8%).

Factors predictive of successful etiologic determination on bivariate analysis included moderate-severe developmental delay or associated cerebral dysgenesis. Factors predictive of eventual developmental outcome included microcephaly, coexisting epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or cerebral dysgenesis. A spectrum of clinical presentations, underlying etiology, and developmental outcome is thus apparent in children with agenesis of the corpus callosum.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how [^1111Hj4b]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The number of studies reporting long-term outcomes of high-risk children is rapidly increasing. However, the methods of these follow-up studies vary widely, with variability arising from inclusion criteria, timing of assessments, outcome measures, and the use of appropriate control groups. As a result, it is difficult to compare the results of published studies or to aggregate the data to provide more certainty around the rates of some important outcomes. Outcome statistics are needed for counseling families and guiding practitioners who follow high-risk groups to understand what outcomes can be expected and at what ages specific problems may emerge. This information can also be linked to evidence-based pathways to help families access management resources.

While it is widely accepted that high-risk infants need close monitoring and surveillance, a framework for this practice has only infrequently been developed; for example, in one instance for a selected group of infants over the first five years of life. A framework could be useful for informing clinical follow-up programs, assist longitudinal research with high-risk infants, and help improve the uniformity of follow-up time-points and measures. The aim of this report is to provide a framework for identifying which children need specialized follow-up, what outcomes should or could be of interest, and how, where, and when follow-up should be conducted.

### Both rare and de novo copy number variants are prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum but not in cerebellar hypoplasia or polymicrogyria [^113wyw2P]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Overcoming the limitations of prior studies, we analyzed genic CNVs in 545 patients with one or more of these three common brain malformations and in 2,349 control individuals. We hypothesized that these patients have a higher genome-wide burden of large rare genic CNVs than controls and that a significant percentage of them have large de novo likely pathogenic CNVs, including both novel and previously reported intervals. We further anticipated that many of the de novo CNVs would be sub-microscopic (less than 4 megabases [Mb]), demonstrating a larger disease burden for CNVs than previously seen through cytogenetic approaches.

### Behavior and corpus callosum morphology relationships in velocardiofacial syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) [^115MqcEZ]. Psychiatry research (2005). Low credibility.

Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2 that predisposes affected individuals to learning disabilities and psychiatric conditions. Previous research has indicated that compared with comparison children, children with VCFS have larger corpus callosal areas. Children with VCFS are often diagnosed with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and previous research has indicated that children with ADHD often have smaller corpus callosal areas than controls. The present study investigated two hypotheses: children with VCFS would have larger callosal areas than controls, and children with VCFS+ADHD would have smaller callosal areas than children with VCFS. Corpus callosum area was obtained from the mid-sagittal slice and was assessed in children with VCFS (n = 60) and age- and gender-matched control participants (n = 52). Results indicated that all of the corpus callosum measures were significantly different between the two groups except for the genu. Across all measures, children with VCFS demonstrated a larger corpus callosum area. Within the VCFS sample, children with VCFS+ADHD (n = 30) had smaller total callosal, splenium, and genu areas than children with VCFS alone. Although children with VCFS+ADHD had smaller total callosal areas than children with VCFS, relative to control participants, these children had larger total callosal and subregion areas except for the genu. In addition to other anatomic anomalies, corpus callosal abnormalities appear to be another variable to consider when analy

### Adaptive functioning development in infants with agenesis of the corpus callosum [^116cJtAS]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a common congenital brain malformation. Early development in infants with ACC remains largely unexamined, despite the increased likelihood of developmental delays and autistic behaviors. This study compares adaptive functioning in infants and toddlers with isolated ACC to children with other neurodevelopmental conditions and typical development.
- **Methods**: Parents of children with ACC completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Interview at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Comparison groups included children with fragile X, Down syndrome, high familial likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), both with and without an ASD diagnosis, and typical development (total n = 957; total assessments = 2676).
- **Results**: By 24 months, 29% of children with ACC were delayed in at least one domain. Linear mixed effect models showed significant group-time interactions in all domains. Post-hoc comparisons revealed the ACC group had poorer performance in communication by 6 months, motor skills by 12 months, and daily living skills by 18 months. However, their socialization was equivalent compared to typically developing children. The ACC group exhibited stronger skills across most domains and time points compared to genetic groups. They demonstrated equivalent communication skills, stronger socialization, and weaker motor skills compared to the autism group.
- **Conclusions**: Although there is significant variability, on average, ACC compromises communication skills by 6 months, with reduced motor and daily living skills by 12 and 18 months, respectively. Multipronged intervention programs are recommended for addressing these developmental challenges.

### Child neurology: Functional reorganization mediating supplementary motor area syndrome recovery in agenesis of the corpus callosum [^112sb3jU]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is a typically transient condition resulting from damage to the medial premotor cortex. The exact mechanism of recovery remains unknown but is traditionally described as a process involving functional compensation by the contralateral SMA through corpus callosal fibers.

The purpose of this case study is to highlight a distinct extracallosal mechanism of functional recovery from an SMA syndrome in a patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). We present the clinical presentation and perioperative functional neuroimaging features of a 16-year-old patient with complete ACC who exhibited recovery from an SMA syndrome resulting from surgical resection of a right-sided low-grade glioma. Preoperative fMRI revealed anatomically concordant activation areas during finger and toe tapping tasks bilaterally.

Three months after surgery, the patient had fully recovered, and a repeat fMRI revealed a shift of the majority of the left toe tapping area from the expected contralateral hemisphere to the ipsilateral left paracentral lobule and SMA. The fMRI signal remodeling observed in this acallosal patient suggests that within-hemisphere plasticity of the healthy hemisphere may constitute an alternative critical process in SMA syndrome resolution and challenges the traditional view that transcallosal fibers are necessary for functional recovery.

### Corpus callosum long-term biometry in very preterm children related to cognitive and motor outcomes [^112BfoYQ]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is suggested as an indirect biomarker of white matter volume, which is often affected in preterm birth. However, diagnosing mild white matter injury is challenging.
- **Methods**: We studied 124 children born preterm (mean age: 8.4 ± 1.1 years), using MRI to assess CC measurements and cognitive/motor outcomes based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WPPSI-V) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2).
- **Results**: Children with normal outcomes exhibited greater height (10.2 ± 2.1mm vs. 9.4 ± 2.3mm; p = 0.01), fractional anisotropy at splenium (895 [680–1000] vs. 860.5 [342–1000]), and total CC length (69.1 ± 4.8mm vs. 67.3 ± 5.1mm; p = 0.02) compared to those with adverse outcomes. All measured CC areas were smaller in the adverse outcome group. Models incorporating posterior CC measurements demonstrated the highest specificity (83.3% Sp, AUC: 0.65) for predicting neurological outcomes. CC length and splenium height were the only linear measurements associated with manual dexterity and total MABC-2 score, while both the latter and genu were related to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient.
- **Conclusions**: CC biometry in children born very preterm at school-age is associated with outcomes and exhibits a specific subregion alteration pattern. The posterior CC may serve as an important neurodevelopmental biomarker in very preterm infants.
- **Impact**: The corpus callosum has the potential to serve as a reliable and easily measurable biomarker of white matter integrity in very preterm children. Estimating diffuse white matter injury in preterm infants is critical for predicting long-term outcomes.

### Retrospective analysis of the prognostic factors of fetal corpus callosum dysplasia [^113tN9yt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

To analyze the genetic characteristics and long-term outcomes of fetuses with dysplasia of the corpus callosum (DCC) or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (PACC), a study was conducted.

Methods: A total of 42 fetuses with DCC (n = 36) or PACC (n = 6) were retrospectively analyzed from January 2016 to December 2022 at the Peking University First Hospital. The cohort was categorized into isolated (15/42, 36%) and nonisolated groups (27/42, 64%), and differences in the genetic abnormalities and long-term outcomes between the two groups were analyzed. DCC was subdivided into short CC, thin CC, and thick CC. The outcomes of the three different types of DCC were analyzed and discussed.

Results:

- **Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA)**: Thirty-nine of the 42 cases underwent CMA and CMA+WES (whole exome sequencing), with 13/15 cases in the isolated group and 26/27 cases in the nonisolated group. Only pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were considered, identifying P/LP variants in 2/13 cases in the isolated group and 12/26 cases in the nonisolated group. There was no significant difference between the two groups (χ² = 3.566, P = 0.05897).
- **Outcomes in the isolated group**: Eight cases were terminated, and seven cases were delivered. Postnatal follow-up detected one case of gross motor development delay one year after birth; no obvious abnormalities were found in the other six cases.
- **Outcomes in the nonisolated group**: Twenty-one cases were terminated, and six cases were delivered. Postnatal follow-up detected four cases of children with different degrees of language, motor, and intelligence abnormalities; one case died 10 days after birth.

### Prevalence of corpus callosum pathology in an unselected population. Should assessment of the corpus callosum be included in the routine 20 weeks scan [^116PBPup]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prevalence of abnormalities of the corpus callosum (AbnCC) in a non-selected population, propose a systematic screening protocol for AbnCC in all populations through direct assessment, and describe the follow-up and prognosis of all AbnCC cases diagnosed in our clinical setting.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of the prevalence of AbnCC over 11 years. We included a sagittal assessment of the corpus callosum (CC) in the second-trimester scan. AbnCC was classified into complete agenesis of CC (ACC) and dysgenesis of CC (DCC; including small, partial agenesis, thick, and with lipoma).

- **Results**: Of the 38,586 second-trimester scans performed during our screening, 43 cases of AbnCC were detected, resulting in a prevalence of 0.8/1000. Of the AbnCC cases, 10 cases were identified as ACC (29.40%) and 24 as DCC (70.59%). Follow-up investigations showed that in the 43 cases with AbnCC, 76.5% had other associated ultrasound abnormalities, 26.5% had genetic abnormalities, 11.8% had other MRI abnormalities, and 25% of the children had neurodevelopmental delays (8.8% of the total), which were severe in only one case.

- **Conclusions**: AbnCC is found in approximately 0.8/1000 of cases in an unselected population. The findings suggest that systematic and direct assessment of the CC as part of the screening ultrasound in the second trimester of gestation should be recommended as a routine practice.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^116eYuuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

We aimed to review the corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) cases diagnosed and managed in our university to contribute to the literature about this antenatally diagnosed fetal cranial anomaly by revealing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of CCA.
- **Methods**: This retrospective and cross-sectional study examined CCA detected in our clinic between 2012 and 2021. Genetic results, accompanying additional anomalies, termination, and perinatal mortality rates were also calculated. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were revealed by investigating motor development, cognitive development, behavioral disorder, speech delay, personal-social backwardness, and epilepsy in cases of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA in the postnatal period.
- **Results**: Data from 30 fetuses were evaluated during the study. The number of isolated CCA and non-isolated CCA cases is 11 (37.5%) and 19 (62.5%), respectively, and the number of partial CCA and complete CCA cases is 8 (26%) and 22 (74%), respectively. Among the 30 fetuses, the numbers of live births, chromosomal anomalies, perinatal mortalities, and terminations were found to be 14 (47%), 3 (10%), 3 (10%), and 13 (43%), respectively. Postnatal evaluation was performed in 14 children, and normal neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed in 5 (35.7%). All these children were from the isolated CCA group. Additionally, poor neurodevelopmental outcome was detected in 37.5% of isolated CCA.
- **Conclusion**: If CCA is detected in the fetus, additional ultrasonographic anomaly and genetic examination should be performed to differentiate isolated CCA from non-isolated CCA.

### Retrospective analysis of the prognostic factors of fetal corpus callosum dysplasia [^113EJohh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

The incidence of abnormalities of the corpus callosum (CC) is approximately 1.8 per 100,000 in the general population and 230–600 per 100,000 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The long-term outcomes of fetuses with abnormalities of the CC are mainly related to the etiology of the condition and whether abnormalities of the CC appear isolated on imaging.

The prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the CC (ACC) has been comprehensively described. Approximately two-thirds of children with isolated complete agenesis of the CC (CACC) have good developmental outcomes, but these children may have different degrees of defects that become more obvious between 10 and 20 years of age and include neuropsychological disorders and behavioral disorders. Children with partial agenesis of the CC (PACC) or nonisolated ACC have worse later-life prognoses. However, there is limited information on short, thin, or thick CCs. The wide range of neurodevelopmental presentations associated with ACC indicates the necessity of accurate assessment and diagnosis of fetuses to better inform prenatal counseling.

In this study, we classified short, thin, and thick CCs as DCCs and retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, pregnancy outcomes, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with antenatal diagnoses of PACC and DCC in our center. Factors influencing fetal CC abnormalities were also analyzed. These data provide evidence for the clinical consultation and management of fetal PACC and DCC.

### A large cohort study of prenatal exome sequencing redefines diagnosis in fetal corpus callosum anomalies [^116EwagB]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

Anomalies of the corpus callosum (AnCC) are congenital malformations associated with highly variable neurodevelopmental outcomes. We performed prenatal exome sequencing (pES) on a cohort of 352 fetuses diagnosed with AnCC, analyzing the diagnostic yield, the implicated genes based on the type of anomaly (partial or complete agenesis, short corpus callosum, or callosal dysgenesis), and assessing the impact on pregnancy outcomes.

The overall diagnostic yield of pES was 23%, with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in 49 different genes, most of which linked to intellectual developmental disorders. The highest diagnostic yield (46%) was observed in fetuses with callosal dysgenesis. Notably, in cases of corpus callosum agenesis, variants in the DCC gene were the most frequently identified etiology (3.2%, n = 9), associated with a favorable neurodevelopmental outcome. All couples with a fetal DCC variant decided to continue the pregnancy to term. In contrast, 73% of couples with other genetic diagnoses chose pregnancy termination, compared to 17% in cases without a genetic diagnosis.

pES provides essential prognosis information that supports prenatal decision-making and care. The identification of genes associated with favorable outcomes, along with the integration of pES into prenatal diagnosis, enhances informed decision-making for parents and improves the clinical management of AnCC.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^1174pJkH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In a study including pregnancies with 127 cases of corpus callosum agenesis (CCA), termination, intrauterine death, and live birth rates were found to be 31%, 3%, and 66%, respectively. In our study, we found the termination, intrauterine death, and live birth rates to be 43%, 10%, and 47%, respectively. Consistent with the literature, 77% (10/13) of the cases that were terminated were non-isolated CCA. Three families with isolated CCA chose termination due to concerns about a poor outcome. The high number of patients opting for termination even in isolated cases contributes to our termination rate being higher compared to the literature. At the same time, intrauterine death in cases involving genetic and multiple system abnormalities has reduced our live birth rate.

Although CCA diagnosis rates have increased with the development of prenatal imaging methods, prenatal counseling remains challenging. Neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CCA vary even among individuals with similar characteristics, such as type of CCA (complete or partial), isolated versus syndromic cases, similar chromosomal or genetic mutations, and similar fetal MRI or ultrasound findings. Motor delay, cognitive retardation, behavioral disorders, epilepsy, and social and language disorders are the most common symptoms. In a review of isolated corpus callosum agenesis, a normal neurodevelopmental outcome was found in 75% of cases. Although the number of patients whose postnatal outcomes were evaluated in our study was small, normal neurological outcomes were detected in 62% of patients with isolated CCA.

### Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum [^113gDiiy]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum (OMIM 218000) is an autosomal recessive disease of early onset. It is characterized by a delay in developmental milestones, severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy with areflexia, a variable degree of agenesis of the corpus callosum, amyotrophy, hypotonia, and cognitive impairment. Although this disorder has rarely been reported worldwide, it has a high prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of the province of Quebec, Canada, predominantly due to a founder effect.

The gene defect responsible for this disorder has recently been identified. It is a protein-truncating mutation in the SLC12A6 gene, which codes for a cotransporter protein known as KCC3. Herein, we provide the first extensive review of this disorder, covering epidemiological, clinical, and molecular genetic studies.

### Clinical outcomes following prenatal diagnosis of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and callosal dysgenesis (AVID) [^117PaFfG]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

When identified prenatally, the imaging triad of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, interhemispheric cyst, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (AVID) can indicate a more serious congenital brain anomaly. In this follow-up series of 15 fetuses, we present the neurodevelopmental outcomes of a single institution cohort of children diagnosed prenatally with AVID.

Our fetal ultrasound database was queried for cases of AVID between 2000 and 2016. All available fetal MR imaging studies were reviewed for the presence of interhemispheric cysts or ventricular diverticula, and dysgenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Clinical records were reviewed for perinatal management, postnatal surgical management, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Fifteen prenatal cases of AVID were identified. Twelve were live-born, and three pregnancies were terminated. Of the 12 patients, 11 underwent neurosurgical intervention. Of the eight patients surviving past infancy, seven of eight have moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delays or disabilities, encompassing both motor and language skills, and all have variable visual abnormalities.

In our cohort of 15 prenatally diagnosed fetuses with AVID, eight survived past infancy and all have neurodevelopmental disabilities, including motor and language deficits, a wide range of visual defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and medical comorbidities.

### Prenatal diagnosis of Aicardi syndrome based on a suggestive imaging pattern: A multicenter case-series [^111NRbrU]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

**Agenesis of the corpus callosum**: ACC was diagnosed in all cases except one (19/20, 95% [Figures 1 and 2]), demonstrated as complete or partial in 17 and 2 cases, respectively. The splenium was involved in Case 6, and the genu and rostrum in Case 3. Discordance between ultrasound and MRI was observed in three cases: Case 3 showed partial agenesis versus complete agenesis, Case 6 showed partial agenesis versus a complete corpus callosum, and Case 16 showed complete agenesis versus a complete corpus callosum. These discrepancies were mainly related to difficulties in midline analysis due to the mass effect of interhemispheric cysts. Identification of Probst bundles associated with ACC was demonstrated when DTI sequences were used (Cases 2, 11, and 18).

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^111mNmCi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is the most prominent white matter pathway connecting the brain hemispheres. This connection, consisting of nearly 200 million axons, is involved in many cognitive functions, including language, reasoning, and integration of sensory information. The CC consists of four parts from front to back: rostrum, genu, body, and splenium. Corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) is one of the most common cortical malformations. The incidence of CCA is 0.018% in live births, 2.3% among children with neurodevelopmental retardation, and 0.0053% in autopsy series.

Intellectual disability, motor and cognitive development delay, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, and social and language problems are the most common neurodevelopmental problems in children diagnosed with CCA. The severity of these problems depends on additional anomalies associated with CCA and accompanying genetic syndromes. In cases of CCA detected antenatally, revealing the cause or related anomalies may provide counseling about the long-term postnatal outcomes of the children. However, even in cases of isolated CCA, there is heterogeneity regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes. Providing counseling to pregnant women diagnosed with CCA becomes quite complicated. This complexity arises due to the use of subjective tests in outcome assessment and reporting, bias in patient selection, study design, length of follow-up, lack of control groups, and variable definitions. Families may choose termination, especially in cases with genetic disorders or additional ultrasound findings accompanying CCA with a poor prognosis.

### Child neurology: Functional reorganization mediating supplementary motor area syndrome recovery in agenesis of the corpus callosum [^116vYZQs]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The recovery observed in the patient without a corpus callosum suggests that alternative pathophysiologic processes may be implicated in functional remodeling. Before surgery, our patient did not exhibit SMA activation during motor tasks, a finding that is consistent with previous studies. After surgery, the left toe tapping area was mainly detected in the left paracentral lobule and SMA, suggesting the transfer of function to the contralateral side. The unexpected left-sided SMA activation induced by left toe tapping suggests the presence of extracallosal within-hemisphere processes in functional reorganization, which may have resulted from a compensatory increase in activation from a previously undetected blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal. This idea is consistent with previous fMRI studies in patients with an intact corpus callosum, which revealed a similar pattern of SMA activation ipsilateral to limb movements after surgery.

Indeed, few studies have reported an increase in intrahemispheric functional connectivity between sensorimotor nodes of the healthy hemisphere during SMA recovery. Furthermore, unilateral motor movements have been shown to be represented bilaterally in the SMA but exhibit contralateral predominance. Thus, unilateral SMA damage may uncover a functionally silent, albeit present, network in the uninjured contralateral SMA, capable of supplanting the function of the injured cortex. This process may be facilitated by plastic functional changes within the contralateral intact hemisphere.

The study provides unique information regarding a distinct mechanism of recovery.

### Exome sequencing identifies recessive CDK5RAP2 variants in patients with isolated agenesis of corpus callosum [^114vASap]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a common brain malformation observed either as an isolated condition or as part of numerous congenital syndromes. Cognitive and neurological involvements in patients with ACC are variable, ranging from mild linguistic and behavioral impairments to more severe neurological deficits. At the time of writing, the underlying genetic causes of isolated ACC remain elusive, and causative genes have yet to be identified.

We performed exome sequencing on three acallosal siblings from the same non-consanguineous family and identified compound heterozygous variants, p [Gly94Arg];[Asn1232Ser], in the protein encoded by the CDK5RAP2 gene, also known as MCPH3, a gene previously reported to cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Our findings suggest a novel role for this gene in the pathogenesis of isolated ACC.

Macrocerebellum, a neuroradiological and clinical entity of unknown etiology characterized by an isolated, disproportionately large cerebellum, has at the time of writing been reported in only a few cases. It has been suggested that the condition could represent a marker for disturbed cerebral development; however, longitudinal reports are lacking. We describe a 19-month-old patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum who developed enlargement of the cerebellum without clinical signs of cerebellar impairment, a picture that has not been previously described.

### Callosal agenesis and congenital mirror movements: Outcomes associated with DCC mutations [^117VmAkK]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Pathogenic variants in the gene encoding deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) are the first genetic cause of isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Here we present the detailed neurological, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological characteristics of 12 individuals from three families with pathogenic variants in DCC (aged 8–50 years), who showed ACC and mirror movements (n = 5), mirror movements only (n = 2), ACC only (n = 3), or neither ACC nor mirror movements (n = 2). There was heterogeneity in the neurological and neuroimaging features on brain MRI, and performance across neuropsychological domains ranged from extremely low (impaired) to within normal limits (average). Our findings show that ACC and/or mirror movements are associated with low functioning in select neuropsychological domains and that a DCC pathogenic variant alone is not sufficient to explain the disability.
- **What this paper adds**: Neuropsychological impairment severity is related to the presence of mirror movements and/or agenesis of the corpus callosum. A DCC pathogenic variant in isolation is associated with the best prognosis.

### Isolated corpus callosum agenesis: A ten-year follow-up after prenatal diagnosis (How are the children without corpus callosum at 10 years of age?) [^117WuC6z]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2012). Low credibility.

Corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) is generally diagnosed in utero. The outcome appears to be better if the malformation is isolated. The aim of this study, which is the first with a long (10 years) and standardized follow-up, was to report the cognitive abilities of children with isolated CCA diagnosed prenatally.
- **Methods**: We prospectively evaluated 17 children. Clinical examinations and neuropsychological tests were performed each year. School achievement, as well as personal and familial data, were collected.
- **Results**: Twelve children completed the entire follow-up. One child was eventually considered to have associated CCA because signs of fetal alcohol syndrome had become evident. Of the 11 other children, three (27%) had borderline intelligence, whereas the intelligence levels of eight (73%) were within the normal range, although half of these children experienced some difficulties in scholastic achievement. Neither epilepsy nor intellectual deficiency was noted, and intellectual quotient scores correlated strongly with the mother's education level.
- **Conclusion**: Although prenatal diagnosis of isolated CCA is reliable, false postnatal diagnoses remain possible (10–20%) even with complete prenatal screening. The outcome is mostly favorable because intelligence is within the normal range for nearly three-quarters of the children. However, they frequently have mild learning difficulties.

### How should antenatal counseling be given to parents in the fetal corpus callosum agenesis [^1154SQDM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Since prenatal and postnatal outcomes are poor in non-isolated cases of corpus callosum agenesis (CCA), termination of pregnancy may be recommended to the family. However, given the considerable heterogeneity in outcome measures, follow-up time, and neurodevelopmental tools used, extensive prospective studies are needed to determine the occurrence of neurodevelopmental morbidity in children with isolated CCA.

Our research had some limitations as a retrospective study. The fact that 26% of our CCA cases do not have pregnancy follow-up and the remaining 43% are terminated has significantly reduced the number of our cases. In addition, since neurodevelopmental evaluation varies according to age, postnatal results may not fully reflect neurodevelopmental delay. The main limitations are that genetic testing is limited, and patients' neurodevelopmental status may vary depending on prenatal CCA as well as treatment, education, environmental factors, and family structure. The strength of our study is that all patients in the CCA series were diagnosed prenatally and were managed by a multidisciplinary team during pregnancy and postpartum.

### Child neurology: Functional reorganization mediating supplementary motor area syndrome recovery in agenesis of the corpus callosum [^112Vv9F8]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

**Oy-sters**: SMA syndrome should always be considered after medial premotor cortex injury. Even in patients exhibiting profound neurologic deficits, a significant recovery is expected. In patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), recovery from SMA syndrome remains possible through extracallosal compensatory mechanisms. Thus, ACC may not preclude surgical removal of lesions within the SMA.

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis of fetal corpus callosum abnormalities and follow-up analysis [^113rpVyA]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations of fetal corpus callosum abnormalities and discussed their prognosis based on the results of postnatal follow-up.
- **Methods**: One hundred fifty-five fetuses were diagnosed with corpus callosum abnormalities by MRI at our hospital from 2004 to 2019. The Gesell Development Scales were used to evaluate the prognosis of corpus callosum abnormalities after birth.
- **Results**: Corpus callosum abnormalities were diagnosed in 149 fetuses from singleton pregnancies and in 6 pairs of twins, with 1 fetus in each pair having a corpus callosum abnormality. Twenty-seven cases (27/155) were lost to follow-up, whereas 128 cases (128/155) were successfully followed up. Of these, 101 cases resulted in induced labor, while 27 cases underwent natural birth. Among the 27 cases of corpus callosum abnormality identified after birth, 22 cases were from singleton pregnancies (22/27). Moreover, 1 twin from each of 5 pairs of twins (5/27) demonstrated corpus callosum abnormalities. The average Gesell Development Scale score was 87.1 in 19 cases of agenesis of the corpus callosum and 74.9 in 3 cases of hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Among the 5 affected twins, 2 had severe neurodevelopmental delay, 2 had mild neurodevelopmental delay, and 1 was premature and died.
- **Conclusion**: The overall prognosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum is good in singleton pregnancies. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is often observed with other abnormalities, and the developmental quotient of hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is lower compared with agenesis of the corpus callosum.

### Corpus callosum long-term biometry in very preterm children related to cognitive and motor outcomes [^114rfXC2]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is suggested as an indirect biomarker of white matter volume, which is often affected in preterm birth. However, diagnosing mild white matter injury is challenging.
- **Methods**: We studied 124 children born preterm (mean age: 8.4 ± 1.1 years), using MRI to assess CC measurements and cognitive/motor outcomes based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WPPSI-V) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2).
- **Results**: Children with normal outcomes exhibited greater height (10.2 ± 2.1 mm vs. 9.4 ± 2.3 mm; p = 0.01) and fractional anisotropy at the splenium (895[680–1000] vs. 860.5[342–1000]) and total CC length (69.1 ± 4.8 mm vs. 67.3 ± 5.1 mm; p = 0.02) compared to those with adverse outcomes. All measured CC areas were smaller in the adverse outcome group. Models incorporating posterior CC measurements demonstrated the highest specificity (83.3% Sp, AUC: 0.65) for predicting neurological outcomes. CC length and splenium height were the only linear measurements associated with manual dexterity and total MABC-2 score, while both the latter and genu were related to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient.
- **Conclusions**: CC biometry in children born very preterm at school age is associated with outcomes and exhibits a specific subregion alteration pattern. The posterior CC may serve as an important neurodevelopmental biomarker in very preterm infants.
- **Impact**: The corpus callosum has the potential to serve as a reliable and easily measurable biomarker of white matter integrity in very preterm children.

### Agenesis of the corpus callosum: Classifying functional manifestations with the ICF-CY [^1171bvgD]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a congenital condition in which the corpus callosum fails to develop fully. In the literature, ACC has been broadly conceptualized and inconsistently described. This article demonstrates how the universal language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health-Children and Youth (ICF-CY) can increase the specificity with which researchers and clinicians describe the variable manifestations of ACC.
- **Methods**: The database for this article was based on a review of 83 studies on developmental and neuropsychological manifestations of congenital ACC in children and adolescents. First, the extent to which the findings on ACC could be documented using the taxonomic codes in the ICF-CY was examined. Next, the findings from each study were mapped onto the ICF-CY to summarize the distribution of clinical features reported in the literature.
- **Results**: There was a high degree of correspondence between the reported findings and the taxonomic codes of the ICF-CY. The distribution of clinical features was discussed.
- **Conclusions**: This taxonomic application advances the ICF-CY as a common language for researchers and clinicians who work with children who have ACC. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a condition that has been broadly conceptualized and inconsistently described in research and practice. The variable clinical manifestations of children with ACC can be most effectively described using the ICF-CY. The application of the ICF-CY to conditions with highly variable clinical manifestations is emphasized.

### Distinguishing 3 classes of corpus callosal abnormalities in consanguineous families [^1151FWHD]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to create a classification system for pediatric corpus callosal abnormalities (CCA) based upon midline sagittal brain MRI. We used the term CCA for patients with structural variants of the corpus callosum, excluding patients with interhemispheric cyst variant or pure dysplasia without hypoplasia. Currently, no system exists for nonsyndromic forms of CCA, and attempts to create such a system have been hampered by highly variable morphology in patients with sporadic CCA. We reasoned that any useful strategy should classify affected family members within the same type, and that phenotypic variability should be minimized in patients with recessive disease.
- **Methods**: We focused recruitment toward multiplex consanguineous families, ascertained 30 patients from 19 consanguineous families, and analyzed clinical features together with brain imaging.
- **Results**: We identified 3 major CCA classes, including hypoplasia, hypoplasia with dysplasia, and complete agenesis. Affected individuals within a given multiplex family usually displayed the same variant of the class of abnormality and they always displayed the same class of abnormality within each family, or they displayed complete agenesis. The system was validated among a second cohort of 10 sporadic patients with CCA.
- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that complete agenesis may be a common end-phenotype, and implicate multiple overlapping pathways in the etiology of CCA.

### Structural alterations of the corpus callosum in children with infantile hydrocephalus [^112kGR9f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum comprises five subdivisions, each with distinct functional connections. The posterior (splenium) part of the corpus callosum connects visual areas in the occipital lobe, whereas the midposterior (isthmus) part connects fibers of motor, somatosensory, and primary auditory areas. As the central (body) fibers traverse the cerebral cortex, they give rise to the corona radiata and contribute to the formation of various prominent white matter pathways. The midanterior (genu) part of the corpus callosum connects the medial and lateral surfaces of the frontal lobes, whereas the anterior portion (rostrum) serves as a vital bridge linking the orbital surfaces of the frontal lobes.

Understanding the intricacies of corpus callosum microstructure and volume is crucial for comprehending neurodevelopmental and pathologic processes. Microstructure, composed of intricate white matter fibers, holds essential information regarding the structural integrity and connectivity within this neural bridge. Alterations in microstructural properties can provide insights into the underlying changes, shedding light on the adaptability and resilience of the corpus callosum in response to various conditions. Similarly, changes in volume offer a macroscopic view of the structural alterations. One study demonstrated a relationship between brain morphometry and functioning in children treated for hydrocephalus. Results revealed reductions in the size of the corpus callosum in the shunted hydrocephalus group of children aged 6–13 years and a relationship between the corpus callosum and… (text incomplete).

### Both rare and de novo copy number variants are prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum but not in cerebellar hypoplasia or polymicrogyria [^116rTBzR]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

The hypothesis that there would be an enrichment of large de novo CNVs in the patient cohort was also supported for ACC but not CBLH or PMG, as we observed that 9.4% of ACC patients had at least one de novo CNV, with 7.1% having at least one large de novo CNV ≥ 500 kb. As anticipated, almost one-third (34.5%) of all de novo CNVs were sub-microscopic (less than 4 Mb).

Intriguingly, a significant number of de novo, but not inherited, CNVs in ACC overlapped de novo CNVs previously observed in patients with autism. One explanation for this is that our ACC cohort was skewed towards patients who had a developmental disability, including autism, since this was the reason why many of these patients were initially ascertained. From Table S7, which lists four features of developmental disability in all of our ACC patients, only 16 (15.8%) patients out of the 101 patients in whom all four features were evaluated had no developmental impairment. None of the CNVs from these 16 patients overlapped de novo CNVs in autism. Thus, because all ACC patients whose de novo CNVs overlapped de novo autism CNVs had some form of developmental disability, their de novo CNVs may contribute less towards ACC and more towards the developmental disability. Another explanation is that the observed overlap points to a shared genetic risk between ACC and autism for the following reasons. First, it has been shown that there is an overlapping genetic risk among divergent neurological disorders, indicating that, while there may be some unique variants for each class of disorders, there is also a common genetic susceptibility that could explain the observed overlap.

### Pediatric outcome of children with the prenatal diagnosis of isolated septal agenesis [^117Jy5A7]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Isolated septal agenesis (SA) is a rare disease with clinical outcomes, particularly neurological outcomes, that are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of these children.
- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of 17 children with isolated SA or SA combined with moderate ventricular dilatation (VD) that was diagnosed antenatally and confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the antenatal period.
- **Results**: Of the 17 children, 14 had normal neurological examinations, 2 had language development delay and visuo-spatial dyspraxia, and 3 of the 17 children had behavioral problems. Eight children had neuropsychological evaluations, and the results were normal in six cases. There were 3 cases of septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) diagnosed postnatally, which highlighted the difficulties in assessing the optic tract and hypothalamic-pituitary region in antenatal imaging. Language delay and behavioral disorders were the main abnormalities at follow-up.
- **Conclusion**: The discovery of an isolated SA reveals the difficulties of prenatal diagnosis to correlate the neurological and functional prognosis to morphological findings. The prognosis seemed to be good. It appears necessary to improve the diagnostic performance of fetal brain imaging and to follow up these children prospectively to assess their long-term cognitive-behavioral outcomes.

### Ppa2-associated sudden cardiac death: Extending the clinical and allelic spectrum in 20 new families [^111MwzoU]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Progressive neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia are frequent manifestations in mitochondrial diseases. Cerebellar hypoplasia and agenesis of the corpus callosum are less common, although they have been reported in mitochondrial diseases and other metabolic disorders. These observations are consistent with mitochondrial depletion or dysfunction affecting tissues requiring optimal levels of ATP availability, such as muscle and nerve cells. Neurological examination and follow-up are therefore recommended for surviving individuals harboring pathogenic biallelic PPA2 variants.

This large cohort has allowed the identification of several variant combinations compatible with survival into childhood and beyond in some individuals from eight families: the p.([Glu172Lys];[Pro228Leu]) combination in families 4 and 5; the p.([Glu172Lys];[Leu278Ser]) combination in family 17; the p.([Thr159Met];[Glu172Lys]) combination in families 7, 13, and 18; the p.([Arg127Leu];[Glu172Lys]) combination in family 16, although this genotype in family 6 resulted in death at the age of 14 months in individual II-2; and the p.([Arg127Leu];[Arg127Leu]) combination in family 9. Despite some surviving individuals in these families, families 4 and 16 also illustrate variability of intrafamilial expression. Indeed, in family 4, individuals II-2 and II-3 died of a cardiac arrest at 15 years and 23 months of age, respectively, whereas their 19-year-old brother is alive with progressive spasticity and cerebellar syndrome. In family 16, two siblings died of cardiac failure at 24 and 18 months old, whereas their affected sibling…

### Non-visualisation of cavum septi pellucidi: Implication in prenatal diagnosis [^115ayahV]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The agenesis or dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (CC) represents the largest bundle of white matter fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, facilitating intercommunication. The development of the CC occurs between 12 and 18 weeks of gestation from the lamina terminalis. Anatomically and embryologically, its development is closely related to that of the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP). Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a prevalent central nervous system anomaly, occurring in 0.5–7 per 10,000 live births.

The prevailing theory regarding the embryogenesis of the CC posits that it begins with the development of the genu, followed by the anterior body, posterior body, and finally the splenium. The rostrum, contrary to the orderly anterior-posterior progression of callosal development, forms last, typically by 20 weeks. Dysgenesis of the CC is characterized by partial agenesis or hypoplasia. In cases of partial agenesis, the splenium and rostrum are frequently absent, and the remaining CC may exhibit hypoplasia. Callosal hypoplasia involves the underdevelopment of the entire CC.

Prenatal imaging findings for ACC, in conjunction with non-visualisation of the CSP, may include colpocephaly (enlargement of the trigone and occipital horns of the lateral ventricle), a high-riding third ventricle, parallel orientation of the lateral ventricles, steer horn configuration of the frontal horns of lateral ventricles, convergence of median sulci towards the third ventricle, interhemispheric cyst, and abnormal course or absence of the pericallosal artery. However, in cases of CC dysgenesis, the CSP is typically present but may be shortened.

### Prenatal assessment of brain malformations on neuroimaging: An expert panel review [^112Kc3Eu]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Corpus callosum anomalies are significant findings in fetal imaging, with isolated corpus callosum abnormality being the most frequently diagnosed. Given the increased risk of adverse neurologic outcomes, recognizing complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum is crucial. In cases where the corpus callosum is severely dysplastic or virtually absent, it is important to evaluate the status of other commissures, as they may also be abnormal or absent. The absence of the callosum and cavum septum pellucidum (normally visible from 16 GW on ultrasound and by 20 GW on MRI) are usually appreciable in the sagittal plane and should be confirmed in the coronal plane. The coronal plane is also useful to distinguish callosal agenesis with an ectopic hippocampal commissure at its embryologic origin from hypogenesis/dysgenesis.

Additional suggestive signs include elevation of the roof of the third ventricle and colpocephaly with a teardrop appearance. A "steer horn configuration" of the frontal horns on coronal imaging is due to non-crossing white matter bundles (Probst bundles) or an abnormally radiating orientation of the median gyri and sulci relative to a potentially high-riding, interhemispherically extending third ventricle on sagittal imaging. This is often accentuated by the associated malrotation of the cingulate gyri. In cases of partial agenesis, the posterior portion is often deficient due to an arrest in development. Corpus callosum abnormalities may be associated with other structural midline abnormalities causing barriers to commissuration, such as interhemispheric cysts and lipomas, or, as previously mentioned, with MCD.

### A comparison of microstructural maturational changes of the corpus callosum in preterm and full-term children: a diffusion tensor imaging study [^116j15XJ]. Neuroradiology (2012). Low credibility.

Preterm children with thinning of the corpus callosum (CC) frequently achieve poor neurodevelopmental outcomes despite the absence of a definite brain lesion. Here, the authors compared the microstructural characteristics of the CC in preterm and full-term children using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
- **Methods**: Twenty-two preterm children with no definite focal lesion but with thinning of the CC by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and 23 age-matched full-term children were investigated by DTI. CCs were subdivided into genu, rostral body, body, isthmus, and splenium. Voxel counts (VC), fractional anisotropies (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured in each subdivision. Eleven preterm and 11 age-matched full-term subjects underwent follow-up scanning, and interval changes in these parameters for each subdivision were compared.
- **Results**: VC and FA were significantly lower in the preterm group than in the full-term group, particularly in the isthmus. Furthermore, incremental changes in VC and FA were significantly smaller in the preterm group. Differences in maturation between the two groups were more pronounced with age in all subdivisions except the splenium. At all ages, noticeable FA differences between the two groups were observed in the isthmus. For white matter tracts, the preterm group displayed lower FA and fiber number, and higher ADC values than the term group.
- **Conclusions**: The present study shows that thinning of the CC is correlated with lower FA value and that it is more pronounced in preterm children.

We report on a 3-year-old boy with partial trisomy 8p11.23→pter and partial monosomy 4q34→qter, associated with developmental delay, complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, and mild dysmorphic features. Although agenesis of the corpus callosum is not a rare finding among chromosomal abnormalities, partial trisomy 8p together with partial monosomy 4q, resulting from a maternal translocation, was not previously reported to the best of our knowledge.

### Fetal callosal anomalies: A narrative review and practical recommendations for pediatric neurologists [^114E9G6X]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a common indication for fetal neurology consultation, increasingly identified through advances in fetal sonography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging. Despite improvements in diagnostic accuracy, prognostic counseling is challenging due to highly variable neurodevelopmental outcomes. Several factors contribute to neurodevelopmental outcome variability, including associated anomalies and etiologic considerations such as genetic, acquired, and environmental factors.

This narrative review discusses existing literature on prenatal findings, postnatal outcomes, and comorbidities to provide practical guidelines for prenatal diagnosis, counseling, and postnatal management. Additionally, practice and research gaps are identified to advocate for guidelines to improve counseling, management, and optimization of outcomes for affected children and families.

### Beyond isolated and associated: A novel fetal MR imaging-based scoring system helps in the prenatal prognostication of callosal agenesis [^111nLjc1]. AJNR, American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Although "corpus callosum agenesis" is an umbrella term for multiple entities, prenatal counseling is based reductively on the presence (associated) or absence (isolated) of additional abnormalities. Our aim was to test the applicability of a fetal MR neuroimaging score in a cohort of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed isolated corpus callosum agenesis and associated corpus callosum agenesis and correlate it with neurodevelopmental outcomes.
- **Materials and methods**: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of a cohort of cases of consecutive corpus callosum agenesis collected between January 2011 and July 2019. Cases were scored by two raters, and interrater agreement was calculated. Outcome was assessed by standardized testing (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children) or a structured telephone interview and correlated with scores using two-way ANOVA.
- **Results**: We included 137 cases (74 cases of isolated corpus callosum agenesis), imaged at a mean of 27 gestational weeks. Interrater agreement was excellent (0.98). Scores were higher in associated corpus callosum agenesis (P < .0001) without a significant score difference between complete and partial corpus callosum agenesis (P = 0.38). Outcome was assessed in 42 children with isolated corpus callosum agenesis and nine with associated corpus callosum agenesis (mean age, 3.1 years). MR imaging scores correctly predicted developmental outcome in 90.7% of patients with isolated corpus callosum agenesis, improving neurodevelopmental risk stratification.

### Outcome of agenesis of the corpus callosum diagnosed by fetal MRI [^11129fxu]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly utilized for prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). This study aimed to (1) describe cases of ACC diagnosed by fetal MRI, (2) determine the frequency of postnatal confirmation by MRI, and (3) understand postnatal outcomes of infants with ACC.

- **Methods**: Maternal records from Children's National Hospital between January 2012 and June 2019 with a prenatal neurological consultation, fetal MRI, and ACC on imaging were included. Maternal, prenatal, and postnatal infant data were collected. Each case was categorized as complete or partial ACC and isolated or complex ACC by fetal MRI, and group comparisons of outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 127 maternal-fetal dyads with ACC were categorized into 45 isolated-complete, 17 isolated-partial, 46 complex-complete, and 19 complex-partial ACC. Of 75 live births, 72 had postnatal evaluations. In 43 of 59 (73%) cases with postnatal neuroimaging, prenatal ACC subcategory was confirmed. Children with isolated or complex and with partial or complete ACC had similar rates of developmental delays and epilepsy. Complex ACC cases had worse outcomes than isolated ACC, with complex ACC having more postnatal dysmorphisms and abnormal feeding and vision compared with isolated ACC. Similar neurodevelopmental outcomes were seen for partial and complete ACC.

- **Conclusions**: Children with isolated or complex ACC and with partial or complete ACC have a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Fetal and postnatal brain MRI is a valuable tool to understand different outcomes.

### Clinical characterization, genetics, and long-term follow-up of a large cohort of patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum [^114RcKZv]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To gain a better understanding of the clinical and genetic features associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, we enrolled and characterized 162 patients with complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Clinical and genetic protocols allowed us to categorize patients as syndromic subjects, affected by complex extra-brain malformations, and nonsyndromic subjects without any additional anomalies. We observed slight differences in sex ratio (56% males) and agenesis type (52% complete). Syndromic agenesis of the corpus callosum subjects were prevalent (69%). We detected associated cerebral malformations in 48% of patients. Neuromotor impairment, cognitive and language disorders, and epilepsy were frequently present, regardless of the agenesis of corpus callosum subtype. Long-term follow-up allowed us to define additional indicators: syndromic agenesis of corpus callosum plus patients showed the most severe clinical features, while isolated complete agenesis of the corpus callosum patients had the mildest symptoms, although we observed intellectual disability (64%) and epilepsy (15%) in both categories. We achieved a definitive (clinical and/or genetic) diagnosis in 42% of subjects.
