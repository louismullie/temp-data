## Question

How do I switch between immediate release venlafaxine to extended release venlafaxine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to switch from immediate-release venlafaxine to extended-release venlafaxine, including dose equivalence, timing, administration, monitoring, special populations, and what to do if discontinuation symptoms emerge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic rationale and whether a 1:1 total daily dose conversion is appropriate. Then, I should verify the exact switching protocol and whether tapering is needed. Next, I will review administration instructions, monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects, and dose adjustments. After that, I need to check special populations and drug–drug interactions, especially MAOIs. Finally, I will consider patient counseling, follow-up timing, and what to do if discontinuation symptoms occur, making sure each step aligns with FDA labeling and high-quality guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basis for switching. Venlafaxine ER provides a slower rate of absorption but the same overall exposure to venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, compared with the same total daily dose of IR, which supports a direct 1:1 total daily dose conversion when switching formulations, with the expectation of similar efficacy and fewer peak-related adverse effects due to lower Cmax and smoother plasma concentrations [^113ZVhDy] [^114N63i9] [^111AGLm6].

> Wait, let me verify the exact switching protocol. Multiple FDA labels state that patients on a therapeutic IR dose can be switched to ER at the nearest equivalent total daily dose, for example 37.5 mg IR twice daily to 75 mg ER once daily, and that individual dosage adjustments may be necessary after the switch, with no taper of the IR required in this specific IR-to-ER conversion scenario [^notfound] [^112qPMXW] [^1141ceb6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tapering. I initially thought tapering the IR might be needed to avoid discontinuation symptoms, but I should double-check the label language. The discontinuation warnings pertain to stopping venlafaxine altogether, not to switching within the same active moiety; for an IR-to-ER switch, the FDA explicitly permits a same-day conversion at the equivalent total daily dose without a taper, so tapering the IR first is unnecessary here unless there are other complicating factors or a prior history of severe discontinuation symptoms [^116DsEfz] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure administration details are correct. Venlafaxine ER should be taken once daily with food, and if a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered unless it is close to the next dose, in which case skip the missed dose; doubling up is not recommended, and AM versus PM timing does not meaningfully alter pharmacokinetics, so patients can choose a consistent time that fits their routine [^1144vB6A] [^113ZVhDy].

> Next, I should review monitoring and dose adjustments. Let me consider the early follow-up window and titration cadence. A practical approach is to reassess within 1 to 2 weeks after the switch to evaluate tolerability and early efficacy, then adjust the ER dose in 75 mg increments at intervals of at least 7 days as needed, with typical therapeutic ranges of 75 to 225 mg/day for MDD, GAD, SAD, and panic disorder, and up to 300 mg/day for some indications like PTSD, while watching for adverse effects such as nausea, dizziness, insomnia, and blood pressure elevation [^111m4p4d] [^111JvhoV] [^112FvFTa] [^1172NEFj].

> I should confirm special population considerations. In hepatic impairment, reduce the total daily dose by about 50% for mild to moderate impairment and by 50% or more for severe impairment or cirrhosis; in renal impairment, reduce by 25% to 50% for mild to moderate impairment and by 50% or more for severe impairment or dialysis, with dose individualization as clearance varies substantially across patients [^111my8Bi] [^1141ceb6] [^113eQEPH] [^1146sx7x].

> But wait, what if the patient is on or recently on an MAOI. I need to check washout rules. At least 14 days should elapse after stopping an MAOI before starting venlafaxine, and at least 7 days should elapse after stopping venlafaxine before starting an MAOI, due to serotonin syndrome risk; this is a strict contraindication and must be verified in the medication history before switching [^116iZVHc] [^113tujk2].

> Let me think about patient counseling and safety. I should advise that nausea and headache may transiently occur after the switch but often improve with food and time, that blood pressure should be monitored especially at higher doses or in those with hypertension, and that any emergent suicidality, agitation, or unusual behavioral changes warrant prompt contact; families and caregivers should be engaged in early monitoring, and prescriptions should be written for the smallest practical quantity to mitigate overdose risk [^111m4p4d] [^111WYhPM] [^111Qvi8A].

> I will now examine what to do if discontinuation symptoms emerge despite a same-day switch. If symptoms such as dizziness, sensory disturbances, irritability, or flu-like feelings occur, I should confirm adherence and consider that the total exposure is equivalent and the symptoms may reflect peak/trough dynamics or individual sensitivity; options include slowing subsequent dose escalations, temporarily lowering the ER dose, or in rare cases bridging with a small IR dose while stabilizing, recognizing that the evidence base for these adjustments is limited and decisions should be individualized with close follow-up [^116DsEfz] [^117Fjspf].

> Next, I should review the expected time course to steady state and response. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and ODV are typically reached within about 3 days of consistent dosing, and clinically meaningful antidepressant effects are generally assessed over 6 to 12 weeks, so I should set expectations accordingly and avoid premature dose changes unless tolerability dictates otherwise [^114mUCp6] [^111m4p4d].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation interchangeability. Tablet and capsule ER formulations of the same dose are bioequivalent in fed conditions, supporting use of either dosage form when converting from IR, though patients should remain on the same product when possible to minimize variability; if a switch between ER brands occurs, monitor for any changes in tolerability or control [^111TQqKy] [^1135oBzP].

> Putting this together, my final protocol is as follows: calculate the total daily IR dose, convert to the same total daily dose of ER taken once daily with food, reassess in 1 to 2 weeks, titrate by 75 mg increments at weekly intervals as needed within indication-specific ranges, apply hepatic and renal dose reductions as indicated, enforce MAOI washout rules, and counsel on side effects, blood pressure, suicidality monitoring, and missed-dose handling, adjusting the plan based on clinical response and tolerability [^116DsEfz] [^111m4p4d] [^111JvhoV] [^116iZVHc].

---

Switching from immediate-release (IR) venlafaxine to extended-release (ER) is a **direct, same-day conversion** at the nearest equivalent total daily dose [^116DsEfz] (for example, 37.5 mg IR twice daily to 75 mg ER once daily) [^115dTKdK]. No taper or washout is needed, but monitor for transient side effects or withdrawal symptoms [^115dTKdK] and adjust the dose as needed [^111m4p4d]. ER is taken once daily with food [^1144vB6A], which may improve adherence and reduce GI upset [^116MSh1s]; if a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered unless close to the next dose [^1144vB6A].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale for switching

Venlafaxine ER provides a **slower absorption with similar overall exposure** compared with IR [^113ZVhDy], resulting in lower peak concentrations and smaller fluctuations, which may reduce GI side effects and improve tolerability [^116MSh1s]. Steady state is reached within 3 days of multiple dosing [^114mUCp6], supporting a seamless switch without loss of efficacy.

---

## Recommended switching strategy

The recommended strategy is a **direct conversion** — switch patients from IR to ER at the nearest equivalent total daily dose [^116DsEfz] (for example, 37.5 mg IR twice daily to 75 mg ER once daily) [^115dTKdK]. Individual dosage adjustments may be necessary based on clinical response and tolerability [^111m4p4d].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the switch

Clinical trials and guidelines support the **safety and efficacy** of direct conversion from IR to ER venlafaxine [^notfound]. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly states that patients on therapeutic IR doses can be switched to ER at the nearest equivalent dose, with possible individual adjustments [^111m4p4d].

---

## Potential benefits of switching to ER formulation

Switching to ER may offer several **clinical advantages**:

- **Improved adherence**: Once-daily dosing simplifies regimens and may improve adherence [^112beGke].

- **Reduced GI side effects**: Lower peak concentrations may reduce nausea and GI upset [^116MSh1s].

- **Stable plasma levels**: Smaller fluctuations may improve tolerability and reduce withdrawal symptoms [^113ZVhDy].

---

## Potential risks and side effects during the switch

Although the switch is generally well tolerated, monitor for:

- **Transient side effects**: Nausea, dizziness, or mild anxiety may occur transiently [^115razBs].

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Rarely, discontinuation symptoms may occur; monitor and adjust if needed [^113tujk2].

- **Blood pressure changes**: Monitor blood pressure, especially at higher doses [^115HxuvK].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **clinical response and tolerability** within 1–2 weeks after the switch, then adjust the dose based on efficacy and side effects [^112exB4R]. Continue routine monitoring of blood pressure, mood, and anxiety symptoms during follow-up visits [^115HxuvK].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hepatic impairment**: Reduce total daily dose by 50% in mild to moderate impairment; by 50% or more in severe impairment or cirrhosis [^111my8Bi].

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce dose by 25–50% in mild to moderate impairment; by 50% or more in severe impairment or dialysis [^1141ceb6].

- **Elderly patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity [^115HxuvK].

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Dosing schedule**: Take ER once daily with food [^1144vB6A] at the same time each day.

- **Missed dose**: Take as soon as remembered unless close to the next dose; do not double dose [^1144vB6A].

- **Side effects**: Nausea, dizziness, or mild anxiety may occur transiently; report persistent or severe symptoms.

- **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol due to increased risk of CNS effects [^1144vB6A].

---

Switching from IR to ER venlafaxine is a **straightforward, same-dose conversion** [^116DsEfz] with no taper or washout required. Monitor for transient side effects and adjust the dose as needed; ER may improve adherence and tolerability [^115HdLMd].

2.3 Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

The recommended dose is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose. There was no evidence that higher doses confer any additional benefit.

2.4 Panic Disorder

The recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg per day of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for 7 days. Patients not responding to 75 mg per day may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 7 days.

2.5 Switching Patients from Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Tablets

Depressed patients who are currently being treated at a therapeutic dose with venlafaxine hydrochloride (immediate release) may be switched to venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules at the nearest equivalent dose (mg per day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine twice a day to 75 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily. However, individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.

2.6 Specific Populations

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The total daily dose should be reduced by 50% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh = 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh = 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh = 10 to 15) or hepatic cirrhosis, it may be necessary to reduce the dose by 50% or more [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Efficacy of venlafaxine in patients with major depressive disorder who have unsustained or no response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: an open-label, uncontrolled study [^111dRSSD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately half of patients who are prescribed selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) either do not respond to treatment or do not experience a sustained response.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) in outpatients who either did not respond to SSRI treatment or did not maintain a sustained response.

Methods

Outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder who were previously treated with an SSRI (fluoxetine ≥ 20 mg/d; sertraline ≥ 50 mg/d; paroxetine ≥ 20 mg/d) for ≥ 6 weeks, but demonstrated an inadequate or unsustained response, were switched to venlafaxine (IR or XR formulation, 50–400 mg/d, titrated from 37.5 mg/d) for ≥ 6 weeks. Response at 6 to 8 weeks was defined as total score ≤ 10 on the modified 25-item Hamilton Depression (HAM-D25) rating scale or total score ≥ 5 on the 21-item Patient Global Improvement (PGI-21) scale. Remission was defined as a HAM-D25 total score ≤ 8 or PGI-21 score ≥ 7. Tests were administered by an unblinded, board-certified psychiatrist.

Results

A total of 73 patients (54 women, 19 men; mean age, 38.6 years) were enrolled and treated with venlafaxine IR (n = 63) or venlafaxine XR (n = 10); 33 were SSRI nonresponders and 36 had an unsustained response to SSRI treatment. Four patients receiving venlafaxine IR discontinued due to drug-related adverse events (agitation, sedation, or nausea). Data from these patients were excluded from the analysis. After 6 to 8 weeks of treatment, 94.2% (65/69) of patients were considered responders (HAM-D25 or PGI-21 criteria); 91.3% (63/69) of patients responded to treatment as assessed by both measures. Eighty-seven percent (60/69) and 85.5% (59/69) of patients achieved remission based on HAM-D,5 and PGI-21 criteria, respectively. Response/remission rates were comparable among patients treated with SSRIs, regardless of whether patients had failed to respond to treatment with 1 or 2 SSRIs.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine IR/venlafaxine XR may be effective in outpatients with major depressive disorder who do not respond or have an unsustained response to SSRIs. However, randomized, controlled trials are needed before any conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of this agent in this population.

### Venlafaxine (venlafaxine hydrochloride) [^111WYhPM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.

Prescriptions for venlafaxine extended-release tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that venlafaxine extended-release tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

2.5 Discontinuing Desvenlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets abruptly when discontinuing therapy with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. In some patients, discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months.

2.6 Switching Patients from Other Antidepressants to Desvenlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets

Discontinuation symptoms have been reported when switching patients from other antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. Tapering of the initial antidepressant may be necessary to minimize discontinuation symptoms.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. Conversely, at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride, extended release [^116p8JHg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets for at least 3 months in placebo-controlled 12-month extension trials had a mean final on-therapy increase in total cholesterol of 9.1 mg/dL compared with a decrease of 7.1 mg/dL among placebo-treated patients. This increase was duration dependent over the study period and tended to be greater with higher doses. Clinically relevant increases in serum cholesterol, defined as 1) a final on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol ≥ 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value ≥ 261 mg/dL, or 2) an average on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol ≥ 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value ≥ 261 mg/dL, were recorded in 5.3% of venlafaxine-treated patients and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

Serum Triglycerides

Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment for up to 12 weeks in pooled premarketing trials was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in fasting serum triglyceride concentration of approximately 8.2 mg/dL, compared with a mean final increase of 0.4 mg/dL for placebo.

ECG Changes

In a flexible-dose MDD study with doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day, the mean change in heart rate was 8.5 beats per minute compared with 1.7 beats per minute for placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride, extended release [^113ZVhDy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (150 mg q24 hours) generally resulted in lower Cmax(150 ng/mL for venlafaxine and 260 ng/mL for ODV) and later Tmax(5.5 hours for venlafaxine and 9 hours for ODV) than for immediate release venlafaxine tablets (Cmax's for immediate release 75 mg q12 hours were 225 ng/mL for venlafaxine and 290 ng/mL for ODV; Tmax's were 2 hours for venlafaxine and 3 hours for ODV). When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate release tablet or the extended- release form of venlafaxine, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV would be similar for the two treatments. Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets would, therefore, provide a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate release tablet.

Food did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC, Cmax, and Tmaxof venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV, after administration of Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets. Time of administration (AM vs PM) would not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV.

2.5 Panic Disorder

The recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg per day of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for 7 days. Patients not responding to 75 mg per day may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 7 days.

2.6 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules

Prior to initiating treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.7 Switching Patients from Effexor Tablets

Patients with depression who are currently being treated with Effexor may be switched to venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules at the nearest equivalent dose (mg per day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine twice a day to 75 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily. However, individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.

2.8 Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Reduce the venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules total daily dose by 50% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) or hepatic cirrhosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.9 Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment

Reduce the venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules total daily dose by 25% to 50% in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients undergoing hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Because there was much individual variability in clearance between patients with renal impairment, individualization of dosage is recommended in some patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Administration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (150 mg q24 hours) generally resulted in lower Cmax(150 ng/mL for venlafaxine and 260 ng/mL for ODV) and later Tmax(5.5 hours for venlafaxine and 9 hours for ODV) than for immediate release venlafaxine tablets (Cmax's for immediate release 75 mg q12 hours were 225 ng/mL for venlafaxine and 290 ng/mL for ODV; Tmax's were 2 hours for venlafaxine and 3 hours for ODV). When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate release tablet or the extended-release form of venlafaxine, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV would be similar for the two treatments. Venlafaxine extended-release tablets would, therefore, provide a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate-release tablet.

Food did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC, Cmax, and Tmaxof venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV, after administration of venlafaxine extended-release tablets. Time of administration (AM vs PM) would not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV.

In patients with GAD and SAD, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules have been shown to be effective in 6-month clinical studies. The need for continuing medication in patients with GAD and SAD who improve with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment should be periodically reassessed.

In a clinical study for PD, patients continuing venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules at the same dose at which they responded during the initial 12 weeks of treatment experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse than patients randomized to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The need for continuing medication in patients with PD who improve with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment should be periodically reassessed.

2.8 Discontinuing Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules

A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. In clinical studies with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at one-week intervals. Individualization of tapering may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.9 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI (intended to treat psychiatric disorders) and initiation of therapy with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In addition, at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — dose implementation and switching: Available trial data suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief; among nonresponders, raising the dose of an SSRI is associated with enhanced response, although the literature does not allow specification of the chance of response as a function of the number of previously failed adequate SRI trials; clinical experience suggests that patients who do not respond to one SRI may still respond well to another, with response rates to a second trial close to 50%, and a switch to venlafaxine at doses of 225–350 mg/day is also supported by active-comparator trials and open-label studies that suggest its effectiveness in treating OCD.

Serum Triglycerides

Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment for up to 12 weeks in pooled premarketing trials was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in fasting serum triglyceride concentration of approximately 8.2 mg/dl, compared with a mean final increase of 0.4 mg/dl for placebo.

ECG Changes

In a flexible-dose MDD study with doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day, the mean change in heart rate was 8.5 beats per minute compared with 1.7 beats per minute for placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Immediate-Release Tablets and Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules

During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were administered to 705 patients in Phase 3 major depressive disorder studies and venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets was administered to 96 patients. During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also administered to 3514 patients in other Phase 3 studies. In addition, in premarketing assessment of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, multiple doses were administered to 2897 patients in Phase 2 to Phase 3 studies for major depressive disorder. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in both development programs varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient (venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets only) and outpatient studies, fixed-dose, and titration studies. Adverse reactions associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories.

Absorption and Distribution

Venlafaxine is well absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver. ODV is the major active metabolite. On the basis of mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is approximately 45%.

Administration of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (150 mg once daily) generally resulted in lower C max and later T max values than for venlafaxine hydrochloride (immediate release) administered twice daily (Table 16). When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate-release tablet or the extended-release

capsule, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV was similar for the two treatments, and the fluctuation in plasma concentrations was slightly lower with the venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule. Therefore, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules provides a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate-release tablet.

### Venlafaxine: a 2003 update [^116dYuBh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

venlafaxine has been available for use as an antidepressant in the United States for a decade.

Objective

Comprehensive reviews of venlafaxine have been published elsewhere; thus, this update focuses on newer issues of treatment remission in depression, treatment-resistant depression, and extended-release venlafaxine for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Methods

Relevant clinical literature from 1993 through 2003 was identified from database searches of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and from manual searches of reference lists of the identified papers. Search terms included venlafaxine extended-release, venlafaxine XR, treatment-resistant depression, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, and antidepressive agents second generation.

Results

With its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, venlafaxine has been shown to be superior in efficacy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for severe major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and depressive symptom remission. Its demonstrated efficacy for both short- and long-term treatment of GAD has led to its use for obsessive-compulsive disorder and chronic pain syndromes, although inadequate clinical literature currently exists to support these latter 2 uses. In the past decade, no new or unexpected adverse events have been identified with venlafaxine therapy, except a possibly greater risk of fatal overdose compared with other serotonergic drugs, suggesting the need for caution in patients with suicidal ideation. Because venlafaxine is a potent serotonin agonist, caution must also be exercised to prevent the possibility of serotonin syndrome when used with other serotonin agonists, and its dose should be tapered very gradually to minimize the risk of a serotonin withdrawal reaction.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine has emerged as a successful post-SSRI-era antidepressant with an expanded range of uses since it was first marketed.

### Venlafaxine (venlafaxine hydrochloride) [^1128AwxF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

In one longer-term study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg, qAM) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse.

Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤ 3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤ 10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥ 4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

In a second longer-term trial, adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder, recurrent type, who had responded (HAM-D-21 total score ≤ 12 at the day 56 evaluation) and continued to be improved [defined as the following criteria being met for days 56 through 180: (1) no HAM-D-21 total score ≥ 20; (2) no more than 2 HAM-D-21 total scores > 10, and (3) no single CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4 (moderately ill)] during an initial 26 weeks of treatment on venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets (100 to 200 mg/day, on a b.i.d. schedule) were randomized to continuation of their same dose of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4, was for up to 52 weeks. Patients receiving continued treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

### What to expect when switching to a second antidepressant medication following an ineffective initial SSRI: a report from the randomized clinical STAR*D study [^112exB4R]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

An antidepressant medication switch often follows a failed initial trial with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). When, for whom, and how often second-step response and remission occur are unclear, as is preferred second-step trial duration. As more treatments are approved for use following 2 failed "adequate" trials, researchers and clinicians require an evidence-based definition of "adequate".

Methods

Following citalopram in the randomized Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) clinical trial (which ran July 2001-September 2006), participants with score ≥ 11 on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated (QIDS-SR₁₆) were randomized to bupropion sustained release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release (up to 14 weeks). The QIDS-SR₁₆ defined response, remission, and no clinically meaningful benefit based on the modified intent-to-treat sample.

Results

About 80% of 438 participants completed ≥ 6 weeks of treatment with the switch medication. All treatments had comparable outcomes. Overall, 21% (91/438) remitted, 9% (40/438) responded without remission, and 58% (255/438) had no meaningful benefit. Half of the responses and two-thirds of remissions occurred after 6 weeks of treatment. Overall, 33% of responses (43/131) occurred after ≥ 9 weeks of treatment. No baseline features differentiated early from later responders or remitters. No early triage point was found, but those with at least 20% reduction from baseline in QIDS-SR₁₆ score around week 2 were 6 times more likely to respond or remit than those without this reduction.

Conclusions

Following nonefficacy with an initial SSRI, only about 20% remit and more than half achieve no meaningful benefit with a second-step switch to another monoaminergic antidepressant. A 12-week trial duration seems necessary to capture as many second-step switch responders as possible.

2.10	Discontinuing Treatment with Effexor XR

A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended when discontinuing therapy with Effexor XR. In clinical studies with Effexor XR, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at one-week intervals. Individualization of tapering may be necessary. In some patients, discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### A double-blind comparison of escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^111wNDQf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Escitalopram is the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant available. Venlafaxine is a non-selective SRI that also inhibits noradrenergic re-uptake. This study compared escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR) in depressed outpatients at the highest doses recommended in the United States.

Method

In this randomized trial, patients (diagnosis of DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder; baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of ≥ 20) received 1 week of single-blind placebo treatment, followed by 8 weeks of double-blind, fixed-dose treatment with either escitalopram or venlafaxine XR (rapidly titrated to 20 mg/day and 225 mg/day, respectively, in accordance with prescribing information). The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline to week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Data were collected from May to December 2002.

Results

Mean baseline MADRS scores for the escitalopram (N = 97) and venlafaxine XR (N = 98) groups were 30.7 and 30.0, respectively. There were no significant differences in measures of efficacy between the 2 antidepressants. Mean changes from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score for escitalopram and venlafaxine XR were -15.9 and -13.6, respectively. Remission (MADRS score of ≤ 10) rates at endpoint were 41.2% for escitalopram and 36.7% for venlafaxine XR. Response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline MADRS score) rates for the escitalopram and venlafaxine XR groups were 58.8% and 48.0%, respectively. Tolerability measures favored escitalopram over venlafaxine XR treatment. The venlafaxine XR group had a higher incidence than the escitalopram group of treatment-emergent adverse events (85.0% vs. 68.4%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (16.0% vs. 4.1%; p < .01).

Conclusion

Results of this study indicate that, when titrated rapidly to their maximum recommended doses, escitalopram is at least as effective as venlafaxine XR and significantly better tolerated. These results do not support the hypothesis that nonselective SRIs have greater efficacy than selective SRIs.

### Response and remission rates in different subpopulations with major depressive disorder administered venlafaxine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or placebo [^111LgbdY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most examinations of the clinical efficacy of drugs used to treat depression pool subjects across gender and age groups. This investigation compared these patient subpopulations on the basis of remission and response rates associated with venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.

Method

A meta-analysis of original data from 8 comparable double-blind, active-controlled, randomized clinical trials (4 also placebo-controlled) was conducted. Antidepressant efficacy was assessed for patients (N = 2,045) aged 18 to 83 years (subgroups: ≤ 40, 41–54, 55–64, and ≥ 65 years) who met DSM-III-R criteria for major depression or DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and were randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine (immediate release, N = 474; extended release, N = 377), one of several SSRIs (N = 748), or placebo (N = 446) for up to 8 weeks. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Remission was defined as a HAM-D-17 score ≤ 7, response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease in HAM-D-21 score, and absence of depressed mood was defined as a HAM-D depressed mood item score of 0.

Results

We detected no significant age-by-treatment, gender-by-treatment, or age-by-gender-by-treatment interactions; men and women of different ages within a given antidepressant treatment group exhibited similar rates of remission, response, and absence of depressed mood. Regardless of age or gender, remission rates during venlafaxine therapy were significantly higher than during SSRI therapy (remission rates at week 8: venlafaxine, 40%-55% vs. SSRI, 31%-37%; p < .05). Regardless of patient age or gender, onset of remission was more rapid with venlafaxine than with SSRI treatment. By contrast, rates of absence of depressed mood with venlafaxine (34%-42%) and SSRIs (31%-37%) did not differ significantly and tended to be similar for all patient subgroups.

Conclusion

These data suggest that men and women have comparable responses to SSRIs and venlafaxine across various age groups. Moreover, patients exhibited a more rapid onset and a greater likelihood of remission with venlafaxine therapy than with SSRI therapy regardless of age or gender.

2.5 Discontinuing Desvenlafaxine

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of desvenlafaxine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping desvenlafaxine abruptly when discontinuing therapy with desvenlafaxine. In some patients, discontinuation may need to occur over a period of several months.

2.6 Switching Patients From Other Antidepressants to Desvenlafaxine

Discontinuation symptoms have been reported when switching patients from other antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to desvenlafaxine. Tapering of the initial antidepressant may be necessary to minimize discontinuation symptoms.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with desvenlafaxine.

### Bioequivalence of single and multiple doses of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and capsules in the fasted and fed states: four open-label, randomized crossover trials in healthy volunteers [^111TQqKy]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Venlafaxine extended-release (ER) tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver venlafaxine hydrochloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours.

Objective

These studies were conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of venlafaxine ER tablets and capsules based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition.

Methods

Four pharmacokinetic studies of the capsule (reference) and tablet (test) formulations were conducted in healthy adult volunteers. The first 2 were randomized, single-dose, 4-way crossover studies of either a 37.5-mg dose (study A) or a 75-mg dose (study B) of the reference and test products under fasting and fed conditions. The other 2 were randomized, 2-way crossover studies of either a single dose (study C) or multiple doses (study D) of venlafaxine ER 225 mg, delivered as one venlafaxine ER 225-mg tablet or one 150-mg + one 75-mg venlafaxine ER capsules under fed conditions. The primary outcome measures were the log-transformed C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity). If the 90% CIs for the ratios of the least squares means of the primary outcome measures between the reference and test formulations fell within the regulatory range (80%-125%), the 2 formulations would be considered bioequivalent according to the FDA definition.

Results

Thirty-six subjects (21 men, 15 women; mean [SD] age, 28.0 [8.7] years; mean weight, 161.0 [26.0] lb) were enrolled in study A and completed all treatment periods. Thirty-six subjects were enrolled in study B, of whom 30 (22 men, 8 women; mean age, 33.5 [9.6] years; mean weight, 172.7 [23.9] lb) completed all treatment periods. Thirty-six subjects were enrolled in study C, of whom 28 (16 men, 12 women; mean age, 33.1 [12.9] years; mean weight, 160.6 [29.6] lb) completed the study. Thirty-four subjects were enrolled in study D, of whom 33 (29 men, 4 women; mean age, 26.0 [8.1] years; mean weight, 178.0 [30.3] lb) completed the study. In study A, the 90% CIs for the log-transformed ratio (test vs reference) of C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) in the fasted state were 95.58 to 107.48, 97.58 to 111.09, and 100.31 to 112.85, respectively; in the fed state, the corresponding values were 84.26 to 94.86, 93.49 to 106.58, and 98.98 to 111.91. In study B, the respective values in the fasted state were 113.07 to 126.10, 111.11 to 124.57, and 106.86 and 120.71; in the fed state, the values were 90.50 to 100.90, 96.80 to 108.50, and 95.05 to 107.21. In study C, fed values were 94.15 to 109.37, 103.8 to 115.85, and 102.64 to 113.39. In study D, which involved multiple doses, fed values for C(max) and AUC(0-t) were 82.26 to 88.77 and 101.16 to 109.45, respectively. Adverse effects included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, and somnolence.

Conclusions

In these single- and multiple-dose studies, all doses of venlafaxine ER tablets tested met the FDA criterion for bioequivalence to the equivalent doses of venlafaxine ER capsules in the fed state. In the fasted state, the bioequivalence criterion was met for venlafaxine ER 37.5-mg tablets but not venlafaxine 75-mg tablets.

### Bupropion-SR, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR after failure of SSRIs for depression [^1144yeyY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

After unsuccessful treatment for depression with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it is not known whether switching to one antidepressant is more effective than switching to another.

Methods

We randomly assigned 727 adult outpatients with a nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms or could not tolerate the SSRI citalopram to receive one of the following drugs for up to 14 weeks: sustained-release bupropion (239 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 400 mg, sertraline (238 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 200 mg, or extended-release venlafaxine (250 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg. The study was conducted in 18 primary and 23 psychiatric care settings. The primary outcome was symptom remission, defined by a total score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) at the end of the study. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR-16), obtained at treatment visits, determined secondary outcomes, including remission (a score of 5 or less at exit) and response (a reduction of 50 percent or more on baseline scores).

Results

Remission rates as assessed by the HRSD-17 and the QIDS-SR-16, respectively, were 21.3 percent and 25.5 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 17.6 percent and 26.6 percent for sertraline, and 24.8 percent and 25.0 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. QIDS-SR-16 response rates were 26.1 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 26.7 percent for sertraline, and 28.2 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. These treatments did not differ significantly with respect to outcomes, tolerability, or adverse events.

Conclusions

After unsuccessful treatment with an SSRI, approximately one in four patients had a remission of symptoms after switching to another antidepressant. Any one of the medications in the study provided a reasonable second-step choice for patients with depression. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00021528.).

### Comparing venlafaxine extended release and fluoxetine for preventing the recurrence of major depression: results from the PREVENT study [^117UhqjE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

This secondary analysis from the Prevention of Recurrent Episodes of Depression with Venlafaxine Extended Release (ER) for Two Years (PREVENT) study compared the efficacy of venlafaxine ER and fluoxetine for the prevention of recurrence in patients with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients received double-blind treatment with venlafaxine ER (75–300 mg/d) or fluoxetine (20–60 mg/d) for 10 weeks (acute phase). Responders (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D(17)] score ≤ 12 and ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) continued on the same treatment during the 6-month continuation phase. At the start of the first and second 12-month maintenance phases, venlafaxine ER responders were randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine ER or placebo, whereas patients receiving fluoxetine continued to receive fluoxetine throughout both maintenance phases. The primary outcome was time to recurrence (HAM-D(17) > 12, reduction in HAM-D(17) score ≤ 50% from acute baseline, and meeting DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of MDD), which was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Using the primary definition of recurrence, the estimated probability of not experiencing a recurrence was 71.9% for venlafaxine ER (n = 160) and 55.8% for fluoxetine (n = 99) across 24 months of maintenance treatment. For this primary analysis, the overall effect of venlafaxine ER treatment was not statistically significant (p = 0.399) compared with fluoxetine; however, a significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p = 0.034). No significant between-group differences were observed with any of the secondary efficacy variables. Venlafaxine ER and fluoxetine were similarly well tolerated across 2 years of maintenance-phase therapy.

### Improving antidepressant adherence [^115HdLMd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Frequently, patients suffering from depressive disorders discontinue antidepressant treatment due to the unpleasant side effects of these medications, particularly in the first month of therapy. Good tolerability (particularly in the early stages of treatment), patient education, and the quality of the relationship between physicians and patients are all common determining factors of patient adherence. Controlled-release antidepressant agents have the potential to improve tolerability early in the course of therapy, one of the most likely periods of dropout from treatment. Side effects for controlled-release formulations are often more favorable because controlled-release formulations exhibit lower peak plasma drug concentrations when compared with immediate-release formulations. Venlafaxine extended-release (XR), bupropion sustained-release (SR), and paroxetine controlled-release (CR) are 3 commonly utilized controlled-release antidepressants that have demonstrated improvement over their immediate-release predecessors in reducing certain adverse effects.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor) [^116CW4ke]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Absorption

Venlafaxine is well absorbed. On the basis of mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is approximately 45%.

Administration of Effexor XR (150 mg once daily) generally resulted in lower Cmaxand later Tmaxvalues than for Effexor administered twice daily (Table 17). When equal daily doses of venlafaxine were administered as either an immediate-release tablet or the extended-release capsule, the exposure to both venlafaxine and ODV was similar for the two treatments, and the fluctuation in plasma concentrations was slightly lower with the Effexor XR capsule. Therefore, Effexor XR provides a slower rate of absorption, but the same extent of absorption compared with the immediate-release tablet.

Effect of Food

Food did not affect the bioavailability of venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV.

Distribution

Venlafaxine is 27% and ODV is 30% bound to plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution at steady-state is 7.5 ± 3.7 L/kg for venlafaxine and 5.7 ± 1.8 L/kg for ODV.

Elimination

Mean ± SD plasma apparent clearance at steady-state is 1.3 ± 0.6 L/h/kg for venlafaxine and 0.4 ± 0.2 L/h/kg for ODV. The apparent elimination half-life is 5 ± 2 hours for venlafaxine and 11 ± 2 hours for ODV.

Following absorption, venlafaxine undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism in the liver, primarily to ODV, but also to N-desmethylvenlafaxine, N, O-didesmethylvenlafaxine, and other minor metabolites. In vitro studies indicate that the formation of ODV is catalyzed by CYP2D6; this has been confirmed in a clinical study showing that patients with low CYP2D6 levels (poor metabolizers) had increased levels of venlafaxine and reduced levels of ODV compared to people with normal CYP2D6 levels (extensive metabolizers) (see Figure 1).

Excretion

Approximately 87% of a venlafaxine dose is recovered in the urine within 48 hours as unchanged venlafaxine (5%), unconjugated ODV (29%), conjugated ODV (26%), or other minor inactive metabolites (27%).

### The prevention of recurrent episodes of depression with venlafaxine for two years (PREVENT) study: outcomes from the 2-year and combined maintenance phases [^1131qwTQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report second-year results from the 2-year maintenance phase of a long-term study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine extended release (ER) in preventing recurrence of depression.

Method

Outpatients with recurrent unipolar depression (DSM-IV criteria; N = 1096) were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 10 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine ER or fluoxetine. Responders (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D(17)] total score ≤ 12 and ≥ 50% decrease from baseline) entered a 6-month, double-blind continuation phase on the same medication. Continuation-phase responders were enrolled into maintenance treatment consisting of 2 consecutive 12-month phases. At the start of each maintenance phase, venlafaxine ER responders were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with venlafaxine ER or placebo, and fluoxetine responders were continued for each period. The second 12-month maintenance phase compared the time to recurrence of depression with venlafaxine ER (75 to 300 mg/day) versus placebo as the primary efficacy measure. The primary definition of recurrence was a HAM-D(17) total score > 12 and < 50% reduction from baseline (acute phase) at 2 consecutive visits or at the last valid visit prior to discontinuation. The time to recurrence was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between the venlafaxine ER and placebo groups using log-rank tests. Secondary outcome measures included rates of response and remission (defined as HAM-D(17) ≤ 7). The study was conducted from December 2000 through July 2005.

Results

The cumulative probabilities of recurrence through 12 months in the venlafaxine ER (N = 43) and placebo (N = 40) groups were 8.0% (95% CI = 0.0 to 16.8) and 44.8% (95% CI = 27.6 to 62.0), respectively (p < .001). At month 12, using last-observation-carried-forward analysis, the rate of response or remission was significantly higher in the venlafaxine ER group (93%) than in the placebo group (63%; p = .002). Overall discontinuation rates were 28% and 63% in the venlafaxine ER and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were the primary reason for discontinuation for 1 patient (2%) in the venlafax-ine ER group and 4 (10%) in the placebo group. An analysis of the combined maintenance phases, which compared the risk of recurrence over 24 months for patients assigned to venlafaxine ER (N = 129) or placebo (N = 129) for the first maintenance phase, showed a significantly greater cumulative probability of recurrence through 24 months for the placebo group (47.3% [95% CI = 36.4 to 58.2]) than for the venlafaxine ER group (28.5% [95% CI = 18.3 to 38.7]; p = .005).

Conclusion

In this study, an additional 12 months of maintenance therapy with venlafaxine ER was effective in preventing recurrence of depression in patients who had been responders to venlafaxine ER after acute (10 weeks), continuation (6 months), and initial maintenance (12 months) therapy.

### Treatment of neuropathic pain with venlafaxine [^1147spfB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of successful treatment of neuropathic pain with venlafaxine.

Case Report

A 39-year-old white woman presented with neuropathic back pain. The patient obtained 50% pain relief with consecutive use of amitriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine. Anticholinergic effects prompted a switch to extended-release venlafaxine 75 mg/d. Pain relief was as effective with this therapy as with the tricyclic antidepressants. The absence of adverse effects allowed the patient to discontinue all laxatives.

Discussion

Venlafaxine is an antidepressant that inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. This is the major mechanism by which tricyclic antidepressants relieve neuropathic pain. Venlafaxine does not bind to muscarinic-cholinergic, histaminic or alpha1-adrenergic receptors responsible for the common adverse effects seen with tricyclic antidepressants.

Conclusions

This report describes the efficacious use of venlafaxine in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are needed to explore this further.

### Evaluation of switch-to-brand rates as a potential signal for therapeutic equivalency of generic antidepressants: a real-world retrospective cohort study [^115rrpvW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Negative clinical outcomes after switching from brand to generic antidepressants have raised concerns regarding therapeutic equivalency. This research aims to estimate the prevalence of switching and to identify predictors for generic to brand switching for various antidepressants. This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a 10% random sample of enrollees in the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims database from 2007–2015. The base cohort consisted of commercially insured patients who were prescribed escitalopram, duloxetine, or venlafaxine extended release (ER) anytime from the year prior to the generic launch through December 2014. The primary outcome was defined as a switch from generic to a brand within 14 days of sustained generic use in a 1-year follow-up period. Adjusted logistic regression and generalized estimating equations for repeated measures estimated the drug specific and overall odds of switch-to-brand among brand initiators relative to generic initiators, respectively. A total of 102,831 unique patients across 3 drug products contributed to the final analytic sample. The overall prevalence of switch from generic to brand was 0.74%. Across all three antidepressants, brands initiators were more likely to experience a switch-to-brand: escitalopram (odds ratio (OR): 14.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 11.14–18.64), duloxetine (OR: 8.08, 95% CI: 4.85–13.41) and venlafaxine ER (OR: 16.46, 95% CI: 11.56–23.46). The pooled odds of a switch-to-brand in brand vs. generic initiators was 13.77 (95% CI: 11.35–16.71). This study suggests a low overall switch-to-brand prevalence and may support therapeutic equivalence between brand and generic antidepressants. Initiating with a brand product was the strongest predictor for switching back to brand and suggests that patient experience may play a role in drug utilization.

### A randomized, double-blind comparison of duloxetine and venlafaxine in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder [^11368bjD]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical trials assessing antidepressant therapies typically include separate assessments of efficacy (benefit) and adverse events (risk). Global benefit-risk (GBR) assessment allows the simultaneous evaluation of both efficacy and adverse events. The objective was to compare the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine using GBR assessment.

Methods

Data were combined from two similarly designed, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies in which patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to either duloxetine 60 mg/day or venlafaxine extended release (XR) 150 mg/day (75 mg/day for the first 2 weeks) for a 6-week fixed dosing period followed by an additional 6 weeks of treatment in which the dose could be increased up to 120 mg/day for duloxetine and 225 mg/day for venlafaxine. Patients completing the study (or receiving study drug for 2 weeks or more) were eligible to enter a taper period where the dose of study drug was gradually reduced over 1–2 weeks prior to drug discontinuation. The primary outcome measure (defined a priori) was the GBR comparison of duloxetine 60 mg/day and venlafaxine XR 150 mg/day after 6 weeks of treatment. In the GBR analysis, benefit was defined as remission at endpoint [17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) 7]. Risk was defined by four categories: patients having either no adverse events (AEs), AEs with no severity rating greater than moderate, AEs with at least one severity rating of severe, or having discontinued with a reason of self-reported adverse event (regardless of any AE severity). Additional efficacy measures included HAMD17 total score and subscales, HAMA, CGI-S, and PGI-I. Safety and tolerability were assessed via analysis of reasons for discontinuation, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuation-emergent adverse events, and changes in vital signs, weight, and laboratory analytes.

Results

There were no significant differences between duloxetine 60 mg/day and venlafaxine 150 mg/day as measured by GBR assessment at the end of 6 weeks (-1.418 vs. -1.079, P = 0.217) or 12 weeks (-0.349 vs. -0.121, P = 0.440), nor were there significant differences between treatment groups on the majority of efficacy measures. Significantly more venlafaxine-treated patients (74.5%) completed 12 weeks of treatment compared with duloxetine-treated patients (64.8%, P = 0.006). Nausea was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) for both drugs, and was significantly higher with duloxetine 60 mg/day compared to venlafaxine 150 mg/day during the first 6 weeks of treatment (43.6% vs. 35.0%, P0.05). During the taper period, significantly more venlafaxine-treated patients reported discontinuation-emergent adverse events (DEAEs) than duloxetine-treated patients. From a safety perspective, significantly more venlafaxine-treated patients (n = 4) than duloxetine-treated patients (n = 0, P = 0.047) experienced sustained elevations of systolic blood pressure during the fixed dosing period. Otherwise, there were few significant differences in safety measures found between treatment groups during 6 and 12 weeks of therapy.

Conclusions

Duloxetine 60 mg/day and venlafaxine XR 150 mg/day have similar benefit-risk profiles on the basis of a comparison utilizing GBR assessment. The implications of the more subtle differences between these drugs, as well as for interpreting the GBR assessment, are discussed.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride, extended release [^114mUCp6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) in plasma are attained within 3 days of oral multiple dose therapy. Venlafaxine and ODV exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range of 75 to 450 mg/day. The mean ± SD apparent elimination half-life for venlafaxine and ODV after administration of 75 mg Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets under fed conditions were 10.7 ± 3.2 hours and 12.5 ± 3.0 hours respectively. Venlafaxine and ODV are minimally bound at therapeutic concentrations to plasma proteins (27% and 30%, respectively).

Absorption and Distribution

Venlafaxine is well absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver. ODV is the only major active metabolite. On the basis of mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is about 45%. Administration of 75 mg Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets under fed conditions resulted in mean ± SD venlafaxine Cmaxof 26.9 ± 13.4 ng/mL and AUC of 1,536.3 ± 496.8 ng·hr/mL. Tmaxwas 6.3 ± 2.3 hours. ODV mean ± SD Cmax, AUC, Tmaxafter administration of 75 mg Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets under fed conditions were 97.9 ± 29.4 ng/mL, 2,926.0 ± 746.1 ng·hr/mL, and 11.6 ± 2.9 hours, respectively.

### Geriatric depression treatment in nonresponders to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^113UTomB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Up to a third of elderly patients with major depressive disorder are treatment resistant, yet little objective evidence is available to guide the clinician in managing these patients. We report here our experience with elderly subjects with prospectively defined treatment-resistant depression in 2 separate research studies: one entailing an augmentation strategy, the other a change to venlafaxine extended release (XR).

Method

Fifty-three elderly subjects with major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria who failed treatment with paroxetine plus interpersonal psychotherapy received 1 to 3 trials of augmentation with bupropion sustained release, nortriptyline, or lithium. Successively fewer subjects entered each sequential trial of augmentation. Twelve subjects subsequently received venlafaxine XR monotherapy. Response to treatment was defined as a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of < 10 for 3 weeks.

Results

Sixty percent of subjects (N = 32) responded to some form of augmentation, with 45% (24/53), 31% (5/16), and 43% (3/7) responding to the first, second, and third augmentation trials, respectively. The mean time to response after starting the first augmentation trial was 6.0 (SD = 5.8) weeks. Forty-two percent (N = 5) of the venlafaxine XR-treated subjects responded with the mean time to response of 6.4 (SE = 0.9) weeks. Adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation and falls were more common in the augmentation subjects than in the venlafaxine XR subjects.

Conclusion

We observed similar rates and speed of response with an augmentation strategy and a strategy of switching to venlafaxine XR in elderly subjects with prospectively defined treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Venlafaxine XR was generally better tolerated than the augmentation strategies. Further investigation of venlafaxine XR as a preferred strategy for treatment-resistant geriatric depression is warranted.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^112s7unP]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A further limitation is that, although it provides evidence that changing therapy after failure to remit at an early point (in our study 3 weeks) may be preferable to waiting a longer period (e.g. the oft-recommended 6 to 8 weeks), the design did not specifically address the optimal timing of the decision to switch or combine. One RCT compared switching to duloxetine immediately after non-response to 4weeks of escitalopram against continuing 4 more weeks on escitalopram and then switching if non-responsive: the two arms did not differ in their primary outcome of time to response, while there was significant increase in a secondary outcome of remission in the early switch arm than in the later switch arm. Another recent RCT examined the value of switching escitalopram to venlafaxine if patients have shown minimal improvement after 2 weeks; remission rates were 8% higher in the switched than in the continuation arm, but this difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to a small sample size (n = 192, p = 0.21). Thus, the optimal time to combine or switch remains uncertain.

Strengths of this pragmatic trial primarily relate to design features that enhance the real-world application of the results. We employed a large number of study sites using broad eligibility criteria, and thus enrolled sufficient patients to achieve high power to establish or refute differences between groups. Because Japan does not have a primary care system, patients with new onset depressive episodes usually consult office practice psychiatrists directly. Thus, in many other countries, primary care doctors would see and begin treatment of most participants entered in SUN☺D. In comparison to many multi-centre trials, we were able to enrol a large proportion (2011 of 7895) of potentially eligible patients. Enrolment of patients not yet treated for their current episode is another strength, eliminating a potential source of variability. For step 1 randomisation, we excluded patients who did not tolerate a low dose of sertraline, faithfully addressing the clinical question in which patients and clinicians are interested: In patients who tolerate an initial low dose of sertraline, should clinicians titrate to the maximum dose? For step 2 randomisation, we selected alternative interventions that are recommended in practice guidelines and are widely used.

### A double-blind switch study of paroxetine and venlafaxine in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115YmXG2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment guidelines for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) propose to switch serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in case of refractoriness. However, no controlled research has been published yet that prospectively examined the effects of changing SRIs. This article describes the first double-blind switch study of 2 SRIs in patients with OCD.

Method

150 patients with primary OCD, according to DSM-IV criteria, were randomly assigned in a 12-week, double-blind trial to receive dosages titrated upward to 300 mg/day of venlafaxine (N = 75) or 60 mg/day of paroxetine (N = 75). Primary efficacy was assessed by the change from baseline on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), and nonresponse was defined as less than 25% reduction on the Y-BOCS. After a 4-week tapering phase, 43 nonresponders were switched to 12 additional weeks of the alternate antidepressant, of which 16 patients received venlafaxine and 27 received paroxetine.

Results

Eighteen of 43 patients benefited from a switch to the alternate SRI with a mean ± SD decrease of at least 25% on the Y-BOCS. At the end of 12 weeks, responder rates were 56% for paroxetine (15/27) and 19% for venlafaxine (3/16). An intent-to-treat, last-observation-carried-forward analysis demonstrated a mean decrease on the Y-BOCS of 1.8 ± 3.5 in the venlafaxine group and 6.5 ± 7.1 in the paroxetine group. After 2 consecutive SRI trials, 109 of 150 patients (73%) achieved a Y-BOCS decrease of at least 25%.

Conclusion

The results of the current study show that 42% of the nonresponders benefited from a crossover to the other SRI, and that paroxetine was more efficacious than venlafaxine in the treatment of nonresponders to a previous SRI trial. Switching SRIs in case of refractoriness may be considered a useful strategy for patients with OCD.

### Economic burden associated with extended-release vs immediate-release drug formulations among Medicare part D and medicaid beneficiaries [^116AGeUB]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

For this cross-sectional study, the primary analysis was performed using the publicly available 2012–2017 Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Event data set, which contains medication expenditures for approximately 70% of all Medicare beneficiaries, and the Medicaid Spending and Utilization Data set, which contains national-level drug utilization data for outpatient drugs paid for by state Medicaid agencies. Because all data were deidentified and publicly available, The University of Texas Southwestern Human Research Protection Program determined this project did not meet criteria for human subjects' research and did not require institutional review board approval. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The Medicare data set contains 2883 formulations, whereas the Medicaid data set contains 3369 formulations (Figure 1). Drugs with ER formulations in the data sets were identified independently by 2 of us (A.S and N.S.). The ER formulations with disease-specific indications or well-established therapeutic or adverse effect superiority compared with generic IR formulations were excluded (niacin, nifedipine, metoprolol succinate, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and tolterodine). Only drugs with cardiovascular, diabetes, neurologic, and psychiatric indications were included. The study included only oral medications with ER and generic IR formulations with more than 200 claims in 2017 (Figure 1). Only drugs with ER formulations saving at most 1 additional daily dose compared with their generic IR counterparts were included. We extracted data on drug name, number of claims, number of units dispensed, and total expenditure incurred (overall and per claim) for the ER and generic IR formulations. The Medicare data set–reported spending included both beneficiary and government contributions, whereas the Medicaid data set reported both federal and state reimbursement to pharmacies. These data include only total costs to both Medicare and Medicaid and do not account for out-of-pocket costs for the patient. To conservatively estimate the cost, we assumed that all patients who switched to generic IR formulations would use the maximum number of daily administrations recommended. We calculated the savings with the following formula: estimated savings = (daily ER drug dose per unit price − daily IR drug dose per unit price) × total ER drug units dispensed.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose study of venlafaxine extended release capsules in adult outpatients with panic disorder [^1166bWdz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release (ER) in short-term treatment of panic disorder.

Method

In this multicenter, double-blind study, conducted from April 2001 to December 2002, 343 adult outpatients who met criteria for panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were randomly assigned to flexible-dose venlafaxine ER (75–225 mg/d) or placebo for 10 weeks (N = 155 per group, intent-to-treat population). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of panic-free patients as assessed using the Sheehan Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale. Key secondary measures included the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale response (score = 1 or 2). Last-observation-carried-forward data were analyzed, and statistical significance was set at p ≤ .05.

Results

At week 10, the percentage of patients who were free from full-symptom panic attacks was 52% in the venlafaxine ER group and 43% in the placebo group (p = .11). Mean change from baseline in PDSS total score was significantly (p = .006) greater for the venlafaxine ER group (-9.3) than for the placebo group (-7.5), and significantly (p = .03) more venlafaxine ER-treated patients achieved CGI-I response (71%) than did those receiving placebo (59%) at week 10. Treatment with venlafaxine ER was generally safe and well tolerated. Adverse events were the primary or secondary cause for discontinuation for 7 placebo patients (4%) and 12 venlafaxine ER patients (7%).

Conclusions

Venlafaxine ER appears to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in short-term treatment of panic disorder, although the results fell just short of significance on the primary outcome measure.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor) [^1141ceb6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5	Panic Disorder

The recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg per day of Effexor XR for 7 days. Patients not responding to 75 mg per day may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 7 days.

2.6	Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Effexor XR

Prior to initiating treatment with Effexor XR, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.7	Switching Patients from Effexor Tablets

Patients with depression who are currently being treated with Effexor may be switched to Effexor XR at the nearest equivalent dose (mg per day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine twice a day to 75 mg Effexor XR once daily. However, individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.

2.8	Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Reduce the Effexor XR total daily dose by 50% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) or hepatic cirrhosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.9	Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment

Reduce the Effexor XR total daily dose by 25% to 50% in patients with mild (CLcr 60–89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30–59 mL/min) renal impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients undergoing hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Because there was much individual variability in clearance between patients with renal impairment, individualization of dosage is recommended in some patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) in plasma are attained within 3 days of oral multiple dose therapy. Venlafaxine and ODV exhibited linear kinetics over the dose range of 75 to 450 mg/day. The mean ± SD apparent elimination half-life for venlafaxine and ODV after administration of 75 mg venlafaxine extended-release tablets under fed conditions were 10.7 ± 3.2 hours and 12.5 ± 3.0 hours respectively. Venlafaxine and ODV are minimally bound at therapeutic concentrations to plasma proteins (27% and 30%, respectively).

Absorption and Distribution

Venlafaxine is well absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver. ODV is the only major active metabolite. On the basis of mass balance studies, at least 92% of a single oral dose of venlafaxine is absorbed. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine is about 45%. Administration of 75 mg venlafaxine extended-release tablets under fed conditions resulted in mean ± SD venlafaxine Cmaxof 26.9 ± 13.4 ng/mL and AUC of 1536.3 ± 496.8 ng∙hr/mL. Tmaxwas 6.3 ± 2.3 hours. ODV mean ± SD Cmax, AUC, Tmaxafter administration of 75 mg venlafaxine extended-release tablets under fed conditions were 97.9 ± 29.4 ng/mL, 2926.0 ± 746.1 ng∙hr/mL, and 11.6 ± 2.9 hours, respectively.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111jzGUr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sequential strategies beyond antipsychotic augmentation — modest evidence supports augmentation of SRIs with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; specifically, exposure and response prevention [ERP]) and augmentation of CBT with SRIs, although some studies have demonstrated no added benefit from combining SRIs and CBT; in the absence of definitive data, combination treatment is provided to treat a co-occurring disorder that is SRI responsive, to augment a partial response to monotherapy, and to reduce the chance of relapse when medication is discontinued. For patients who do not respond to their first SRI, expert opinion and clinical trial data support switching to a different SRI; clinical experience suggests that response rates to a second SRI trial are close to 50% but may diminish as the number of failed adequate trials increases. A switch to venlafaxine at doses ranging from 225 mg/day to 350 mg/day is supported by active comparator trials and open-label studies, and a switch to mirtazapine is supported by one open pilot study and a double-blind discontinuation trial. If earlier strategies are not effective, expert opinion and three open-label studies support clomipramine augmentation of SSRIs; if clomipramine is added, plasma levels of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine should be assayed 2–3 weeks after reaching a dose of 50 mg/day.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112HCers]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder pharmacotherapy switching after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) nonresponse states that patients who do not respond to their first SSRI may have a better likelihood of response with another SSRI [I], whereas a switch to venlafaxine is less likely to produce an adequate response [II]. For patients who have not benefitted from their first SSRI trial, a switch to mirtazapine can also be considered [III], but the available evidence does not allow one to predict the chance of response to switching medications. SRI nonresponders, like partial responders, have responded to augmentation with antipsychotic medications [II] or CBT [II].

### A randomized, double-blind, active-control study of sertraline versus venlafaxine XR in major depressive disorder [^116MxfEj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Sertraline may produce dual neurotransmitter effects similar to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); however, it has been tested against an SNRI in only 1 previous study, and never at an optimal dose. The objective of the current multisite study was to compare relatively higher doses of sertraline (i.e., 150 mg/day) and venlafaxine extended release (XR) (225 mg/day) in outpatients with major depressive disorder.

Method

Subjects with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with sertraline (N = 82) or venlafaxine XR (N = 78). The study ran from January 2002 through January 2003. The primary outcome measure was the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire; secondary outcome variables included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

Results

Both treatments led to significant improvement in depressive symptoms and quality-of-life measures. No significant differences were noted between treatment groups for final scores on the primary or secondary measures. The treatment groups did not differ significantly in the percentage of responders (sertraline = 55%, venlafaxine XR = 65%; intent-to-treat [ITT] sample) or remitters (sertra-line = 38%, venlafaxine XR = 49%; ITT sample), although the proportions are similar to those found in earlier selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) vs. venlafaxine meta-analyses. In patients who achieved the maximum dose of drug and maintained it for 3 weeks, response rates were similar to those found at lower doses (sertraline = 59%, venlafaxine XR = 70%); however, remission rates for this sample were comparable for both drug groups (sertraline = 48%, venlafaxine XR = 50%).

Conclusions

The efficacies of sertraline and venlafaxine XR were comparable. Although response and remission rates did not differ statistically, the rates were analogous to those reported in previous meta-analyses. However, at clinically relevant higher doses, the remission rates were very similar.

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113h76DH]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28554 records were identified through our search (24524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Economic burden associated with extended-release vs immediate-release drug formulations among Medicare part D and medicaid beneficiaries [^112beGke]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We quantified Medicare Part D and Medicaid spending associated with prescription of ER formulations and found a total potential annual cost savings of up $2.6 billion that could be achieved by switching these drugs to therapeutically comparable generic IR formulations in both Medicare and Medicaid. These savings were demonstrated using only ER formulations saving at most 1 additional daily dose compared with their generic IR formulation counterpart.

Some ER formulations have superior therapeutic effects (eg, metoprolol succinate for heart failure, tolterodine for overactive bladder, and venlafaxine for depression) or fewer adverse effects (eg, niacin for dyslipidemia, nifedipine for patients with heart failure) compared with their generic IR formulation counterparts. Furthermore, ER formulations may be associated with reduced pill burden and improved patient convenience and medication adherence. However, most of the existing literature on ER vs IR formulations (eTable 2 in the Supplement) has evaluated therapeutic efficacy rather than medication adherence and has frequently demonstrated therapeutic equivalence. In addition, several drugs with both ER and IR formulations available have had no direct ER vs IR comparison studies performed for adherence or therapeutic efficacy (eTable 2 in the Supplement). A meta-analysis of 23 studiesshowed no association between administration frequency and medication adherence. Another meta-analysis of 76 studiesshowed an adherence benefit of ER formulations only when the administration frequency was reduced by 2 or more daily doses compared with the corresponding IR formulation. To further address this, we only included ER drugs with 1 fewer daily doses than the IR drug counterpart. Taken together, the existing evidence suggests that therapeutic and adherence-related benefits of ER formulations are medication specific and not consistent across all available ER formulations.

Costs of second-line strategies — economic evidence — are limited; cost data are very sparse, and the only non-industry-sponsored cost-effectiveness study compared switching from one SGA to another and reported that at a 9-week time horizon there were no differences among bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine after unsuccessful treatment with citalopram, but evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) to draw conclusions; no cost-effectiveness analysis compared nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatments for adults with MDD who did not achieve remission after adequate initial treatment.

### Antidepressants: update on new agents and indications [^112zX5Zc]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

A number of antidepressants have emerged in the U.S. market in the past two decades. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice in the treatment of depression, and they are also effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. New indications for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors include post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Extended-release venlafaxine has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine, which is unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is unique in its action — stimulating the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. The choice of antidepressant drug depends on the agent's pharmacologic profile, secondary actions, and tolerability. Sexual dysfunction related to the use of antidepressants may be addressed by reducing the dosage, switching to another agent, or adding another drug to overcome the sexual side effects. Augmentation with lithium or triiodothyronine may be useful in patients who are partially or totally resistant to antidepressant treatment. Finally, tapering antidepressant medication may help to avoid discontinuation syndrome or antidepressant withdrawal.

### Relative bioavailability of two formulations of venlafaxine extended-release 75-mg capsules in healthy Brazilian male volunteers: a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-period crossover study in the fasting and fed States [^114k1qn9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The oral antidepressant venlafaxine hydrochloride is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence of a new generic formulation of venlafaxine extended-release 75-mg capsules (test) and the available branded formulation (reference) to comply with regulatory criteria for marketing of the test product in Brazil.

Methods

This single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy male volunteers and consisted of separate fast- ing and fed phases. A single oral dose of the test or reference formulation was followed by a 7-day washout period, after which subjects received the alternative formulation. There was a 3-month interval between the fasting and fed portions of the study. There was no standardization of race because of the difficulty of achieving standardization in the Brazilian population. Blood samples were collected before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing. Venlafaxine concentrations were determined using an HPLC-MS/MS method. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios (test:reference) for C(max) and AUC(0-t) were within the regulatory range of 80% to 125%. Adverse events were monitored through-out the study based on vital signs, laboratory tests, interviews, and spontaneous patient reports.

Results

Forty-eight subjects were enrolled in both phases of the study; all 48 subjects completed the fasting phase, and 1 subject withdrew during the fed phase. The mean (SD) age of participants in the fasting and fed phases was 24.96 (5.5) and 24.90 (4.7) years, respectively; their mean weight was 69.65 (9.6) and 71.00 (10.6) kg and their mean height was 172.0 (6.9) and 173.0 (6.6) cm. Under fasting conditions, the arithmetic mean venlafaxine C(max) was 35.705 (23.946) ng/mL for the test formulation and 34.470 (20.639) ng/mL for the reference formulation, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.04. The arithmetic mean AUC(0-t) for the respective formulations was 562.015 (481.875) and 508.509 (439.456) ng · h/mL, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.11. The arithmetic mean T(max) was 6.188 (1.560) and 5.885 (1.648) hours. Under fed conditions, the arithmetic mean venlafaxine C(max) was 42.892 (24.348) ng/mL for the test formulation and 46.275 (23.011) ng/mL for the reference formulation, with a geometric mean ratio of 0.93. The arithmetic mean AUC(0-t) for the respective formulations was 737.218 (603.998) and 682.124 (524.713) ng · h/mL, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.08. The arithmetic mean T(max) was 6.787 (1.769) and 5.957 (1.661) hours. There were no significant increases in venlafaxine C(max), AUC(0-t), or T(max) for either formulation in the fed phase compared with the fasting phase. In both the fasting and fed portions of the study, the 90% CIs for the ratio (test:reference) of log-transformed C(max) (fasting: 93.24–105.93; fed: 84.67–97.85) and AUC(0-t) (fasting: 102.90–116.71; fed: 98.19–114.41) were within the acceptance range for bioequivalence. The most common adverse events (≥ 5% of subjects) in the fasting phase were nausea (46%), diarrhea (29%), headache (29%), vomiting (15%), and colic (6%); the most common adverse events in the fed phase were nausea (15%), headache (13%), and dizziness (9%).

Conclusion

In this single-dose study in healthy fasting and fed volunteers, the test formulation of venlafaxine extended-release 75-mg capsules met Brazilian regulatory criteria for bioequivalence to the reference formulation.

Paroxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder — randomized evidence shows acute and continuation benefits: "Three double-blind placebo-controlled trials show paroxetine to be more effective than placebo acutely; an additional double-blind study shows the superiority of paroxetine relative to placebo in maintaining response over 6 months of continuation treatment". In a 12-week double-blind trial of paroxetine 20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 60 mg/day, or placebo, endpoint response rates (YBOCS-25% or CGI-S decrease ≥ 2) were 25% and 29% for 40 mg/day and 60 mg/day, 16% for 20 mg/day, and 13% for placebo. In a 12-week flexible-dose study, the CGI-I response rate was 50% with paroxetine versus 24% with placebo. In another 12-week trial of flexibly dosed paroxetine 20–60 mg/day (mean 37 mg/day), more than half (55%) were YBOCS-25% responders versus 35% with placebo, and flexibly dosed clomipramine 150–250 mg/day (mean 113 mg/day) produced the same responder rate as paroxetine. Versus venlafaxine over 12 weeks, YBOCS-35% responder rates did not differ (paroxetine up to 60 mg/day 44% [n = 76] vs venlafaxine up to 300 mg/day 37% [n = 75]), though YBOCS-25% response favored paroxetine (66% vs 49%); after double-blind medication switch in nonresponders, YBOCS-25% responders were 56% (15/27) for paroxetine vs 19% (3/19) for venlafaxine. For continuation, responders randomized after a 12-week study and 6-month open-label extension (N = 105) had a higher relapse on placebo than paroxetine (59% vs 38%) with mean time to relapse 29 days vs 63 days.

### Desvenlafaxine: another "me too" drug? [^111XNB1P]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare desvenlafaxine with its parent drug, venlafaxine, to determine the usefulness of this new medication.

Data Sources

Information was obtained through a MEDLINE search (1966-June 2008) and from published abstracts. Search terms included desvenlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, Pristiq, major depressive disorder, and venlafaxine.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies and abstracts pertaining to desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine were considered for inclusion. Preference was given to human data.

Data Synthesis

Desvenlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and is the active metabolite of the antidepressant venlafaxine. The recommended dose is 50 mg daily, based on the efficacy and safety data of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 400 mg of desvenlafaxine. The response and remission rates of depression at 8 weeks for the 50-mg dose are 51–63% and 31–45%, respectively. These rates are comparable with those seen with venlafaxine (58% and 45%, respectively). Adverse effects are also similar to those of venlafaxine, with the most common being insomnia, somnolence, dizziness, and nausea. The decreased potential of CYP2D6 activity with desvenlafaxine compared with the parent drug may be a potential advantage in patients on other medications metabolized via this enzymatic pathway. Also, desvenlafaxine tablets are less expensive than extended-release (XR) venlafaxine, which may decrease healthcare costs in the short term. However, venlafaxine XR is expected to go off patent in 2010.

Conclusions

With the overall similarity between these 2 drugs and the potential lack of cost savings, the need for desvenlafaxine and its ultimate utility in treating major depressive disorder appears to be insignificant.

### Immediate-release versus controlled-release formulations: pharmacokinetics of newer antidepressants in relation to nausea [^116MSh1s]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Newer antidepressants are generally as efficacious as but often have fewer side effects than their predecessors such as the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. These newer antidepressants include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline; venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; and bupropion, a selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Most of these antidepressants have half-lives that enable them to be administered as infrequently as 1 to 3 times per day. To further improve upon the ease of use, controlled-release formulations of bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine have been manufactured. Potential pharmacokinetic advantages of these formulations include lower peak plasma drug concentrations and smaller fluctuations between peak and trough plasma drug concentrations, which might influence the tolerability of these medications. Tolerability advantages seen with some of these medications include diminished nausea. The 3 controlled-release agents that are designed to be taken daily — bupropion, paroxetine, and venlafaxine — are associated with lower incidences of nausea overall and nausea leading to treatment discontinuation than are their immediate-release formulations. However, the rates of nausea are similar with both formulations of fluoxetine, despite higher peak plasma drug concentrations and greater fluctuation between peak and trough plasma drug concentrations with fluoxetine weekly than with fluoxetine daily. Although the connection has not been proven, more stable pharmacokinetic profiles might be the cause for the low occurrence of nausea with some controlled-release newer antidepressants.

### A critical examination of the sensitivity of unidimensional subscales derived from the hamilton depression rating scale to antidepressant drug effects [^115sPuEm]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Unidimensional subscales for assessment of major depression may be more sensitive to antidepressant drug effects than the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). To further examine this possibility, we analyzed pooled data from eight comparable, well-controlled clinical trials of venlafaxine and compared such subscales and the 17-item HAM-D (HAM-D(17)) based on effect size and number of patients required for 80% power. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the HAM-D among intent-to-treat patients (2045) randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine (immediate release, n = 474; extended release, n = 377), one of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (n = 748), or placebo (n = 446) for up to 8 weeks. With SSRIs or venlafaxine vs. placebo, subscales yielded effect sizes (0.328–0.528) 16 to 76% larger than the HAM-D(17) did (0.237 and 0.396, respectively), and required 31 to 64% fewer patients for 80% power. With venlafaxine vs. SSRIs, the subscales showed no advantage over the HAM-D(17); all devices yielded comparable, positive effect sizes (0.183–0.195). Final subscale scores significantly predicted (all P < 0.05) whether patients met criteria for remission (eg, HAM-D(17) score of ≤ 7). These findings suggest that unidimensional subscales are more sensitive to antidepressant drug effects than the HAM-D(17) is, but only in active agent/placebo comparisons. Our data further suggest the subscales can predict the presence of remission. Given these findings, prudent use of these subscales may be appropriate, cost-effective, and informative.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121vKRE]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Other pharmacological interventions

Six studies focused on oral pharmacological interventions for TRD. Lenze et al compared 12 weeks of augmentation with aripiprazole to placebo. All patients received venlafaxine extended release, titrated to 300 mg/day. After 12 weeks, those not in remission were randomised to aripiprazole (10–15 mg) or placebo augmentation. On the primary outcome of the MADRS, remission rates were higher in the treatment group (n = 181, OR 1.93,1.04–3.58). Lenze et al included the Scale of Suicidal Ideation as a secondary outcome; ideation resolved in 22 out of 30 (73.3%) participants presenting with suicidal ideation in the active group at baseline and 11 out of 25 (44%) in the placebo group (p = 0.02).

Navarro et al compared two active treatments over 10 weeks, with the second group switching their antidepressant rather than adding mirtazapine. Participants who did not remit after 10 weeks of venlafaxine (225–300 mg/day) were randomised to mirtazapine augmentation (30 mg/day) or switch to imipramine (adjusted to plasma levels). 39.28% of those receiving mirtazapine, relative to 71.43% on imipramine, achieved remission (p = 0.001).

Forester et al evaluated the impact of pharmacogenetic-guided prescribing. Over 24 weeks, clinicians had access to this report for intervention but not control participants. Assessors were only blinded up to week 8, the primary endpoint, where the OR favoured the treatment group (n = 184, OR 3.20, 1.26–8.14).

### Global benefit-risk assessment of antidepressants: venlafaxine XR and fluoxetine [^116EmQ4c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Quantifying efficacy and safety differences between drugs is difficult because rigorous statistical methods to assess benefit and risk simultaneously are lacking.

Methods

Global benefit-risk (GBR) analysis of clinical trial data was used retrospectively to compare venlafaxine extended release (XR) and fluoxetine. Of 301 outpatients with moderate to severe depression given venlafaxine XR 75–225 mg/day (n = 100), fluoxetine 20–60 mg/day (n = 103), or placebo (n = 98) for up to 8 weeks, 295 qualified for analysis. Primary efficacy variables were Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) remission (final on-therapy score ≤ 7) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) response (very much or much improved).

Results

Using remission as outcome, the relative gain of venlafaxine XR was 1.78 vs. fluoxetine (P < 0.01) and 2.04 vs. placebo (P ≤ 0.005). HAM-D remission benefit exceeded risk for significantly more patients given venlafaxine XR (34%) than with fluoxetine (19%, P = 0.023) or placebo (19%, P = 0.017). The odds ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] that patients would be in the benefit > risk category were 2.1 (1.1–4.0) and 2.2 (1.1–4.3) for venlafaxine XR vs. fluoxetine and placebo, respectively. For CGI response, relative gains of venlafaxine XR were 1.39 (P < 0.01) and 1.45 (P < 0.01) vs. fluoxetine and placebo; benefit exceeded risk in 66, 53, and 52% of patients given venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine, and placebo (P = 0.041 vs. venlafaxine XR), respectively.

Conclusions

GBR analysis can be applied to a wide array of efficacy and safety data to form statistical tests of clinically meaningful treatment comparisons. In this comparison, the GBR assessments on response and remission significantly favored venlafaxine XR.

### Duloxetine and venlafaxine-XR in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1128pitU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine has joined venlafaxine on the antidepressant market as a second serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. No previous studies have directly compared these drugs.

Objective

To compare indirectly the efficacy and safety of extended-release (XR) venlafaxine and duloxetine, the 2 currently available serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in treating major depressive disorder.

Methods

Outcomes from published, randomized, placebo-controlled trials reporting on moderately to severely depressed patients (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] ≥ 15 or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] ≥ 18). A systematic literature search of Cochrane, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (1996-January 2005) was performed. Two independent reviewers judged the trials for acceptance, and last observation carried forward data were extracted. Differences in remission (8-week HAM-D score ≤ 7 or MADRS ≤ 10), response (50% decrease on either scale), and dropout rates from lack of efficacy and adverse events were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. Each rate was contrasted with placebo. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results.

Results

Data were obtained from 8 trials evaluating 1754 patients for efficacy and 1791 patients for discontinuation/safety. Venlafaxine-XR rates were 17.8% (95% CI 9.0 to 26.5) and 24.4% (95% CI 15.0 to 37.7) greater than those with placebo for remission and response compared with 14.2% (95% CI 8.9 to 26.5) and 18.6% (95% CI 13.0 to 24.2) for duloxetine. Although numerically higher for venlafaxine-XR, no statistically significant differences were found between the drugs; however, both demonstrated overall remission and response rates significantly higher than the rates achieved with placebo (p < 0.001). Reported adverse events were comparable between drugs.

Conclusions

Venlafaxine-XR tends to have a favorable trend in remission and response rates compared with duloxetine. However, dropout rates and adverse events did not differ. A direct comparison is warranted to confirm this tendency.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram and venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^114wq6aw]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent and disabling condition. Escitalopram and venlafaxine extended release (XR) both are indicated for the treatment of GAD. Outpatients (ages 18–65 years) with DSM-IV-defined GAD (Hamilton Anxiety Scale [HAMA] ≥ 20) were eligible to participate in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, flexible-dose trial. Following randomization, patients received 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram (10–20 mg/day; N = 127), venlafaxine XR (75–225 mg/day; N = 129), or placebo (N = 136). The primary efficacy parameter was mean change from baseline at week 8 in HAMA total score, using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach. Secondary efficacy parameters were HAMA psychic anxiety subscale, Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Treatment was completed by 77% of patients. The least square mean difference for change from baseline at week 8 in HAMA total score for escitalopram and venlafaxine XR versus placebo were -1.52 (P = 0.09) and -2.27 (P = 0.01), respectively, for LOCF, and -1.92 (P = 0.033) and -3.02 (P = 0.001), respectively, for Observed Cases (OC). On all secondary parameters, both active treatments were significantly superior to placebo on the LOCF and OC analyses. Discontinuation due to adverse events was not different for escitalopram versus placebo (7 versus 5%, P = 0.61), but was significantly greater for venlafaxine XR (13%) versus placebo (P = 0.03). Venlafaxine XR, but not escitalopram, separated from placebo on the primary efficacy measure, using the LOCF approach. However, overall efficacy analyses suggest that escitalopram and venlafaxine XR are both effective treatments for GAD. Escitalopram was better tolerated.

### Comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles of brand-name and generic formulations of citalopram and venlafaxine: a crossover study [^1135oBzP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Generic drugs are lower-cost versions of patent-expired brand-name medications. Bioequivalence is decreed when the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the generic to the reference compound for the area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) fall within a 0.80 to 1.25 range. The aim of the present pilot study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of brand-name and generic formulations of citalopram and extended-release venlafaxine.

Method

Effexor XR/Novo-venlafaxine XR 75 mg and Celexa/Gen-citalopram 40 mg were studied in a randomized crossover design. Healthy male volunteers took either Effexor XR or Novo-venlafaxine XR for 4 days, a 4-day washout was allowed, and then participants took the other venlafaxine formulation for 4 days. This was followed by a washout of at least 7 days. The participants then took Celexa or Gen-citalopram for 8 days, a 14-day washout was allowed, and then participants took the other citalopram formulation for 8 days. In each of the study phases, the sequence of treatment (brand-name x generic) was randomly assigned. Plasma levels of drugs were measured at fixed intervals after participants took the drugs and at steady state. The study was conducted from November 2007 through July 2008.

Results

Twelve participants completed the venlafaxine study. Nine of the participants, plus 3 new participants, were then enrolled in the citalopram study, to maintain a total of 12. The plasma levels of citalopram were similar after ingestion of the brand-name and generic drugs. After ingestion of venlafaxine, the C(max) values were 36 ± 6 ng/mL and 52 ± 8 ng/mL in the brand-name and generic groups, respectively. The ratio of the log-transformed values of C(max) was 150% and, therefore, not within the acceptable 80% to 125% range. The concentration of the active metabolite of venlafaxine (O-desmethyl-venlafaxine [ODV]) was also significantly increased in the generic group (+43% higher in the generic group at 3 h; +48% higher at 5 h; p < .05). No differences were seen at steady state for either ODV or venlafaxine. Participants taking Novo-venlafaxine reported 3 times more side effects than those taking Effexor XR. Pill contents were identical in the 2 groups, but extraction of venlafaxine occurred more readily with the generic formulation than with the brand-name formulation, which required an additional sonication.

Conclusion

Gen-citalopram appeared to be bioequivalent to Celexa, whereas Novo-venlafaxine XR was not bioequivalent to Effexor XR. Consequently, the Novo-venlafaxine formulation released its active ingredient more rapidly and outside the acceptable norm.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^115razBs]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Appendix B: Pharmacotherapy — antidepressants monotherapy dosing for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) lists dosing and key safety points. Paroxetine immediate release (IR) is initiated at 10–20 mg daily and controlled release (CR) at 12.5 mg daily, with dose ranges of 20–50 mg daily and 12.5–50 mg. Sertraline is initiated at 25–50 mg daily with a 50–200 mg daily range. Venlafaxine IR starts at 25 mg 2 or 3 times a day and extended release (XR) at 37.5 mg daily, with dose ranges of 75–375 mg in 2–3 divided doses and 75–300 mg once daily. All antidepressants have a Black Box warning for increased risk of suicidality in children and young adults (≤ 24 years) in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Avoid abrupt discontinuation; withdrawal symptoms can occur with sudden discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), paroxetine and venlafaxine in particular. Paroxetine and sertraline have FDA indications for treating PTSD. Common adverse effects of the SSRIs and SNRIs include nausea, headache, diarrhea, nervousness, sexual dysfunction, dizziness. Hyponatremia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) can occur; risk is elevated in patients > 65 years. Venlafaxine can elevate blood pressure; caution is advised with patients with hypertension. Serotonin syndrome can occur, especially with concomitant medications that affect serotonin.

### Venlafaxine extended release versus conventional antidepressants in the remission of depressive disorders after previous antidepressant failure: ARGOS study [^113xALdT]. Depression and Anxiety (2005). Low credibility.

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be used as an alternative treatment for depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant. This randomized, open-label, multicenter study compared the effectiveness of the SNRI venlafaxine extended release (VXR) with that of conventional antidepressants (CA) in patients who were referred to an outpatient psychiatric specialty care setting for treatment after failure to tolerate or respond to at least 4 weeks of treatment with a CA in a primary care setting. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) score ≥ 17 were randomly assigned to treatment with an alternative CA or VXR. Remission was defined as a score ≤ 7 on the HAM-D17. Efficacy analyses were carried out on 3,097 patients from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (1,632 VXR; 1,465 CA). The antidepressants prescribed most frequently in the CA group were paroxetine (21.3%), citalopram (20.1%), sertraline (19.1%), fluoxetine (17.0%), and mirtazapine (7.9%). After 24 weeks of treatment, the VXR group demonstrated a significantly higher remission rate than did the CA group (59.3% VXR; 51.5% CA; P < .0001; odds ratio: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.19–1.58; P < .01). Despite the limitations of the open design, the results of this study suggest that venlafaxine extended release may be more effective than the conventional antidepressants used in this study when treating depressed patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to treatment with a conventional antidepressant.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of the antidepressant efficacy and tolerability of bupropion XR and venlafaxine XR [^113cnEwo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Bupropion, a noradrenaline/dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and venlafaxine, a serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, are both established antidepressants with proven efficacy in randomized controlled clinical trials. The objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, eight-week, flexible-dose study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the once-daily extended-release formulations of these two antidepressants compared with placebo. Patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to once-daily treatment with bupropion XR 150 mg (n = 204), the extended-release formulation of venlafaxine (venlafaxine XR) 75 mg (n = 198) or placebo (n = 189) during weeks 1 to 4, with the option to double the dose at week 5 if response was inadequate. In this study, bupropion XR did not demonstrate statistically significant evidence of greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo on week 8 Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating scale scores (primary endpoint) or on secondary endpoints including CGI, HAM-A and responder and remitter analyses. Descriptive statistics for venlafaxine XR indicated separation versus placebo on MADRS total scores at week 8 and other intermediate time points, and on other endpoints including CGI, HAM-A and responder and remitter analyses. Both active treatments elicited improvement on the Sheehan Disability Scale and its subscales and were generally well tolerated at the doses studied. Rates of nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, constipation, tremor, anorexia and male sexual dysfunction were elevated in the venlafaxine XR group, consistent with its mixed serotonergic/noradrenergic mechanism. Rates of dry mouth, insomnia and hyperhidrosis were elevated in the bupropion XR group, consistent with its catecholaminergic mechanism.

Special Populations

Age and Gender: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of 404 venlafaxine-treated patients from two studies involving both b.i.d. and t.i.d. regimens showed that dose-normalized trough plasma levels of either venlafaxine or ODV were unaltered by age or gender differences. Dosage adjustment based on the age or gender of a patient is generally not necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Extensive/Poor Metabolizers: Plasma concentrations of venlafaxine were higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than extensive metabolizers. Because the total exposure (AUC) of venlafaxine and ODV was similar in poor and extensive metabolizer groups, however, there is no need for different venlafaxine dosing regimens for these two groups.

Liver Disease: In 9 subjects with hepatic cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic disposition of both venlafaxine and ODV was significantly altered after oral administration of venlafaxine. Venlafaxine elimination half-life was prolonged by about 30%, and clearance decreased by about 50% in cirrhotic subjects compared to normal subjects. ODV elimination half-life was prolonged by about 60%, and clearance decreased by about 30% in cirrhotic subjects compared to normal subjects. A large degree of intersubject variability was noted. Three patients with more severe cirrhosis had a more substantial decrease in venlafaxine clearance (about 90%) compared to normal subjects.

### Management of postmenopausal hot flushes with venlafaxine hydrochloride: a randomized, controlled trial [^116ndeDJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of extended-release venlafaxine for the treatment of postmenopausal hot flushes.

Methods

Eighty postmenopausal women with more than 14 hot flushes per week were randomized to receive treatment with extended-release venlafaxine or placebo. Participants received 37.5 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 75 mg daily for 11 weeks. Daily hot flush severity scores and adverse effects were recorded by subjects. Baseline and monthly follow-up questionnaires assessed patient-perceived hot flush score, quality of life, and sexual function. Participants were treated for 12 weeks.

Results

Of the 80 subjects who enrolled in the study, 40 were in the treatment group and 40 in the control group. Of these, 61 completed the study (treatment, n = 29; control, n = 32). Subjective assessment at monthly visits of the effects of hot flush symptoms on daily living were significantly improved in the treatment group (P < .001). Hot flush severity scores based on daily diaries were somewhat lower in the treatment group, but the between-group difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.25). Three side effects, dry mouth, sleeplessness, and decreased appetite, were significantly more frequent in the venlafaxine group, but others, including dizziness, tremors, anxiety, diarrhea, and rash, were significantly less frequent. Ninety-three percent of participants in the venlafaxine group chose to continue treatment at the conclusion of the study.

Conclusion

Extended-release venlafaxine, 75 mg per day, is an effective treatment for postmenopausal hot flushes in otherwise healthy women, based on a significant decrease in patient-perceived hot flush score.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor) [^112bF38i]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.1	Major Depressive Disorder

The efficacy of Effexor XR (venlafaxine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules as a treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was established in two placebo-controlled, short-term (8 weeks for study 1; 12 weeks for study 2), flexible-dose studies, with doses starting at 75 mg per day and ranging to 225 mg per day in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria for MDD. In moderately depressed outpatients, the initial dose of venlafaxine was 75 mg per day. In both studies, Effexor XR demonstrated superiority over placebo on the primary efficacy measure defined as change from baseline in the HAM-D-21 total score to the endpoint visit, Effexor XR also demonstrated superiority over placebo on the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity of Illness scale. Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

A 4-week study of inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for MDD with melancholia utilizing Effexor in a range of 150 to 375 mg per day (divided in a three-times-a-day schedule) demonstrated superiority of Effexor over placebo based on the HAM-D-21 total score. The mean dose in completers was 350 mg per day (study 3).
