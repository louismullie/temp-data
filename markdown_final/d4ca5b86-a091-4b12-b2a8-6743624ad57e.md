## Question

Methotrexate (rheumatrex) 7.5 mg one tablet by mouth once per week

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether methotrexate 7.5 mg by mouth once weekly is an appropriate prescription and how to optimize it with dosing, folate, monitoring, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether 7.5 mg weekly is guideline-concordant for common indications like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Then, I should verify the need for folic acid supplementation and the best timing. Next, I will review baseline and ongoing laboratory monitoring, including renal and hepatic safety. After that, I need to consider dose escalation strategies and when to prefer subcutaneous administration. Finally, I should confirm contraindications, high-risk scenarios, and medication interactions that could alter safety or dosing decisions [^1154F81C] [^112P1psS].

> Let me first confirm the dose itself. Methotrexate 7.5 mg orally once weekly aligns with FDA-labeled starting doses for adult rheumatoid arthritis and is within the typical initiation range used in practice, although many guidelines encourage titration to at least 15 mg weekly within 4–6 weeks to optimize efficacy, so 7.5 mg is appropriate to start but often insufficient as a maintenance target in RA [^111JuVrY] [^11758QRU] [^113h75Jb].

> Wait, let me verify the indication-specific dosing ranges so I don't overgeneralize. For RA, the labeled starting dose is 7.5 mg weekly with escalation to effect, and doses above 20 mg weekly increase the risk of serious adverse reactions, so most patients stabilize between 15–20 mg weekly if tolerated [^111JuVrY]. For psoriasis, typical effective doses are 10–25 mg weekly, with a hard maximum of 30 mg weekly in guidelines, so 7.5 mg is on the low end and may be inadequate for moderate-to-severe disease unless used for tolerability or in combination regimens [^115YhfMF]. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, dosing is weight-based at 10 mg/m2 weekly, which is not directly comparable to a fixed 7.5 mg adult dose, reinforcing that 7.5 mg is an adult RA starting dose rather than a pediatric standard [^115YhfMF].

> Hold on, I should verify folate strategy because it meaningfully changes tolerability. Folic acid or folinic acid is recommended with low-dose weekly methotrexate to reduce gastrointestinal, hepatic, and hematologic adverse effects; common practice is 1 mg folic acid daily, or 5 mg once weekly taken 24 hours after methotrexate, and higher folate doses can further reduce toxicity without clear loss of efficacy, though very high doses may theoretically blunt response and should be individualized [^111JuVrY] [^112b4sf7] [^114vCwR1].

> I need to ensure baseline and early monitoring are explicit. Before or at initiation, obtain CBC with differential, liver enzymes and albumin, renal function, and screen for latent TB and hepatitis B/C per risk; during the first 1–2 months, check CBC and LFTs every 2–4 weeks, then, once stable, extend to every 3 months, with more frequent checks after dose changes or if intercurrent illness or dehydration increases risk; chest radiography is reasonable if pulmonary disease is suspected or as a baseline in some protocols [^112Era3e] [^114FCZCz] [^1154F81C] [^115rQjYi].

> Let me consider dose escalation and route, because underdosing delays disease control. The ACR conditionally recommends titrating to at least 15 mg weekly within 4–6 weeks if tolerated, and if oral intolerance or inadequate response occurs, switching to subcutaneous methotrexate can improve bioavailability and tolerability without necessarily increasing toxicity at comparable doses; split-dose oral regimens over 24 hours are another option for GI intolerance [^11758QRU] [^115U8k4x] [^115ZFTFJ].

> But wait, what if the patient has renal impairment or is elderly; I should double-check dosing cautions. Methotrexate is renally cleared, and impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions delay elimination and increase toxicity risk, so dose reduction and closer monitoring are required; in older adults, use caution due to reduced renal/hepatic reserve and consider more accurate renal function assessment beyond serum creatinine when eGFR is borderline [^113TBW8S] [^112P1psS].

> I will now examine hepatotoxicity risk and when to escalate hepatic surveillance. For patients without hepatic risk factors, monitor LFTs every 3–6 months and repeat in 2–4 weeks if there are mild elevations; persistent abnormalities or albumin decline warrant dose adjustment and GI referral, and liver biopsy is generally considered only with sustained transaminase elevations or after substantial cumulative exposure, whereas patients with risk factors warrant stricter monitoring and earlier biopsy considerations per dermatology guidelines [^1145anJ4] [^113aypz1] [^117FD3JQ].

> Hold on, I should verify key safety counseling and drug interactions so we avoid preventable harm. Emphasize that methotrexate is taken once weekly only, as daily dosing errors have caused fatalities; review interacting drugs such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics that can increase toxicity; counsel on alcohol moderation; and verify pregnancy status and effective contraception in those with reproductive potential given teratogenicity and pregnancy contraindication [^111JuVrY] [^1154F81C].

> Let me reconsider the original prescription phrasing. "Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) 7.5 mg, one tablet by mouth once per week" is appropriate as a starting dose for adult RA, but I should add explicit folic acid instructions, a clear titration plan toward 15–20 mg weekly if tolerated, and a monitoring schedule to ensure safety and efficacy; if the intended indication is psoriasis, I should confirm that 7.5 mg is a bridge dose and that escalation toward 15–25 mg weekly is planned as tolerated, given the lower likelihood of adequate response at 7.5 mg in moderate-to-severe disease [^111JuVrY] [^11758QRU] [^111ghBFg].

> In summary, 7.5 mg orally once weekly is a guideline-concordant starting dose for RA, but most patients benefit from escalation to at least 15 mg weekly with close laboratory monitoring and folate supplementation; ensure weekly-only dosing, screen for infections and hepatic/renal risk, and individualize route and titration to balance efficacy and tolerability while minimizing toxicity risks [^111JuVrY] [^11758QRU] [^112Era3e].

Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) 7.5 mg PO once weekly is a **standard starting dose** for rheumatoid arthritis [^111JuVrY], with dose escalation to 15–25 mg weekly as needed [^114Kw4Ry]. It is also used for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, typically 10–25 mg weekly [^111ghBFg] [^113sMBpo]. Always administer **folic acid 1 mg daily** (except on methotrexate day) to reduce adverse effects [^111JuVrY] [^114vCwR1]. Monitor CBC, LFTs, and renal function every 2–4 weeks initially, then every 8–12 weeks [^111cLuT6] [^115rQjYi]. Avoid use in pregnancy, severe renal or hepatic impairment, and active infection; review drug interactions (e.g. NSAIDs, trimethoprim) [^1154F81C]. Emphasize strict weekly dosing to prevent fatal toxicity from dosing errors [^111JuVrY] [^114FCZCz].

---

## Clinical indications

Methotrexate is indicated for several **autoimmune and inflammatory conditions**, including:

- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: First-line DMARD; starting dose 7.5–15 mg weekly, titrated to 15–25 mg based on response and tolerability [^111JuVrY] [^11758QRU].

- **Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis**: 10–25 mg weekly; adjust to response and tolerability [^115YhfMF] [^113sMBpo].

- **Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)**: 10 mg/m² weekly, titrated to effect [^115YhfMF].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Methotrexate inhibits **dihydrofolate reductase**, reducing tetrahydrofolate and impairing DNA synthesis, leading to apoptosis of rapidly dividing cells, including lymphocytes. It also reduces proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) and adenosine accumulation, contributing to anti-inflammatory effects [^111M2VsW].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Methotrexate is **highly effective** in RA, with approximately 40–50% of patients achieving ACR20 responses at 6 months. In psoriasis, about 36% achieve PASI 75 at 16 weeks. In psoriatic arthritis, efficacy is moderate, with about 40% achieving ACR20 responses at 24 weeks.

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Initial dose**: 7.5 mg orally once weekly [^111JuVrY].

- **Dose escalation**: Increase by 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks to 15–25 mg weekly based on response and tolerability [^116Cd44i].

- **Folic acid supplementation**: 1 mg daily (except on methotrexate day) to reduce GI and hematologic toxicity [^116jZ3ww] [^114vCwR1].

- **Administration**: Take with food to minimize GI upset; swallow tablets whole with water [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Regular monitoring is essential to detect toxicity early; **CBC, LFTs, and renal function** should be checked every 2–4 weeks initially, then every 8–12 weeks once stable [^115rQjYi]. Key adverse effects include myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and GI symptoms; risk increases with higher doses, renal impairment, and drug interactions [^114puk2P] [^116JewEK] [^113TBW8S].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include pregnancy, severe renal or hepatic impairment, active infection, bone marrow suppression, and severe immunodeficiency [^112P1psS]. Use caution in elderly patients, those with mild renal or hepatic impairment, and when coadministered with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs [^112P1psS].

---

## Drug interactions

Key interactions include **NSAIDs**, which increase the risk of myelosuppression and GI toxicity; **trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole**, which increases toxicity via antifolate effects; and **proton pump inhibitors**, which may increase methotrexate levels. Live vaccines should be avoided due to immunosuppression [^1154F81C].

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Weekly dosing**: Emphasize strict weekly dosing to prevent fatal toxicity from dosing errors [^111JuVrY] [^114FCZCz].

- **Folic acid**: Take 1 mg daily, except on methotrexate day [^116jZ3ww] [^114vCwR1].

- **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid to reduce hepatotoxicity risk [^112ie2D9].

- **Infection precautions**: Report fevers or infections promptly [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: Effective contraception required; avoid in pregnancy [^111JuVrY] [^112S4xjk].

---

Methotrexate 7.5 mg PO once weekly is a **standard starting dose** for RA, with escalation based on response. It requires **close monitoring** and patient counseling to ensure safety and efficacy [^113kfQNm].

### Monitoring liver function during methotrexate therapy for psoriasis: are routine biopsies really necessary? [^116LBPKG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a widely used and efficacious treatment for psoriasis. Current recommendations advise liver biopsy after each cumulative 1–1.5g dosage of methotrexate. Although studies of methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis are of variable quality, the evidence indicates that in patients with no risk factors for liver disease on long-term, low-dosage (< 20mg), once-weekly methotrexate, liver biopsy is justified after an initial cumulative dosage of 4g. Advances in the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrogenesis may eventually further reduce the need for biopsy.

Methotrexate — dosage and administration in psoriasis: Methotrexate is generally given as a single weekly oral dose, and an oral measurement approach can use parenteral solution where "0.1 mL of a 25 mg/mL multidose vial is equivalent to a 2.5-mg oral tablet". Initial dosing often uses "a single test dose of 2.5 or 5 mg" to evaluate bone-marrow suppression, with maintenance "weekly dosages usually range from 7.5 to 25 mg". After dose escalation, "it may take up to 4 weeks for a clinical response to occur". Alternatives to oral administration are noted: "Intramuscular administration is helpful when there is gastrointestinal intolerance to oral dosing or if there are concerns regarding patient compliance. Subcutaneous injection is equally effective and can be self-administered at home".

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^117AyV81]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

MTX and LEF are uncommonly discontinued for blood-test abnormalities after the first year of shared-care prescription and discontinuations for severely abnormal blood-test results are even less frequent. These data will be useful when counselling patients in routine clinical practice. Elevated liver enzymes were the commonest blood-test abnormality to cause treatment discontinuations. This underlines the need to advise patients treated with DMARDs to minimize other risk-factors for hepatotoxicity. Further research is required to identify risk-factors of target-organ damage, and, to develop a prognostic model for risk-stratified blood-test monitoring. This is being evaluated by our team in another ongoing study that will also assess the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of risk-based monitoring.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^113aypz1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Methotrexate safety monitoring — liver and hepatotoxicity: Liver function test monitoring is recommended every 3 to 6 months when results are normal, and abnormal elevations should prompt a repeat laboratory check in 2 to 4 weeks. For persistent elevations, a gastrointestinal (GI) referral is recommended. For patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, it may be reasonable to consider an alternative therapy to methotrexate; if methotrexate is chosen, recommended hepatotoxicity monitoring is similar to that in low-risk individuals, except noninvasive hepatic specific serology should be performed at baseline and annually thereafter, irrespective of total cumulative dose.

Psoriasis — methotrexate dosing and administration is described as weekly doses ranging from 7.5 mg to 25 mg given as 1 dose or divided into 3 dosages over 24 hours, with 10 mg weekly being slower acting than 25 mg weekly but with fewer severe adverse effects; daily dosing of 2.5 mg daily for 6 days showed less benefits than weekly dosing of 15 mg divided into 3 doses every 8 hours over a 24-hour period and was more likely to cause elevation in liver enzymes, and gastrointestinal adverse effects may be better tolerated when the dose is divided into 3 doses given every 12 hours. Methotrexate is usually given orally, but parenteral preparation is available for weekly subcutaneous or intramuscular administration, and some physicians prefer to start with a test dose of 2.5 to 5 mg followed by a complete blood count 5 to 7 days after the test dose, while an alternative is to begin at a therapeutic dose such as 15 mg weekly; dosage changes frequently take at least a month for a clinical response. Parenteral methotrexate solution can be administered orally such that 0.6 mL of (25 mg/mL) methotrexate is equal to six 2.5-mg tablets, and although labels report different bioavailabilities for subcutaneous and oral routes, the bioavailability of parenteral solution when taken orally is thought to be similar to that of oral formulations.

### Methotrexate (Xatmep) [^114FCZCz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Closely monitor patients undergoing XATMEP therapy so that toxic effects are detected promptly. In general, monitoring of the following parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.5)].

Increase monitoring frequency during initial dosing, dose changes, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration).

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

5.15 Risk of Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the recommended dose is taken one time weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Overdosage (10)].

Advise patients to measure XATMEP with an accurate milliliter measuring device. Inform patients that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions [see Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to ask their pharmacist to recommend an appropriate measuring device and for instructions for measuring the correct dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### What is the expected clearance of methotrexate? A therapeutic drug monitoring reference guide for high-dose methotrexate use in pediatric malignancies [^111dyW4T]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

High-dose methotrexate dosage and infusion durations differ across treatment protocols for pediatric leukemia, lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Supportive care interventions are dependent on a patient's elimination of methotrexate (MTX). Therefore, it is important to establish the expected MTX elimination across protocols. Using modeling and simulation of real-world data, we determined the expected MTX concentrations at common time points from the start of infusion (24, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 hours) and the time that each patient would reach a typical discharge threshold (0.4, 0.2, 0.15, and 0.10 µM). These data provide a reference for MTX concentrations for common pediatric protocols.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^115u8iz5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Dosing Information

Rasuvo is a single-dose manually-triggered auto-injector for once-weekly subcutaneous use only [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Administer Rasuvo in the abdomen or the thigh. Rasuvo is only available in doses between 7.5 to 30 mg in 2.5 mg increments. Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require oral, intramuscular, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intrathecal dosing, doses less than 7.5 mg per week, doses more than 30 mg per week, high-dose regimens, or dose adjustments of less than 2.5 mg increments.

---

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^112Era3e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Laboratory Tests

Patients undergoing Rasuvo therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray.

During therapy, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

During initial or changing doses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5	Risks from Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that Rasuvo is administered once weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.6	Patients with Impaired Renal Function, Ascites, or Pleural Effusions

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Rasuvo administration.

5.7	Dizziness and Fatigue

Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8	Malignant Lymphomas

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Discontinue Rasuvo first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.

Psoriasis — methotrexate laboratory monitoring and toxicity management specify that ongoing studies should include a complete blood count (CBC) every 2 to 4 weeks for the first few months, then every 1 to 3 months; some suggest testing on the fifth to sixth day of the weekly methotrexate cycle because liver chemistry values may be elevated 1 to 2 days after a dose; a significant reduction in leukocyte or platelet counts necessitates reduction or temporary discontinuation of methotrexate; for overdose or cytopenias, folinic acid (leucovorin) at 10 mg m2 should be administered and given immediately with subsequent doses every 6 hours; renal monitoring includes serum urea nitrogen and creatinine at 2- to 3-month intervals, and liver chemistries should be performed every 4 weeks with more frequent monitoring for hepatic risk factors.

Methotrexate — hematologic toxicity risk factors and test dosing in psoriasis are outlined, stating that risk factors include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, methotrexate dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake. The test dose is typically 2.5 or 5 mg with a complete blood cell (CBC) count evaluated 5 to 6 days later, and although the use of a test dose does not guarantee that patients will not experience myelosuppression, it is mandatory in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or other significant risk factors for hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia can rarely occur with the use of low-dose weekly methotrexate, even after single doses, and as pancytopenia may occur as long as 4 to 6 weeks after increasing the methotrexate dosage, more frequent monitoring is suggested with dosage increases. The literature suggests that significant myelosuppression is rare in appropriately monitored patients with psoriasis who have no risk factors for hematologic toxicity.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel, single-site pilot trial to compare two different starting doses of methotrexate in methotrexate-naïve adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^117Sr5PB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is a cornerstone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Despite its widespread use, expert opinions differ about the optimal MTX starting dosage to achieve rapid onset of action while averting increased occurrence of adverse effects. Plasma concentrations have not been assessed in previous studies that monitored clinical efficacy.

Objective

This study was performed to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response of a standard (15 mg) and an accelerated (25 mg) dosing regimen, each administered orally once a week.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel, single-site study included 19 MTX-naïve patients older than 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients participated for 16 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS-28) as the primary outcome parameter. Plasma MTX concentrations were measured using HPLC at weeks 1, 5, 10, and 16. Tolerability was assessed via routine blood analysis (hematology and clinical chemistry) and a patient questionnaire to monitor adverse events. Reported or observed adverse events were recorded along with information about their severity and causal relationship to the study medication.

Results

Nineteen white patients (13 women and 6 men; mean age, 56 years; and mean weight, 74 kg) participated. At study entry, mean (SD) DAS-28–4v (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was 4.73 (1.02). Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were 1.45 (0.85); for C-reactive protein, 11.45 (10.04) mg/dL; for alkaline phosphatase, 73.58 (19.91) U/L; for aspartate aminotransferase, 23.32 (7.13) U/L; and for creatinine, 0.87 (0.22) mg/dL. Although pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC and C(max) were significantly higher after the accelerated dosing regimen, clinical activity scores (DAS-28) and inflammation parameters (C-reactive protein) did not indicate a significant benefit of an accelerated starting regimen. Considering toxicity, no elevation in liver function enzymes and no decrease in renal function were observed using the accelerated dosing (statistical significance set at P ≤ 0.05). No serious adverse events were noted. All observed adverse events were classified as study related. Overall, adverse events were noted in 58% of patients. Comparison of the two doses revealed that 60% of patients receiving the standard dosing regimen and 56% of patients receiving the accelerated dosing regimen reported adverse events, the most frequent being gastrointestinal. These events were generally self-limiting.

Conclusions

Differences in clinical response between these two small selected patient groups who received an initial oral dose of either 15 or 25 mg MTX per week did not reach the level of statistical significance. The overall incidence of adverse effects, all classified as study related, was 58%, with 60% of patients receiving the standard dosage and 56% of patients receiving the accelerated dosing regimen reporting adverse effects. However, because of the small sample size, this study was not powered to detect differences in the incidence of adverse events between the two dosing groups.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate hematologic toxicity and monitoring — notes that hematologic toxicity is more likely in patients with renal insufficiency, advanced age, dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake; a test dose should be considered in patients with such risk factors, and if there is no evidence of myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity the weekly dose can be increased as needed. Pancytopenia can result after even a single dose and can occur as late as 6 weeks, so close laboratory monitoring is recommended after each dose increase. Regular laboratory monitoring with complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests should be performed every 3 to 6 months assuming no abnormalities, and periodic renal monitoring should be considered in patients with poor renal function.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^116QAxaE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Tests

Patients undergoing Otrexup therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray.

During therapy, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

During initial or changing doses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5 Risks from Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that Otrexup is administered weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function, Ascites, or Pleural Effusions

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Otrexup administration.

5.7 Dizziness and Fatigue

Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8 Malignant Lymphomas

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Discontinue Otrexup first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.

5.9 Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce "tumor lysis syndrome" in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

Liver function test (LFT) monitoring — patients on methotrexate without risk factors: monitor every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal lab results. For elevations < 3-fold the upper limit of normal, repeat in 2–4 wk. For elevations ≥ 3-fold the upper limit of normal, closely monitor, repeat 2–4 wk, and decrease dose as needed. For persistent elevation in liver enzymes during 12 mo period or a decline in the serum albumin below the normal range in a patient with normal nutritional status, a consultation with GI and/or liver biopsy should be considered.

2.1	Important Dosage and Safety Information

Use only preservative-free Methotrexate for Injection for treatment of neonates or low-birth weight infants and for intrathecal use. Do not use benzyl alcohol-containing formulations for high-dose regimens unless immediate treatment is required and preservative-free formulations are not available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential before starting Methotrexate for Injection [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
For patients switching between a methotrexate product administered orally and Methotrexate for Injection, consider potential differences in bioavailability.

2.2	Recommended Monitoring and Concomitant Therapies for Intermediate- and High-Dose Regimens

To decrease the risk of severe adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]:

Administer leucovorin rescue in patients receiving Methotrexate for Injection doses of 500 mg/m2or greater (e.g., high-dose).
Consider leucovorin rescue for patients receiving Methotrexate for Injection doses between 100 mg/m2to less than 500 mg/m2(e.g., intermediate-dose).

Refer to the leucovorin Prescribing Information for additional information.

For high-dose Methotrexate for Injection regimens, follow the supportive care and monitoring instructions below. Also consider for patients receiving intermediate-dose Methotrexate for Injection regimens.
Monitor serum creatinine, electrolytes, at baseline and at least daily during therapy
Administer intravenous fluids starting before the first dose and continuing throughout treatment to maintain adequate hydration and urine output
Alkalinize urine starting before the first dose and continuing throughout treatment to maintain a urinary pH of 7 or higher
Monitor methotrexate concentrations at least daily and adjust hydration and leucovorin dosing as needed
Administer glucarpidase in patients who have toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (> 1 micromole per liter) and delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function (refer to the glucarpidase Prescribing Information for additional information)

Methotrexate (MTX) liver biopsy monitoring — risk-stratified thresholds and options are as follows: Liver biopsies were previously recommended after 1.0 to 1.5 g cumulative MTX; for patients without major hepatic risk factors who reach 3.5 to 4.0 g of oral MTX with normal liver tests, three options are suggested (biopsy, continued monitoring without biopsy, or switching therapy), and the AAD guidelines recommend liver biopsy at the same cumulative 3.5- to 4-g level; in those with one or more risk factors, more stringent monitoring is necessary, entailing a liver biopsy soon after therapy onset, preferably after 2 to 6 months, with repeated biopsies after every 1.0 to 1.5 g of oral MTX; there are no dosage guidelines for liver biopsy after subcutaneously administered MTX.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dosage of JYLAMVO is 7.5 mg orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 20 mg once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occur between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

The recommended starting dose of JYLAMVO is 10 mg/m2orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 30 mg/m2 once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occurred between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

2.5 Recommended Dosage for Psoriasis

The recommended dosage of JYLAMVO is 10 mg to 25 mg orally once weekly until an adequate response is achieved. Adjust the dose gradually to achieve optimal clinical response; do not exceed a dose of 30 mg per week. Once optimal clinical response has been achieved, reduce the dosage to the lowest possible dosing regimen.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid supplementation to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Thiopurines and methotrexate — use, dosing, and safety include that for newly diagnosed pediatric CD, 6-mercaptopurine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg/d, administered in combination with the first course of corticosteroids, has demonstrated efficacy; adverse effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, nausea, infections, hepatotoxicity, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders, with risks of skin cancer and lymphoma demonstrated in observational studies and decreasing with medication discontinuation, and although these agents may be considered as steroid-sparing maintenance agents, accumulating risks associated with thiopurine exposures may outweigh the original steroid-sparing benefit. Methotrexate is also effective as a corticosteroid-sparing agent for the maintenance of CD remission, with parenteral methotrexate at 25 mg per week for at least 6 months with potential reduction to 15 mg per week; patients with normal small bowel absorption may be started on or switched to oral methotrexate at 15–25 mg once per week. Adverse effects related to methotrexate include nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, bone marrow suppression and skin cancer, and likely lymphoma; the white blood cell counts and liver chemistries should be routinely monitored, and when prescribed to women with child-bearing capability, methotrexate should be administered only if highly effective contraception is in place. For patients on anti-TNF therapy, thiopurines or methotrexate may also be used as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity with methotrexate 12.5–15 mg orally once weekly; antidrug antibodies can develop as early as the first 100 days of treatment, and lower drug levels at week 14 and greater risk of loss of response may be associated with active smoking status, increased body mass index, and anti-TNF monotherapy, whereas earlier initiation of combination therapy with immunomodulators may yield more durable effectiveness.

Results

Data for 24 871 and 3897 participants with AIRDs prescribed MTX and LEF were ascertained. Of these, 15 670 and 2689 participants contributing 46 571 and 4558 person-years follow-up were included in the MTX and LEF cohorts, respectively (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The median (IQR) MTX and LEF dose at cohort entry was 10 (7.5–15) mg/week and 10 (10–20) mg/day, respectively. 2.1% participants were prescribed both drugs at cohort entry or within the first 6 months. The majority of participants in the MTX cohort had RA (65.8%), were female (64.6%) and their mean (.) age was 57 (15) years. In the LEF cohort, 63.9% had RA, 67.3% were female and the mean (.) age was 57 (13) years (Table 1). The median (IQR) follow-up in the MTX and LEF cohorts was 2.31 (0.82–4.92) and 1.03 (0.33–2.94) years, and there were 1262 and 259 drug discontinuations due to abnormal monitoring blood test results, respectively. Of these 95.6 and 95% were ascertained using values of blood-test results while the remainder were ascertained using Read codes. The 40% random sample of MTX discontinuations with blood-test abnormalities consisted of 505 cases and yielded 27 (5.35%) discontinuations that could potentially be explained by another underlying illness or its treatment or complications.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^1135Yuk1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As long as the reliable and widely accessible system of prediction of MTX efficacy and intolerance is not available, optimal clinical approach to MTX therapy remains of upmost importance. This study brings additional evidence for the high efficacy of MTX especially in early disease and underlines importance of using the dose around 15 mg/m 2 administered parenterally in order to evaluate treatment response early in the disease course. Such a treatment strategy does not appear to increase the rate and severity of MTX adverse events when compared to oral treatment using lower doses. Limited by short duration of follow-up and relatively small patient number true significance of our findings has yet to be confirmed through the ongoing extension of the study.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that is antiproliferative and immunosuppressive: it impairs DNA synthesis (via inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase), decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Methotrexate is mainly used to treat Crohn's disease; the use of methotrexate in patients with ulcerative colitis is controversial. A recent study of 179 patients with active ulcerative colitis found that 91 patients (51%) achieved steroid-free response with methotrexate induction therapy; however, in the 84 patients who then received maintenance therapy, methotrexate was not superior to placebo in the prevention of relapse. Adverse events in patients receiving methotrexate treatment include myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, both of which are dose-dependent.

Despite this, there is a lack of data available evaluating methotrexate therapy in IBD, and there are no societal recommendations for monitoring hepatotoxicity. The authors recommend complete blood count and liver function tests before, and 1 month after, initiation of methotrexate. If liver function test results are elevated, then the authors recommend reducing the methotrexate dose. In patients with normal test results remaining on methotrexate, the authors recommend repeating these tests every 2 to 4 months. Simultaneous treatment with folic acid can reduce the adverse events associated with methotrexate treatment, and is advisable. Several polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of folic acid are associated with the toxicity of methotrexate, though study results are conflicting.

Biologic Agents

Anti-TNF Agents

The introduction of biologic agents has greatly improved the management of IBD. However, primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response are significant clinical problems, particularly with anti-TNF agents. In 2011, Ben-Horin and Chowersreviewed the literature on the loss of response to anti-TNF agents in Crohn's disease. They found that 23% to 46% of patients who initially responded to anti-TNF agents had experienced the secondary loss of response based on the need for dose intensification by 12 months of therapy. Several factors can cause nonresponse or loss of response, including patient characteristics such as increased body mass index, female sex, increased age, and severely active IBD leading to high inflammatory burden and fecal loss of the drug. Parenteral administration of large molecule biologic agents can lead to the development of ADAs (immunogenicity) that reduce serum active-drug concentrations, and this is the main cause of loss of response to anti-TNF agents.–In addition to the use of thiopurines in combination with biologic agents to reduce immunogenicity, other immunosuppressants, mainly methotrexate, can be of similar use.

Methotrexate — management of abnormal liver tests and hepatotoxic co-medications states that monitoring is also indicated when the dosage is increased or if the patient is taking concomitant hepatotoxic medications. If a significant persistent abnormality in liver chemistry develops, methotrexate therapy should be withheld for 1 to 2 weeks and then liver chemistry tests should be repeated, with liver chemistry values likely to return to normal in 1 to 2 weeks. If significantly abnormal liver chemistry values persist for 2 to 3 months, a liver biopsy should be considered if continuation of methotrexate therapy is desired. The extent of fibrosis on liver biopsy specimen dictates whether methotrexate may be continued, it is prudent to discontinue methotrexate if a patient refuses to undergo a liver biopsy, and more frequent monitoring of both laboratory studies and liver histology is necessary if other hepatotoxic medications are used along with methotrexate.

Methotrexate — hepatotoxicity risk stratification and monitoring specify that risk factors for hepatotoxicity from methotrexate include history of or current greater than moderate alcohol consumption, persistent abnormal liver chemistry study findings, history of liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, family history of inheritable liver disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, history of significant exposure to hepatotoxic drugs or chemicals, and hyperlipidemia. Updated methotrexate guidelines from the National Psoriasis Foundation suggest that patients be divided into two groups, those with risk factors for hepatotoxicity from methotrexate and those without. Patients with no risk factors for methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity should be judged by the American College of Rheumatology criteria for monitoring methotrexate, which include an evaluation of liver chemistries every 1 to 3 months with the need for a liver biopsy only if 5 of 9 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are elevated during a 12-month period or if there is a decline in the albumin (in patients with normal nutritional status) below normal in the setting of well-controlled disease. Furthermore, data suggest that 3.5 to 4.0 g instead of 1.0 to 1.5 g of cumulative methotrexate may be a more appropriate time frame for the first liver biopsy in patients without preexisting risk factors for hepatotoxicity.

Methotrexate hepatotoxicity monitoring in patients with risk factors advises stricter measures: "Consider the use of a different systemic agent", "Consider delayed baseline liver biopsy (after 2–6 mo of therapy to establish medication efficacy and tolerability)", and "Repeated liver biopsies after approximately 1–1.5 g of methotrexate". The text notes "Patients with one or more risk factors for hepatotoxicity need be followed up with the more stringent guidelines (Table IV)", and if methotrexate is still used, "this patient should have a liver biopsy performed at or near the beginning of methotrexate therapy", though "As some patients will discontinue methotrexate within 2 to 6 months because of adverse effects or lack of clinical effectiveness, it is sensible to postpone the early treatment liver biopsy until after this initial period". For ongoing risk, "a repeated biopsy should be performed at a cumulative dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g", "a liver biopsy is also indicated" for "persistent significant abnormalities in liver chemistry values", and biopsy "should be repeated with every additional 1.0 to 1.5 g of methotrexate".

Introduction

Low dose methotrexate, administered weekly, is the first line glucocorticoid sparing drug used to treat immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and cutaneous psoriasis resistant to topical treatment or phototherapy. Methotrexate is also used in the treatment of steroid dependent inflammatory bowel disease and is often combined with biological medicines to optimise efficacy and prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies. Methotrexate use has increased in the era of biologics, with only a few patients (about 3%) with rheumatoid arthritis or with psoriasis with or without arthritis prescribed biologics in European countries.

Although effective and well tolerated, methotrexate can cause cytopenia, raised liver enzyme levels, and acute kidney injury, mostly during the first few months of treatment. Concern about these side effects has led to the recommendation to perform blood tests every two to four weeks to monitor patients for full blood count, liver function, and urea electrolytes and creatinine during the initial few months of treatment, followed thereafter by tests every three months for everyone. However, no evidence base supports the use of three monthly blood tests in the early detection of liver, blood, or kidney toxicity during long term methotrexate treatment.

We previously reported that clinically significant cytopenia, raised liver enzyme levels, and acute kidney injury that required methotrexate discontinuation were infrequent after the first year of methotrexate treatment. Indeed, many abnormalities detected during the monitoring of blood tests for long term methotrexate treatment are subsequently found to be due to an intercurrent illness or its treatment. Nevertheless, the detection of these abnormalities causes anxiety, requires repeat testing, and may result in treatment interruption that results in a disease flare-up. Unnecessary blood tests waste patient's time and healthcare resources, including the time of general practitioners and phlebotomists.

It would be beneficial to predict the risk of clinically significant abnormal blood test results during long term methotrexate treatment to inform the frequency of testing for individuals. To better understand this risk, we developed and validated a prognostic model for estimating the probability of clinically significant methotrexate toxicity during long term treatment and stratifying those at greatest and least risk.

Methotrexate — laboratory monitoring experience and liver biopsy considerations — patients taking methotrexate have undergone routine CBC counts and assessment of renal function; for patients with leukopenia, the dose has been adjusted based on the WBC count; in one study, 26% of patients had one or more hematologic abnormalities, and more than 95% of these patients had symptoms consistent with viral infection, with the abnormality resolving within 1 month of withholding the drug and not recurring with rechallenge; liver function tests, especially of the transaminases, are monitored; the routine use of liver biopsy after every cumulative dose of 1 to 2 g methotrexate is controversial; and if present, nausea, diarrhea, and stomatitis have responded to dose reduction and the addition or an increase in dosage of 1 mg folic acid.

Pediatric psoriasis — methotrexate monitoring and safety state that elevations in hepatic transaminases are common, with transient increases within 3 to 4 days after dosing, and therefore monitoring laboratory tests should be performed at least 4 to 6 days after dosing; bone marrow suppression generally occurs early in treatment (first 4–6 weeks) and is reversible with cessation of methotrexate; based on the risk of acute idiosyncratic bone marrow failure, an initial test dose of 1.25 to 5 mg of methotrexate may be considered, followed by a complete blood count 5 or 6 days later to check for bone marrow toxicity; hepatic fibrosis has not been reported in a child using methotrexate for psoriasis and liver biopsies are very rarely recommended or required for children, especially those with cumulative doses below 1.5 g and without laboratory test result abnormalities; in general, recommended monitoring includes complete blood count, hepatic transaminases, and creatinine, and monitoring for latent infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, or HIV should be considered before therapy based on individual circumstances and local epidemiology.

### Leflunomide [^113SMvLD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (> 2 x ULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing.

Methotrexate in psoriasis therapy — Table III recommendations: Methotrexate is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. Methotrexate is less effective than adalimumab and infliximab for cutaneous psoriasis. Methotrexate is efficacious for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral arthritis, but not for axial involvement); in psoriatic arthritis, the efficacy of methotrexate is lower than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors. Recommended methotrexate dosage typically ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg weekly, and the dose can be given as a single dose or in 3 doses over 24 hours. Methotrexate can be administered orally or subcutaneously. A test dose should be considered, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Administration of folic acid or folinic acid is recommended to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic adverse effects, and large folic acid and folinic acid doses may reduce the efficacy of methotrexate. Combination therapy with methotrexate and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy can be considered for adult patients with generalized plaque psoriasis to enhance efficacy and lower cumulative doses of both treatments.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis [^116Cd44i]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Trial design

MIPA was a 6-month, double-blind, parallel-group RCT in which patients with active PsA were randomized to receive MTX (target dose 15 mg/week) or matched placebo. The allocation ratio of active to placebo treatment was 1: 1.

Patients

MIPA enrolled males and females aged at least 18 years with PsA currently attending UK specialist rheumatology clinics.

Inclusion criteria

These comprised: (i) clinically apparent psoriasis (skin or nails) and active inflammatory synovitis involving at least one peripheral joint (adapted from the two mandatory criteria of Bennett, following the approach of Gladman and Salvarani et al.); (ii) a constant level of NSAID therapy for at least 1 month; (iii) previous DMARD therapy discontinued for at least 1 month and (iv) willing and able to give informed consent.

Exclusion criteria

These comprised: (i) other inflammatory arthropathies or arthritis mutilans; (ii) systemic steroid therapy currently or within the last 3 months; (iii) previous or current treatment with MTX; (iv) other serious medical disorders including liver, renal and cardiac disease; (v) women of childbearing potential not taking adequate contraceptive precautions; and (vi) abnormal full-blood counts and liver function tests or other contraindications to MTX therapy.

Treatments

Experimental treatment

Patients were seen monthly to adjust their trial medication and for safety monitoring. MTX was given initially at 7.5 mg/week, increased at 4 weeks to 10 mg/week and at 8 weeks to the target dose of 15 mg/week. In patients with persistently active disease, the dosage could be increased at the discretion of the supervising rheumatologist to 20 mg/week at 4 months and 25 mg/week at 5 months.

Control treatment

Patients received matched placebos that were increased similarly.

Concomitant therapy

All patients received oral folic acid (5 mg weekly) and anti-emetic therapy as needed. They continued their current NSAIDs and analgesics at unchanged dosages. Oral or i.m. steroids were not used and only one IA steroid was allowed.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^115xpGux]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

This study was driven by the lack of published evidence on the importance of MTX dose and route of administration on both its efficacy and various types of adverse events. We aimed to thoroughly document our clinical practice based on the treat-to-target approach in order to prove the concept that better therapeutic effect achieved with the higher dose of parenteral MTX is associated with clinically acceptable adverse effects comparable to those reported in published series using oral treatment.

### Fatal low-dose methotrexate toxicity: a case report and literature review [^116xnY8Y]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that acts primarily by inhibiting the folic acid cycle. In addition to its application for treating malignancies, MTX is also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Adverse effects have been reported even at low doses (up to 25mg/week), and there is risk of toxicity in the form of myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, or pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we report a case of a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and mucocutaneous ulcers and erosions. The patient was taking methotrexate 10mg weekly without folic acid supplementation and was found to be pancytopenic. Despite treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure and passed away after 16days of hospitalization. Myelosuppression is considered the most serious side effect with the highest risk of mortality. Risk factors for toxicity include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, drug interactions, and medication errors. Importantly, serum levels of MTX do not correlate with toxicity; therefore, folinic acid rescue therapy should be started as soon as MTX toxicity is suspected. MTX toxicity is rare with low dose, proper dose scheduling, and adherence to the recommended guidelines. It is imperative that physicians considering therapy with low dose MTX for dermatologic indications take into consideration a patient's risk factors for toxicity and monitor appropriately.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^112PdUQS]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, this study has several limitations. First, our findings are not applicable to patients at very high risk of drug toxicity and not transferred to shared-care prescribing e.g. CKD-4, pre-existing chronic liver disease. However, it is extremely uncommon to offer MTX or LEF to such patients, and the results of our study will therefore apply to the vast majority of AIRD patients. Secondly, dose data were missing for the majority of MTX and a large proportion of LEF prescriptions. This limits the validity of dose-reduction analysis. Thirdly, CKD progression and a serum creatinine increase of > 26 μm/l, the minimum change required to consider the presence of AKI, was used to ascertain drug discontinuation with kidney function decline. The guideline specifies that the increase in creatinine should occur within 48 h. We were unable to meet this part of the definition due to inherent large gaps between blood-tests, potentially resulting in an overestimate of the incidence of AKI. Our results therefore represent a worst-case scenario with respect to impact on kidney function. Some of the abnormal blood-test results could be due to concurrent prescription of other DMARDs e.g. SSZ. This can potentially elevate the outcome event rate. However, this is unlikely to play a large part as our outcome definition required a prescription gap of at-least 90 days and, it can reasonably be expected that in this period most rheumatologists will be able to ascertain the actual drug responsible for the blood-test abnormality. Moreover, some patients prescribed first-line subcutaneous MTX for RA from the hospital clinic, and stepping down to GP prescribed and monitored oral MTX may appear as incident users of MTX. However, this is likely to be uncommon as most patients with RA in the UK are commenced on oral MTX first-line and, if commenced on subcutaneous MTX first-line may have a contraindication to oral therapy. Research suggests that patients prescribed subcutaneous MTX change to the oral route in < 3% instances. Additionally, some treatment discontinuations in people with SLE may be due to increased disease activity e.g. cytopenia resulting in treatment escalation. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding cases with SLE or CTD reported similar event rates as the main analysis. Finally, it is difficult to attribute causality for adverse events and some potential adverse events may be unrelated to the treatment.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — methotrexate is conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for DMARD-naive patients with NAFLD, normal liver enzymes and liver function tests, and no evidence of advanced liver fibrosis who have moderate-to-high disease activity. Use of methotrexate should be restricted to patients with normal liver enzymes and liver function tests and without evidence of liver disease or liver fibrosis (Stage 3 or 4), noninvasive testing to diagnose and stage liver fibrosis as well as consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be considered prior to initiating methotrexate, and more frequent monitoring should be performed (every 4 to 8 weeks). The recommendation is conditional because patients' and clinicians' risk tolerance varies.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^113TBW8S]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With IV administration, 80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.

Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg. Impaired renal function, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels.

Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance.

Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity. It has been postulated that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved. When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function, a third space effusion, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods.

When other forms of parenteral methotrexate are administered during cancer chemotherapy, the potential for toxicity from high dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate plasma elimination.

Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustments of leucovorin dosing.

### The information required by people with inflammatory arthritis when taking methotrexate: a mixed-methods systematic review [^111pJM6P]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Concerns about taking MTX

Reticence was expressed by many about taking MTX. Some were concerned that MTX was not helpful for IA and wanted information about possible risks and long-term harms, possible lifestyle restrictions, such as the need to limit alcohol intake, and alternative treatment options.

Receiving verbal and written information around the time of diagnosis that highlighted the need for care with the timing and dosage of MTX, requirements for safety monitoring blood tests, and possible side effects generated more concerns for some. Others reported a pragmatic approach, balancing concerns about MTX with optimism that the side effects would not affect them. Satisfaction with information about side effects varied, with many seeking reassurance and more information, including the likelihood of experiencing side effects, to support decisions regarding starting MTX. Some remained concerned about side effects, but decided to start MTX and sought more information.

Those with more concerns often used multiple information sources, seeking to resolve concerns and gain reassurance about the necessity to take MTX. Using multiple information sources sometimes resulted in conflicting information that increased concerns, creating a barrier to starting MTX. Others chose not to read 'official' information in a bid to minimize concerns about side effects, whereas others rationalized their concerns, accepting that all drugs have side effects. Information about alternative treatment options was important for those concerned that the risk of side effects outweighed potential benefits of MTX; however, many reported not receiving such information.

Many were concerned about possible adverse effects and implications on lifestyle. Specific concerns included the impact of MTX on sex life, which some felt was not adequately addressed. The risk of experiencing MTX related nausea was undesirable leading to concerns about potential long-term harms resulting from taking MTX. Some identified concerns about the risk of developing side effects when taking multiple medications, and wondered whether MTX was the cause of hair loss. Fears about the possibility of MTX causing drowsiness were not always adequately addressed. Conflicting guidelines about restricting alcohol intake frequently led to anxieties, appeared to increase concerns about the toxicity of MTX, were deemed patronizing, and created a burden of treatment for some. Many wanted information about possible drug interactions, dietary restrictions, or interactions between food and MTX. Practical aspects such as deciding which day of the week to take MTX, organizing MTX supplies, problems opening packaging, managing s.c. MTX injection devices and side effects (such as local injection site reactions), managing associated toxic waste and the importance of safety monitoring also resulted in concerns and difficulties. Illustrative quotes are provided in Table 2.

### Early rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab, methotrexate, or their combination (U-act-early): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, strategy trial [^114Kw4Ry]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, treatment aim is early, rapid, and sustained remission. We compared the efficacy and safety of strategies initiating the interleukin-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab with or without methotrexate (a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD]), versus initiation of methotrexate monotherapy in line with international guidelines.

Methods

We did a 2-year, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, strategy study at 21 rheumatology outpatient departments in the Netherlands. We included patients who had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis within 1 year before inclusion, were DMARD-naive, aged 18 years or older, met current rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria, and had a disease activity score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) of at least 2·6. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to start tocilizumab plus methotrexate (the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm), or tocilizumab plus placebo-methotrexate (the tocilizumab arm), or methotrexate plus placebo-tocilizumab (the methotrexate arm). Tocilizumab was given at 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks with a maximum of 800 mg per dose. Methotrexate was started at 10 mg per week orally and increased stepwise every 4 weeks by 5 mg to a maximum of 30 mg per week, until remission or dose-limiting toxicity. We did the randomisation using an interactive web response system. Masking was achieved with placebos that were similar in appearance to the active drug; the study physicians, pharmacists, monitors, and patients remained masked during the study, and all assessments were done by masked assessors. Patients not achieving remission on their initial regimen switched from placebo to active treatments; patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm switched to standard of care therapy (typically methotrexate combined with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor). When sustained remission was achieved, methotrexate (and placebo-methotrexate) was tapered and stopped, then tocilizumab (and placebo-tocilizumab) was also tapered and stopped. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission (defined as DAS28 < 2·6 with a swollen joint count ≤ four, persisting for at least 24 weeks) on the initial regimen and during the entire study duration, compared between groups with a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Analysis was based on an intention-to-treat method. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01034137.

Findings

Between Jan 13, 2010, and July 30, 2012, we recruited and assigned 317 eligible patients to treatment (106 to the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 103 to the tocilizumab arm, and 108 to the methotrexate arm). The study was completed by a similar proportion of patients in the three groups (range 72–78%). The most frequent reasons for dropout were adverse events or intercurrent illness: 27 (34%) of dropouts, and insufficient response: 26 (33%) of dropouts. 91 (86%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm achieved sustained remission on the initial regimen, compared with 86 (84%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 48 (44%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm (relative risk [RR] 2·00, 95% CI 1·59–2·51 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs methotrexate, and 1·86, 1·48–2·32 for tocilizumab vs methotrexate, p < 0·0001 for both comparisons). For the entire study, 91 (86%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 91 (88%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 83 (77%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm achieved sustained remission (RR 1·13, 95% CI 1·00–1·29, p = 0·06 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs methotrexate, 1·14, 1·01–1·29, p = 0·0356 for tocilizumab vs methotrexate, and p = 0·59 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs tocilizumab). Nasopharyngitis was the most common adverse event in all three treatment groups, occurring in 38 (36%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 40 (39%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 37 (34%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm. The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups (17 [16%] of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm vs 19 [18%] of 103 in the tocilizumab arm and 13 [12%] of 108 in the methotrexate arm), and no deaths occurred during the study.

Interpretation

For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, strategies aimed at sustained remission by immediate initiation of tocilizumab with or without methotrexate are more effective, and with a similar safety profile, compared with initiation of methotrexate in line with current standards.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials and other studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Commonly reported adverse reactions include ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse reactions are infection, malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, and dizziness.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

The approximate incidences of methotrexate-attributed (i.e., placebo rate subtracted) adverse reactions in 12 to 18-week double-blind studies in patients (n = 128) with RA treated with low-dose oral (7.5 mg per week to 15 mg per week) pulse methotrexate are listed below. Most patients were on concomitant NSAIDs and some received corticosteroids. Hepatic histology was not examined in these short-term studies.

Incidence ≥ 10%: Elevated liver function tests 15%, nausea/vomiting 10%.

Incidence 3% to < 10%: Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3).

Incidence 1% to < 3%: Rash/pruritus/dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 3000/mm3), pancytopenia, dizziness.

### Methotrexate: prescribing and monitoring practices among the consultant membership of the British Association of Dermatologists [^1149AtbV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate is frequently used in dermatology practice and is potentially toxic. Prescribing and monitoring strategies have evolved over time and many areas of practice remain controversial and without firm evidence base.

Objectives

To document current U.K. prescribing and monitoring practice and to identify variations in practice.

Methods

A postal questionnaire was sent, in a single mailshot, in January 2004 to the entire consultant membership (n = 531) of the British Association of Dermatologists.

Results

We received a response rate of 71%. The majority of respondents prescribed for small numbers of patients and 81% reported using a patient information sheet. Almost all monitored full blood count, liver function tests and urea, electrolytes and creatinine, and 71% measured aminoterminal peptide of type III procollagen levels. We identified a wide range of practice in the use of liver biopsy. In terms of adverse events, 12% reported experience of patients developing irreversible liver damage (severity not defined). Forty-nine deaths were reported, of which 18 were due to myelosuppression, six to possible pulmonary fibrosis, two to liver failure in the absence of reported alcohol consumption and four as a consequence of liver biopsy.

Conclusions

We have documented wide variations in methotrexate prescribing and monitoring practice. We compare reported practice with current guidelines and highlight the importance of monitoring for myelosuppression.

### Efficacy and safety of systemic methotrexate in two fixed doses of 10 mg or 25 mg orally once weekly in adult patients with severe plaque-type psoriasis: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study [^112eSuVp]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is the 'gold-standard' drug for the treatment of severe psoriasis. In the absence of any consensus on an optimum dose of MTX for psoriasis, there is wide variation in prescribing patterns between dermatologists, resulting in variable or delayed therapeutic effects.

Aim

To identify the most effective fixed single weekly dose of oral MTX with acceptable side-effects in the treatment of severe plaque-type psoriasis.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging study, which enrolled 60 patients of both genders (aged 18–62 years) with severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group A was treated with MTX 10 mg once weekly, and group B was treated with 25 mg MTX once weekly. The main outcome measure was change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) between the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks.

Results

Of the 60 patients, 51 (85%) completed the 12-week study. At the end of the study, 24 patients (92.3%) in the MTX 25 mg group had achieved a 75% reduction in PASI (PASI 75) from baseline, compared with 18 patients (72%) in the MTX 10 mg group (P > 0.05). Mean time in weeks to achieve PASI 75 was significantly shorter in the MTX 25mg group (7.92 ± 1.91) than in the MTX 10mg group (9.47 ± 2.29) (P < 0.05). In addition, 20 patients (69%) in the MTX 25mg group achieved 100% reduction in PASI compared with 9 patients (30%) in the MTX 10mg group within 12weeks of the study period (P < 0.01). Adverse effects were generally mild, and were noted in 43.1% of the 51 patients who completed the study, with no significant difference in frequency between the two groups, although they were less severe in the 10mg group.

Conclusions

MTX 25mg is an effective dose as monotherapy for the treatment of severe psoriasis, whereas the 10mg dose is slow to act and less effective, but has a less severe side-effect profile.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^112P1psS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of methotrexate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and renal function, decreased folate stores, concomitant disease or other drug therapy (i.e., that interfere with renal function, methotrexate or folate metabolism) in this population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Since decline in renal function may be associated with increases in adverse reactions and serum creatinine measurements may over estimate renal function in the elderly, more accurate methods (i.e., creatinine clearance) should be considered. Serum methotrexate levels may also be helpful. Elderly patients should be closely monitored for early signs of hepatic, bone marrow and renal toxicity. In chronic use situations, certain toxicities may be reduced by folate supplementation. Post-marketing experience suggests that the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonitis may increase with age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Otrexup administration.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The effect of hepatic impairment on methotrexate pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Otrexup is contraindicated in patients with alcoholic liver disease or other chronic liver disease. Patients with obesity, diabetes, hepatic fibrosis or steatohepatitis are at increased risk for hepatic injury and fibrosis secondary to methotrexate, and should be monitored closely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Survey on the use of methotrexate by pediatric rheumatologists in Canada [^111LL3KH]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine methotrexate (MTX) use and the degree to which Canadian pediatric rheumatologists adhere to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines on monitoring for MTX toxicity.

Methods

A 20-item questionnaire was e-mailed to 37 pediatric rheumatologists in 17 centers in Canada. A total of 28 (75.7%) responded.

Results

The oral route (PO) of administration was preferred initially by 78.6% in most cases, but for more severe cases, this fell to 42.8%. Those who chose not to start PO used the subcutaneous route (SQ). When PO was initial treatment, a switch to SQ was undertaken because of dose escalation, lack of efficacy, or GI toxicity. An initial mean dose of 0.35–0.5 mg/kg/wk was prescribed by 51.8%. For 75%, the maximum dose was 1 mg/kg/wk (up to 25 mg). Complete blood count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were determined by 100% at baseline and in followup; albumin and creatinine by 85.7% at baseline, but by only 71.4% and 67.8%, respectively, in followup. After a change in dose, 96.3% requested blood tests at least monthly; this was extended to every 6 to 8 weeks by 78.6% when the dose was stable. Side effects of recurrent nausea and/or vomiting were reported to occur frequently. No severe toxicity, and in particular no case of cirrhosis, was reported. Prophylactic folate supplementation was prescribed by almost all physicians.

Conclusion

Most Canadian pediatric rheumatologists follow ACR guidelines to monitor for MTX toxicity in children with rheumatic diseases who were prescribed MTX. The variation in monitoring and response to toxicity raises the question whether specific pediatric guidelines should be developed.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112dYVbr]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — adverse effects and discontinuation: In rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis populations, side effects lead to drug discontinuation in ~30% of subjects, with transaminase elevation (21%), nausea (18%), and diarrhea (12%), and age ≥ 60 years and impaired renal function are cited as risk factors. In a British registry of 673 individuals, discontinuation due to methotrexate-attributed side effects occurred in 36.3%, with GI symptoms (10.5%), abnormal liver function tests (5.5%), cytopenias (5.5%), pulmonary symptoms (3%), and cutaneous abnormalities (2.1%); life-threatening adverse events occurred in 1.7% of the cohort. In a single-center study of 26 patients followed for 84 months (12 treated for all 84 months), the drug was stopped in four patients (three for toxicity — one alopecia, two pneumonitis — and one for noncompliance).

Methotrexate — folate supplementation and lab timing: Use of folic/folinic acid in conjunction with methotrexate is strongly recommended, and use of folic/folinic acid with methotrexate may mitigate adverse events and improve tolerability. LFT results may be transiently elevated if testing is done within 2 days after administration of methotrexate; hence, testing within this window is discouraged.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112ie2D9]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — hepatic toxicity, risk factors, and monitoring: One prospective study in rheumatoid arthritis reported stopping methotrexate because of hepatotoxicity in 5% of cases, and a large series identified severe liver failure and cirrhosis in 24 patients with a 5-year cumulative incidence of one per 1,000 patients. A meta-analysis of 636 patients across 15 studies found that 28% progressed at least one histologic grade, with 5% having advanced liver disease (grade IIIB or IV), and major risk factors included cumulative methotrexate dose, heavy alcohol use, and underlying psoriasis. Patients had a 6.7% chance of progressive liver damage for each cumulative gram of methotrexate, and these data have led to the recommendation that liver biopsy be considered after each 1 to 1.5 g of methotrexate. Routine liver function testing usually is performed every 4 to 12 weeks while receiving the drug; liver biopsy samples are no longer recommended by the American College of Rheumatology, which instead recommends monitoring transaminase levels, and only if transaminase levels are elevated in more than one-half of the testing in the prior year does the American College of Rheumatology recommend a biopsy. In sarcoidosis, hepatotoxicity has been reported in up to 15% of cases, and increased alcohol consumption has led to increased methotrexate toxicity in some studies; patients with hepatitis C are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity.

### Global, regional, and national burden of rheumatoid arthritis, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^112pMckp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Data forecasting has shown a substantial increase in rheumatoid arthritis prevalence is expected by 2050, highlighting the need for global projects to control the burden of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. These projections have not accounted for the effect of COVID-19 on the burden of rheumatoid arthritis, which could include reduced access to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment regimens and higher mortality in older adults. Addressing the unmet rehabilitation need, such as the WHO Rehabilitation 2030 call for action, is imperative if disability is to be minimised, and equitable rehabilitation services for people with rheumatoid arthritis are required globally. Adequate resourcing of programmes that target both prevention and modification of risk factors such as smokingand obesity will also be important globally. We found a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis among females than males; however, case fatality was higher in males. The higher prevalence among females is in keeping with other autoimmune disorders and is hypothesised to be related to differences in the sex chromosomes and hormonal factors, and evidence suggests that higher case-fatality in males might be due to innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors.

While use of biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs is now widespread in high-income regions, drugs such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine, used as monotherapy or in combinations, remain very effective and affordable conventional synthetic DMARD treatment options for patients with rheumatoid arthritis globally, and 2·5 mg methotrexate tablets are listed for inflammatory arthritis on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Access to an effective dose of methotrexate (20 mg per week) early in the disease course of rheumatoid arthritis can significantly reduce disease burden; however in low-income and middle-income regions, access to medical professionals who can diagnose rheumatoid arthritis and prescribe and monitor methotrexate at an appropriate dose can be limited. A qualitative study of physicians from 29 African countries assessed barriers to methotrexate prescribing in low versus medium–high Human Development Index countries, and found methotrexate dosing to be similar. Barriers to methotrexate use included inconsistent supply, financial restrictions (such as cost of travelling to dispensing sites), patient hesitancy related to cultural beliefs and societal roles, few prescribers, prevalent infections (especially viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV), and availability and cost of safety monitoring. A clearer picture of how these potentially modifiable factors might influence outcomes could be gained if treatment data were collected by GBD in the future.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

The recommended starting dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 10 mg/m2orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 30 mg/m2once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occurred between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

Administer folic acid or folinic acid to reduce the risk of methotrexate adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

2.5 Recommended Dosage for Psoriasis

The recommended dosage of Methotrexate Tablets is 10 to 25 mg orally once weekly until an adequate response is achieved. Adjust the dose gradually to achieve optimal clinical response; do not exceed a dose of 30 mg per week. Once optimal clinical response has been achieved, reduce the dosage to the lowest possible dosing regimen.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^117H4URc]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) affect > 1% adults and are treated with DMARDs. These drugs can cause cytopenia, raised liver enzymes and AKI and, fortnightly to monthly monitoring blood-tests are recommended when initiating treatment with less frequent testing thereafter. In the UK, DMARDs are initiated in a rheumatology clinic with prescriptions dispensed from the hospital and fortnightly blood monitoring overseen by the rheumatology team. Once an effective, tolerated and stable dose is reached, the responsibility for prescribing and arranging 2–3 monthly blood-tests is handed to the GP under shared-care policy supported by the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and Royal College of General Practitioners. The Rheumatology team is contacted if there are side-effects, including blood-test abnormalities and oversee treatment changes. Monitoring blood-tests are discontinued after 2 years for SSZ while long-term testing is continued for low-dose MTX and LEF. Whether such long-term testing influences the decision to discontinue treatment is not known because most clinical trials are shorter than 1 year, and many observational studies report cumulative toxicity including outcomes from the treatment initiation phase during which reversible drug-induced target organ injury is common. However, evidence from a large 2-year clinical trial suggests that DMARD discontinuation due to target organ damage becomes less common with increasing duration of treatment. With growing use of DMARDs and the corresponding increased burden and cost of testing, it is important to evaluate the benefit from regular monitoring blood-tests for long-term low-dose MTX or LEF treatment. Thus, the objectives of this study were to examine the incidence of drug discontinuation and dose reduction with abnormal blood-test results in AIRDs treated with long-term low-dose MTX or LEF. We also explored the data to examine whether the incidence of MTX discontinuation due to any abnormal blood-test result, elevated liver enzymes, AKI or cytopenia differed in RA and PsA as there is evidence that psoriasis increases the risk of hepatotoxicity from MTX.

### An evaluation of the utility of routine laboratory monitoring of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): a retrospective review [^113tPupg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

There are no consensus evidence-based guidelines for the routine laboratory monitoring of children with JIA receiving NSAIDs. Recommendations vary, but typically include monitoring serum liver and renal function along with a complete blood count (CBC) every 3 to 6 months. The Committee on Clinical Guidelines for monitoring drug therapy in adults with rheumatoid arthritis recommends yearly CBC and liver function tests depending on type of NSAID. The incidence of reported NSAID adverse events in adult patients ranges from rare (< 1%) to uncommon (1–10%) to common (> 10%) and states that insufficient data is available to develop complete evidence-based recommendations on the extent and frequency of monitoring. Furthermore, the guidelines also say it is unlikely that studies which gather such data will be performed as toxicities in adults range form 0.1% to 5%. From this, it is expected that evidence is lacking to support the application of these guidelines to the care of children.

Our study has several limitations. As a result of the retrospective design, complete data was not available for all patients. Patients were not followed for a consistent period of time. The frequency of laboratory testing in general was relatively low and was inconsistent among practitioners and patients. There was no prior determination of either a consistent frequency of laboratory testing or the evaluation and management of children with abnormalities on testing. Specifically, there were no consistent criteria for discontinuing NSAID therapy. Since the discontinuation of NSAID was used as a surrogate for clinical significance, and since this study was undertaken in a single pediatric rheumatology clinic where the patients were cared for by a small number of practitioners, this determination may be susceptible to measurement bias. Sample size was also limited due to the lack of standardization regarding the frequency of testing as well as the exclusion of many children receiving methotrexate, who undergo routine laboratory monitoring specifically due to the potential for methotrexate to cause liver toxicity.

Methotrexate in lung disease and lung transplant recipients — blood work monitoring — patients should be monitored with a CBC count, liver function panel, and phosphate and creatinine levels when commencing methotrexate therapy, and the tests should be repeated every 4 to 12 weeks; clinical monitoring for infections and signs of hepatotoxicity is also recommended; and patients with baseline transaminases or bilirubin levels of more than three times the upper limit of normal probably should not receive the drug.

Pediatric psoriasis and methotrexate — dosing, administration, tolerability, and response: Patients showing partial benefit within 3 to 4 months of treatment initiation should continue methotrexate therapy for an additional 3 to 4 months before determining if methotrexate is adequately controlling the disease. In a multicenter cohort of 289 pediatric patients aged 9 to 14 years, methotrexate was well tolerated with 90.8% reporting no adverse events; 8% experienced nausea and 1 patient discontinued due to elevated liver function tests, and 34.1% of methotrexate users showed improvement greater than or equal to PASI 75 during treatment. Dosing in young children (< 13 years) is weight based and often started at 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/week (range, 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg/week to a maximum of 25 mg/week) with increasing titration of 1.25 to 5 mg/week until an effective or maximum dose is attained, while those ages 13 years and older can be dosed similarly to adults with a maximum dose of 25 mg/week. Subcutaneous administration is preferred over oral because of fewer gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects, better bioavailability, and higher efficacy at lower doses; methotrexate can be administered as scored 2.5-mg tablets that can be split and crushed, and standard oral solution is supplied in a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Most children who respond to treatment will show improvement 5 to 12 weeks after treatment initiation, but it may take an additional 3 to 4 months to reach peak treatment efficacy; there is no consensus on duration, although a slow taper after 2 to 3 months of sustained clearance is reasonable. Methotrexate use requires folic acid supplementation, usually 1 mg daily (or 6 days a week, sparing the day of methotrexate administration).

### Leflunomide (Arava) [^111Vf3H5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with ARAVA. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (> 2 × ULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with ARAVA. Use caution when ARAVA is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting ARAVA, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3-fold ULN occurs, interrupt ARAVA therapy and investigate the cause. If likely ARAVA-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If ARAVA-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of ARAVA therapy may be considered.

If ARAVA and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing.

### Baricitinib, methotrexate, or combination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and No or limited prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment [^111sHYik]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Study protocol and oversight

RA‐BEGIN was a 52‐week randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, active comparator–controlled study conducted at 198 centers in 18 countries. Patients were randomized 4:3:4 to receive oral MTX monotherapy (administered once weekly), baricitinib monotherapy (4 mg administered once daily), or the combination of baricitinib and MTX. MTX was initiated at 10 mg/week and, if tolerated, increased to 20 mg/week by week 8. A lower dosage regimen was available if clinically indicated (initial dosage of 7.5 mg once weekly and maximum dosage of 12.5 mg once weekly). Randomization was stratified by geographic region and presence or absence of joint erosions on centrally read baseline radiographs. Patients with a screening estimated GFR ≥ 40 and < 60 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 who were assigned to baricitinib monotherapy or baricitinib plus MTX received baricitinib at 2 mg. Concomitant treatment with stable doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and/or oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was permitted. Baricitinib and placebo to match were supplied as 4‐mg and 2‐mg tablets. Active and placebo MTX were supplied as identical opaque capsules containing excipient with or without commercially available MTX. Folic acid was provided by the sponsor as a noninvestigational product, and all patients were required to take at least 1 mg once daily (or per local standard of care).

Rescue treatment (baricitinib plus MTX) for those patients whose tender and swollen joint counts did not improve by ≥ 20% from baseline was available beginning at week 24. New or increased doses of NSAIDs, analgesics, and oral corticosteroids could also be used after rescue. Patients completing week 52 could enter a long‐term extension study. Patients who did not enter the extension study or who discontinued early were followed up for ∼28 days after their last dose of study drug.

The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by each center's institutional review board or ethics committee. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was initiated in November 2012 and completed in August 2015, with enrollment occurring between January 2013 and August 2014.

### Leflunomide and diclofenac sodium gel (lefluniclo) [^1129Zetr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide tablets. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (> 2xULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide tablets. Use caution when leflunomide tablets are given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide tablets, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide tablets therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide tablets - induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide tablets -induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide tablets therapy may be considered. If leflunomide tablets and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^114bAgVH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Antimetabolites and immunosuppressants for atopic dermatitis (AD) — conditional recommendations, comparative efficacy, and safety monitoring are summarized as follows: Cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate are identified as the most commonly recommended older systemic therapies, and each received conditional recommendations based on low or very low certainty evidence, with evidence downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision due to small sample sizes. Head-to-head trials report cyclosporine was more effective than methotrexate for up to 16 weeks after which they were similarly effective, and azathioprine and methotrexate had essentially identical efficacy through 12 weeks; a network meta-analysis found cyclosporine dosed between 3 and 5 mg/kg per day more effective than methotrexate and azathioprine, which, in turn, were more effective than placebo, though with substantial uncertainty due to small sample sizes. There is less randomized trial evidence supporting mycophenolate; in one trial after a cyclosporine run-in, maintenance with mycophenolate sodium or cyclosporine showed little difference in efficacy at 10 weeks. These agents require baseline and ongoing laboratory monitoring for adverse effects, can increase the risk of serious infections, and have specific potential end-organ toxicities — cyclosporine is most prominently associated with renal impairment and hypertension, methotrexate with liver damage, and azathioprine and mycophenolate with cytopenias — and cyclosporine is not suitable for long-term use as the potential for renal damage increases with cumulative dose.

### Efficacy of etanercept in combination with methotrexate in moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis is not dependent on methotrexate dosage [^1174eNfa]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Data were pooled from two ETN clinical trials — COmbination of Methotrexate and ETanercept in Active Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (COMET) and Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate with Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO). In both trials, a group of patients were randomised to receive double-blinded MTX monotherapy or a combination of ETN+MTX for 24 months consecutively. Patients who switched treatments after 12 months in the COMET trial or who received ETN monotherapy in the TEMPO trial were excluded from this analysis.

At baseline in both trials, patients in the MTX arm received 7.5 mg/week (3 capsules taken in 2 divided doses approximately 12 h apart). At the week 4 visit, if the patients had an inadequate response (defined as any painful or swollen joints), the patients' oral dose was increased to 15 mg/week, taken in two divided doses approximately 12 h apart. At the week 8 visit, if the patients still had an inadequate response, the oral dose was increased to 20 mg/week. This titration schedule was true both for the MTX monotherapy arm and the combination therapy arm. Following dose titration, MTX treatment remained stable unless adverse events indicated dose reduction.

The study designs and eligibility and exclusion criteria were similar across the two trials, facilitating data pooling (table 1).

Eligibility and exclusion criteria

The main differences between the trials were the inclusion criteria for disease duration (up to 20 years in the TEMPO trial and < 2 years in the COMET trial) and the assessment of baseline disease activity (table 1).
