## Question

AKI causes and diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes and diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and staging of AKI to anchor the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories and their relative frequencies across settings. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including history, exam, labs, imaging, and when to biopsy. After that, I need to examine the limitations of creatinine and urine output and the role of biomarkers. Finally, I will consider special populations, controversies, and synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm with risk stratification and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the definition and staging so I don't build on a shaky foundation. AKI is defined by KDIGO as an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours, with staging by the magnitude of creatinine rise or oliguria duration, which correlates with outcomes in multiple cohorts [^111WXxDd]. Hold on, I should verify the time windows and thresholds; yes, those are the canonical KDIGO criteria and they remain the international standard for diagnosis and staging in clinical practice and research [^112LuMYS].

> Next, I should review the etiologic framework, but wait, let me reconsider the traditional prerenal–intrinsic–postrenal taxonomy. While this triad remains useful for organizing the differential, modern nephrology emphasizes that AKI is heterogeneous and multifactorial, with overlapping mechanisms rather than mutually exclusive boxes, so I need to ensure I don't over-simplify and miss combined insults [^117BvjEb]. With that caveat, prerenal causes include hypovolemia, shock, heart failure, and hepatorenal physiology; intrinsic causes include ischemic ATN, nephrotoxins, sepsis-associated AKI, glomerulonephritides, interstitial nephritis, and thrombotic microangiopathies; postrenal causes are obstructive uropathies, with obstruction being particularly important in older men and those with known prostatic disease [^11222p3J].

> I will now examine epidemiology and context-specific patterns to guide pretest probabilities. In high-income settings, AKI commonly occurs in hospitalized older adults and is frequently linked to sepsis, nephrotoxins, and procedures, whereas in low- and middle-income countries, infections, obstetric hemorrhage, and hypovolemic shock predominate; perioperative AKI is common and carries substantial morbidity, and COVID-19 has emerged as a major contributor with high ICU incidence and variable reported rates depending on case ascertainment and follow-up [^113LsPJo]. Hold on, I should verify that these patterns align with contemporary reviews; yes, these are consistent with recent Lancet and specialty consensus statements [^113LsPJo] [^1134WCr8].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach, starting with history and exam, because missing a reversible cause would be a mistake. I need to check for exposures such as NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, contrast, chemotherapy, and herbal agents; assess volume status and hemodynamics; look for systemic features suggesting vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, or thrombotic microangiopathy; and screen for obstruction risk factors like prostatic hypertrophy or prior stones, since these steer testing and urgency of intervention [^111NmB7g]. Let me verify that this aligns with primary care and emergency medicine guidance; yes, these elements are consistently emphasized in outpatient and ED frameworks for AKI evaluation [^111NmB7g] [^113cjKzL].

> I should double-check the core laboratory strategy so I don't omit essentials. Baseline tests include serial creatinine and BUN with attention to trends, electrolytes and acid–base status, CBC, and urinalysis with microscopy, because sediment findings like muddy brown casts, dysmorphic RBCs, or eosinophils refine the differential toward ATN, glomerulonephritis, or interstitial nephritis respectively [^111NmB7g] [^111f8R3z]. Wait, let me verify the role of FENa and FEUrea; they can help distinguish hypoperfusion from intrinsic injury, but diuretics and CKD can confound interpretation, so I need to integrate them with the clinical picture rather than use them in isolation [^111NmB7g].

> Now, imaging: I need to ensure I don't delay bladder outlet evaluation. Renal tract ultrasound is recommended within 24 hours for most AKI without a clear cause, and urgently within 6 hours if obstruction is suspected, because relieving obstruction is a reversible, kidney-saving intervention. Doppler can add information on perfusion when indicated. Hold on, I should verify guideline concordance. UK Kidney Association guidance explicitly supports early ultrasound in this timeframe, which matches standard practice in nephrology and emergency settings [^117G2kG1].

> But wait, what if the cause remains unclear or the course is atypical? I should consider kidney biopsy when AKI persists without explanation beyond about 7–10 days, when glomerular disease is suspected, or when systemic involvement suggests vasculitis or TMA, because histology can change management and prognosis; this is particularly relevant in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and drug-induced interstitial nephritis [^111f8R3z]. Let me verify that this is consistent with primary care and nephrology guidance; yes, both emphasize early nephrology input and biopsy in unexplained or severe AKI phenotypes [^111NmB7g] [^111f8R3z].

> Next, I should review the limitations of creatinine and urine output so I don't over-rely on insensitive markers. Creatinine rises only after substantial nephron loss and with a 48–72 hour lag in previously healthy kidneys, and it is influenced by muscle mass, age, sex, diet, and drugs, while oliguria can reflect hypovolemia or diuretics rather than true injury, leading to false negatives and positives that obscure timing and severity of injury. Hold on, I should verify that these limitations are consistently documented; multiple contemporary reviews corroborate these constraints and the need for trend-based interpretation and clinical context [^113JB182] [^115G3zHo].

> I will now examine biomarkers, but I need to be cautious not to jump to conclusions about replacing creatinine. Novel tubular injury biomarkers such as NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18, L-FABP, and cell-cycle arrest markers like [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] can detect injury hours to a day earlier than creatinine and improve risk stratification, yet they are not universally available, lack specificity for etiology, and should complement — not replace — clinical assessment and creatinine/UOP monitoring [^1128wWJv] [^113LsPJo]. Wait, let me verify consensus statements; ADQI recommends combining damage and functional biomarkers with clinical data to identify high-risk patients and guide care processes, which supports selective, context-driven biomarker use rather than blanket screening [^1128wWJv].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts so I don't miss nuances. In pediatrics, reduced creatinine generation and developmental differences complicate interpretation, and age-appropriate staging systems and biomarker validation are needed. In pregnancy, preeclampsia/eclampsia, hemorrhage, and infection dominate etiologies. In oncology and transplant, nephrotoxic drugs and immune-mediated processes are key. And in COVID-19, AKI is common and multifactorial, so applying standard KDIGO criteria with attention to sepsis physiology and microvascular injury is essential [^114VSn9m]. I should confirm that these are supported by specialty consensus; yes, these points are consistent with pediatric, obstetric, onco-nephrology, and COVID-19 AKI statements [^112Jk31p] [^114RL8nm] [^112Prcv9] [^114VSn9m].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and evolving paradigms so I don't overstate certainty. The prerenal–intrinsic–postrenal taxonomy is being challenged by evidence that hypoperfusion and tubular injury often coexist, prompting calls to frame AKI as a spectrum of functional impairment and structural damage rather than discrete buckets; additionally, the concept of acute kidney disease (AKD) bridges AKI and CKD and identifies patients at risk who do not meet AKI or CKD criteria but have adverse outcomes, which has implications for follow-up and research [^117BvjEb] [^113RrLYN]. Let me double-check that these shifts are reflected in recent KDIGO and ADQI discussions; yes, contemporary KDIGO controversies conferences and ADQI workgroups explicitly address heterogeneity, AKD, and the need for refined definitions and subphenotyping [^111proz3].

> I should now synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and make sure it is actionable. Start with risk stratification and surveillance in high-risk patients using serial creatinine and urine output. If AKI is suspected or present, obtain a focused history and exam, core labs including urinalysis with microscopy, and early renal ultrasound to exclude obstruction. Escalate to serologies and biopsy when indicated. And consider biomarkers selectively to refine risk and detect injury earlier, while avoiding excessive low-yield testing and anchoring on pretest probability [^1169pgFu] [^117G2kG1] [^1128wWJv] [^114nwQ4J]. Wait, let me verify alignment with guidelines; KDIGO and UKKA endorse prompt etiologic evaluation, early ultrasound, and judicious use of adjuncts, which supports this stepwise approach [^117G2kG1].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and longitudinal care are addressed, because missing recovery or progression would be a gap. AKI survivors have increased risks of CKD, cardiovascular events, and mortality, so arranging nephrology follow-up and CKD surveillance after moderate-to-severe AKI is prudent, and documenting recovery trajectory helps define AKD and guide counseling and risk modification [^113LsPJo] [^111proz3]. Hold on, I should verify that major guidelines emphasize post-AKI follow-up; yes, KDIGO and KDOQI commentaries consistently recommend structured follow-up to detect nonrecovery and CKD progression [^113LsPJo].

AKI is defined by a rapid rise in serum creatinine or a fall in urine output [^112LuMYS], most often due to **sepsis, hypovolemia, nephrotoxins, or obstruction** [^113LsPJo]. Diagnosis relies on **KDIGO criteria** (serum creatinine rise ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, ≥ 1.5× baseline within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours) [^112LuMYS] and is staged by severity [^111JD9cT]. Early recognition and etiologic workup — history, exam, urinalysis, electrolytes, and renal ultrasound [^117G2kG1] — are essential to guide therapy and prevent progression [^116zoaEu].

---

## Causes of AKI

AKI has a **heterogeneous etiology**; causes are commonly categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal [^111NmB7g].

---

### Prerenal causes (renal hypoperfusion)

- **Hypovolemia**: Hemorrhage, dehydration, burns, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal losses [^113LsPJo].
- **Low cardiac output**: Heart failure, cardiogenic shock, valvular disease [^111f8R3z].
- **Systemic vasodilation**: Sepsis, liver failure, anaphylaxis [^11222p3J].
- **Renal vasoconstriction**: NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, cyclosporine, tacrolimus [^notfound].

---

### Intrinsic renal causes (parenchymal injury)

- **Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**: Ischemia, nephrotoxins (aminoglycosides, contrast media, cisplatin, rhabdomyolysis) [^notfound].
- **Glomerular diseases**: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, ANCA vasculitis, anti-GBM disease [^111f8R3z].
- **Interstitial nephritis**: Drug-induced (beta-lactams, NSAIDs, PPIs), infections, autoimmune [^notfound].
- **Vascular**: Thrombotic microangiopathy, atheroembolic disease, renal vein thrombosis [^111f8R3z].

---

### Postrenal causes (obstruction)

Postrenal causes include **mechanical obstruction** — benign prostatic hypertrophy, malignancy, ureteral stones, strictures, or retroperitoneal fibrosis — and **functional obstruction** such as neurogenic bladder [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and staging

The **KDIGO 2012 guidelines** provide standardized diagnostic criteria and staging for AKI [^116QKB7G]:

| **Stage** | **Serum creatinine criteria** | **Urine output criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | Increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or 1.5–1.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6–12 hours |
| Stage 2 | Increase 2.0–2.9× baseline within 7 days | ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥ 12 hours |
| Stage 3 | Increase ≥ 3.0× baseline within 7 days or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL with acute rise or RRT initiation | ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria ≥ 12 hours |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential to identify the cause and guide management [^111f8R3z]:

---

### Clinical history and physical examination

Assess risk factors, comorbidities, recent procedures, and medication use; evaluate volume status, hemodynamics, and signs of systemic disease [^111NmB7g].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Serum creatinine and BUN**: Baseline and serial measurements [^1142XM1n].
- **Electrolytes and acid-base status**: Sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride [^111NmB7g].
- **Urinalysis**: Proteinuria, hematuria, casts, specific gravity [^111f8R3z].
- **Urine electrolytes**: Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) [^117E4SRg].
- **Specialized tests**: ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM, complement levels, hepatitis serologies, HIV, as indicated [^111f8R3z].

---

### Imaging

Obtain **renal ultrasound** within 24 hours to assess kidney size, echogenicity, and obstruction [^117G2kG1]; use CT or MRI when ultrasound is inconclusive or to further characterize obstruction or vascular disease [^notfound].

---

### Renal biopsy

Indications include unexplained AKI persisting beyond 7–14 days, suspected glomerular disease, systemic involvement, or progressive renal failure [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of current diagnostic methods

Serum creatinine is a **late and nonspecific marker** [^113JB182]; urine output is influenced by diuretics and fluid status [^115G3zHo]. Novel biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18, [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7]) show promise for earlier detection and risk stratification but are not yet widely adopted in routine practice [^113LsPJo].

---

## Conclusion

AKI is a **common and serious condition** with diverse causes. Early recognition using KDIGO criteria, followed by a structured diagnostic workup, enables timely identification of reversible causes and guides targeted therapy to improve outcomes [^113gSKbC].

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function. It is often diagnosed in the context of other acute illnesses and is particularly common in critically ill patients. The clinical consequences of AKI include the accumulation of waste products, electrolytes, and fluid, but also less obvious effects, including reduced immunity and dysfunction of non-renal organs (organ cross-talk).

The impact and prognosis of AKI vary considerably depending on the severity, clinical setting, comorbid factors, and also geographical location. There is increasing evidence that AKI is associated with serious short- and long-term complications, in particular increased mortality and morbidity, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high financial healthcare costs. As such, AKI is now recognized as a major public health problem.

Rapid diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic workup are essential to identify those types of AKI where specific therapies and interventions are available to reverse the injurious process within the kidneys. This review will summarise the key aspects of diagnosis and diagnostic work-up with particular focus on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Before you call renal: acute kidney injury for hospitalists [^115kZHtU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical problem of growing incidence in hospitalized patients. It increases the risk of poor outcomes, length of stay and the cost of hospitalization. Successful management of acute kidney injury requires early recognition and diagnosis through detailed medical history, careful physical exam, judicious use of laboratory and radiologic tests and timely renal consultation. Subsequent management is tailored to the likely mechanism of injury with emphasis on limiting both further injury and systemic consequences. A common sense approach to acute kidney injury is essential for hospitalists aiming to limit further injury, prevent acute complications and lessen the risk of chronic morbidity.

### Acute kidney disease and renal recovery: consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 16 workgroup [^117GUoAv]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Consensus definitions have been reached for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and these definitions are now routinely used in research and clinical practice. The KDIGO guideline defines AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, whereas CKD is defined by the persistence of kidney disease for a period of > 90 days. AKI and CKD are increasingly recognized as related entities and in some instances probably represent a continuum of the disease process. For patients in whom pathophysiologic processes are ongoing, the term acute kidney disease (AKD) has been proposed to define the course of disease after AKI; however, definitions of AKD and strategies for the management of patients with AKD are not currently available. In this consensus statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) proposes definitions, staging criteria for AKD, and strategies for the management of affected patients. We also make recommendations for areas of future research, which aim to improve understanding of the underlying processes and improve outcomes for patients with AKD.

### Diagnosis, epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury [^117E7Dec]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is an increasingly common and potentially catastrophic complication in hospitalized patients. Early observational studies from the 1980s and 1990s established the general epidemiologic features of acute kidney injury: the incidence, prognostic significance, and predisposing medical and surgical conditions. Recent multicenter observational cohorts and administrative databases have enhanced our understanding of the overall disease burden of acute kidney injury and trends in its epidemiology. An increasing number of clinical studies focusing on specific types of acute kidney injury (e.g., in the setting of intravenous contrast, sepsis, and major surgery) have provided further details into this heterogeneous syndrome. Despite our sophisticated understanding of the epidemiology and pathobiology of acute kidney injury, current prevention strategies are inadequate and current treatment options outside of renal replacement therapy are nonexistent. This failure to innovate may be due in part to a diagnostic approach that has stagnated for decades and continues to rely on markers of glomerular filtration (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) that are neither sensitive nor specific. There has been increasing interest in the identification and validation of novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury that may permit earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This review summarizes the major epidemiologic studies of acute kidney injury and efforts to modernize the approach to its diagnosis.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with serious short- and long-term complications. Early diagnosis and identification of the underlying aetiology are essential to guide management.

### Acute kidney injury [^112WN4v3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute kidney injury:

- **Definition**: AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function resulting from structural or functional injury that is characterized by decreased GFR, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria.
- **Pathophysiology**: AKI has multiple possible causes, including renal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis), or obstruction to the emptying of the kidneys (post-renal AKI).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AKI in the US is estimated at 179–317 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Hypoperfusion of the kidneys with resultant ischemic injury represents the most important group of etiologies, mediating AKI through cellular injury caused by a mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with AKI do not recover renal function by hospital discharge. In this group of patients, AKI is associated with 1-year age-adjusted mortality of approximately 60%, compared to approximately 10% in patients who recovered renal function within 7 days.

---

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^111rWcXj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, recurrent episodes of AKI and long-term mortality. Prevention of development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. Search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by the late diagnosis and the complex and incompletely elucidated pathophysiology. Progress in the management of AKI is to be expected from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

In this narrative review, we discuss methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1164LfZV]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to evaluate all patients with AKI promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes.

### Acute kidney injury [^116gQkzx]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury [^1134WCr8]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative organ injury is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. Among different types of perioperative organ injury, acute kidney injury occurs particularly frequently and has an exceptionally detrimental effect on surgical outcomes. Currently, acute kidney injury is most commonly diagnosed by assessing increases in serum creatinine concentration or decreased urine output. Recently, novel biomarkers have become a focus of translational research for improving timely detection and prognosis for acute kidney injury. However, specificity and timing of biomarker release continue to present challenges to their integration into existing diagnostic regimens. Despite many clinical trials using various pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions, reliable means to prevent or reverse acute kidney injury are still lacking. Nevertheless, several recent randomized multicenter trials provide new insights into renal replacement strategies, composition of intravenous fluid replacement, goal-directed fluid therapy, or remote ischemic preconditioning in their impact on perioperative acute kidney injury. This review provides an update on the latest progress toward the understanding of disease mechanism, diagnosis, and managing perioperative acute kidney injury, as well as highlights areas of ongoing research efforts for preventing and treating acute kidney injury in surgical patients.

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^111iTdAv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be defined as the abrupt loss of kidney function, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and impaired control of acid-base, electrolyte and fluid balance. The term 'AKI' has replaced 'acute renal failure' as it emphasises that renal dysfunction encompasses a spectrum of disease severity, rather than a single discrete entity. AKI is a common problem in children admitted to hospital, especially among those requiring intensive care, and it is an independent risk factor for increased mortality and severe morbidity. In addition there are few long-term studies that have assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children who experience an episode of AKI. In one follow-up study of children admitted to intensive care in Canada, 46.8% were identified as being at risk of CKD between 1 year and 3 years after an episode of AKI. Here we review the recent progress in identifying early AKI biomarkers to improve detection; we describe key aspects of managing AKI in children and we highlight areas for future development.

### Three feasible strategies to minimize kidney injury in' incipient AKI' [^116dHeWB]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and increasing in hospitalized patients. The earlier recognition of renal injury, at a stage described as 'incipient AKI', may allow renoprotective strategies to be initiated at a time when more kidney tissue is salvageable. 'Incipient AKI' represents renal injury as manifested by new-onset proteinuria, cellular activity on urine microscopy, or elevated novel biomarkers of kidney injury in the absence of clinical data that meet current diagnostic criteria for AKI. We propose three strategies to preserve kidney function and minimize further kidney injury in patients with 'incipient AKI'. These include — when appropriate for the prevailing cause of 'incipient AKI' — use of low-chloride-containing intravenous solutions, continued use of renin-angiotensin system antagonists, and use of diuretics to achieve adequate control of intravascular volume. The combined approach of the early diagnosis of AKI and early employment of feasible therapeutic strategies may slow the growth of clinical AKI, AKI requiring renal replacement therapy and chronic kidney disease, and might reduce AKI-associated mortality.

### Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice? [^117BvjEb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^114R2JkN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology and outcomes — clinical burden — span multiple settings, and severe disease in critical illness is frequent and lethal; "severe AKI occurs in > 5% of critically ill patients and is associated with mortality rates of 40%-70%". Although "recovery of kidney function occurs in the majority of patients surviving an episode of AKI, many patients remain dialysis dependent or are left with severe renal impairment", and "even patients who have complete or near-complete recovery of kidney function are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD)" with superimposed AKI on CKD "associated with acceleration in the rate of progression to end-stage disease".

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^112DoURG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Current clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction, and guiding the application of clinical and surrogate endpoint biomarkers. Ideally, biomarkers should be validated in multicenter and prospective cohorts, and tested in clinical trials for their impact on patient outcomes. As many researchers have advocated, in AKI, an ideal biomarker may not replace serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output but should be considered of additional value. In recent years, biomarkers for tubular injury, inflammation and repair, renal filtration, and oxidative stress have shown significant potential in the early detection and prognosis of AKI (Fig. 1). However, their clinical implementation faces challenges in terms of technology and validation, requiring large-scale studies to confirm their effectiveness. This review summarizes the current state of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AKI, exploring their prospects in clinical practice and providing guidance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1162zsGX]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions in acute kidney injury: a literature review [^117GjGv4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

AKI is a critical concern in nephrology, inflicting considerable harm on both physical and mental health, while its elevated incidence and fatality rates place a tremendous strain on the healthcare system. The clinical diagnosis of AKI relies on changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output, lacking definitive methodologies. It is imperative to investigate the molecular pathways to create highly specific and readily observable diagnostic tools and to develop therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^112TZHBx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### Biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of acute kidney injury [^115MAEyi]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

AKI is an increasingly common disorder that is strongly linked to short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite a growing heterogeneity in its causes, providing a timely and certain diagnosis of AKI remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the evolution of AKI biomarker studies over the past few years, focusing on two major areas of investigation: the early detection and prognosis of AKI. We highlight some of the lessons learned in conducting AKI biomarker studies, including ongoing attempts to address the limitations of creatinine as a reference standard and the recent shift toward evaluating the prognostic potential of these markers. Lastly, we suggest current gaps in knowledge and barriers that may be hindering their incorporation into care and a full ascertainment of their value.

Despite advancements in obstetric care, pregnancy-associated acute kidney injury (PrAKI) continues to be a significant public health concern, contributing to substantial maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The most common causes of PrAKI include preeclampsia/eclampsia, haemorrhage, and infection. Diagnosis is influenced by gestational age and individual risk factors. Alongside traditional investigations such as imaging and kidney biopsy, novel diagnostics and biomarkers may provide valuable insights for differential diagnosis. This review aims to offer an update on the diagnostic approaches and investigational tools for PrAKI, while also addressing current challenges in the diagnostic paradigm and presenting recommendations for clinical practice and future research.

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Table 1
KDIGO definition and classification of AKI

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^113L2HcF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe complication of critical illness associated with death and disability. The symptoms and clinical consequences of AKI can be quite similar regardless of whether the etiology is predominantly within the kidney or predominantly outside the kidney; the AKI syndrome encompasses both structural injury as well as acute functional impairment. The costs of care for these patients are very high and research on AKI is thus focusing on prevention, early detection and treatment. The non-profit foundation Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO), managed by the National Kidney Foundation with the aim of developing and implementing guidelines, completed in 2012 the first international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guidelines for AKI. This workgroup utilized previously existing criteria to try and unify and develop all aspects, both clarified and uncertain, of AKI and critical care nephrology. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group had designed the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function and End-stage kidney disease) system for diagnosis and classification through a broad consensus of experts back in 2004. This classification was also modified for pediatric patients in order to better classify small children with AKI (pediatric RIFLE). More recently, the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) endorsed the RIFLE criteria with a modification to include changes in serum creatinine (sCr; ≥ 0.3 mg/dl or 26.5 μmol/l) when they occur within a 48-hour period. Unfortunately, the existing criteria, while useful and widely validated, are still limited by relatively scarce and non-uniform clinical application. The KDIGO workgroup focused their effort into reconciling all the different criteria and providing a comprehensive set of guidelines and new definitive AKI criteria (Table 1).

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^112NaGMt]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute kidney disease

AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days and CKD starts when kidney disease has persisted for more than 90 days. Based on epidemiological studies and histological case series, it is clear that some patients have a slow but persistent (creeping) rise in serum creatinine over days or weeks but do not strictly fulfil the consensus criteria for AKI. To classify this phase between the early stage of AKI (first 7 days) and the onset of CKD (beyond 3 months), the KDIGO expert group proposed the term "acute kidney disease" (AKD) and suggested the following criteria: a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² for < 3 months, a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35%, and an increase in serum creatinine by > 50% for < 3 months or evidence of structural kidney damage for < 3 months. These criteria are currently under revision (personal communication with the ADQI group).

### The pressing need for real-time risk assessment of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [^1146BEaB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is associated with short- and long-term outcomes that reflect the severity of the injury. Recent studies have suggested that 'early' initiation of renal replacement therapy may alter the course of AKI and improve short-term outcomes like inpatient mortality. The current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition of AKI has been criticized for misclassification bias, lack of sensitivity and the static manner in which AKI stages are defined. This editorial reviews various approaches to improving the specificity and sensitivity of the KDIGO AKI criteria, and also concludes that a staging system based on creatinine trajectories would be better suited for developing a prognostic index for real-time, dynamic risk assessment that the current KDIGO staging criteria.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^117Rj5aj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The broad clinical syndrome of acute kidney injury (AKI) encompasses various aetiologies, including specific kidney diseases (e.g. acute interstitial nephritis), non-specific conditions (e.g. renal ischaemia) as well as extrarenal pathology (e.g. post-renal obstruction). AKI is a serious condition that affects kidney structure and function acutely, but also in the long term. Recent epidemiological evidence supports the notion that even mild, reversible AKI conveys the risk of persistent tissue damage, and severe AKI can be accompanied by an irreversible decline of kidney function and progression to end-stage kidney failure.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI were designed to systematically compile information on this topic by experts in the field.

These guidelines are based on the systematic review of relevant trials published before February 2011. Nevertheless, for many sections of the guidelines, appropriate supporting evidence is lacking in the literature. As a consequence, variations in practice will inevitably occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources and limitations unique to a region, an institution or type of practice. Therefore, in line with its philosophy, the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) wanted to issue a position statement on these guidelines.

A working group was established to produce guidance from the European nephrology perspective, based on the compiled evidence as presented, with an update of the literature up to March 2012, following the methodology as explained in the ERBP instructions to authors. The present document will deal with the diagnosis and prevention of AKI, and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) (Sections 1–4 of the KDIGO document), and other chapters will be discussed in a separate position statement.

As a general rule, we will only mention those guideline statements of the KDIGO document that we have amended, even when the change is small. If a KDIGO recommendation is not repeated, it can be considered as endorsed by ERBP as is, unless specifically stated otherwise.

### Adjudication of etiology of acute kidney injury: experience from the TRIBE-AKI multi-center study [^117ECLmw]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), regardless of the definition employed, is a common complication following adult cardiac surgery. Increasing acceptance of standardized definitions of AKI amongst nephrologists and intensivists has advanced several aspects of AKI research yet the practical issue of what constitutes "true AKI" clinically, remains unsettled. Novel biomarkers have demonstrated promising associations with AKI, leading to a resurgence in clinical trials in the setting of AKI. However, given the suboptimal performance of some biomarkers, there is only limited data to support the role of accurate adjudication of AKI to improve the diagnostic and discriminative performance of traditional and modern markers of renal function.

Recent research has focused on augmenting serum creatinine's limited ability to detect true renal tubular injury, rather than a temporary change in glomerular filtration (pre-renal azotemia, PRA). Conceptually, PRA, defined as a transient decrease in the effective perfusion of the kidney, either from volume depletion or relative hypotension, should spare damage to the kidney/renal tubules in comparison to other intrinsic (intra-renal) causes of kidney injury. Some maintain that attempting to clinically distinguish PRA from intrinsic kidney injury is not feasible and likely unnecessary as all AKI lies on a spectrum. A limited number of non-cardiac surgery studies have had varying success in attempting to adjudicate AKI events and tease out the ability of novel biomarkers to distinguish PRA from direct tubular injury.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112714HR]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^114nwQ4J]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an increasingly common complication among hospitalized patients, and is associated with increased mortality, development of chronic kidney disease, and increased resource utilization. The optimal diagnostic approach to AKI is not well established.

The traditional approach to the differential diagnosis of AKI emphasizes three broad categories: pre-renal AKI, which results from inadequate perfusion of the kidneys; post-renal AKI, which results from obstruction to the flow of urine; and intrinsic causes of AKI, which can be due to injury or dysfunction of the glomeruli, other blood vessels, tubules, or the interstitium. A large number of diagnostic tests are available for the investigation of AKI. Determining which test to order in which patient with AKI should be based on estimates of pre-test probability from the clinical context and an appreciation of the diagnostic performance characteristics of the various tests available.

Previous studies have examined the utility of some AKI diagnostic tests in isolation, such renal ultrasonography and urine microscopy, but none have comprehensively assessed the patterns and clinical utility of a wide range of diagnostic tests in patients with AKI. We performed this study to identify the frequency with which various urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests are ordered in patients with AKI, and to assess their diagnostic yield.

### Potential use of biomarkers in acute kidney injury: report and summary of recommendations from the 10th acute dialysis quality initiative consensus conference [^116suQaB]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in the discovery and development of biomarkers of kidney disease, and several have now been evaluated in different clinical settings. Although there is a growing literature on the performance of various biomarkers in clinical studies, there is limited information on how these biomarkers would be utilized by clinicians to manage patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Recognizing this gap in knowledge, we convened the 10th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting to review the literature on biomarkers in AKI and their application in clinical practice. We asked an international group of experts to assess four broad areas for biomarker utilization for AKI: risk assessment, diagnosis, and staging; differential diagnosis; prognosis and management; and novel physiological techniques including imaging. This article provides a summary of the key findings and recommendations of the group, to equip clinicians to effectively use biomarkers in AKI.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^116QKB7G]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^111JD9cT]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Acute kidney injury [^1142XM1n]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### Incidence and prognosis of acute kidney diseases and disorders using an integrated approach to laboratory measurements in a universal health care system [^113RrLYN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do the acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) criteria from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines identify patients who do not meet existing criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI), and what is the prognosis of these patients?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1.1 million Canadian residents, AKD criteria identified many patients who did not meet existing criteria for CKD or AKI, and patients with AKD without AKI had overall modestly increased risks of incident and progressive CKD, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Meaning

The incorporation of AKD into clinical and research initiatives for kidney disease would increase recognition of patients at risk of adverse outcomes who are not identified by current AKI and CKD criteria; however, the clinical importance of AKD remains to be determined.

Key messages

- AKI is a complex disorder, and we have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI on the basis of existing systems (that is, RIFLE). These proposals will require validation.

- Our recommendations have been endorsed by participating societies that represent the majority of critical care and nephrology societies worldwide.

- These recommendations provide a stepping stone to standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment strategies.

- Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require the development of collaborative networks. The AKIN was formed to provide an effective mechanism for facilitating such efforts.

### Raising awareness of acute kidney injury: a global perspective of a silent killer [^1124N7BV]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes. Over the last few years, collaborative efforts, enabled by a common definition of AKI, have provided a description of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of this disease and improved our understanding of the pathophysiology. There is increased recognition that AKI is encountered in multiple settings and in all age groups, and that its course and outcomes are influenced by the severity and duration of the event. The effect of AKI on an individual patient and the resulting societal burden that ensues from the long-term effects of the disease, including development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is attracting increasing scrutiny. There is evidence of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervention. These emerging data point to an urgent need for a global effort to highlight that AKI is preventable, its course is modifiable, and its treatment can improve outcomes. In this article, we provide a framework of reference and propose specific strategies to raise awareness of AKI globally, with the goal to ultimately improve outcomes from this devastating disease.

### A framework and key research questions in AKI diagnosis and staging in different environments [^111E9siD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is common worldwide, and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. The RIFLE system of staging AKI correlates with survival in AKI in several settings. A similar AKI definition and staging system that also incorporates lesser degrees of serum creatinine elevation was proposed at the inaugural Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) meeting in 2005. At the Second AKIN meeting in Vancouver, Canada in September 2006, our group developed a research agenda that would test the utility of these diagnostic and staging criteria to predict patient outcomes in a variety of clinical settings and patient groups.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Three-day, international, consensus conference. A multidisciplinary stakeholder committee was divided into work groups. Recommendations for clinical practice and for future research were developed by the committee as an iterative process. This procedure consisted of a literature review phase and focus group interactions with presentations to the entire committee.

Results

We first proposed a conceptual framework of disease that describes a series of AKI stages, antecedents and outcomes, and allows a description of research recommendations based on transition between AKI stages. We further proposed methods for testing of the definition and development of research questions to establish the utility of new biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of AKI and associated illnesses.

Conclusions

Retrospective studies should be conducted to initiate the process of validating the AKIN definition of AKI, followed by comprehensive prospective studies that incorporate sampling for emerging AKI biomarkers.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115tb9kd]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery has been consistently associated with long-term morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Furthermore, the relationship persists even among patients with complete renal recovery, or patients with minor perturbations in renal function not reaching the threshold for AKI. The mechanism, pathogenesis, and risk factors for postoperative AKI vary significantly by surgical type and corresponding perioperative stressors.

Because treatment options for postoperative AKI are limited, perioperative management has traditionally focused on prevention and diagnosis. Identifying prerenal (hypoperfusion), postrenal (outflow obstruction), and intrinsic renal (ischemic or nephrotoxic injury) causes are crucial first steps in the management of AKI. Additionally, the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines emphasize severity-based management of AKI. In patients with normal kidney function and mild AKI, management focuses on rapid identification and avoidance of nephrotoxic insults plus attention to volume status and renal perfusion pressure. As the severity of AKI increases, the accompanying disruption to acid–base status and electrolyte balance may necessitate focused medical and supportive therapies, with renal replacement therapy and/or intensive care admission for the most severe cases.

In this review, we define AKI in the perioperative setting, describe the epidemiologic burden, discuss procedure-specific risk factors, detail principles of management, and highlight areas of ongoing controversy and research.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^112XELTZ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### Acute kidney injury in critical care: time for a paradigm shift? [^11517ZeP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute alterations in renal function are commonly encountered in various settings with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. Our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been fairly stagnant, until recently largely limited by a lack of concerted efforts in the field. This review summarizes the recent advances and provides an overview of emerging trends in this field.

Recent Findings

One of the limitations in our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been the lack of a standardized definition and staging criteria for this disorder. New information on the epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury has emerged providing an opportunity to reappraise our approach to this disease. Also, there has been new work on the relationship of alterations of renal function to short and long-term outcomes, particularly mortality.

Summary

To translate advances from basic research to clinical application a multidisciplinary approach is required. New research in the field of biomarkers combined with clinical markers will lead to therapies that can be introduced earlier in the course of the disease and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in mortality from this potentially reversible condition.

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^116WHuDE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition in children admitted to hospital and existing serum and urine biomarkers are insensitive. There have been significant developments in stratifying the risk of AKI in children and also in the identification of new AKI biomarkers. Risk stratification coupled with a panel of AKI biomarkers will improve future detection of AKI, however, paediatric validation studies in mixed patient cohorts are required. The principles of effective management rely on treating the underlying cause and preventing secondary AKI by the appropriate use of fluids and medication. Further therapeutic innovation will depend on improving our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying AKI in children.

Epidemiology and diagnosis

Incidence and diagnosis

What are the rates of COVID-19 AKI, and how should it be diagnosed?

Recommendations

Timing of AKI with symptom onset, hospitalization, confirmation of infection, disease severity and level of care should be characterized for appropriate clinical management (not graded).
We recommend use of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition for AKI, including serum creatinine (SCr) level and urine output, in clinical practice (evidence level: 1A).
We suggest using kidney-specific tests along with measures of kidney function to characterize clinical presentations, course and outcomes of AKI (evidence level: 2B).

Rationale

Rates of reported AKI vary considerably between studies, with higher rates reported in countries outside of China (Table 1). Patients with COVID-19 may present with AKI or develop it during the course of their hospitalization. Those requiring admission to the ICU have a higher rate of AKI than those hospitalized on the wards. Of note, many published reports of patients with COVID-19 do not include definitions or staging of AKI, or information on renal recovery or follow up. The distinction between de novo AKI and AKI superimposed on pre-existing CKD is also rarely made. In addition, reported hospital admission rates of patients with COVID-19 varies between and within countries, reflecting different national and regional health-care systems, policies for hospitalization and for assigning levels of care (e.g. ICU admission). These factors all complicate comparisons of AKI rates based solely on the number of hospitalized patients. This variation is exemplified by data from the UK, where initial rates of AKI in April 2020 (as defined by need for RRT) were reported to be 20% in hospitalized patients with a reported mortality of over 80%, whereas data from July 2020 showed an incidence of 27% but an observed mortality of 57%(Table 1). Rather than reflecting an improvement in AKI outcomes, this variation reflects incomplete follow-up whereby more recent data from patients with shorter lengths of stay is not representative of the overall cohort. Such confounders should be considered when examining crude rates of AKI and the need for RRT.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^111f8R3z]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic work-up

As a syndrome, AKI can have multiple aetiologies. In critically ill patients, the most common causes are sepsis, heart failure, haemodynamic instability, hypovolaemia, and exposure to nephrotoxic substances. Acute parenchymal and glomerular renal diseases are relatively rare. Determining the aetiology is essential to guide management and potentially target and influence the disease process.

The terms "pre-renal", "renal" and "post-renal" have traditionally been used to narrow the differential diagnosis of AKI. It was a long-held view that "pre-renal AKI" or "transient" AKI were synonymous with "hypovolaemic AKI" and "fluid responsiveness". However, several studies have demonstrated that tubular damage may be present in patients with "pre-renal AKI". Furthermore, adverse outcomes have been noted even when creatinine returned to baseline within 24 h. Based on these results, the ADQI group proposed to differentiate between "functional AKI" and "kidney damage" in preference to the terms "pre-renal", "renal", and "post-renal" AKI.

The specific diagnostic workup in individual patients with AKI depends on the clinical context, severity, and duration of AKI, and also on local availability. Urinalysis, examination of the urinary sediment, and imaging studies should be performed as a minimum, with additional tests depending on the clinical presentation (Fig. 4).

### Acute kidney injury: what's the prognosis? [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common (especially during critical illness), increasing in incidence, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited and functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. Emerging novel biomarkers are, however, likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis. Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill and over the past few years insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared with those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists and further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### Optimal timing of renal replacement therapy initiation in acute kidney injury: the elephant felt by the blindmen? [^112btud8]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Practical implications and prospects: we plea for a universal AKI definition!

AKI is a complex disorder with many potential (i.e. septic, ischemic, or toxic) triggers. Prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal disorders may either alone or in combination contribute to AKI severity and progression. All of these factors finally will determine patient outcome. On top of this, RRT is increasingly implemented in the treatment of AKI, even in the absence of life-threatening hemodynamic or metabolic conditions. Basing decisions on creatinine concentrations or urinary output is unreliable in critically ill ICU patients. Moreover, the prognosis may also vary in patients who are diagnosed with similar AKI stage at different time points (e.g. at admission or during hospitalization). Thus, currently applied AKI criteria should be adapted and perhaps strengthened by adding sensitive functional and structural biomarkers.

Several novel biomarkers have been introduced as an aid to identify patients with AKI earlier, to evaluate severity of kidney injury, to differentiate type and etiology of injury, and to assess the effect of interventions on renal recovery. Some biomarkers may even independently detect AKI progression regardless of glomerular filtration rate changes. Actual biomarkers lack specificity for correctly assessing the time of AKI occurrence but are useful for risk stratification in severe AKI and for determining the need for RRT or mortality prediction. Furthermore, a clinical approach supported by biomarker assessment performed better than a pure clinical or biomarker model to predict relevant outcome variables such as AKI progression, recovery of renal function, need for RRT, and death.

We strongly believe that adding biomarker measurement to existing AKI classifications would more accurately confirm both the presence and severity of AKI and allow appropriate stratification and inclusion of patients in well-designed RCTs. This is imperative to correctly assess the real impact of early versus late RRT initiation on patient outcome. Maybe then we will behold the whole elephant!

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111proz3]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^116639p6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional, and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians, and other health-care professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

### Subphenotypes in acute kidney injury: a narrative review [^116XyhmC]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical subphenotypes of AKI

Currently, the defining criteria for AKI are based purely on the absolute or relative increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urinary output. Therefore, the definition of AKI does not include information about the trajectory of AKI, AKI biomarkers, or renal recovery criteria. Moreover, it does not acknowledge the significance of recurrent AKI 'hits' within a single hospitalization. However, AKI is heterogeneous in its etiology. Single AKI episodes can differ based on timing of injury, rate of AKI development, natural history specific to etiology, prediction of clinical outcome, and finally, severity. Additionally, outcomes are influenced by baseline kidney function, the duration of AKI, and the interaction with non-kidney organ injury and dysfunction. Moreover, the variability in the application of KDIGO criteria is a great source of heterogeneity and reported varying outcomes especially in database and registry-related research.

The concept of pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal AKI has a long tradition to stratify the etiology of AKI and is among the oldest ways to subphenotype AKI. As the diagnosis of AKI does not account for etiology, conventional diagnostic tools may reveal disease processes with available specific treatment, such as thrombotic microangiopathies, glomerulonephritis, or post-renal obstruction. In addition to these, using creatinine trajectories allow a more tailored and immediate approach to management (Fig. 3).

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115G3zHo]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

Common definitions of AKI rely on changes in serum creatinine and absolute urine output to provide an easy to interpret, objective, and validated approach useful for epidemiologic studies; however, each component of common AKI metrics has limitations. Notably, urine output is significantly influenced by hypovolemia and diuretics, decreasing specificity, while serum creatinine only begins to increase after 50% of functional nephrons are lost, and these changes may not manifest for 48 to 72 h after injury, leading to low sensitivity in previously healthy kidneys. Furthermore, serum creatinine can be impacted by nonrenal factors including age, muscle mass, nutritional status, liver function, and gastrointestinal elimination, further limiting diagnostic accuracy, and not all patients have a recorded baseline serum creatinine. Despite these limitations, serum creatinine remains the standard biomarker for AKI in perioperative practice.

The KDIGO criteria, currently used to define AKI, update two previous consensus definitions, (1) Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage Renal Disease (RIFLE)and (2) AKI-Network (AKIN), to capture patients with smaller creatinine increases, allowing earlier disease detection.

Patient enrichment strategies

AKI is complex and multifactorial, with multiple conditions presenting with clinically indistinguishable features. The heterogeneous nature of AKI syndromes refers to the different exposures that may all lead to acute decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but the underlying mechanisms are quite different (cyclosporin-induced AKI vs septic AKI vs cardiorenal AKI). However, a kidney damage without a loss of function is also associated with worse outcome. Heterogeneity in AKI development and clinical course stems from numerous factors including susceptibility, underlying comorbidities, severity of acute illness, presence of extra-renal organ failures, and the type and severity of the insult leading to AKI. Patient baseline variability, including known and unknown differences in chronic and acute characteristics, can drive differential responses to different interventions and will contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects observed in clinical trials.

Several approaches can be considered to minimize baseline variability in clinical trials. These include stratified randomization to balance key known or clinically apparent baseline characteristics (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD]), use of standardized protocols to minimize process of care variability, selection of a particular clinical setting to focus on a homogenous type of insult (e.g. post-cardiopulmonary bypass), or use of improved diagnostics (e.g. biomarkers) to better identify patient subtypes. Application of prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies (supplementary Table 2) would be expected to identify patients most likely to develop an outcome of interest and respond to an intervention. Precise differential diagnosis may contribute to trial efficiency by selecting patients with traits more likely to favorably respond to candidate therapies. Implementation of enrichment strategies in AKI could enable identification of the right patients for discrete prevention, treatment, and kidney rehabilitation interventions.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^113LUECJ]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical importance of AKD needs to be further assessed. Retrospective cohort data based only on changes in serum creatinine values and with limited clinical context suggest a relevance for AKD: the population of patients who meet laboratory criteria for AKD but not CKD or AKI is relatively large, and these individuals have increased risks of incident and progressive CKD, kidney failure (formally referred to as "end-stage kidney disease"), and death, confirming the need to better define and classify AKD. Furthermore, a revised definition and classification of AKD could be better harmonized with both the definitions and classifications of AKI and CKD and tie to clinical management. As in adults, the AKI/AKD/CKD spectrum should be unified in children, and definitions should be the same for children and adults. A special consideration in children, as well as in adults with low muscle mass, is a reduced serum creatinine concentration, which may impact AKI diagnosis.

The assessment of renal recovery is still controversial, and its definition is essential given the implications for patients and clinicians. Issues related to assessment of recovery include changes in creatinine generation due to reduction in muscle mass, among others.

Advances in diagnosis of AKI

Serum creatinine and urine output continue to be the foundational measures for AKI diagnosis even though their limitations are well known. In the future, kidney damage biomarkers, biopsy, and imaging may be useful for staging AKI, classification of cause, prognosis, and treatment. However, currently there is insufficient information about any of these measures to warrant addition to the AKI definition. Given that the global availability of novel biomarkers is limited, incorporating them into definitions will be challenging. Measurements of real-time or kinetic GFR are research tools at present, and more evidence is needed regarding their clinical applicability (Table 2).

Both urine output and serum creatinine level should continue to be used; ideally, the new AKI guideline would provide further clarification as to the role of these measurements. If possible, both should be ascertained. However, if serum creatinine measurements are not immediately available, urine output criteria should be used.

### Acute kidney injury [^113LsPJo]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.

### Acute kidney injury [^115sSaVq]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. AKI occurs in approximately 10–15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Kidney dysfunction or damage can occur over a longer period or follow AKI in a continuum with acute and chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of kidney injury or stress are new tools for risk assessment and could possibly guide therapy. AKI is not a single disease but rather a loose collection of syndromes as diverse as sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The approach to a patient with AKI depends on the clinical context and can also vary by resource availability. Although the effectiveness of several widely applied treatments is still controversial, evidence for several interventions, especially when used together, has increased over the past decade.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^115BhpEW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

### How to use biomarkers efficiently in acute kidney injury [^114Pxcgi]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

We discuss the performance of novel biomarkers in acute kidney injury (AKI). Comparison of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of several biomarkers with some clinical and/or routine biochemical outcome parameters reveals that none of the biomarkers has demonstrated a clear additional value beyond the traditional approach in clinical decision making in patients with AKI. Unscrutinized use of these biomarkers may distract from adequate clinical evaluation and carries the risk of worse instead of better patient outcome.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^116MgyqL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### Diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated nephrotoxicity: a position statement from the American society of onco-nephrology [^112Prcv9]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of cancer and are now the backbone of therapy for several malignancies. However, ICIs can cause a spectrum of kidney immune-related adverse events including acute kidney injury (AKI), most commonly manifesting as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), although glomerular disease and electrolyte disturbances have also been reported. In this position statement by the American Society of Onco-nephrology (ASON), we summarize the incidence and risk factors for ICI-AKI, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinicopathologic features of ICI-AKI. We also discuss novel diagnostic approaches and promising biomarkers for ICI-AKI. From expert panel consensus, we provide clinical practice points for the initial assessment and diagnosis of ICI-AKI, management and immunosuppressive therapy, and consideration for rechallenge with ICI following AKI episodes. In addition, we explore ICI use in special populations, such as kidney transplant recipients, and propose key areas of focus for future research and clinical investigation.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^113JB182]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current diagnostic methods for AKI and their limitations

The diagnostic criteria for AKI primarily include the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease), AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network), and KDIGO (kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes) standards, all of which emphasize the importance of SCr. Common adjunctive diagnostic methods also include urine output monitoring, imaging tests, and assessments of electrolytes and acid-base balance. In clinical practice, the KDIGO standard is widely used as it combines the advantages of the RIFLE and AKIN criteria, providing a more comprehensive basis for the diagnosis of AKI.

Serum creatinine

SCr is the most used diagnostic tool for acute changes in kidney function. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines recommend the following criteria: an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/mL (≥ 26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h; a SCr increase of more than 1.5 times baseline within the past 7 days; urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) for more than 6 h.

Due to the long half-life of SCr and kidney functional reserve, changes in SCr are not significant during early kidney injury and may not reflect pathological changes in a timely manner. SCr values are influenced by factors such as muscle mass, metabolism, liver function, diet, hydration, and exogenous creatinine intake, and can also be affected by physiological and analytical variability. Drugs (such as cimetidine and trimethoprim) that inhibit tubular secretion or blood concentration (such as diuretics) may cause false elevation, while changes during pregnancy can also affect SCr levels. Additionally, prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal AKI can all lead to an increase in SCr, requiring a comprehensive interpretation in conjunction with the specific cause. Faster testing methods, such as creatinine clearance over 2–4 h, dynamic estimated GFR (kinetic eGFR), or plasma clearance of renal clearance-dependent compounds (such as iohexol), though not yet widely adopted in clinical practice, have been proposed as alternative tools to SCr testing.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^1128wWJv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^116Psxf6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria were introduced in 2004, defining the clinical stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome measures based on serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and urine output. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that these markers are insufficient in drawing an accurate illustration of kidney injury. Indeed, mortality and morbidity remain high in AKI, suggesting that accuracy and speed of patient evaluation are lacking. A great deal of evidence indicates that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a sensitive and specific early marker of various etiological classes of AKI and would be highly valuable in conjunction with existing markers of AKI for better classifying renal injury as well as dysfunction (kidney attack). Improvements in diagnosis, risk identification, stratification, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring will benefit clinical decision-making in the individualized bundling of therapies and ongoing patient management. In particular, kidney protection and AKI prevention may become feasible if an earlier and more accurate diagnosis is made for AKI. Here, we discuss the opportunity to consider whether NGAL is ready for routine clinical use in a number of etiologies of AKI.

### Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: consensus report of the 28th Acute Disease Quality Initiative workgroup [^11222p3J]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is strongly associated with adverse outcomes, including an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events and death. The pathophysiology of SA-AKI remains elusive, although microcirculatory dysfunction, cellular metabolic reprogramming and dysregulated inflammatory responses have been implicated in preclinical studies. SA-AKI is best defined as the occurrence of AKI within 7 days of sepsis onset (diagnosed according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome criteria and Sepsis 3 criteria, respectively). Improving outcomes in SA-AKI is challenging, as patients can present with either clinical or subclinical AKI. Early identification of patients at risk of AKI, or at risk of progressing to severe and/or persistent AKI, is crucial to the timely initiation of adequate supportive measures, including limiting further insults to the kidney. Accordingly, the discovery of biomarkers associated with AKI that can aid in early diagnosis is an area of intensive investigation. Additionally, high-quality evidence on best-practice care of patients with AKI, sepsis and SA-AKI has continued to accrue. Although specific therapeutic options are limited, several clinical trials have evaluated the use of care bundles and extracorporeal techniques as potential therapeutic approaches. Here we provide graded recommendations for managing SA-AKI and highlight priorities for future research.

Evaluate patients with AKI promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes (Not Graded). Monitor patients with AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to stage the severity, according to Recommendation 2.1.2 (Not Graded), and manage patients with AKI according to the stage and cause (Not Graded). Evaluate patients 3 months after AKI for resolution, new onset, or worsening of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (Not Graded).

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^116SLug8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Summary

AKI is a common condition in children admitted to hospital and existing serum and urine biomarkers are insensitive. There have been significant developments in stratifying the risk of AKI in children and also in the identification of new AKI biomarkers. Risk stratification coupled with a panel of AKI biomarkers will improve future detection of AKI, however paediatric validation studies in mixed patient cohorts are required. The principles of effective management rely on treating the underlying cause and preventing secondary AKI by the appropriate use of fluids and medication. Further therapeutic innovation will depend on improving our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying AKI in children.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^113gSKbC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

3. Need for an international collaborative network

AKI is a global problem with varying etiologies and manifestations, but the outcomes are similar. Given the wide global variation in the natural history and management of AKI, it is essential that mechanisms for sharing information and for collaboration among centers be developed. It was felt that the establishment of an international collaborative research effort for AKI would contribute to international research and education about AKI. The group proposed four major topics that would need to be addressed by this initiative (Table 4).

### Classification and staging of acute kidney injury: beyond the RIFLE and AKIN criteria [^1117NoeX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often overlooked in hospitalized patients, despite the fact that even mild forms are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular failure and infections. Research endorsed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative led to the publication of a consensus definition for AKI — the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, and End-stage renal disease) — which was designed to standardize and classify renal dysfunction. These criteria, along with revised versions developed by the AKI Network (AKIN), can detect AKI with high sensitivity and high specificity and describe different severity levels that aim to predict the prognosis of affected patients. The RIFLE and AKIN criteria are easy to use in a variety of clinical and research settings, but have several limitations: both utilize an increase in serum creatinine level from a hypothetical baseline value and a decrease in urine output, but these surrogate markers of renal impairment manifest relatively late after injury has occurred and do not consider the nature or site of the kidney injury. New biomarkers for AKI have shown promise for early diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of AKI. As more data become available, they could, in the future, be incorporated into improved definitions or criteria for AKI.

### Biomarkers for acute kidney injury: is NGAL ready for clinical use? [^111VWrWQ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The need to introduce novel independent biomarkers of AKI into the clinical setting is crucial for earlier diagnosis and improved risk assessment. A parallel problem is the poor understanding of pathophysiology of AKI, which would be improved by the comprehensive characterization of the molecular pathways involved in the propagation of kidney injury.

Some etiological areas may benefit from further work or confirmatory trials in specific populations. However, the development of individual criteria and decision-making frameworks for the etiological variants of AKI is necessary to encompass the variety of factors that can influence clinical decisions. This exercise demands the consensus of experts regarding a proposed protocol for the inclusion of NGAL within evolved RIFLE criteria. At the same time, routine clinical utilization of injury biomarkers will probably be the solution for real advancement in this area.
