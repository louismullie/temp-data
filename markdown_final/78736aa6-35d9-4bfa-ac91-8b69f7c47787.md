## Question

oral mucosites underlying mechanism explanation while discussing prognosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of the underlying mechanism of oral mucositis, including its pathophysiology, temporal dynamics, and how these relate to prognosis, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why mucositis matters prognostically. Then, I should verify the dual-pathway model of direct and indirect injury. Next, I will examine the five-phase sequence and its temporal dynamics. After that, I need to check the key molecular mediators and their thresholds. I will then integrate host and treatment modifiers that shift risk. Finally, I will translate this into prognostic implications and management touchpoints, ensuring each claim aligns with the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why mechanism matters for prognosis. Oral mucositis is a common, dose-limiting toxicity of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation, with severe forms occurring in roughly two-thirds of patients receiving concurrent cisplatin-radiation for head and neck cancer and in the majority of transplant-conditioning regimens, leading to pain, dysphagia, malnutrition, infection risk, treatment interruptions, and substantial cost, all of which can worsen cancer outcomes and quality of life [^113NnN8w] [^116Y5m4D] [^1114jvrj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I need to verify the dual-pathway model. The immediate or direct pathway reflects DNA double-strand breaks and ROS generated within minutes of radiation or cytotoxic exposure, injuring basal epithelial stem cells and initiating a p53-driven DNA damage response, whereas the indirect pathway emerges over days to weeks as cumulative therapy overwhelms cytoprotective systems, amplifying oxidative stress, NF-κB–driven inflammation, and cytokine cascades that sustain and propagate injury beyond the initial insult [^111X85ja] [^111iZHXq] [^113qtkZR].

> Wait, let me verify the temporal dynamics using the canonical five-phase framework. Initiation (phase I) occurs within hours with DNA damage and ROS. Signaling/activation (phase II) follows in 1–3 days with p53 and NF-κB activation. Amplification (phase III) over days to a week features a cytokine-driven positive feedback loop. Ulceration (phase IV) emerges around 10–15 days as barrier breakdown and microbial invasion occur. Healing (phase V) begins around 15–21 days with re-epithelialization once the injurious stimulus abates, though fractionated radiotherapy blurs these boundaries through cumulative vertical crosstalk between fractions [^112faX9R] [^117NT1nc] [^114ELZDR].

> I should confirm the key molecular mediators and their thresholds. ROS are central, with estimates that up to 70% of radiation-induced normal tissue injury is ROS-mediated. Superoxide and hydroxyl radicals overwhelm endogenous antioxidants, destabilize membranes, and activate redox-sensitive transcription factors including NF-κB, AP-1, and HIF-1α, while p53 toggles from pro-survival antioxidant programs to pro-apoptotic responses as oxidative stress exceeds repair capacity, and NF-κB coordinates a pro-inflammatory program that both responds to and amplifies ROS signaling [^111iZHXq] [^113qtkZR] [^114cUzdh].

> Let me consider the tipping-point concept carefully. The indirect pathway dominates clinical severity once cumulative injury surpasses a patient-specific threshold where antioxidant defenses, DNA repair, and epithelial renewal can no longer keep pace. Clinically, this aligns with erythema appearing after about 15–20 Gy and ulceration peaking after cumulative doses around 30 Gy in fractionated head and neck radiotherapy, with the exact threshold modulated by intrinsic factors such as genetics, epigenetics, and microbiome, as well as treatment factors like field size, fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy [^112faX9R] [^113NnN8w] [^115PVSLa].

> I need to check host modifiers that shift risk and trajectory. Female sex and smoking associate with higher risk, while baseline oral health, salivary flow, and the oral microbiome influence both susceptibility and severity. Dysbiosis and specific bacterial taxa can exacerbate injury via metabolic and immune interactions, and germ-free or microbiome-manipulation models increasingly support a causal contribution of microbes to mucositis pathogenesis, although translation to clinical microbiome-targeted therapies remains early and heterogeneous [^115PVSLa] [^111R786C] [^114tC1pj].

> Next, I should review treatment modifiers that modulate mechanism and outcome. Concurrent cisplatin or fluoropyrimidine chemoradiation markedly increases severe mucositis rates, altered fractionation schedules intensify mucosal injury, and targeted agents such as mTOR inhibitors (for example, everolimus) can independently cause stomatitis through distinct but overlapping pathways. Conversely, evidence-based supportive strategies like basic oral care, cryotherapy for short-half-life agents, and palifermin in select settings mitigate risk by targeting upstream drivers or promoting epithelial renewal, though no single intervention is universally effective across contexts [^113NnN8w] [^1163rcDK] [^117BzLcm] [^113x7JCM].

> But wait, what about the prognostic implications of severity and duration. Severe mucositis independently predicts treatment interruptions or dose reductions, which can compromise local control and survival in head and neck cancers. It also increases hospitalization, infection risk including bacteremia, and healthcare costs, and in immunosuppressed hosts, mucositis-related bacteremia correlates with higher 100-day mortality, underscoring that mucositis is not merely a symptom but a clinically meaningful toxicity with systemic consequences [^116Y5m4D] [^113NnN8w] [^116jcDgq].

> I should double-check the mechanistic links to these outcomes. Barrier breakdown permits microbial translocation and secondary infection, pain and dysphagia drive malnutrition and dehydration, and systemic inflammatory signaling can perpetuate cachexia and immune dysregulation. Notably, oral foci of infection correlate with prolonged post-transplant length of stay, and severe mucositis is a leading cause of unplanned treatment breaks in head and neck chemoradiation, reinforcing the prognostic weight of mucositis severity and duration [^113xXvHS] [^113NnN8w] [^113rrp7t].

> Let me reconsider whether early, mechanism-targeted interventions can alter prognosis. Strategies that blunt ROS, interrupt NF-κB–driven inflammation, or augment epithelial renewal can delay or attenuate the tipping point; for example, palifermin reduces severe mucositis in high-risk settings, cryotherapy reduces mucositis in bolus 5-FU and melphalan contexts, and emerging agents like avasopasem (a superoxide dismutase mimetic) directly target ROS to reduce severe oral mucositis in chemoradiation, though optimal timing and patient selection remain under study [^113x7JCM] [^112y7zR4] [^1114ZYBy].

> In summary, I need to ensure the mechanistic-prognostic bridge is explicit. Oral mucositis arises when direct cytotoxic injury is amplified by an indirect cascade of oxidative stress and inflammation that, once it exceeds a patient-specific biological threshold, produces clinically significant barrier failure, pain, infection risk, and treatment disruption. Therefore, mechanism-informed prevention and early, aggressive symptom control are not just supportive care but integral to preserving treatment intensity and, potentially, improving survival and quality of life in patients undergoing curative-intent therapy [^111X85ja] [^113NnN8w] [^116Y5m4D].

Oral mucositis is driven by **direct epithelial injury** from chemotherapy/radiation [^117Ai4Zn] and **indirect inflammatory amplification** via ROS, NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) [^113qtkZR] [^1168M29n], with microbiome dysbiosis further worsening damage [^111R786C]. Clinically, it progresses through five phases: initiation, upregulation, amplification, ulceration, and healing [^112faX9R] [^113L5Ycq], with severity peaking around 4–5 weeks of radiotherapy [^112faX9R]. Prognosis is shaped by treatment factors (dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy) [^116QEf6Y] [^113NnN8w], patient factors (age, comorbidities, oral hygiene, genetics) [^113gDz8y] [^116rjmTz] [^1163rcDK] [^115PVSLa], and the severity/duration of mucositis, which can cause pain, infection, malnutrition, treatment delays, and increased healthcare costs [^116Y5m4D] [^116jcDgq]. Management is **multimodal**, including basic oral care, pain control, infection prevention, and nutritional support [^116PURyY]; emerging therapies targeting ROS and inflammation are under study [^1137FCBq] [^1114ZYBy].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Direct epithelial injury

DNA damage from **radiation and chemotherapy** causes DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis in rapidly dividing basal epithelial cells [^111X85ja] [^1168M29n], reducing renewal and causing atrophy and ulceration [^112faX9R]. Oxidative stress arises because radiation generates **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** [^111iZHXq] that overwhelm antioxidant defenses, damaging lipids, proteins, and DNA and promoting cell death [^111iZHXq] [^115r1oU5] [^113qtkZR].

---

### Indirect inflammatory amplification

- **NF-κB activation**: Radiation-induced ROS activate NF-κB [^113qtkZR], driving transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and amplifying inflammation [^1168M29n].

- **Cytokine cascade**: These cytokines recruit neutrophils and macrophages, further increasing ROS and tissue damage [^111iZHXq].

- **Microbiome dysbiosis**: Therapy disrupts oral microbiota [^114mCtmr]; pathogenic bacteria colonize ulcers, producing endotoxins and proteases that worsen mucosal injury [^114tC1pj].

---

### Temporal progression (five-phase model)

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Key events** |
|-|-|-|
| Initiation | Days 0–2 | DNA damage, ROS, epithelial apoptosis [^117NT1nc] |
| Upregulation | Days 2–3 | NF-κB activation, cytokine expression [^117NT1nc] |
| Amplification | Days 2–10 | Cytokine cascade, inflammatory amplification [^117NT1nc] |
| Ulceration | Days 10–15 | Barrier breakdown, microbial invasion, severe pain [^117NT1nc] |
| Healing | Days 15–21 | Re-epithelialization, resolution [^117NT1nc] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and complications

- **Pain and functional impairment**: Severe pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, and difficulty eating/drinking [^117Ai4Zn].

- **Infection risk**: Ulcerations allow bacterial/fungal invasion, increasing sepsis risk, especially in immunosuppressed patients [^112y7zR4].

- **Nutritional impact**: Reduced intake leads to malnutrition, weight loss, and dehydration [^113NnN8w].

- **Treatment disruptions**: Severe mucositis often necessitates treatment delays, dose reductions, or interruptions, potentially compromising outcomes [^113NnN8w].

---

## Prognostic factors

### Treatment-related factors

Treatment-related factors include **higher radiation dose, altered fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy** [^116QEf6Y] [^111VCQVU], which increase severity and duration [^113NnN8w]. The **cumulative radiation dose** correlates with mucositis severity; ulceration typically emerges after ~30 Gy [^116QEf6Y].

---

### Patient-related factors

Patient-related factors include **older age, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease, and comorbidities** (e.g. diabetes, malnutrition), which elevate risk and severity [^116rjmTz] [^117Ai4Zn]. Genetic polymorphisms in cytokine and oxidative stress pathways also influence susceptibility and severity [^115PVSLa] [^114VuykX].

---

### Severity and duration

Greater severity and longer duration are linked to higher risks of infection, nutritional compromise, and treatment interruptions, worsening prognosis [^116Y5m4D] [^116jcDgq].

---

## Management strategies

- **Basic oral care**: Regular oral hygiene, saline rinses, and non-alcoholic mouthwashes reduce severity and infection risk [^notfound].

- **Pain management**: Topical anesthetics, systemic analgesics, and opioids for severe pain [^111VQsps].

- **Infection prevention**: Antimicrobial rinses and prophylactic antifungals reduce infection risk [^notfound].

- **Nutritional support**: Dietary counseling, oral supplements, and enteral/parenteral nutrition as needed [^116jcDgq].

- **Emerging therapies**: Agents targeting ROS (e.g. avasopasem) [^1114ZYBy] and anti-inflammatory compounds are under investigation [^112pvxpf].

---

Oral mucositis arises from **direct epithelial injury** and **indirect inflammatory amplification**, with severity driven by treatment and patient factors. It causes significant morbidity, impairs treatment adherence, and increases costs; **multimodal care** and targeted therapies are essential to improve outcomes.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review highlights the range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at alleviating pain in OM. OM remains a significant complication of cancer therapy, with complex pathogenesis and substantial impact on patient quality of life. Enhanced pain management strategies are crucial, as they can reduce treatment delays, minimize dose reductions, and ultimately enhance therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, effective management may lower healthcare costs by decreasing the need for supportive interventions and hospitalizations.

Given the complexity of OM pathogenesis and the diverse inflammatory mediators involved in pain perception, no single intervention has proven sufficient to address OM across its various stages. Effective management often requires a combination of treatments, beginning with topical medications and escalating to systemic therapy. Despite the variety of available options, a well-established gold-standard protocol has yet to be defined.

Assessing the efficacy of mouthwashes for pain management presents challenges due to variations in their composition and concentration across clinical studies. This lack of standardization complicates the application of findings to clinical practice. Certain mouthwashes, such as those containing lidocaine, doxepin, or benzydamine, have demonstrated promising results for pain relief. However, the potential benefits of combining different pain management strategies remain unclear. Further clinical data are needed to determine whether such combinations could enhance pain reduction. Looking ahead, prioritizing research on novel molecular pathways — such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and neurotrophic factors — holds promise for the development of more targeted and effective therapies.

### Management of cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis [^111yuAcp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The oral mucosa is a common site for collateral damage of cancer therapies, including radiation, cytotoxic medication, and newer targeted therapies. Ulcerative oral mucositis is typically painful and affects oral functions including speech, and oral intake of food and medications, thus impacting the quality of life. Denuded epithelium may also provide access of oral microbial flora to the deeper tissues and the circulation. Prevention of oral mucositis is an ongoing quest currently with relatively few answers. In this chapter, the present authors discuss the evidence and current practice for prophylaxis and management of this treatment side effect in cancer patients.

### Oral mucositis induced by risperidone: rare side effect of a frequently prescribed medication [^111f27K5]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Although there is no clear evidence concerning the aetiological mechanisms underlying antipsychotic-induced oral lesions, this case report supports the hypothesis that antipsychotic-induced oral ulcerations result from the reduction of saliva protection with minor effects related to oral movement disorders or impairment of the bacterial flora of the saliva. Owenby and colleaguesreported an incidence of dry mouth as high as 30.4% in a review concerning the use of risperidone as augmentation treatment for major depressive disorder. Furthermore, a strong association between antipsychotics and reduction in salivary secretion was found in four 70-year-old Swedish cohorts during a 30-year period (n = 1072): these findings were adjusted also for gender, cohort and number of teeth.

Importantly, all the agents associated with xerostomia may predispose patients to stomatitis and tongue pain, especially if administered in combination. In order to preclude the development of this complication with such drugs, extra time and efforts should be provided to improve the patient's oral hygiene. As a matter of fact, the management of patients with psychosis primarily involves mechanical debridement, maintenance of proper oral hygiene and removal of potential causative oral agents. In most cases, the elimination of any incriminating factor is usually sufficient to treat the lesions and no drugs are required. Overall, the prognosis of these patients is excellent if the disease is self-limiting.

In our case, poor oral hygiene due to the psychiatric condition and the use of false dentition may also have predisposed our patient to the onset of stomatitis and mild oral ulcerations leading to the immediate discontinuation of risperidone.

### New frontiers in mucositis… [^114VuykX]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Standard-dose chemotherapy causes oral mucositis in up to 40% of patients, whereas high-dose chemotherapy related to stem cell/bone marrow transplantation causes oral mucositis in up to 80% of patients. Painful mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal toxicity including diarrhea can significantly compromise QoL. 17For example, a prospective, multicenter study of the burden of mucosal toxicity on patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy for various cancers demonstrated that for each increasing grade of oral mucositis or diarrhea, there is a corresponding significant reduction in QoL. 18Given the importance of these and related toxicities there is important opportunity in the era of the Internet and tablet computers to enhance collection and analysis of toxicity data. This strategy would enable clinicians to better understand toxicity being experienced by patients and to intervene more quickly.
19.

In addition, both systemic and tissue-associated increases of proinflammatory cytokines are associated with regimen-related mucosal injury. 30, 31Genetically controlled variability in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and its association with disease status has been well established. For example, the presence of SNPs associated with TNF-α has a significant effect on severe toxicity risk, including mucositis, in an allogeneic stem cell transplant population.
35. Perhaps a more comprehensive assessment of genetically based risk could thus be biologically valid. An alternative approach has thus been recently validated. This approach has been recently applied to the practical clinical problem of predicting oral mucositis risk for patients with hematologic malignancies receiving standard conditioning regimens in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These treatments typically result in severe mucositis in almost 40% of treated patients.

27The mucosa has not escaped as a tissue at risk and, in fact is actually a common site for toxicities. 3 Toxicity data thus continue to accumulate at a rapid rate. In general, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of mucosal injury has not been well studied, although it likely occurs through different pathways than those described for cytotoxic drugs or radiation. Consequently, clinical course may vary with respect to onset, duration, cycle-associated risk, and clinical presentation. Diarrhea is common, as is exacerbation of mouth ulcers. As targeted therapies continue to evolve, more aggressive investigation to understand their cellular etiologies will be critical to develop effective interventions.

### Guidance on mucositis assessment from the MASCC mucositis study group and ISOO: an international Delphi study [^115gFyBR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our recommendations have been purposely designed to match specific clinical contexts, defined by treatment modality and separated for oral mucositis and gastrointestinal mucositis, providing contextualized recommendations for both clinical assessment and relevant PROMs, as well as their frequency. Our guidelines have also been separated based on whether the assessment is in the clinical practice or clinical trial context, recognizing that each setting may have different objectives for mucositis assessment, e.g. clinical decision-making vs evaluating the efficacy of an anti-mucositis intervention. In everyday clinical setting, as well as in the clinical trial context where anti-mucositis interventions are being investigated, PROMs should be strongly prioritized given the goal of reducing symptom burden, not strictly mucosal damage, and the fact that objective tissue damage does not necessarily equate to perceived symptom burden. Also, it should be acknowledged that the use of the suggested scales to assess mucositis should not prevent physicians from evaluating other symptoms induced by mucositis with other scales. For instance, the evaluation of pain by means of the widely used visual analogue scale or the numeric rating scale should continue to be performed as an essential part of the clinical visit.

In implementing these recommendations, it is also critical that the longitudinal and often episodic nature of mucositis and its associated symptoms be acknowledged. Of course, this reiterates the need to perform frequent assessments where possible to capture the both the severity and duration of symptoms. This is ultimately what enables the true burden of mucositis to be defined, where 1–2 days of severe mucositis may indeed be equally burdensome as 7 days of mild mucositis. Calculating the area under the curve may be a simple way to synthesize both duration and severity, and thus easily compare burden across individual patients or study populations. However, in performing repeated assessments, the risk of the patient's perception of symptom burden may also shift as previously discussed. Including measures of response shift can be helpful in evaluating true change, and thus mucositis trajectories, in these patients.

### The pathogenesis of mucositis: updated perspectives and emerging targets [^115nxrx6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Mucositis research and treatment are a rapidly evolving field providing constant new avenues of research and potential therapies. The MASCC/ISOO Mucositis Study Group regularly assesses available literature relating to pathogenesis, mechanisms, and novel therapeutic approaches and distils this to summary perspectives and recommendations. Reviewers assessed 164 articles published between January 2011 and June 2016 to identify progress made since the last review and highlight new targets for further investigation. Findings were organized into sections including established and emerging mediators of toxicity, potential insights from technological advances in mucositis research, and perspective. Research momentum is accelerating for mucositis pathogenesis, and with this has come utilization of new models and interventions that target specific mechanisms of injury. Technological advances have the potential to revolutionize the field of mucositis research, although focused effort is needed to move rationally targeted interventions to the clinical setting.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^114tC1pj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The core pathogenesis of mucositis is well established, initiated by direct cytotoxic damage to rapidly dividing stem cells. While it is known that secondary inflammatory mechanisms serve to exacerbate this initial injury, the understanding of these mechanisms has continuously evolved, reflecting more sophisticated models of mucositis and investigational approaches. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) have systematically reviewed and updated the original 5-phase model of mucositis pathogenesis proposed by Sonis in 2004, with the most recent update published in 2019. In the 2019 update, the possible involvement of the oral and gut microbiota was discussed, along with tangible mechanisms for how these resident microorganisms may contribute to mucositis development causally. This marked a revolution in our understanding of host-microbe interactions in the context of mucositis development as, prior to this, microbes (including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi, and yeast) had only been recognized for their opportunistic nature, in which they colonized areas of ulceration and potentially translocated into the blood stream. While this highlighted an important new component of mucositis pathogenesis, conclusions regarding the true causal role of the microbiota and its associated metabolome ("the microbiome") were limited due to the inherent challenges in defining causation with respect to the microbiome and, as such, a low number of studies that were appropriately designed to draw these conclusions. However, since the 2019 update, several studies have moved beyond these associative findings, and the contribution of the oral and gut microbiota to mucositis is increasingly evident. Here, we provide an updated perspective on the oral and gut microbiome contribution to mucositis pathogenesis while also placing a critical lens on the complex methodological approaches needed to dissect cause-and-effect.

### Oral inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis exacerbate chronic graft-versus-host disease [^113oFHEL]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- Oral mucositis severity was tied to chronic GVHD in both HLA-matched HCT and haploidentical HCT using posttransplant cyclophosphamide.
- Oral dysbiosis caused harmful bacteria to migrate to lymph nodes and the intestine, leading to persistent activation of immune cells.

### Oral foci of infection and their relationship with hospital stay after haematopoietic cell transplantation [^113xXvHS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

There can be various mechanisms through which oral foci of infection may contribute to prolonged hospital LOS. Firstly, oral foci may result in oral exacerbations. This could not be confirmed in this study, as the incidence of oral exacerbations was very low and two out of four oral exacerbations could not be linked to an oral focus. Secondly, oral infections can act as site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites triggering systemic infections. Bloodstream infections are frequent in neutropenic patients, and inadequacy of the inflammatory response makes sepsis a significant cause of morbidity in this setting. However, prior research did not find an association between pre-HCT oral health status and increased risk of bacteraemia. Thirdly, oral foci may directly induce an inflammatory response in mucosal tissues, potentially increasing the incidence and severity of oral mucositis and thereby increasing LOS. However, prior research did not find a relationship between oral foci and the development of oral mucositis during chemotherapy in patients with solid tumours or lymphoma. Lastly, there might be a shared risk profile for both oral foci occurrence and extended LOS, with unmeasured variables possibly distorting this association. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for all known and measured confounders. Nevertheless, other factors such as the impact of underlying disease and antineoplastic therapy in the past and remission status could have influenced the results.

Data for this study were collected in a clinical setting where patients received treatment based on clinical indication. Severity of chronic oral foci of infection likely played a role in the treatment decision. For instance, larger periapical radiolucencies and deeper periodontal pockets may have been treated more frequently than smaller periapical radiolucencies or less severe periodontal pockets. As a consequence, the association between oral foci and hospital LOS could be even more substantial than our current findings suggest.

In conclusion, our study showed that the presence of at least three oral foci of infection after pre-HCT dental treatment was associated with a statistically significantly longer hospital LOS in the early post-HCT phase. Allogeneic HCT recipients with at least three oral foci had an additional 12 days in the hospital compared to those without oral foci. These findings suggest that minimal intervention before transplantation, especially in allogeneic HCT recipients, may not always be adequate. However, this association does not imply causation, and there is insufficient evidence to state that pre-HCT dental treatment reduces LOS. Further research should clarify the association between oral foci of infection and bacteraemia, neutropenia, fever and oral mucositis.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^1137FCBq]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis (OM) remains a significant unmet need for patients being treated with standard concomitant chemoradiation (CRT) regimens for head and neck cancers (HNC). OM's pathogenesis is complex and includes both direct and indirect damage pathways. In this paper, the field is reviewed with emphasis on the initiating and sustaining role of oxidative stress on OM's pathobiology. A hypothesis is presented which suggests that based on OM's clinical and biological trajectory, mucosal damage is largely the consequence of cumulative CRT-induced biological changes overwhelming physiologic self-protective mechanisms. Furthermore, an individual's ability to mount and maintain a protective response is dependent on interacting pathways which are primarily determined by a multiplex consisting of genomics, epigenomics, and microbiomics. Effective biologic or pharmacologic OM interventions are likely to supplement or stimulate existing physiologic damage-control mechanisms.

### Neutropenic ulcers in oncology: terminology, diagnosis, and management [^115yVgcf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutropenic ulcerations are characterized by mucosal ulcerations which occur in the presence of neutropenia, suggesting a direct link between neutropenia and mucosal ulceration. An oral ulcer can be labeled as "neutropenic" only if the patients have primary (typically congenital) or secondary neutropenia, and neutropenia is the sole causative factor. Oral mucosal ulcers observed in patients undergoing oncologic therapy may also be termed as "neutropenic ulcers", but the pathogenesis of these oral ulcers more likely involves mucosal events related to trauma, microbial factors, and direct cytotoxicity. In cancer patients, the early appearance of oral ulcers is often attributed to oral mucositis which is a condition primarily caused by the direct mucosal cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. Oral ulcers that develop later during or after active cancer therapy may result from intraoral trauma and typically manifest on non-keratinized areas of the oral mucosa which are more susceptible to mucosal damage. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, factors such as disturbances in mucosal barrier function as well as bone marrow suppression lead to reduced neutrophil count and function, and can contribute to the development of oral ulcers. While the etiology of oral ulcers in cancer therapy receiving patients can vary, it is important to emphasize that the host's response plays a crucial role in the progression and repair process of these lesions. This narrative review presents the etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, and potential management approaches for oral ulcerations in neutropenic patients, with a particular focus on clarifying the usage of the term "neutropenic ulcer" since this term lacks diagnostic specificity and can be misleading in clinical practice regarding the underlying causes and treatment strategies.

### Effectiveness of glutamine in the management of oral mucositis in cancer patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116Y5KAG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of glutamine for preventing or treating moderate-to-severe oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy or radiation therapy in patients with cancer.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to June 2020. The outcomes analyzed were oral mucositis (at all levels of severity). Data were pooled using the random-effects model and are expressed as risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified using I².

Results

Sixteen RCTs were included in this review. In this meta-analysis, compared with placebo, glutamine significantly reduced the incidence of grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88). In subgroup analysis, oral glutamine administration (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92) and a medium or low daily dose of glutamine (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28–0.94; respectively) decreased risk. Glutamine caused a borderline significant reduction in the risk of grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis induced by radiotherapy (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58–0.99) and especially in its prevention (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28–0.94).

Conclusions

Glutamine significantly reduces the risk of oral mucositis during chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Furthermore, large prospective trials are required to support these findings.

In contrast, the indirect pathway is responsible for most of the acute and chronic tissue effects associated with ROM. Its activity is reflective of the inability of physiologic defense mechanisms to mitigate accumulating radiation stressors resulting in an imbalance in which biological injury drivers such as free radicals and damaging cytokines cannot be sufficiently controlled as other damage signals are initiated. Those mechanisms that provide protection and healing are superseded by a cascade of destructive elements. Primary cytoprotective actions are replaced by the biological imperative to eliminate irreversibly damaged cells or mutated DNA. Whereas the immediate pathway is uninterrupted and focused, the indirect pathway is more nuanced and contains several different mediators, most under genetic control, which interact with each other. It is, therefore, sensitive to patients' genomics, tumor biology, and other intrinsic factors. Its impact becomes most clinically obvious when the threshold of a patient's cytoprotective mechanisms is surpassed. Ultimately patients' risk and course of ROM reflect the cumulative effect of both immediate and indirect pathways.

Overwhelmingly, it is injury provoked by non-DSB mechanisms that accounts for most RITs. The DNA damage response results in ATM-mediated p53 activation, lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, and sphingomyelinase activation and prompts activation of the innate immune response and inflammasome. But it is uncontrolled oxidative stress that plays the biggest role in the indirect pathway, leading to the greatest turmoil which ultimately poses the most significant mucosal survival threat. Couple that with an inability of cell repair processes to keep pace with ROS-induced injury and the balance tips in favor of severe ROM.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^111juAx7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

As the complexity of ROM pathogenesis has been further defined, we have mapped the steps leading to and sustaining injury, developed a biological event hierarchy, and sequentially integrated biological signaling into our picture of ROM's clinical course. With this understanding, better strategies to identify effective druggable targets have ensued.

But executing on those strategies has been difficult. The biological cascade that follows a single acute dose of radiation is complicated. PubMed contains over 7000 papers describing normal tissue response to RT and about 10,000 with keywords including "radiation" and "normal tissue". Overwhelmingly, each manuscript focuses on a single biological molecule, cell type, organelle, or pathway, at one time point. A global picture is absent. To put this into perspective, imagine you were tasked with drawing a country map by piecing together detailed maps of individual cities. Now imagine that the city maps changed daily; you get an idea of the difficulties in comprehensively defining ROM pathogenesis in the context of a fractionated radiotherapy course. A working paradigm describing ROM's pathogenesis must address three observations. First, not only does radiation impact cancer cells and normal cells in different ways, but there is variability depending on normal cell type. Second, while initial ROM clinical changes are attributable to immediate direct cell injury, its time and fraction-dependent progression and sustainment are dominated by indirect signaling, enzymatic shifts, and protein and non-protein intermediaries. In aggregate, these indirect effects are the major contributors to ROM development. Finally, the extensive complex of biological events and mediators which initiate, catalyze, and sustain radiation-induced injury is dynamic. The degree with which it impacts ROM reflects the extent of homeostasis loss as a function of cumulative radiation dose. Thus, direct damage can be reasonably modeled as a radiation dose response, while the indirect damage pathway is subject to intrinsic genomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic influences.

### Unraveling the complexity of radiotherapy-and chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis: insights into pathogenesis and intervention strategies [^114mCtmr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiotherapy- or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (RIOM/CIOM) presents significant challenges in cancer treatment, severely impacting patients' quality of life (QoL) and therapeutic outcomes. Despite advancements, existing prevention and treatment measures have notable limitations. RIOM/CIOM involves a multifaceted interplay of inflammatory cascades orchestrated by the innate immune response. Furthermore, dysbiosis of oral and intestinal microbiota, triggered by anticancer therapy, exacerbates mucosal damage through intricate interactions with the innate immune system. This review provides an update on pivotal signaling pathways governing the initiation and progression of RIOM/CIOM. It also elucidates the intricate relationship between microbiota dysbiosis and dysregulation of oral mucosal immune homeostasis. Moreover, potential interventions targeting these pathogenic mechanisms are summarized, offering valuable insights for further exploration of RIOM/CIOM's complex pathophysiology and the development of more effective interventions.

### Mucositis (or stomatitis) [^117Ai4Zn]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gupta A, West H. Mucositis. JAMA Oncol. 2016; 2:

1379. doi:
10. 1001/jamaoncol.
2016. 2103 Mucositis is inflammation and damage of the mucous membranes lining the mouth and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Mucositis is a common side effect of chemotherapy and can also be seen in individuals who receive bone-marrow transplants or radiation therapy. Younger patients and those with poor dental hygiene, dry mouths, or gum disease are at higher risk of developing mucositis, though it is not possible to predict which patients will develop mucositis. Specific chemotherapy drugs, their dose and frequency of administration, and concomitant irradiation can affect the risk of developing mucositis. Mucositis typically develops 5 to 14 days after chemotherapy. Symptoms range from a mild soreness in the mouth to a severe form requiring hospitalization. Symptoms include pain, burning, and redness in the mouth.

Ulcers may develop, increasing the risk for bleeding and infection. Dryness of the mouth can lead to bad breath as well as difficulty in speaking and tasting food. Pain and difficulty swallowing may limit food and water intake, leading to dehydration and weight loss. A feeding tube may sometimes be required to supplement or replace feeding by mouth. In severe cases, patients may need to be admitted to the hospital for pain control, intravenous fluids and nutrition, and monitoring and treatment of superimposed infection or bleeding. Patients with uncontrolled diarrhea or blood in their stool are often admitted to the hospital. Most patients who develop mucositis are able to safely resume chemotherapy, although the dose and schedule of further treatment may sometimes be altered. A thorough oral and dental care assessment prior to initiating chemotherapy may reduce the risk of mucositis.

Swishing ice chips in the mouth for 30 minutes around the time of chemotherapy, sometimes referred to as "oral cryotherapy, " may provide a very inexpensive and effective way to prevent or minimize mucositis. Palifermin, a drug that promotes healing and regeneration of cells, low-level laser irradiation to the mouth, and mouthwashes may be helpful in preventing stomatitis in certain high-risk patients. In addition, certain medications can be used to reduce GI mucositis in the appropriate clinical setting.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^116JoTBe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications: how does the complexity of toxicity pathogenesis impact risk assessment, druggable targets, and precision medicine?

ROM occurs in two phases. Immediate injury mediated primarily by DSBs begins right after the first dose of radiation. Manifestations of cell injury such as ROM are, at this stage, probably limited and reversible up to a threshold dose, perhaps around 30 Gy. Mechanisms associated with immediate injury are only modestly influenced by, or responsive to, intrinsic factors such as patient genomics.

The indirect pathway is, for normal tissue, catastrophic, most clinically meaningful, and the result of cytoprotective mechanisms being overwhelmed by radiation-induced stress. It occurs at a threshold dose of radiation at which the cell and tissue capacity to neutralize or reverse the physiologic impact of recurrent radiation challenges is surpassed. The indirect pathway differs from the immediate pathway in three major ways: First, the radiation threshold dose at which it is initiated varies among patients as it is the subject to intrinsic controlling mechanisms including genomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and microbiomics; second, it is indirect and enabled by intermediates including mediators of oxidative stress, cytokines, and enzymes; and third, it is influenced by signaling from bystander cells.

The consequences of these differences provide insight into clinical behaviors, opportunities for ROM risk prediction, and intervention targeting (Fig. 3). From a hierarchical standpoint, the ability to contain ROS and blunt the downstream effects of key transcription factors seems an obvious strategy for interfering with the indirect pathway. In the face of out-of-control ROS levels, solely blocking downstream events is likely to fail. So this leads to four approaches: (1) reducing oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals; (2) combination agents which are pleiotropic, effectively mitigating ROS levels, transcription factor activation, and cytokine production; (3) extrinsic supplementation in which therapeutically administered "lifeboat" compounds metabolize excessive ROS; and (4) pharmacologically mediated expression or activation of ROS-controlling enzymes.

Fig. 3
Mucositis is the consequence of the cumulative biological effects of the radiation challenge exceeding the intrinsic capacity of physiological protective mechanisms. Increasing the threshold for a gain in biological protection results in consequent increase in the threshold for manifestations of mucosal injury. Interventional strategies that supplement protective mechanisms and pathways or those that stimulate intrinsic mechanisms to optimize their effectiveness have proven to be most effective.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^116Xrje7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radiation-induced toxicities (RIT) threaten treatment tolerance, cause tissue injury, compromise quality of life, and increase healthcare resource use. No group is more at risk of RIT than head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Even with improved radiotherapy (RT) technology and techniques, this cohort consistently suffers both acute and chronic RITs. None is more impactful than OM.

Many past attempts to identify an effective pharmacologic solution for radiation-induced oral mucositis (ROM) have failed. It seems that underestimating the biological complexities of ROM's pathogenesis contributed to missteps in accurately identifying druggable targets. Gone are the days when ROM was assumed to be solely due to direct DNA damage in epithelial stem cells, that a single group of cells (endothelium) influenced another (epithelium), that normal and tumor cells responded identically to radiation, or that the molecular path leading to tissue damage was accurately represented by a linear cascade.

### New pharmacotherapy options for chemotherapy-induced alimentary mucositis [^112x88Vg]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced alimentary mucositis is an extremely common condition that is caused by a breakdown of the mucosal barrier. It occurs in between 40–100% of cancer patients depending on the treatment regimen. Symptoms typically include pain from oral ulceration, vomiting and diarrhoea. Alimentary mucositis often necessitates chemotherapy reductions or treatment breaks, overall potentially compromising survival outcomes. Consequently, alimentary mucositis creates a burden not only on patients' quality of life but also on healthcare costs. Despite this, currently, there is no clinically effective localised/pharmacological therapy intervention strategy to prevent alimentary mucositis.

Areas Covered

Over recent years, a number of novel pharmacotherapy agents have been trialed in various preclinical and clinical settings. This critical review will therefore provide an overview of emerging pharmacotherapies for the treatment of alimentary mucositis following chemotherapy with particular emphasis on studies published in the last 2 years. A Pubmed literature search was conducted to identify eligible articles published before 30 November 2013 and each article was reviewed by all authors. All articles were written in English.

Expert Opinion

Currently, there is no clinically effective localised therapeutic intervention strategy to prevent the condition. New emerging areas of research have recently been proposed to play key roles in the development of alimentary mucositis and these areas may provide researchers and clinicians with new research directions. Hopefully this will continue, and evidence-based informed guidelines can be produced to improve clinical practice management of this condition.

### Alimentary tract mucositis in cancer patients: impact of terminology and assessment on research and clinical practice [^111Nyi4x]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Significance

The field of terminology and assessment of oral and gastrointestinal mucosal injury caused by high-dose cancer therapies in cancer patients has undergone important evolution in recent years. The advances are important for several clinical and research reasons. These reasons include improved patient management and design and conduct of clinical trials based on molecularly targeted therapies. For several decades leading up to the 1980s, terminology was characterized by varying use of "mucositis" and "stomatitis" to describe oral mucosal inflammatory changes and ulceration caused by cancer treatments. In addition, oral mucositis was viewed principally as an epithelial event and one that likely did not intersect with causative mechanisms associated with gastrointestinal mucositis. The term "stomatitis" was directed to oral toxicities and seemed to isolate these conditions from parallel events occurring throughout the alimentary tract and potentially other tissues as well. These perspectives and varying use of these terms resulted in several dilemmas, including (1) difficulty in accurately reporting incidence and severity of oral mucositis and, (2) an under-appreciation of potential significance of alimentary tract mucosal toxicity relative to overall course of therapy, patient quality of life, and in some cases, survivorship. These and related components of the model relative to mucositis have undergone strategic shifts over the past 15 years. A 1989 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference targeted oral mucositis research as one of the key areas for investigation relative to causation, clinical impact, and potential links with other complications in cancer patients. Research in this area over the past 15 years has evolved such that oral and gastrointestinal mucositis are now appropriately framed as a continuum of pathobiologic changes over time, with clinical impact that may well contribute to overall symptom clustering in selected patient cohorts.

Objectives

This paper will review history, current status, and new research directions associated with terminology and assessment of mucosal injury in cancer patients in the context described above.

P53 — tipping the balance?

Radiation-induced DNA strand breaks initiate a p53 DNA-damage response. Triggered by ATM activation, p53 accumulates in the nucleus to initiate cell cycle arrest and promote survival and regulation of oxidative stress and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. P53's impact on the cell's response to oxidative stress varies with the level of ROS. During the initial stages of radiation, when ROS is modest, p53 signaling favors antioxidation by increasing antioxidant enzyme transcription including MnSOD. However, once the extent of oxidative stress outstrips the ability of cytoprotective mechanisms to cope with increasing ROS levels as a consequence of cumulative radiation, the role of p53 shifts from promoting cell survival to protecting the organism from irrevocably damaged DNA. JNK signaling activates pro-oxidant genes such as p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Lipid peroxidation is enhanced and previously supported MnSOD activation is instead impaired through mitochondrial disruption.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice guidelines for the management of mucositis secondary to cancer therapy [^11415XuD]. Cancer (2020). High credibility.

MASCC/ISOO mucositis guidelines — methods and classification describe a literature search from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016 with additional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from July 2016 to June 2019; articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers using a standard form, and a single RCT was considered sufficient to develop a guideline. Efficacy analyses of placebo-controlled studies focused on 4 types of effects (mucositis severity, mucositis duration, pain severity, and pain duration), while active-comparator trials were assessed separately. Findings were merged with prior evidence and organized by level of evidence into categories of recommendation, suggestion, or no guideline possible (NGP), with negative guidelines based on lack of efficacy and not indicating harm. Guidelines were specified by clinical setting: the aim (prevention or treatment), the cancer treatment modality (radiation therapy [RT], chemotherapy [CT], RT-CT, or high-dose conditioning therapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]), and the route of administration. Because of the literature volume, the project was divided into 8 sections (basic oral care; anti-inflammatory; photobiomodulation [laser and other light therapy]; cryotherapy; antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and analgesics; growth factors and cytokines; natural and miscellaneous agents; and all interventions for gastrointestinal mucositis).

### Guidance on mucositis assessment from the MASCC mucositis study group and ISOO: an international Delphi study [^111aJP1i]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Mucositis remains a significant challenge in providing optimal care for people with cancer, and its assessment therefore represents the cornerstone of effective supportive cancer care both in clinical practice and research. Despite its importance, mucositis assessment lacks guidance and is typically informed by individual or institutional norms or preferences. This heterogeneity undoubtedly impacts our ability to synthesize data and translate new knowledge into clinical practice. The MASCC MSG is the peak professional group providing authoritative guidance on the prediction, prevention and management of mucositis. We therefore leveraged on this collective and global expertise to develop a set of expert opinion-guided recommendations on mucositis assessment, contextualized for various settings in clinical practice and research.

The heterogeneous approach to mucositis assessment we assumed from the available literature was underscored in the first phase of this study. Our data highlight that even in the MASCC MSG, a specialized group where the importance of appropriate mucositis assessment is highly valued, there is significant variability in preferences and practices. As such, it is highly likely that in a non-expert population of healthcare providers and researchers, the degree of variability and need for guidance is amplified.

### Oral care evaluation to prevent oral mucositis in estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with everolimus (oral care-BC): a randomized controlled phase III trial [^1163rcDK]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral mucositis is a clinically significant complication of mucotoxic cancer therapy that affects 5%–40% of patients receiving standard‐dose chemotherapy and more than 75% of patients receiving either high‐dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation or radiation therapy for head and neck cancer 1, 2, 3. Molecularly targeted therapeutic drugs and chemotherapy drugs used for cancer treatment can cause oral mucositis, resulting in pain and other symptoms. The pain makes it difficult for the patient to ingest orally and can result in malnutrition. Difficulties with oral ingestion and poor oral cleaning can also result in an increase of bacteria inside the mouth, which is associated with systemic risks due to an increased risk of aspiration pneumonitis. Oral mucositis can also result in postponement of changes in treatment, discontinuation of treatment, and prolongation of hospitalization 4, 5.

Although guidelines on oral mucositis 2, 3 state that dental intervention is preferred when implementing cancer treatment, such interventions are not strongly recommended. A retrospective study of 495 patients with nonhead and non‐neck cancers showed that commencement of oral care reduced the incidence of complicating oral mucositis from 38.5% to 10.5% 6, but this is the only such study, and there is insufficient evidence for a strong recommendation. Saito et al. demonstrated that prophylactic professional oral health care reduced the risk of oral mucositis in a small prospective study to assess the usefulness of such care in preventing mucositis in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy 7.

In a randomized phase III study of the treatment of hormone receptor‐positive, hormone therapy‐resistant refractory breast cancer, the progression‐free survival was significantly longer in a concomitant everolimus group compared with an exemestane monotherapy group 8. The incidence of oral mucositis of any grade as an adverse drug reaction of everolimus was 58%, and an analysis of Asian patients showed that the corresponding value in these patients was 81% 9, with an incidence of 91% in Japanese patients 10. However, the mechanism underlying the occurrence of everolimus‐induced oral mucositis has not yet been elucidated.

### The role of the gut microbiome on radiation therapy efficacy and gastrointestinal complications: a systematic review [^114TcXgq]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy (RT) is an essential component of therapy either curative or palliative armamentarium in oncology, but its efficacy varies considerably among patients through many extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of the tumour, which are beginning to be better understood. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome represents a key factor in the modulation of the systemic immune response and consequently on patients' outcome. Moreover, the emergence of biomarkers that are derived from the gut microbiota has fuelled the development of adjuvant strategies for patients treated with immunotherapy in combination or not with RT. Despite progress in development of more precise radiotherapy techniques, almost all patients undergoing RT to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectum develop acute adverse events as a consequence of several dose-limiting parameters such as the location of irradiation that may subsequently damage normal tissue including the intestinal epithelium. Several lines of evidence in preclinical models identified that vancomycin improves RT-induced gastrointestinal toxicities such as diarrhea and oral mucositis. In order to gain further insight into this rapidly evolving field, we have systematically reviewed the studies that have described how the gut microbiome may directly or indirectly modulate RT efficacy and its gastro-intestinal toxicities. Lastly, we outline current knowledge gaps and discuss potentially more satisfactory therapeutic options to restore the functionality of the gut microbiome of patients treated with RT.

An alternative concept of ROM pathogenesis

A hypothetical argument suggests that ROM pathogenesis describes the cumulative effect of two distinct pathways which occur in a semi-staggered sequence. The first pathway, the immediate injury pathway, induces direct damage to basal stem cells, whereas injury induced by the second pathway, the indirect pathway, reflects the failure of normal host defense mechanisms to keep up with biological challenges imparted by accumulating radiation doses. The two occur in parallel, but their contribution to ROM pathogenesis is staggered and not equivalent. Within and between each pathway are interactions between cells, their components, signaling molecules, transcription factors and their products, and positive and negative feedback loops. While basal epithelial cells are the target end organ, inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells in the submucosa are active participants serving as message generators and carriers, both during the active period of radiation therapy and as conduits for late tissue changes. And the tissue environment is dynamic: Mucosa irradiated on day 1 is not the same days or weeks later after being conditioned by chronic radiation exposure. Once gap junctions are disrupted, the microbiome also becomes a participant. This all occurs in the context of patients' baseline physiological state which is likely altered by biological activity emanating from the tumor response to irradiation.

The concept of radiation injury being mediated by direct and indirect mechanisms has been described (Hall S et al. as an example). What is novel is the idea that trajectory and severity of RIT are driven by an irrevocable tipping point in the balance between radiation-associated damage mechanisms and the capacity of physiological protective mechanisms to meet that challenge.

The immediate injury pathway causes basal epithelial cell death in the absence of intermediaries primarily through direct ionization of DNA chemical bonds and DNA cleavage by hydroxyl radical from ionization of water, both generating radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). While DSBs only have an identifiable role in 30% of radiation injuries, damage occurs quickly and primes subsequent downstream events. The immediate pathway is responsive to radiation dose and schedule, but not markedly impacted by intrinsic response modifiers such as genetics. The early phenotypic consequences of ROM are most likely attributable to the immediate pathway. The threat of the immediate pathway as the sole provocateur of ROM is less than that of the indirect pathway as suggested by the finding that the 3000 DNA lesions per cell noted after the first exposure to a 2 Gy fraction is well within the ability of cell repair and is far less than the number of breaks associated with normal oxygen metabolism.

### Biomarkers and non-invasive tests for gastrointestinal mucositis [^114uxtoQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mucositis is a severe side effect of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy in several cancer treatment protocols. It comprises complex inflammatory damage to the mucosa of the complete alimentary tract. Gastrointestinal mucositis, further referred to as mucositis, is complex and the pathophysiology can be based on the five-phase pathophysiological model of oral mucositis. However, the exact working mechanism has not been elucidated. Patients suffer from abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, with consequently weight loss, nutritional support, and an increased risk to develop a sepsis or bacteremia. The incidence of mucositis is estimated at 40–100% of patients with chemotherapy, dependent of treatment and patient-related factors. The estimation of the incidence is such a broad range, since there is no gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of mucositis. The therapy of cancer has been changed in the past years to more targeted therapies. However, the effect of these targeted therapies on the risk, severity, and incidence of mucositis is unknown. It is thought that there is an underreporting of mucositis due to a lack of a gold standard. Ideally, for the diagnosis and severity of mucositis, inspection of the small intestine microscopically would be necessary. Therefore, the gold standard would be a biopsy from the small intestine. However, an endoscopy is invasive, can be painful, the small intestine is only visible for a small part, and moreover, this test is not preferable in an immune-compromised patient since there is a high risk of infection and bleeding. The intestinal tissue is vulnerable during mucositis. Therefore, clinical practice is in need of a test to diagnose and assess the severity of mucositis. An optimal test to diagnose mucositis and establish the severity will give the opportunity to evaluate studies, to determine risk factors and incidence, and if used in all studies, it will make it possible to compare them. Moreover, this optimal test will potentially improve management in for example prophylactic antibiotic use, or diet changes for nutritional support.

Multifactorial approach and international guidelines

As soon as inflammation has been widely demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of mucositis by initiating a broad of cascades and pathways that leads to ulceration, studies have concentrated their efforts in finding the best way to prevent and treat this common RT and CHT side effect. Through the years, lots of strategies have been proposed to control both the initiation and progression of mucositis. Anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, mouthwashes, oral care protocols and other non-pharmacological remedies and devices (photobiomodulation for example) are reported in literature as being the historical milestones when approaching patients suffering from mucositis.

In everyday clinical practice, all these agents and strategies are usually combined in a markedly different way.

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) guidelines provide clinicians with a set of interventions for mucositis based on strong evidence. They are continuously updated through a systematic approach to weigh the evidence and analyze the clinical applicability of different strategies.

Mucositis management is a complex objective because of the presence of many confounding factors; thus, a multimodal combined methodology should be considered and strongly preferred. Agents, both local and systemic, able to address the multifactorial aspects and multi-layered basis of mucositis are robustly recommended. Moreover, both initiation and progression of mucositis are deeply influenced by the patients' different baseline characteristics like microbioma, oral hygiene and saliva environment. The optimal treatment should, thus, be designed both on patients' characteristics and on the idea that mucositis needs, definitely, an extensively multimodal strategy based on the contribution of a multidisciplinary team supporting patients in every phase of their treatment. This team should comprise other professional stakeholders like dentists, nutritionists, pain therapists and nurses in order to tailor treatment on patients thus considering the patient as a whole.

### Oral mucositis and selective elimination of oral flora in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy: a double-blind randomised clinical trial [^116QEf6Y]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients can induce oral mucositis, which is an acute inflammation of the oral mucosa. Until now no effective intervention has been developed to prevent oral mucositis in radiotherapy. This prevention is even more relevant now because altered fractionation schedules for the treatment of head and neck malignancies induce more severe mucositis. All patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck region develop oral mucositis to some extent, depending on radiation schedule, radiation field, radiation volume and cumulative dose. Clinically, mucositis appears in a conventional radiation scheme after a cumulative radiation dose of 10–20 Gy as a white discoloration of the mucosa because of hyperkeratinisation. The next stage is a deepening erythema followed by the development of pseudomembranes and ulcerations. Severe mucositis, appearing as pseudomembranes, will develop at the end of the third week of radiation, after about 30 Gy. Prevention of severe mucositis is important because mucositis affects the patient's feeding status, physical and mental well-being and it can influence the course of radiotherapy. Further oral pain because of mucositis has a serious impact on the quality of life of patients.

Several mechanisms are supposed to play a role in the development of mucositis: changes at the cellular level of the basal cell layer, inflammatory process in the epithelium and influence of bacteria on mucosal surface. Changed oral flora, colonising the oral mucosa, may aggravate the mucosa reaction because of radiation. The carriage and colonisation of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of irradiation mucositis. A hypothesis has been proposed on the development of mucositis in four consecutive phases, in which the ulcerative/bacterial phase is thought to play a role in the development of fibrous pseudomembranes of the oral mucosa. A pilot study in 15 patients reported the protective effect of an antibiotic lozenge for selective elimination of the oral flora. Less severe mucositis and a less mean mucositis score compared to a historical control group was observed. None of the PTA-(polymyxin E 2 mg, tobramycin 1.8 mg and amphotericin B 10 mg) treated patients needed nasogastric tube feeding. In a cohort study including 36 patients, it was found that PTA lozenges may reduce irradiation mucositis. In contrast, randomised studies reported conflicting effects on mucositis by selective oral flora elimination.

### Oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients [^113NnN8w]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis (OM) is a common side effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer (HNC). Despite the medical advances in cancer therapy, OM is still virtually inevitable in patients being irradiated for neoplasms of the head and neck. The initial signs of oral mucositis typically manifest after cumulative doses between 15 and 20 Gy, with ulceration formation by 30 Gy and reaching peak severity in the week after radiation treatment completion (generally 60–72 Gy in management of HNC), then resolving over the 3–4 weeks following treatment completion. Severe oral mucositis (SOM), defined as WHO grade 3 and grade 4, occurs in 65–70% of patients receiving concurrent cisplatin and radiation therapy for locoregionally advanced HNC. WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis leads to risk of systemic infection, severe pain, reduced oral intake which can lead to dehydration, significant weight loss and malnutrition, need for feeding tube placement and hospitalization. The clinical and economic impact, not to mention the impact on patient quality of life from oral mucositis has been well studied. As mucositis is commonly the dose-limiting factor leading to disruption or delay in cancer therapy, establishment of evidence-based guidelines has been paramount in supportive care management of these patients. Improvements in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis remain essential to better patient outcomes. Here we review the current standard of care, recent successes and failures in development of therapies to mitigate OM, share patient and provider educational resources, and describe on-going and future directions of research in this area.

### Evaluation and prognostic impact of nutrition in patients with acute leukemia: a narrative review [^113rrp7t]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of This Review

Acute leukemia (AL) is a hematological neoplasm with rapid progression that affects nutritional status of patients. Assessing nutrition in patients with haematological malignancies poses challenges due to the rapid progression of the disease, the variety of methods for evaluating malnutrition. In this review we will provide evidence of the need of early malnutrition diagnosis thru timely assessment and the implications of malnutrition in patients evolution in patients with AL.

Recent Findings

The prevalence of malnutrition ranging from 15 to 26.5% among patients with AL. It is well known that inflammation and cytokine production have been recognized as potential mechanisms of CCS in hematologic malignancies. Regardless of the mechanism underlying Cancer Cachexia Syndrome (CCS) in AML, patients undergoing conditioning chemotherapy and during transplant or antineoplastic treatment. In addition to this, patients with AL undergoing chemotherapy frequently face two main challenges: oral mucositis (OM) and neutropenic colitis (NC). Both conditions challenge nutrition intake and nutrients absorption which make them more susceptible to have nutritional deficits. Malnutrition in patients with acute leukemia face a higher risk of therapy failure, increased rates of relapse, and higher mortality rates. Nutritional status impact patient's prognosis in many ways, malnutrition increases risk of antineoplastic treatment toxicities, hospital stay, and cost, as well reduces quality of life and this condition worsens patient's prognosis.

### Prediction of mucositis risk secondary to cancer therapy: a systematic review of current evidence and call to action [^115PVSLa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Despite advances in personalizing the efficacy of cancer therapy, our ability to identify patients at risk of severe treatment side effects and provide individualized supportive care is limited. This is particularly the case for mucositis (oral and gastrointestinal), with no comprehensive risk evaluation strategies to identify high-risk patients. We, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) Mucositis Study Group, therefore aimed to systematically review current evidence on that factors that influence mucositis risk to provide a foundation upon which future risk prediction studies can be based.

Methods

We identified 11,018 papers from PubMed and Web of Science, with 197 records extracted for full review and 113 meeting final eligibility criteria. Data were then synthesized into tables to highlight the level of evidence for each risk predictor.

Results

The strongest level of evidence supported dosimetric parameters as key predictors of mucositis risk. Genetic variants in drug-metabolizing pathways, immune signaling, and cell injury/repair mechanisms were also identified to impact mucositis risk. Factors relating to the individual were variably linked to mucositis outcomes, although female sex and smoking status showed some association with mucositis risk.

Conclusion

Mucositis risk reflects the complex interplay between the host, tumor microenvironment, and treatment specifications, yet the large majority of studies rely on hypothesis-driven, single-candidate approaches. For significant advances in the provision of personalized supportive care, coordinated research efforts with robust multiplexed approaches are strongly advised.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^1168M29n]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stomatitis pathophysiology

Oral mucositis/stomatitis (hereafter stomatitis) is inflammation of the mucosal lining of any of the structures in the mouth, manifesting as erythema, ulceration, bleeding, and pain which may interfere with oral intake. Stomatitis is commonly associated with anticancer agents; for example, in patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors, up to half may experience stomatitis adverse events (AEs; range: 6%-52%). Stomatitis is also a common AE in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy (range: 33%-99%), with generally higher incidences seen among patients treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Several potential mechanisms leading to stomatitis development have been identified. A 5-stage model of stomatitis has been proposed for radiotherapy/chemotherapy and is characterized by initiation, activation, amplification, ulceration, and healing over a 15–21-day period (Figure 1). The first stage — initiation — involves cellular damage in the form of DNA double-strand breaks induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy, which promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species and upregulates damage-associated pattern molecules. In the second stage, cellular damage results in the activation of damage response signaling molecules, p53 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). In the third stage, NF-κB activation results in damage signal amplification through the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1 beta, which subsequently activate more NF-κB in a positive feedback loop. The fourth stage involves tissue damage and cell death due to the inflammatory response, leading to ulcerations in the mucosa and increasing susceptibility to infections. The final stage — healing — occurs when the initiating cellular damage that drove the inflammatory response and consequent tissue damage stops (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Five-stage model for mucositis in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

This model represents the pathogenesis of stomatitis induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 0–2 days: Initiation phase and primary injury response. Radio- and chemotherapy-induced damages lead to DNA double-strand breaks and oxidative stress and, consequently, generates ROS. The injury to epithelial, submucosal, and endothelial cells provokes the release of endogenous DAMPs. 2–3 days: ROS, innate immune response, and binding of endogenous DAMPs (CRAMPs) to receptors further propagates and activates several transcriptional pathways, including NF-κB. This leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6. 2–10 days: Amplification of the injury signal. The effectors produced during the previous phase result in an amplification of the injury signal. The released TNF-α initiates the activation of MAPK that sustains NF-κB activity. During this stage, the primary damage signaling is amplified through positive-feedback loop mechanisms. 10–15 days: Ulceration. Breaks in the submucosa allow microorganisms to invade this tissue district leading to mononuclear-infiltrating cell-mediated inflammation response. 15–21 days: Tissue re-epithelialization. Stimuli from the submucosa extracellular matrix and mesenchyme promote the healing process. Abbreviations: CRAMP, chemoradiation-associated pattern molecule; DAMP, damage-associated pattern molecule; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, metalloproteinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

Potential roles of microbiota through stages of mucositis pathogenesis

5- phase pathogenesis of mucositis and involvement of the microbiota

Finally, it is critical that we cooperate to advance our understanding of microbe-mucositis interactions and adopt consistent approaches in project methodology. Although many studies implicate the microbiome in mucositis development, unfortunately, the field has struggled to progress beyond this hype and deliver translationally meaningful insights. In fact, there remains only one clinical practice guideline recommending a microbial-based intervention for mucositis, with Lactobacillus containing probiotics only recommended in a relatively restricted patient population. This reflects the variable nature of microbiome science and, thus, the inconsistency in methodological approaches employed across studies, making comparisons across studies exceptionally difficult. In addition to more consistent mucositis assessment, emphasis should be placed on adequate reporting of studies to ensure reproducibility with respect to intervention design/delivery, sample collection, processing and sequencing. Numerous tools exist to guide people in these areas to ensure adequate reporting; thus, replication can be achieved.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^111DNDH2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future perspectives

It has long been known that mucositis is associated with microbial changes, yet the causal basis for these findings has been challenging to confirm. As microbiome science evolves, our understanding of the causal basis for the microbiota's involvement in mucositis will continue to grow in depth and complexity. Ultimately, the mechanistic basis for the microbiota in mucositis is best explored using germ-free models, which can be selectively colonized with specific microbes or microbial communities. In addition, it is likely that the effect(s) of certain microbial-based therapeutics will also continue to strengthen our understanding of the microbiota's involvement in mucositis development. However, it is critical that we continue to approach and interpret these studies appropriately and acknowledge the technical limitations of current approaches as well as the numerous confounding factors that may render microbial interventions ineffective. Ultimately, the end goal in understanding the causal basis for the microbiota in mucositis development should be to design and implement microbial interventions that improve mucositis burden. As such, this ethos must remain front and center when designing these studies. Emphasizing clinically meaningful endpoints (e.g. patient-reported outcome measures) while also collecting appropriate biospecimens to conduct translational and mechanistic studies will create the knowledge base that is needed to advance mucositis prevention and management while also continuing to advance the pathobiological model to reflect the modern understanding of this highly prevalent and burdensome complication of cancer therapy.

### Emerging evidence on the pathobiology of mucositis [^113rrzaN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the biological basis for cancer therapy-induced mucosal barrier injury (mucositis). The last formal review of the subject by MASCC/ISOO was published in 2007; consequently, an update is timely.

Methods

Panel members reviewed the biomedical literature on mucositis pathobiology published between January 2005 and December 2011.

Results

Recent research has provided data on the contribution of tissue structure changes, inflammation and microbiome changes to the development of mucositis. Additional research has focused on targeted therapy-induced toxicity, toxicity clustering and the investigation of genetic polymorphisms in toxicity prediction. This review paper summarizes the recent evidence on these aspects of mucositis pathobiology.

Conclusion

The ultimate goal of mucositis researchers is to identify the most appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions and to be able to predict toxicity risk and personalize interventions to genetically suitable patients. Continuing research efforts are needed to further our understanding of mucositis pathobiology and the pharmacogenomics of toxicity.

### Development of the MASCC / ISOO clinical practice guidelines for mucositis: an overview of the methods [^112RCLPD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

New studies and literature continue to emerge on the management of mucositis secondary to cancer therapy. The evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for mucositis were first published in 2004 and updated in 2007 and 2014 by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO). The existing 2014 guidelines for mucositis are being updated in line with new literature to inform clinical practice. This paper describes the materials and methods employed for the comprehensive updates to the guidelines for managing mucositis.

### Antimicrobial therapy to prevent or treat oral mucositis [^113V9GPR]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2003). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis represents a significant source of morbidity after chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Since infection may have an important role in the pathophysiology of oral mucositis, several antimicrobial agents have been investigated for their efficacy in preventing and treating this disease. We sought to establish the weight of evidence for antimicrobial treatment and identified 31 prospectively designed clinical trials of which 13 reported some benefit and 15 did not. No clear pattern was identified regarding patient type, cancer treatment, or type of antimicrobial agent used, and inconsistent assessment of oral mucositis made comparison of outcomes difficult. Newer drugs, such as the topical antimicrobial peptide iseganan HCl initially showed promise in reducing mucositis and the related oral pain but the results of a phase 3 trial were disappointing and the line of enquiry was abandoned altogether. Hence, there is a need to better understand the role of the microflora in the cause of oral mucositis if an antimicrobial agent for prevention and treatment of this disease is to be developed.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^113qtkZR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

NF-κB activation results in the expression of many target genes, including the transcription of MnSOD to enhance mitochondrial antioxidation. As a signaling molecule, H₂O₂ also provides supplemental NF-κB activation. In contrast to O₂●−, H₂O₂ is stable and non-polar, so it easily passes through membranes, enabling signaling functions distant from the source and enhancing its ability as a messenger for some cell types.

The relationship between ROS and NF-κB has been reviewed. NF-κB has been largely associated with cell survival, and it is in that context that it mitigates ROS-induced apoptosis or necrosis by activation of target genes which impact ROS production. Interaction and crosstalk between ROS and NF-κB-JNK to prevent sustained JNK activation impact p53 (see below) and thus favorably affect survival.

NF-κB's central role in RIT pathogenesis is well-established. Many NF-κB-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines track with RIT severity. And relationships between overexpression of cytokine genes has been linked to OM risk. Furthermore, cytokine-mediated messaging plays a role in feedback loops which amplify steps leading to injury. Thus, the consequences of NF-κB likely change in response to the accumulation of radiation stress. Cell adhesion, acute phase proteins, stress response, and regulators of cell death and survival are all within its functional catchment and pro-inflammatory cytokines in perpetuating oxidative stress.

### Management of chemo / radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer: a review of the current literature [^113apdTe]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal mucositis is an important complication in non-surgical cancer treatments. It represents the major complication in radiotherapy of tumors located in head and neck areas. Many results have been published in order to define the best clinical protocol for prophylaxis or treatment of mucositis, but a consensus has not been attained yet. In this review, some recent topics in prophylaxis and treatment of mucositis related to radiation therapy are reconsidered using PUBMED and GOOGLE SCHOOLAR search engines from 2000 to 2015. In this review, more than 100 clinical studies have been selected and divided into the prophylactic or therapeutic uses of the evaluated treatment agents. The number of patients and kind of study design, the clinical features, prevalence, risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, complication, prophylaxis and the treatment of mucositis were also specified. Nevertheless, it has not been truly achieved a consensus protocol of prophylaxis and treatment of oral mucositis.

### The broadening scope of oral mucositis and oral ulcerative mucosal toxicities of anticancer therapies [^1139DBUB]. CA (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, highly symptomatic complication of cancer therapy that affects patients' function, quality of life, and ability to tolerate treatment. In certain patients with cancer, OM is associated with increased mortality. Research on the management of OM is ongoing. Oral mucosal toxicities are also reported in targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. The objective of this article is to present current knowledge about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, assessment, risk prediction, and current and developing intervention strategies for OM and other ulcerative mucosal toxicities caused by both conventional and evolving forms of cancer therapy.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^111R786C]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of the microbiota's causal role in mucositis

Emerging fundamental evidence suggests that the microbiota causally contributes to the pathogenesis of mucositis, although studies that are designed to strictly assess causality remain scarce and methodologically challenging. The ability of various microbial manipulative strategies to alter mucositis development/severity, while not strictly causative, certainly add strength to the growing evidence that microbial-mucosal-immune interactions serve to exacerbate or perpetuate cytotoxic therapy-related mucosal injury. However, what remains unclear is the specific mechanisms by which microbial interventions exert their benefit and, thus, those that outline precisely how key microbial taxa contribute to mucositis pathogenesis. Several mechanistic observations have been made from studies testing various microbial interventions, including changes in drug pharmacokinetics, enhanced luminal acidification, mucus production, tight junction integrity, reduced inflammation, and normalized bile acid profiles. Ultimately, it is highly unlikely that a single mechanism can be identified. Instead, it is most plausible that multiple events involving the microbiota, mucosa, and immune system operate in concert to dictate the homeostatic milieu of the local and system environment, thus, the severity of mucositis and its associated symptoms. It is critical to acknowledge the ineffective results of certain microbial-based interventions in controlling mucositis, with lack of efficacy reflecting the heterogeneity between studies regarding drug regimens and radiotherapy modalities, mucositis measures and pathophysiology assessment. As such, for meaningful advances in understanding how to modulate the microbiota to control mucositis effectively, the field must adopt consistent methodological approaches concerning microbiome analyses, intervention design and mucositis assessment.

Normal mechanisms that control oxidative stress are ultimately overwhelmed

Seventy percent of radiation-induced cell injury is attributable to oxidative stress. Normally, cells maintain a level of redox homeostasis by interacting enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. RT induces ROS formation with such ferocity that normal protective mechanisms are overwhelmed. Excessive ROS levels directly disrupt cells and further serve as secondary messengers to elicit responses, resulting in acute and chronic normal tissue injury through ligand/receptor-initiated pathways including MAPK, pI3K, and NF-κB. By interfering with transcription factor activation through redox sensitive cysteine residues in DNA-binding sites, ROS affects such critical pathways as those associated with NF-κB, AP-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α). There is continuous dynamic interaction and crosstalk which becomes increasingly multifarious as their biological downstream consequences become evident. Fundamentally then, it is the insufficient capacity of normally functioning redox control systems that dominates radiation-induced normal cell destruction.

Control of oxidative stress is so critical to cell survival that redundant processes contribute to its management at two levels: systems (largely enzymatic) that process certain ROS to make them non-pathogenic and damage-control mechanisms which amplify antioxidant mechanisms.

Cells are 70% water, and this plays a key role in the oxidative stress from radiation. Radiolysis of water hydroxyl radical (●OH) directly cleaves tumor DNA. It also initiates the formation of superoxide (O₂●−), a major cause of oxidative stress, and uncontrolled, the first indirect pathway blow to normal cell survival. Ionizing radiation further activates cell wall NADPH oxidases generating even greater amounts of O₂●− in the hours following treatment. Later in the indirect pathway, inflammatory cells recruited to the sites of emerging tissue injury may produce O₂●− for weeks after irradiation. In response to escalating O₂●−, the cell counters with "first line antioxidants" a network of enzymes, including superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, of which the SODs play a lead and anchoring role.

### Addressing pain in oral mucositis: narrative review of current practices and emerging treatments [^116jcDgq]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to pain, OM can cause significant difficulties with eating and swallowing, often necessitating enteral or parenteral nutritional support. The onset of OM is characterized by oral mucosal erythema accompanied by burning and numbness. However, as OM progresses, the clinical presentation can vary significantly among patients, with most developing deep ulcerations in areas such as the floor of the mouth, soft palate, and lateral aspects of the tongue. The severity and nature of pain can differ depending on the extent and location of mucosal involvement.

More importantly, severe OM can result in delays, interruptions, or modifications to planned cancer treatment regimens, potentially impacting the overall prognosis of cancer.

Severe pain associated with OM can have profound consequences, potentially disrupting a patient's cancer treatment course. Studies show that approximately 30% of patients with advanced mucositis are forced to discontinue their treatment regimens due to the debilitating pain and other associated conditions such as bacteremia (particularly in neutropenic patients) and bleeding. The additional hospital costs for patients diagnosed with high-grade oral mucositis in the context of HSCT are estimated to be $42,000. In patients with solid tumors who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy, cost increments range from $2,500 for mild mucositis to $5,500 for severe mucositis per chemotherapy cycle. These costs stem from the need for supplementary nutritional support, increased analgesic prescriptions, and extended hospitalizations, further compounding the financial and emotional burden on patients. Mucositis, therefore, not only leads to prolonged hospital stays but also places a significant financial strain on both patients and healthcare systems.

OM presents a significant challenge in pain management, particularly as its severity progresses. While various interventions, such as oral rinses or mucosal agents containing topical anesthetics and analgesics, may offer some relief in mild cases, they often fail to provide sufficient pain control as the condition intensifies. Currently, there is no curative treatment for OM; thus, ongoing research and the development of novel therapies are critically important. Consequently, systemic analgesics — including opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and others — have been investigated for their effectiveness in achieving adequate pain relief. This review focuses on the pharmacological management of OM-associated pain, discusses the challenges inherent in its treatment and highlights promising advancements aimed at enhancing pain control for this patient population.

### Guidance on mucositis assessment from the MASCC mucositis study group and ISOO: an international Delphi study [^111JyobY]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the significant heterogeneity in approaches used by respondents, a key finding in our survey was the limited use of PROMs for both oral and gastrointestinal mucositis. PROMs are a form of health status report, completed by the patient without interpretation or involvement of their healthcare team. A basic assumption of PROMs is that the meaning of an item to a respondent does not change over time, also called measurement invariance. However, when one experiences a change in health status, one may change one's internal standards, values and/or conceptualization of symptoms or other aspects of quality of life (i.e. recalibration, reprioritization, or reconceptualization). These underlying changes are termed response-shift effects, and may affect the meaning or interpretation of the measured change. Interpreting change over time is thus complicated by this fundamental human process of adaptation. Nevertheless, unlike clinical assessments, PROMs capture the more nuanced and subjective nature of a symptom, aiming to measure its burden irrespective of objective severity. Increasing advocacy has emerged for PROMs being integrated into clinical practice and research, especially in supportive cancer care as it is well documented that clinicians tend to under-report on the prevalence, emergence and severity of treatment side effects, including mucositis. However, given the dynamic nature of mucositis and an individual's perceived symptom burden, especially during treatment and its recovery, PROMs should be collected frequently, which may result in inflated intra-individual variation or "response shifts'. Response shifts can be identified through patterns in longitudinal studies and incorporating measures of response shift can be valuable in assessing true change in these patients.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^117G936z]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Advances in the treatment of cancer have significantly improved mortality rates; however, this has come at a cost, with many treatments still limited by their toxic side effects. Mucositis in both the mouth and gastrointestinal tract is common following many anti-cancer agents, manifesting as ulcerative lesions and associated symptoms throughout the alimentary tract. The pathogenesis of mucositis was first defined in 2004 by Sonis, and almost 20 years on, the model continues to be updated reflecting ongoing research initiatives and more sophisticated analytical techniques. The most recent update, published by the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO), highlights the numerous co-occurring events that underpin mucositis development. Most notably, a role for the ecosystem of microorganisms that reside throughout the alimentary tract (the oral and gut microbiota) was explored, building on initial concepts proposed by Sonis. However, many questions remain regarding the true causal contribution of the microbiota and associated metabolome. This review aims to provide an overview of this rapidly evolving area, synthesizing current evidence on the microbiota's contribution to mucositis development and progression, highlighting (i) components of the 5-phase model where the microbiome may be involved, (ii) methodological challenges that have hindered advances in this area, and (iii) opportunities for intervention.

### Mucositis: current management and investigations [^111VCQVU]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Oral and pharyngeal mucositis present significant management problems for patients undergoing radiation for head and neck cancers. The incidence and severity of these sequelae of radiation have increased with the use of altered fractionated schedules and concurrent chemotherapy. Directed therapies for the prevention of mucositis have yet to be established. Over the past several decades, therapies have been and continue to be designed that interfere with the causative factors of mucositis in an effort to diminish its incidence. These novel therapies protect normal mucosa either through direct radioprotection or manipulation of growth factors and cytokines that are involved in mucosal repopulation. Other therapies have tried to counter inflammation or infection with the belief that the insult from radiation is exacerbated by these normal response mechanisms to injury. It has become clear that the quality of life of patients and the economic costs of supportive therapies needed because of toxicities of cancer therapies are significant concerns. Research leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms of mucosal injury will ideally result in more specific, more targeted, and effective strategies for prevention of mucositis rather than current management algorithms that rely primarily on costly symptom management.

### Stem cell transplantation patients receiving a novel oral care protocol for oral mucositis prevention and treatment: patient-reported outcomes and quality of life [^1114jvrj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a standard treatment for malignant and non-malignant conditions that lead to immune system failure, such as haematologic malignancies, solid tumours and autoimmune diseases. Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy-based conditioning regimens are administered prior to stem cell infusion to eradicate the underlying disease, to create space for engraftment and to provide immunosuppression. Patients undergoing autologous HSCT receive their own stem cells, while those undergoing allogeneic HSCT receive stem cells from related or unrelated donors. Stem cells may be harvested from bone marrow, peripheral blood or cord blood.

Oral mucositis (OM), a common toxic effect of the regimen drugs used, occurs in 70–99% of HSCT patients, and the incidence of its severe forms range from 20 to over 75%, depending on the intensity of the conditioning regimen and on the patient's predisposing factors. OM results from the inflammation of the oral mucosal barrier and is accompanied by various signs and symptoms, such as erythema, ulcers, difficulty eating and/or drinking and pain. Severe cases of OM are associated with extreme discomfort and may affect patients' quality of life (QoL) and transplant-related outcomes, including infection risk and procedure-related costs.

### Guideline for the prevention of oral and oropharyngeal mucositis in children receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^11463aCy]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Guideline development panel

The Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO) Mucositis Prevention Guideline Development Group was formed in March 2014 (see online supplementary appendix 1). Members were selected with a view to obtain interdisciplinary representation from internationally recognised experts in paediatric mucositis and POGO institutions. Panel members completed conflict of interest forms; no members had important conflicts. The guideline was editorially independent from the funding body.

Evidence identification and synthesis

There is a large literature base of studies that evaluate oral mucositis prevention in single arm and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) among adult and paediatric populations. Biologically, interventions that are effective in adult populations are likely to have a similar effect in children. However, differences in efficacy may arise related to changing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, age-related variance in the distribution of receptors for targeted interventions and lack of patient cooperation for some interventions. Specific interventions may have less utility in children if there is limited use of an antineoplastic agent in children when the mechanism of protective activity is agent specific. Toxicities of therapy may also be different and interference with anticancer activity may differ by underlying tumour type. Paediatric studies are also critical to determine dosing recommendations. Consequently, we decided to evaluate the adult and paediatric literature with an emphasis on the appraisal of paediatric studies.

In order to limit the scope of the adult and paediatric review, we took a pragmatic approach that builds on work conducted by a recent Cochrane Collaboration systematic review, and The Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO). More specifically, because our health question was to identify prophylactic interventions that are effective at preventing or reducing the severity of oral mucositis, we chose to systematically review interventions that were recommended or suggested in any population by MASCC/ISOO for the prevention of oral mucositis and that showed evidence of benefit in the Cochrane Collaboration systematic review. These interventions were cryotherapy, low level light therapy (LLLT) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Since the best way to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention is through conduct of RCTs, we evaluated RCTs of these agents in any age group and assessed if the effect appeared to differ by adult or paediatric population. We did not conduct systematic reviews of agents that the MASCC/ISOO guideline recommended against using.

### Mucosal injury from targeted anti-cancer therapy [^115zdfKg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

With the increased use of so-called targeted anti-cancer therapies, there has been a change in toxicities that patients are experiencing. As most targeted therapies are given in conjunction with more traditional chemotherapeutic agents, toxicities of these combination therapies are also evolving. Whilst we increasingly understand the mechanisms underlying the toxicities of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the addition of targeted treatments requires a new understanding of both toxicity and interacting mechanisms.

Aims

The aims of this review (which formed the basis of an invited plenary lecture at the 2006 Annual conference of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer) were to define targeted anti-cancer therapy, to describe its known impact on the mucosa, either alone, or in combination with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, and finally to provide an outline for future directions in research into mucosal injury from targeted anti-cancer therapies.

Methodology

Two separate literature reviews were conducted. The combined reviews produced 700 papers of which approximately 70 were included in the review.

Results

As with mucosal injury (or mucositis) in general, the studies are hampered by a lack of mucosal injury as primary endpoint, and the variable definitions and levels of reporting. The depth to which mucosal injury was studied was also inadequate. However, it is clear that the key to understanding toxicity is to understand the mechanism of action of the drug, from which it should be possible to predict the toxicities that will occur.

Conclusions

With the increasing use of targeted anti-cancer therapies, mucosal injury, particularly in its manifestations of diarrhoea, and mouth ulcers, is becoming even more prominent. More publications of basic and clinical research in this area is required.

### Relieving oral mucositis-palifermin discovery-NCI… [^113dLimr]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

The sores also leave patients open to potentially life-threatening infections. Patients with severe mucositis may need intravenous nutrition, antibiotics to fight infections, pain medicines, and longer hospital stays. For years, doctors wondered what could be done to relieve oral mucositis in patients receiving cancer treatment. A Chance Discovery Leads to a Possible Solution In the late 1980's, NCI scientists Jeffrey Rubin, M. D. Ph. D. Stuart Aaronson, M. D., and Paul Finch, Ph. D., were conducting research to identify proteins that play a role in cancer cell growth. They studied epithelial cells, which line the surfaces of the body's organs, because many tumors are derived from these cells. Instead of finding a culprit of uncontrolled cancer growth, the scientists identified and isolated another molecule, that they called keratinocyte growth factor, that turned out to be expressed in epithelial wounds.

Subsequent research showed that KGF aids the healing process by stimulating the growth of epithelial cells in tissues such as the skin and mouth. And additional research showed that treating cancer patients with KGF before cancer treatment had a strong protective effect, limiting the damage cancer treatments can inflict on the rapidly dividing cells of the mouth. These studies suggested that KGF could potentially be used to treat or prevent oral mucositis. In a key clinical trial involving multiple NCI-designated cancer centers, over 200 cancer patients received either palifermin or a placebo with their cancer treatment. This study showed that, for patients with blood cancers who were receiving high-dose radiation and chemotherapy, those given palifermin had a much lower incidence of the most debilitating form of oral mucositis. Compared to patients who received placebo, patients who received palifermin also needed less pain medicine and intravenous nutrition.

Currently, palifermin is only approved for use in patients with blood cancers. Additional studies have suggested that it is safe and effective in reducing severe oral mucositis in patients treated for other cancers, particularly head and neck cancers. NCI scientists are currently studying its use for other conditions, such as graft-versus-host disease, a complication that occurs in bone marrow or stem cell transplant patients. Because of NCI research, clinicians now have a remarkably successful treatment for preventing and treating oral mucositis, vastly improving the quality of life of patients who are undergoing intensive cancer treatment.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^112faX9R]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Mucositis is dynamic morphologically

The type of oral mucosa impacts ROM risk as it typically effects the movable or thin mucosa but spares the more keratinized tissue. Mean turnover time for tissues at risk ranges from 14 days (buccal mucosa) to 20 days (floor of the mouth). Consequently, if a single radiation exposure sufficiently destroyed basal stem cells on day 0 to completely stop cell renewal, the phenotypic effect — ulceration — would be expected between 2 and 3 weeks later, precisely what is observed in patients treated with bolus doses of stomatotoxic chemotherapy (Fig. 2). This contrasts with the extended onset and course of ROM where small incremental RT fractions are administered over time.

Fig. 2
Fractionated radiated challenge influences biological interactions and phenotype in the development of SOM. The biological sequence which delineates the pathogenesis of mucositis has been described as a linear 5-phase process (5,6): initiation (I), signaling (S), amplification (A), ulceration (U), and healing (H). The concept was originally proposed based on data obtained following challenges with bolus chemotherapy in humans or a single dose of high energy radiation in animals (Panel 1). The sequence also characterizes the biological response and course associated with each daily fraction of radiation experienced by patients being treated for cancers of the head and neck. Critically, however, in cases of fractionated dosing, the net clinical effect is not only a consequence of the linear events initiated by each fraction but more importantly by the vertical crosstalk which recognizes that the biological consequences of each fraction not only affect tissue horizontally but also modifies or is modified by cell function primed by earlier doses (Panel 2)

ROM's clinical trajectory is well-known. Most patients receiving 2 Gy daily fractions manifest clinical evidence of reduced renewal (epithelial atrophy) about 2–3 weeks after radiation start and peak ulceration by 4–5 weeks. In the context of mean turnover time, this would suggest that a cumulative radiation dose of about 20–25 Gy is necessary to overcome physiologic defense mechanisms and irreversibly injure enough basal stem cells to tip the balance from maintenance of homeostasis to generation of ulcerative ROM (Fig. 2).

Ulceration heralds the start of a biological tug-of-war in which cell-signaling pathways favoring wound healing are triggered but face an ongoing bombardment of biological drivers of ROM, including additional radiation fractions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NF-κB-driven (nuclear factor-kappa B) inflammation.

### Interventions for preventing oral mucositis in patients with cancer receiving treatment: oral cryotherapy [^112y7zR4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Oral mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy, head and neck radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, affecting over 75% of high risk patients. Ulceration can lead to severe pain and difficulty eating and drinking, which may necessitate opioid analgesics, hospitalisation and nasogastric or intravenous nutrition. These complications may lead to interruptions or alterations to cancer therapy, which may reduce survival. There is also a risk of death from sepsis if pathogens enter the ulcers of immunocompromised patients. Ulcerative oral mucositis can be costly to healthcare systems, yet there are few preventive interventions proven to be beneficial. Oral cryotherapy is a low-cost, simple intervention which is unlikely to cause side-effects. It has shown promise in clinical trials and warrants an up-to-date Cochrane review to assess and summarise the international evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral cryotherapy for preventing oral mucositis in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 17 June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 17 June 2015), EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 17 June 2015), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 17 June 2015) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 17 June 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry, and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching databases.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-design randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of oral cryotherapy in patients with cancer receiving treatment. We used outcomes from a published core outcome set registered on the COMET website.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of electronic searches, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for information where feasible. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we reported mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. We pooled similar studies in random-effects meta-analyses. We reported adverse effects in a narrative format.

Main Results

We included 14 RCTs analysing 1280 participants. The vast majority of participants did not receive radiotherapy to the head and neck, so this review primarily assesses prevention of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. All studies were at high risk of bias. The following results are for the main comparison: oral cryotherapy versus control (standard care or no treatment). Adults receiving fluorouracil-based (5FU) chemotherapy for solid cancersOral cryotherapy probably reduces oral mucositis of any severity (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72, 5 studies, 444 analysed, moderate quality evidence). In a population where 728 per 1000 would develop oral mucositis, oral cryotherapy would reduce this to 444 (95% CI 379 to 524). The number needed to treat to benefit one additional person (NNTB), i.e. to prevent them from developing oral mucositis, is 4 people (95% CI 3 to 5). The results were similar for moderate to severe oral mucositis (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.65, 5 studies, 444 analysed, moderate quality evidence). NNTB 4 (95% CI 4 to 6). Severe oral mucositis is probably reduced (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.61, 5 studies, 444 analysed, moderate quality evidence). Where 300 per 1000 would develop severe oral mucositis, oral cryotherapy would reduce this to 120 (95% CI 81 to 183), NNTB 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). Adults receiving high-dose melphalan-based chemotherapy before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)Oral cryotherapy may reduce oral mucositis of any severity (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.01, 5 studies, 270 analysed, low quality evidence). Where 824 per 1000 would develop oral mucositis, oral cryotherapy would reduce this to 486 (95% CI reduced to 289 to increased to 833). The NNTB is 3, although the uncertainty surrounding the effect estimate means that the 95% CI ranges from 2 NNTB, to 111 NNTH (number needed to treat in order to harm one additional person, i.e. for one additional person to develop oral mucositis). The results were similar for moderate to severe oral mucositis (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.09, 5 studies, 270 analysed, low quality evidence). NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 NNTB to 17 NNTH). Severe oral mucositis is probably reduced (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.72, 5 studies, 270 analysed, moderate quality evidence). Where 427 per 1000 would develop severe oral mucositis, oral cryotherapy would reduce this to 162 (95% CI 85 to 308), NNTB 4 (95% CI 3 to 9). Oral cryotherapy was shown to be safe, with very low rates of minor adverse effects, such as headaches, chills, numbness/taste disturbance, and tooth pain. This appears to contribute to the high rates of compliance seen in the included studies. There was limited or no evidence on the secondary outcomes of this review, or on patients undergoing other chemotherapies, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or on comparisons of oral cryotherapy with other interventions or different oral cryotherapy regimens. Therefore no further robust conclusions can be made. There was also no evidence on the effects of oral cryotherapy in children undergoing cancer treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We are confident that oral cryotherapy leads to large reductions in oral mucositis of all severities in adults receiving 5FU for solid cancers. We are less confident in the ability of oral cryotherapy to reduce oral mucositis in adults receiving high-dose melphalan before HSCT. Evidence suggests that it does reduce oral mucositis in these adults, but we are less certain about the size of the reduction, which could be large or small. However, we are confident that there is an appreciable reduction in severe oral mucositis in these adults. This Cochrane review includes some very recent and currently unpublished data, and strengthens international guideline statements for adults receiving the above cancer treatments.

### The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on supportive care for oral mucositis: current concepts and practice [^1157yEhN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) markedly affected the way healthcare professionals approach patients with cancer worldwide, not only in terms of therapeutic decision-making but also in terms of supportive care. With the rapid appearance of signs and symptoms and the need of close re-assessment, standard management of oral mucositis has been challenged by physical distancing and limited resources due to the global crisis. Building on the clinical experience developed during the acute phase by members of the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO), the implications of COVID-19 on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of mucositis are critically reported. Inspired by the restructuring of supportive care measures in response to the pandemic, suggestions for new models of approaching acute side effects are also discussed.

### Guidance on mucositis assessment from the MASCC mucositis study group and ISOO: an international Delphi study [^115e3itZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While there are a variety of options available for mucositis assessment, these tools vary considerably in their complexity and degree of validation, with no clear guidance on when and how they should be used. This heterogeneity has undoubtedly impacted the translation of clinical research into clinical practice, with varying adoption of mucositis assessment tools complicating evidence synthesis. We therefore aimed to establish guidance on mucositis assessment, tailored for a variety of clinical contexts, with the goal of informing the next generation of mucositis research to be more consistent and, by extension, better suited to impact clinical practice.

### Interventions for preventing oral mucositis in patients with cancer receiving treatment: cytokines and growth factors [^113x7JCM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy, head and neck radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, affecting over 75% of high-risk patients. Ulceration can lead to severe pain and difficulty with eating and drinking, which may necessitate opioid analgesics, hospitalisation and supplemental nutrition. These complications may disrupt cancer therapy, which may reduce survival. There is also a risk of death from sepsis if pathogens enter the ulcers of immunocompromised patients. Ulcerative oral mucositis can be costly to healthcare systems, yet there are few preventive interventions proven to be beneficial. Cytokines and growth factors may help the regeneration of cells lining of the mouth, thus preventing or reducing oral mucositis and its negative effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of cytokines and growth factors for preventing oral mucositis in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (searched 10 May 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched 10 May 2017); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 May 2017); Embase Ovid (7 December 2015 to 10 May 2017); CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 10 May 2017); and CANCERLIT PubMed (1950 to 10 May 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-design randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of cytokines and growth factors in patients with cancer receiving treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of electronic searches, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we reported mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. We pooled similar studies in random-effects meta-analyses. We reported adverse effects in a narrative format.

Main Results

We included 35 RCTs analysing 3102 participants. Thirteen studies were at low risk of bias, 12 studies were at unclear risk of bias, and 10 studies were at high risk of bias. Our main findings were regarding keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and are summarised as follows. There might be a reduction in the risk of moderate to severe oral mucositis in adults receiving bone marrow/stem cell transplantation after conditioning therapy for haematological cancers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 6 studies; 852 participants; low-quality evidence). We would need to treat 11 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 6 to 112). There might be a reduction in the risk of severe oral mucositis in this population, but there is also some possibility of an increase in risk (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.11; 6 studies; 852 participants; low-quality evidence). We would need to treat 10 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 5 to prevent the outcome to 14 to cause the outcome). There is probably a reduction in the risk of moderate to severe oral mucositis in adults receiving radiotherapy to the head and neck with cisplatin or fluorouracil (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00; 3 studies; 471 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We would need to treat 12 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 7 to infinity). It is very likely that there is a reduction in the risk of severe oral mucositis in this population (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; 3 studies; 471 participants; high-quality evidence). We would need to treat 7 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 5 to 15). It is likely that there is a reduction in the risk of moderate to severe oral mucositis in adults receiving chemotherapy alone for mixed solid and haematological cancers (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.70; 4 studies; 344 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We would need to treat 4 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 3 to 6). There might be a reduction in the risk of severe oral mucositis in this population (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65; 3 studies; 263 participants; low -quality evidence). We would need to treat 10 adults with KGF in order to prevent one additional adult from developing this outcome (95% CI 8 to 19). Due to the low volume of evidence, single-study comparisons and insufficient sample sizes, we found no compelling evidence of a benefit for any other cytokines or growth factors and there was no evidence on children. There did not appear to be any serious adverse effects of any of the interventions assessed in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are confident that KGF is beneficial in the prevention of oral mucositis in adults who are receiving: a) radiotherapy to the head and neck with cisplatin or fluorouracil; or b) chemotherapy alone for mixed solid and haematological cancers. We are less confident about a benefit for KGF in adults receiving bone marrow/stem cell transplant after conditioning therapy for haematological cancers because of multiple factors involved in that population, such as whether or not they received total body irradiation (TBI) and whether the transplant was autologous (the patients' own cells) or allogeneic (cells from a donor). KGF appears to be a relatively safe intervention. Due to limited research, we are not confident that there are any beneficial effects of other cytokines and growth factors. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the use of cytokines and growth factors in children.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^111bn2mx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Phase I: Initiation

The initiation phase involves direct damage to cells in the alimentary tract (mouth through to anus) caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments targeting these rapidly dividing populations of cells via irreversible damage to DNA. This damage leads to an upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes, targeting the basal epithelium and submucosa of the alimentary tract, leading to severe tissue damage.

The initiation of mucositis in both the oral cavity and GIT is almost exclusively driven by cytotoxic injury to stem cells, which are then incapable of populating the mucosa. Superficially, it may be challenging to consider how the microbiota may influence this relatively simple mechanism. The initial injury leads to the generation of oxidative stress through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While antioxidants have been investigated for their ability to reduce chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced toxicities (including mucosal), there is no consensus on the efficacy of antioxidants in OM or GI-M. However, recent advances in the role of gut microbiota in intestinal disease generation suggest that ROS are increased during gut dysbiosis, and a healthy gut microbiota protects against oxidative stress, suggesting the state of the gut microbiota is likely to influence the onset (or not) of OM or GI-M. However, no studies have examined the effects of gut microbiota on ROS levels in mucositis (or ROS levels on microbiota). Therefore, further evidence is required to substantially link gut microbiota influences over ROS specifically to mucositis.

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^113gDz8y]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Help is on the way (or is toxicity inevitable?)

An impressive example of biological crosstalk in radiation response is the interaction between MnSODs and the Keap1-Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-like) pathway. Nrf2 is a key transcription factor in maintaining redox homeostasis and appears to be a noteworthy contributor to host radiation response. Interestingly, two aspects of Nrf2 behavior align with clinical observations associated with ROM. First, Nrf2 activity declines with age and thus is consistent with RIT risk. Second, in agreement with clinical observations of OM behavior, Nrf2 activity varies with circadian rhythm. While concordance between Nrf2 and ROM has not been specifically studied, ROM risk based on time of day of radiation has been reported.

Under normal conditions, the Keap1-Nrf2 complex inhabits the cytoplasm, with Keap1 keeping Nrf2 in check. Under significant stress or in response to signaling, Nrf2 is released from its Keap constraint and migrates to the nucleus where it is activated to control the transcription of over 400 genes. Functionally, Nrf2 binds to and regulates the expression of acute radiation expression (ARE) genes which encode for both antioxidant proteins, including SODs, and a second tier of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione transferase and metallothioneins.

MnSOD signaling catalyzes Nrf2 upregulation. In MnSOD-silenced hepatocytes, MnSOD acted as a signaling mediator for Nrf2-related survival genes and that expression of Nrf2 and its nuclear translocation could be mediated by MnSOD signaling.

In a reciprocal mechanism that might be interpreted as a cellular attempt to accelerate the control of potentially toxic levels of ROS, ARE-bound Nrf2 activates MnSOD in a manner that is consistent with the importance of redox sensitivity in regulating Nrf2 and NF-κB in the genesis of ROM. Furthermore, not only are reductions in Nrf2 associated with a parallel response in SODs, but HO-1, a Nrf2 target gene, is linked to Nrf2's ability to attenuate NF-κB expression.

Of interest relative to the clinical trajectory of developing ROM is the finding that Nrf2 activation is radiation dose dependent. Activation has been noted at radiation fractions of 2 Gy. However, unlike the first line enzymatic response which is triggered by NF-κB and AP1 within minutes or hours after the first dose of irradiation, Nrf2 antioxidant induction and response are slower. Reportedly, there is a 5-day delay before the Nrf2 antioxidant activation is observed. Possibly, the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway serves as a lifeboat against threatening levels of oxidative stress that have thwarted effective control by first line enzymes.

### Guideline for the prevention of oral and oropharyngeal mucositis in children receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^115kjEPg]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Research gaps

Research gaps are highlighted in box 1 and include identification of chemotherapeutic agents appropriate for cryotherapy. Important research gaps related to LLLT include better mechanistic information on how the modality could be effective, determination of ideal treatment parameters and comprehensive long-term adverse-effect evaluation, since enhanced bone growth has been reported in preclinical studies. For KGF, research is needed to identify the optimal KGF dose and its short-term and long-term toxicities in paediatric patients. Data related to compliance and cost-effectiveness are needed for these strategies. More paediatric evidence is required to evaluate existing and new interventions to prevent or reduce the severity of mucositis particularly since some children at risk for mucositis, especially infants and very young children, will not be eligible for any of the interventions identified in this guideline.

Box 1
Key research gaps

Another important gap is the identification of ineffective interventions to prevent mucositis in children. In randomised trials, equivalence trials require larger sample sizes than superiority trials because the minimal clinically important difference (in superiority trials) is larger than the margin of clinical equivalence. In synthesising trial results, it is unclear how much information is required before concluding equivalence in efficacy outcomes. Similarly, it is unclear how much information demonstrating lack of benefit is required before panels can recommend against use of an agent for interventions without meaningful harms or costs. Finally, how panels should weigh indirect adult evidence in making paediatric recommendations against use of an intervention is another question. Among these research gaps, research priorities that should be addressed early include the identification of paediatric anticancer treatment protocols appropriate for cryotherapy, feasibility of cryotherapy and LLLT in clinical practice, and child preferences for these strategies.

### Methodology for the MASCC / ISOO mucositis clinical practice guidelines update [^114geZRK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Members of the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) recently completed the process of updating the MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of mucositis. These guidelines, originally published in 2004, and last updated in 2007, provide clinicians with objective, evidence-based recommendations for the management of mucositis secondary to cancer therapy. This brief paper describes the methodology used to conduct the most recent systematic review in 2011, and develop new guidelines, providing the basis for the update. The overriding aims of the process were to assess evidence of effectiveness of interventions for the prevention and treatment of mucositis and to produce clinical practice guidelines for the management of mucositis using best available evidence.

### Updated perspectives on the contribution of the microbiome to the pathogenesis of mucositis using the MASCC / ISOO framework [^112Fvend]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there have been major advances in the treatment of cancer, namely the development of novel treatment modalities, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain the backbone of effective cancer control. Although effective, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are highly non-selective, resulting in a range of healthy cells and tissues being subject to their cytotoxic properties resulting in tissue injury and the development of adverse symptoms and side effects. Mucosal tissues are especially susceptible to this non-selective cytotoxicity due to the highly proliferative nature of the mucosal epithelial cells. Damage to mucosal surfaces in the mouth and intestines (termed mucositis) is especially challenging, impacting oral intake, speech, swallowing, nutrient absorption, barrier integrity, and immune function. It is also extremely prevalent, with oral mucositis (OM) occurring in almost 100% of people undergoing head and neck (chemo)radiotherapy, and gastrointestinal mucositis (GI-M) occurring in 80% of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. Due to the constellation of symptoms associated with mucositis, including pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and infection, mucositis is a major clinical challenge, impacting treatment adherence, requiring costly resource utilization and impairing patient quality of life. Severe OM and GI-M can lead to treatment breaks or regimen de-escalation, impacting survival.

### Addressing pain in oral mucositis: narrative review of current practices and emerging treatments [^113L5Ycq]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pathogenesis of OM

The pathogenesis of OM is complex and involves multiple factors. The current model of its development includes cytotoxic effects from chemotherapy drugs, disruption of epithelial junctional integrity, inflammation, myelosuppression caused by treatment, and alterations in the oral microbiota.

The pathogenesis of OM follows a complex five-phase process: initiation, upregulation, signal amplification, ulceration, and healing,(Figure 1).

Figure 1
Oral mucositis pathogenesis. Exposure to antineoplastic treatments triggers DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and death of basal oral mucosa epithelial cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokine release impairs tissue oxygenation and activates pathways that exacerbate connective tissue damage and cellular apoptosis. The high infection risk can further aggravate mucosal ulceration once the submucosal breaks form in the oral mucosa lining. The final phase involves oral mucosa re-epithelialization and tissue repair. Created in BioRender. Ramirez, (M) (2025)o32c149.

1. **Initiation Phase**: This phase begins with cellular and DNA damage induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy, which leads to the release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and results in the death of basal and submucosal epithelial cells.

2. **Upregulation Phase**: In this phase, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) occurs. These cytokines activate pathways that damage connective tissue, impair tissue oxygenation, and trigger cellular apoptosis.

3. **Amplification Phase**: Positive feedback mechanisms involving pro-inflammatory cytokines exacerbate tissue damage, further propagating the inflammatory response.

4. **Ulceration Phase**: Characterized by the formation of submucosal breaks, this phase allows for the invasion of microorganisms, increasing the risk of infection.

5. **Healing Phase**: The final phase involves re-epithelialization and tissue repair of the oral mucositis ulcerations, aiming to restore the integrity of the effected mucosal tissue.

### Amifostine in the management of radiation-induced and chemo-induced mucositis [^115RujLc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mucositis is a significant complication of cancer therapy, with important clinical and economic implications. In June 2005, the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) conducted an evidence-based update review of the literature on mucositis. The goal of this literature review is to update previously published guidelines for the management of mucositis.

Results

This article reports the findings of the subgroup charged with reviewing the literature related to amifostine.

### Avasopasem manganese treatment for severe oral mucositis from chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ROMAN) [^1114ZYBy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Severe oral mucositis is a common debilitating side effect of RT for HNC patients, and its mitigation is a substantial unmet medical need. With no FDA-approved drug to limit SOM development, MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice guidelines currently focus on symptom management strategies. Unlike palliation, avasopasem acts to block a critical underlying mechanism driving SOM. Unlike low-light laser therapy, AVA's systemic delivery impacts mucositis development beyond where instruments can reach and extends to other organs, like the kidneys.

For consistency with the Phase 1b/2a and Phase 2b trials, the same WHO scoring criteria was utilized to measure OM in ROMAN. FDA regulators preferred WHO, as unlike RTOG and CTCAEv5·0, WHO clarifies impact of OM on patient diet (solids, liquids, nothing by mouth). However, RTOG or CTCAEv5·0 could have been utilized in addition to the WHO scoring criteria for comparison. Villa et al. evaluated concordance of WHO, RTOG, and CTCAE scoring in a similar population of two hundred patients with OP/OC cancer receiving chemoradiation enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Discordance was seen with patients exhibiting mild to moderate OM or most severe (grade 4) OM. When patients had severe OM (WHO score ≥ 3), 99·6% of CTCAE and 97·7% of RTOG scores were concordant.

### Expert consensus on the prevention and treatment of radiochemotherapy-induced oral mucositis [^1151kVsd]. International Journal of Oral Science (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced mucositis:

- **Definition**: Chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis refers to erythematous and ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa in patients with cancer being treated with chemotherapy or radiation.
- **Pathophysiology**: Chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis is caused by direct toxicities (cell death and reduction in cell turnover) and indirect toxicity (myelosuppression).
- **Disease course**: Tissue injury, upregulation of inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines, and ulceration results in chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis, which causes clinical manifestations of severe pain, bleeding, and weight loss impacting nutritional intake, oral hygiene, and QoL; gastrointestinal mucositis can manifest as diarrhea. Mucositis complicated by infection during severe immunosuppression can lead to systemic sepsis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis independently is not associated with increased mortality.

### Dose-limiting mucositis: friend or foe? [^112yS1z8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose-limiting toxicities are ubiquitous to cancer-directed therapy, presenting with severity to a degree that necessitates therapy de-escalation, pause, or discontinuation. To date, there is incredible limited understanding if these therapy de-escalations present risk for survival by limiting delivery of intensive therapy, or if they indicate physiologic susceptibility and are a favorable prognostic indicator. Mucositis is an excellent illustration of the current paradox of dose-limiting toxicities-it has existed alongside therapy for eight decades, but despite its presence, there is an incomplete understanding of how it develops, why it varies between oncologic populations, and if it relates to cancer survival. Rigorous methodologic approaches in symptom science holds potential to better understand mucositis, to determine if it is a marker of response or threat, and evaluate if it holds potential to guide therapy delivery.

### Prevention of radiation-induced mucositis [^115MeDV8]. Current Oncology Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Radiation-induced mucositis is an important dose-limiting acute side effect associated with the treatment of tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract. The toxicity of radiation therapy increases with prior or concurrent administration of some chemotherapeutic agents. Pretreatment eradication of infection, maintenance of oral hygiene, and treatment breaks, as necessary, have been the mainstay of the therapeutic options for patients with radiation-induced mucositis. Recent research has begun to clarify the pathophysiology of radiation-induced mucositis. This suggests that new, more effective agents for both prevention and treatment may be forthcoming in the near future. Currently, no highly effective and widely accepted prevention or treatment exists.

Biological characterization of a moving target

Contrasting with many models used to study radiation biology, clinical fractionated radiation regimens provide a different dosing dynamic and cell and tissue challenge. The biological "movie" following a single radiation exposure only partially reflects the repeated pounding suffered by normal mucosa during treatment in which the biological impact of radiation represents the sum of cumulative dosing. Further, the biological responses of previously irradiated cells and tissues will differ from those of radiation naïve ones, as is well recognized in the setting of clinical reirradiation. Whatever signals or pathways are induced one day are supplemented, overlapped, and modified on subsequent days of treatment (Fig. 1). Following radiation, lingering effects of treatment also project into delayed or late clinical events.

Fig. 1
Differences in the clinical trajectory of oral mucositis between a bolus and fractionated stomatotoxic challenge: one blow from a sledgehammer vs. cumulative hits from a small ball peen hammer. The acuity of SOM development and resolution in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy such as in conditioning regimens for stem cell transplants contrasts dramatically with the slower onset, duration, and time to resolution observed in patients receiving typical regimens of fractionated doses of radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancers. While there is similarity in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, the repetitive challenge of multiple radiation doses produces a cumulative biological effect that results in injury, i.e. one blow from a sledgehammer vs. repeated hits with a small hammer

### A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis: when biological challenges exceed physiologic protective mechanisms. implications for pharmacological prevention and treatment [^115RCK4L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis (OM) remains a significant unmet need for patients being treated with standard concomitant chemoradiation (CRT) regimens for head and neck cancers (HNC). OM's pathogenesis is complex and includes both direct and indirect damage pathways. In this paper, the field is reviewed with emphasis on the initiating and sustaining role of oxidative stress on OM's pathobiology. A hypothesis is presented which suggests that based on OM's clinical and biological trajectory, mucosal damage is largely the consequence of cumulative CRT-induced biological changes overwhelming physiologic self-protective mechanisms. Furthermore, an individual's ability to mount and maintain a protective response is dependent on interacting pathways which are primarily determined by a multiplex consisting of genomics, epigenomics, and microbiomics. Effective biologic or pharmacologic OM interventions are likely to supplement or stimulate existing physiologic damage-control mechanisms.

### Oral mucositis in head and neck cancer: risk, biology, and management… [^116yEz3S]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

The Oral Environment and Mucositis The pathogenesis of mucositis is a study of multiple sequential biologic events coupled with the influence of the oral environment and microbiome. 1The majority of pathways that lead to mucositis are the same whether the initiating event is chemotherapy, radiation, or concomitant chemoradiation. However, the schedule of biologic challenges is clearly different. Whereas patients being treated with cycled chemotherapy receive an acute challenge that is administered systemically, patients undergoing radiation receive a succession of fragmented radiation doses, which, even in small increments, trigger a cascade of biologic events. Also, although compartmentalization of the events associated with mucositis is undoubtedly a fantasy created for the convenience of explanation, the sequence can be divided into five stages: initiation, upregulation/activation, signal amplification, ulceration, and healing.

The initiating biologic events that start the process were first attributed to oxidative stress and the generation of free radicals. Although still a critical event, we now know that activation of the innate immune response and Nrf2 provides alternative initiating pathways. Studies in which these pathways have been effectively interrupted demonstrate mitigation of downstream injury. From an interventional standpoint, the initiation phase is a ripe target as its attenuation affects the course of direct and indirect pathways of tissue damage. 25Among the best studied is activation of the NF-κB pathway and consequent generation of proinflammatory cytokines. 26Although tissue and peripheral blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines — such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha — track well with the development of mucositis, it is unclear whether their role is one of mediating or messaging for injury or whether they are themselves true drivers of damage.

6BZD has been reported to have a range of biologic activities that interfere with mechanisms thought to be of importance in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced oral mucositis. A study in a hamster model of mucositis — in which the effect of topically applied BZD on selected morphologic and biologic parameters was studied in temporal fashion — demonstrated that BZD modified epithelial proliferation, but not differentiation, and that the observed changes correlated with a reduction in tissue levels of IL-1β and TNF-α, but not IL-6. Preferential antiapoptotic activity was seen in epithelium and connective tissue of BZD-treated animals. 28.

Biological concepts: ROM and dominos

ROM pathogenesis consists of parallel, sequential, and staggered molecular events occurring in a temporal dimension. Were ROM simply the consequence of a series of interdependent occurrences, it might be modeled by a row of dominos where each domino represented a component in the pathogenetic path. Hit the first domino and the next domino falls, then the next, and so on until ulceration occurs. However, such a linear representation ignores the complicated relationships which characterize ROM's biological processes. A more realistic arrangement would account for the intricacies, redundancies, and interactions that occur, perhaps a pyramid arrangement in which the first domino hits the next 2, those hit the 4 behind them, etc. But that still would not accurately reflect biological dynamics which might require that 2 of the dominos in row 10 could not only fall backward, but also sideways, or that a looping row of dominos could project from the major group and circle back to re-knock over recovered dominos. Even this model fails to recognize that the size and weight of each domino might vary from patient to patient (genomic variability), that the space between dominos is not the same (epigenetics), or even that the force applied to each is not equivalent (amplifying potential of the microbiome).

Pain Management Strategies

The standard approach to managing oral mucositis involves patient education, the use of oral rinses, both topical and systemic pain management, hydration, nutritional support, and infection prevention strategies. Pain management strategies for OM involve a comprehensive approach that targets both nociceptive and neuropathic components. Nociceptive pain, which arises from tissue damage, can be effectively managed with analgesic oral rinses, over-the-counter analgesics like acetaminophen and NSAIDs, as well as opioid medications. However, neuropathic pain often requires alternative therapies. In these cases medications like duloxetine (an antidepressant) and gabapentin (an anticonvulsant) are commonly utilized to address the underlying nerve dysfunction and provide pain relief.

As outlined by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO), multi-agent combination oral care protocols have shown efficacy in preventing OM. The following section will explore the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options for OM, as well as the latest emerging therapies under investigation to address this highly complex condition.

### Management of mucositis during chemotherapy: from pathophysiology to pragmatic therapeutics [^114S4F9p]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced mucositis is a common condition caused by the breakdown of the mucosal barrier. Symptoms can include pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, which can often necessitate chemotherapy treatment breaks or dose reductions, thus compromising survival outcomes. Despite the significant impact of mucositis, there are currently limited clinically effective pharmacological therapies for the pathology. New emerging areas of research have been proposed to play key roles in the development of mucositis, providing rationale for potential new therapeutics for the prevention, treatment or management of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. This review aims to address these new areas of research and to comment on the therapeutics arising from them.

Conclusion

RITs such as ROM have two distinct, but interactive pathways, immediate/direct and indirect. An effective management strategy must consider both optimal drug targets and dosing schedules. A treatment which maximally attenuates the indirect pathway and acts at a key "chokepoint" is likely to favorably impact the severity, incidence, and course of ROM without negatively impacting tumor response.

There is no FDA approved drug therapy to mitigate ROM in HNC patients. RITs, including ROM, remain common, create suffering for patients, threaten optimum cancer therapy, drain healthcare resources, and share pathogenesis components and sequences. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of ROM's pathogenesis is critical to successful development of therapeutic interventions.

### Addressing pain in oral mucositis: narrative review of current practices and emerging treatments [^1171iDSA]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oral mucositis (OM) is a debilitating complication of cancer therapies, affecting up to 85% of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation and nearly all receiving head and neck radiotherapy. Characterized by mucosal inflammation, ulceration, and severe pain, OM significantly impairs oral intake, speech, and quality of life. These disruptions, compounded by complications such as infection, bleeding, and increased healthcare costs, often necessitate treatment delays or modifications, negatively impacting cancer prognosis. Recent insights into nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms of OM-related pain have led to the development of innovative management strategies. Given the debilitating nature of OM in cancer patients and the critical need for effective pain control, this review aims to examine pharmacological advancements targeting the complex nature of OM-related pain, including agents such as lidocaine, doxepin, benzydamine, methylene blue, opioids, gabapentin, palifermin, caphosol, and ketamine.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in the PUBMED, COCHRANE, and MEDLINE databases, covering studies from 2000 to 2024. Studies focusing on OM pathogenesis and pain management strategies were screened. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews involving adult patients treated with lidocaine, doxepin, benzydamine, methylene blue, opioids, gabapentin, palifermin, caphosol, or ketamine for OM-associated pain.

Conclusion

OM pain arises from nociceptive and neuropathic pathways involving inflammatory cytokines and neuropeptides. Current interventions, including topical and systemic agents, have shown promise, yet variability in treatment protocols and limited high-quality evidence hinder standardized practices. This review highlights the clinical applicability of emerging therapies, such as avasopasem manganese, which has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating OM progression. Ongoing clinical trials targeting novel pathways that modulate mucosal inflammatory response and limit disease severity offer hope for improved pain relief. Addressing the multifaceted nature of OM-associated pain is essential for enhancing quality of life and optimizing cancer treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to establish robust, evidence-based guidelines for OM pain management.

### Anti-inflammatory agents in the management of alimentary mucositis [^112pvxpf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Alimentary mucositis is a significant complication of cancer therapy, with important clinical and economic implications.

Materials and Methods

In June 2005, the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology conducted an evidence-based review of the literature on alimentary mucositis. The goal of this literature review was to update previously published guidelines for the management of mucositis.

Results

This article reports the findings of the subgroup charged with reviewing the literature related to anti-inflammatory interventions. Considerable preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the use of anti-inflammatory agents may be a promising approach to reduce the severity of mucositis. However, there was not enough evidence to support any new guidelines advocating the use of any specific anti-inflammatory intervention.

Conclusion

Thus, there is a need for well-designed clinical trials evaluating the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the management of mucositis.

Oral mucositis is a serious complication of cancer therapy and in severely immunosuppressed patients. In immunosuppressed patients, the signs and symptoms of infection often are muted because of limited host response, and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment may be difficult. Prevention of mucosal breakdown, suppression of microbial colonization, control of viral reactivation, and effective management of severe xerostomia are all critical steps to reducing the overall morbidity and mortality of oromucosal infections.

### New thoughts on the pathobiology of regimen-related mucosal injury [^116rjmTz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Our understanding of the biological basis for mucosal barrier injury (mucositis) induced by cancer therapy with radiation or drugs continues to evolve. A patient's mucosal response to cancer therapy appears to be controlled by both global (i.e.g.ender, underlying systemic disease, race) and tissue specific (i.e. epithelial type, intrinsic endocrine system, local microbial environment, function) factors.

Conclusion

Interactions of these elements, coupled with underlying genetic influences, most likely govern the risk, course and severity of regimen-related mucosal injury.

### Confounding factors in the assessment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer [^112Yxkap]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma not amenable for surgical resection or resected with high-risk features is usually based on (chemo-)radiation treatment. Oral mucositis represents one of the main side effects of (chemo-)radiation, with an important impact on quality of life and causing approximately 20% of early interruption of treatment, leading to a suboptimal dose administered. Treatment and prevention of oral mucositis have a central role in the therapeutic pathways of head and neck cancer patients but remains quite challenging. Although extensive research is conducted to identify interventions for the management of mucositis, very few interventions had sufficient evidence to generate an international expert consensus. This may be partially explained by confounding factors that could influence the development and assessment of oral mucositis. Little is known about the confounding factors of oral mucositis, which, if not well balanced in an experimental study, could lead to non-solid results. The current paper aims to review the main oral mucositis confounding factors related to head and neck cancer patients.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^113UGNPX]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oral mucositis/stomatitis (hereafter stomatitis) is a common dose-limiting toxicity seen with various classes of cancer treatment. Symptoms associated with stomatitis, primarily oral pain, may impact patient quality of life and may lead to dose delay and reduction or treatment discontinuation. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel trophoblast cell surface antigen 2-directed antibody-drug conjugate undergoing clinical investigation in multiple solid tumor types. Stomatitis is among the most reported adverse events associated with Dato-DXd, with most cases being grades 1–2. This article reviews the incidence of stomatitis seen with Dato-DXd, including in the phase III pivotal studies TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 (in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, respectively), both studies met a dual primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care chemotherapies. Developing new cancer therapies requires evidence-based strategies to successfully prevent, monitor, and manage adverse events. Accordingly, a thorough evaluation of potential underlying mechanisms, risk factors, available clinical data, and adequacy of preventive and management recommendations for stomatitis is presented here. Prophylaxis recommendations for a daily oral care plan include oral hygiene education and the use of a prophylactic steroid-containing mouthwash. Ongoing studies continue to collect data on Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis to further characterize clinical features and possible mechanisms of this toxicity. Appropriate management may reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of events, improve quality of life, and support patient adherence to treatment.

### Oral mucositis complicating chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy: options for prevention and treatment [^114zfoGJ]. CA (2001). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis represents a therapeutic challenge frequently encountered in cancer patients. This side effect causes significant morbidity and may delay the treatment plan, as well as increase therapeutic expenses. The pathogenesis of this debilitating side effect can be attributed to the direct mucosal toxicity of cytotoxic agents and ionizing radiation and to indirect mucosal damage caused by a concomitant inflammatory reaction exacerbated in the presence of neutropenia, and the emergence of bacterial, mycotic, and viral infections. The prophylactic and therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of oral mucositis consists of locally and systemically applied nonpharmacological measures and pharmacotherapeutics.
