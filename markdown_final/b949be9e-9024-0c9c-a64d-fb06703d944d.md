## Question

A 54-year-old woman with a history of severe rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic prednisone and weekly methotrexate), hypertension, and well-controlled atrial fibrillation (on warfarin, INR 2.4) presents with new onset fever and a productive cough. Chest X-ray shows right lower lobe pneumonia; blood cultures pending. You plan to start oral levofloxacin 750 mg daily empirically for community-acquired pneumonia — okay to proceed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe and appropriate to start oral levofloxacin 750 mg daily for community-acquired pneumonia in a 54-year-old woman with severe rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone and weekly methotrexate, hypertension, and well-controlled atrial fibrillation on warfarin with INR 2.4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and whether levofloxacin is an appropriate empiric choice for CAP. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions, especially with warfarin and methotrexate. Next, I will assess patient-specific safety risks such as QT prolongation, tendinopathy, and CNS effects. After that, I need to check dosing and renal function considerations. Finally, I will weigh alternatives and outline a monitoring and mitigation plan if levofloxacin is used, including INR checks, symptom surveillance, and when to switch therapy if risks outweigh benefits.

> Let me first confirm the indication and appropriateness of levofloxacin for CAP. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with activity against typical CAP pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypicals, and is commonly used as monotherapy for CAP in adults, so the indication itself is reasonable if local resistance patterns support it and there are no overriding contraindications [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the warfarin interaction before committing. The FDA labeling for levofloxacin notes that while a controlled study in healthy volunteers did not show a significant pharmacokinetic effect on warfarin, postmarketing reports describe enhanced anticoagulant effects with bleeding when levofloxacin is coadministered, and INR should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is used with warfarin; this is a classic pharmacodynamic interaction with unpredictable clinical impact, so I should not assume safety just because a PK study was neutral [^3aac9af5] [^777020fd].

> Hold on, I should also check the methotrexate interaction. Fluoroquinolones can inhibit renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, potentially increasing methotrexate levels and toxicity; although the strength of evidence varies and some data are from case reports, the mechanistic plausibility and potential for serious toxicity (mucositis, cytopenias, hepatotoxicity) make this a meaningful risk in someone on weekly methotrexate, especially at higher doses or with renal impairment, so I need to ensure close monitoring and consider dose holds if methotrexate levels rise or toxicity appears [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I evaluate QT risk. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which alone is not a contraindication, but fluoroquinolones can prolong the QT interval; levofloxacin has a modest QT effect compared with moxifloxacin, yet risk is amplified by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, structural heart disease, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs; I should confirm electrolytes and review her medication list for other QT-prolonging agents before proceeding and consider ECG if risk factors are present or if symptoms arise [^7190481d] [^a42e9553].

> Let me consider tendinopathy risk next. Chronic corticosteroid use is a major risk factor for fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture, and rheumatoid arthritis itself increases risk; this risk is not theoretical and can occur during therapy or even months after completion, so I should counsel the patient to stop therapy and seek care immediately if she develops tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation, and I should reconsider fluoroquinolone use if alternatives are reasonable [^3c865e86] [^673982c5].

> I should double-check dosing and renal function. Levofloxacin 750 mg daily is a standard adult dose for CAP; however, if creatinine clearance is below 50 mL/min, dose adjustment is required to avoid accumulation, so I need to check her renal function and adjust accordingly if impaired [^7190481d].

> But wait, what if the risks outweigh the benefits here. Given the combination of warfarin with unpredictable INR elevation, weekly methotrexate with potential for increased toxicity, and chronic steroid exposure elevating tendinopathy risk, a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin would often be preferred empirically for CAP unless there is a specific reason to favor a fluoroquinolone (e.g., severe beta-lactam allergy or documented atypical coverage needs); I should confirm local antibiograms and allergy history before switching, but I should not default to levofloxacin in this high-risk profile without a compelling rationale [^notfound].

> If, after discussing alternatives and local resistance patterns, levofloxacin is still chosen, I need to ensure a strict monitoring plan. I should obtain baseline electrolytes and an ECG if QT risk factors exist, check INR within 2–3 days of initiation and then every few days until stable, hold methotrexate that week and monitor CBC and LFTs, and advise immediate cessation and evaluation for any tendon pain or neurologic symptoms; I should also counsel on photosensitivity and CNS effects and avoid coadministration with antacids, iron, or multivitamins within 2 hours to preserve absorption [^3aac9af5] [^7190481d].

> In summary, I should not jump to conclusions and simply say "proceed". While levofloxacin can treat CAP, the combination of warfarin, methotrexate, and chronic steroids creates a high-risk pharmacologic milieu for bleeding, methotrexate toxicity, and tendon injury; if used at all, it should be with informed consent, close INR and lab monitoring, and a low threshold to switch to a safer agent, but my initial inclination is to prefer a non-fluoroquinolone regimen unless there is a compelling indication that outweighs these risks [^3aac9af5] [^3c865e86].

---

Do not use **levofloxacin 750 mg daily** in this patient because of the **high risk of tendon rupture** from concomitant corticosteroids and rheumatoid arthritis, and the **significant risk of bleeding** from potentiation of warfarin. Use a beta-lactam (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate or ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide (e.g. azithromycin) or doxycycline instead, and monitor INR closely if any antibiotic is started.

---

## Pharmacological considerations and risks

### Tendon rupture risk

- **Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy**: Levofloxacin carries a boxed warning for tendinitis and tendon rupture, especially in patients over 60, those on corticosteroids, or with rheumatoid arthritis [^3c865e86].
- **Corticosteroid concomitant use**: Chronic prednisone significantly increases tendon rupture risk with fluoroquinolones.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: RA itself elevates tendon rupture risk, and adding a fluoroquinolone compounds this hazard [^3c865e86].

---

### Warfarin interaction and bleeding risk

- **Warfarin potentiation**: Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, can enhance warfarin's anticoagulant effect, increasing bleeding risk and INR instability [^3aac9af5].
- **Clinical evidence**: Postmarketing reports link levofloxacin to elevated INR and bleeding when combined with warfarin, necessitating close INR monitoring [^3aac9af5].
- **Current INR**: The patient's INR of 2.4 is therapeutic; adding levofloxacin risks supratherapeutic INR and bleeding.

---

### Additional safety concerns

Additional safety concerns include **QT prolongation**, as fluoroquinolones can prolong the QT interval, posing risk in patients with arrhythmias or on QT-prolonging drugs, and **CNS effects**, with fluoroquinolones associated with seizures and neuropsychiatric effects, which are more likely with systemic corticosteroids.

---

## Alternative antibiotic recommendations

Given these risks, **avoid levofloxacin**; consider the following alternatives:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate + azithromycin | - Effective CAP coverage <br/> - No significant warfarin interaction <br/> - Lower tendon risk |
| Ceftriaxone + azithromycin | - Broad CAP coverage <br/> - No significant warfarin interaction <br/> - Lower tendon risk |
| Doxycycline monotherapy | - Alternative for mild CAP <br/> - No significant warfarin interaction <br/> - Lower tendon risk |

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

If an antibiotic with warfarin interaction is unavoidable, **monitor INR within 2–3 days** of initiation and adjust warfarin as needed, and counsel the patient to report bleeding, bruising, or unusual symptoms promptly.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Levofloxacin 750 mg daily is **not appropriate** for this patient due to the **high risk of tendon rupture** from corticosteroids and RA, and the **significant bleeding risk** from warfarin potentiation. Use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline, and monitor INR closely if any interacting antibiotic is used.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^4219b0f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that doses of levofloxacin > 1,000 mg/d do not reduce time to culture conversion but do result in an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 AEs, with higher exposures also associated with slightly more QTcF prolongation. In our study, a dose of 750 mg was adequate to achieve the target AUC/MIC of 100. However, because there was no detectable difference in toxicity between doses of 750 mg/d and 1,000 mg/d and there is wide variability of AUCs achieved with oral levofloxacin, we conclude that a dose of 1,000 mg/d will most reliably achieve target levels without incurring unnecessary toxicity.

### From repurposing to refinement: optimizing levofloxacin for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^53552e3e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This is a well-designed and carefully conducted study, but the authors' conclusion merits further consideration. First, the authors provide no evidence that the 750-mg regimen was inferior to the 1,000-mg regimen in any of the evaluated parameters, including time to culture conversion, MIC, ratio of AUC to MIC, and adverse events. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to conclude that a 750-mg dose remains a viable option, at least for lean patients.

Second, it is worth noting that QT interval prolongation (Fridericia-corrected QT interval > 450 ms) was more common among patients in the higher dose group in this study. As the authors acknowledge as a limitation, the drugs used alongside levofloxacin in their study are not those currently prioritized for MDR TB treatment. When combined with newer anti-TB drugs, QT interval prolongation could be more pronounced, as both bedaquiline and delamanid can also prolong the QT interval. Considering these factors, the study's findings supporting the use of a lower dose should be given greater significance.

In conclusion, the authors have conducted a well-designed study to determine the optimal dose of levofloxacin as an anti-TB drug. The study delivers a clear and straightforward message: for MDR TB treatment, a daily dose exceeding 1,000 mg of levofloxacin provides no additional benefit in terms of efficacy while increasing the risk of adverse effects. Levofloxacin, repurposed for MDR TB treatment, has now been refined for optimal dosing.

7.1 Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins

While the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of levofloxacin tablets with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacin administration.

7.2 Warfarin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.4 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Warning or precaution regarding the use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride OPHTH (also known as Avelox, Moxeza, Vigamox) and superinfection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as prolonged use of moxifloxacin may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^3fc9ed14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Contraindication regarding the use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride IV (also known as Avelox, Moxeza, Vigamox) and known or at risk of QT prolongation: avoid using moxifloxacin in patients with known QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmia (including torsade de pointes), ongoing proarrhythmic conditions (such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia), uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, receiving class IA (such as quinidine, procainamide) or class III (such as amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics or other QT-prolonging drugs (such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, or TCAs).

### Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever [^f8ac2393]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Drug-induced fever is an uncommon but important differential in patients with unexplained fever. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with advanced renal disease and recent total hip arthroplasty who developed fever after an extended course of ciprofloxacin treatment. Extensive investigations, including cultures, imaging and orthopaedic review, failed to identify an infectious source. Although her fever initially resolved by day 2, it recurred on day 19 of treatment. Repeat assessments remained inconclusive. Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever was suspected, and defervescence occurred within 48 hours of discontinuation, with no recurrence thereafter. This case highlights the importance of considering drug fever once other causes have been excluded. Early recognition can prevent unnecessary antibiotic escalation, reduce hospital stay and improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, particularly when new medications coincide with unexplained fever in the absence of clear infection.

### Levofloxacin [^7190481d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using levofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

The pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in younger adults and elderly adults do not differ significantly when creatinine clearance is taken into consideration. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.

### Primaquine phosphate [^306e0bf0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warning or precaution regarding the use of primaquine phosphate PO and prolonged QT interval: use caution in patients with conditions that may increase the risk of QT prolongation or receiving medications known to cause electrolyte imbalances.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin hydrochloride. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur. [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled multiple-dose clinical trials, 23% of patients receiving oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults.

In trials of intravenous use, 42% of moxifloxacin hydrochloride patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 23% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator-treated patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Therefore, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia). [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]

8.6 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild, moderate, severe, or end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment, including those patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). [See Dosage and Administration (2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3].

---

### Ciprofloxacin [^6f8f79f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.13 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, ciprofloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with ciprofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued.

As with other drugs, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^a42e9553]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Culture conversion was high and treatment failure rare, and therefore our study results are not inconsistent with the observation that a levofloxacin AUC during the most recent 24-hour dosing interval (AUC 0–24)/MIC of > 100 can be expected to be associated with a successful outcome of MDR-TB treatment with a levofloxacin-containing regimen. Notably, all patients receiving levofloxacin at any of the doses in our study were able to achieve this target when the MIC was ≤ 1.0 μg/ml (the usual range in M. tuberculosis isolates susceptible to levofloxacin). This is in contradiction to the report of Ghimire and coworkers, who concluded that doses of 1,000 mg/d did not consistently achieve this target. The fact that all of our study participants had an AUC 0–24 /MIC above this threshold indicates that an AUC 0–24 /MIC of > 100 was above the inflection point on the activity/concentration curve; this in turn implies that further increases in AUC may not offer additional clinical benefit in the range of MICs that are encountered with susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates. Had we included lower doses of levofloxacin in our study, we might have observed this inflection, but we truncated our dose range so that no participants received less than the recommended adult dose of ≥ 750 mg of levofloxacin for the treatment of TB.

We found a minimal increase in QTcF interval prolongation with higher exposures to levofloxacin: a ΔQTcF of 6.9 ms (95% CI, −4.0 to 17.9 ms) at 16 weeks between the lower and upper tertiles of AUC. This effect is less pronounced than with moxifloxacin, another member of the fluoroquinolone class. Formal QT prolongation studies have revealed substantial QT prolongation with moxifloxacin at 400 mg/d but none with levofloxacin at doses as high as 1,500 mg/d. This represents one of the advantages of levofloxacin, a safe, tolerable drug that can be safely used in combination with anti-TB agents that have QT-prolonging effects. Bedaquiline, one such drug, is part of every current WHO-recommended regimen for the treatment of MDR/rifampicin-resistant TB. Although a growing body of literature shows that bedaquiline-linked QT interval prolongations are rarely clinically important, even when bedaquiline is used in combination with delamanid, it will still be beneficial to patients and TB programs to minimize the additive cardiac toxicity risk conferred by companion drugs.

### Haloperidol decanoate (Haldol decanoate) [^4ea6c114]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Since QTc interval-prolongation has been observed during HALDOL treatment, caution is advised when prescribing to a patient with QT-prolongation conditions or to patients receiving medications known to prolong the QTc-interval (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects). Examples include (but are not limited to): Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide); Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and other drugs such as citalopram, erythromycin, levofloxacin, methadone, and ziprasidone.

Caution is advised when HALDOL decanoate is used in combination with drugs known to cause electrolyte imbalance (e.g., diuretics or corticosteroids) because hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia are risk factors for QT prolongation.

As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opioids, and alcohol.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid using fluoroquinolones in patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months. Recognize that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^474fff33]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 QT Prolongation

Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin hydrochloride the mean (± SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (± 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (± 22) on Day 1 (n = 667) and 7 msec (± 24) on Day 3 (n = 667).

Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations:

Known prolongation of the QT interval
Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions
Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia,
Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia
Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents
Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants

Elderly patients using intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)].

In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore, the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded.

In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed.

A single participant had a QTcF of > 500 ms (grade 3 AE); this participant was in the 20-mg/kg treatment arm and had the highest recorded AUC, although the QT prolongation was considered likely attributable to concomitant use of azithromycin, a protocol-prohibited drug with known QT prolongation potential. The AE resolved after discontinuation of azithromycin; levofloxacin was not discontinued. One further participant experienced a QTcF of between 470 and 500 ms after randomization in the lowest tertile of AUC. Both participants with QT intervals of ≥ 470 ms subsequently completed study treatment. A further eight participants experienced a QTcF of > 450–470 ms after randomization. These events occurred more frequently among participants in the highest tertile of AUC (n = 7; 21.2%) compared with the lowest tertile (n = 1; 3.0%; P = 0.014; P = 0.029 excluding the participant who received azithromycin). Furthermore, excluding this participant, there was evidence of a linear relationship between maximum QTcF from visits at or after randomization and AUC (P < 0.001; Figure 3), with a mean increase of 7.3 ms (95% CI, 3.1–11.5 ms) per increase in 100 hours*μg/ml. The largest difference in QTcF between the lower and upper tertiles of AUC was seen at 16 weeks (Figure E12.4), with mean changes from baseline QTcF of 8.0 ms (95% CI, 1.6–14.4 ms) in the lower tertile and 14.9 ms (95% CI, 6.0–23.8 ms) in the upper tertile (excluding the participant who received azithromycin), a ΔQTcF of 6.9 ms (95% CI, −4.0 to 17.9 ms).

### From repurposing to refinement: optimizing levofloxacin for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^953c8295]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

After the development of rifampicin in 1963, nearly 50 years passed before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new antituberculosis drug, bedaquiline, in 2012. During this five-decade drought, antibiotics originally developed for other bacterial infections but later found to be effective against tuberculosis (TB) were repurposed to treat drug-resistant TB. Representative examples include fluoroquinolones, linezolid, and clofazimine.

Among the repurposed drugs, fluoroquinolones were the first to be widely adopted and became the most extensively used in TB treatment. Their anti-TB activity was potent enough that patients with TB who initially received incorrect diagnoses of bacterial pneumonia experienced temporary but noticeable clinical improvement when prescribed these drugs. With multiple studies confirming their positive impact on microbiological and clinical outcomes, fluoroquinolones have consistently been recognized as key components in multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment. A meta-analysis incorporating individual data from more than 12,000 patients with MDR TB further reinforced these findings, demonstrating that the use of levofloxacin or moxifloxacin was associated not only with treatment success but also with reduced mortality. On the other hand, the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance significantly worsens MDR TB treatment outcomes. Because of the significant clinical impact of fluoroquinolone resistance and their crucial role in MDR TB treatment, these drugs are not only considered defining criteria of extensive drug-resistant TB and pre–extensive drug-resistant TB, but they are also classified as group A essential anti-TB drugs, alongside linezolid and bedaquiline.

Among the newer generation fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have been used in TB treatment. Gatifloxacin, another fluoroquinolone, was previously evaluated in experimental 4-month regimens for drug-susceptible TB. However, because of its association with dysglycemia, particularly in elderly patients, it was subsequently withdrawn from the market.

Choosing between levofloxacin and moxifloxacin for TB treatment requires careful consideration. Experimental and animal studies have shown that moxifloxacin has a lower minimum inhibitory concentration than levofloxacin and exhibits greater bactericidal activity. However, moxifloxacin is also more likely to cause QT interval prolongation compared with levofloxacin. Previously, we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in patients with MDR TB. The negative sputum culture conversion rates at 3 months and overall treatment outcomes were not different between the two groups. Adverse events were more frequent in the levofloxacin group, particularly musculoskeletal pain.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 400 mg [^149974bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 QT Prolongation

Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin hydrochloride the mean (± SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (± 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (± 22) on Day 1 (n = 667) and 7 msec (± 24) on Day 3 (n = 667).

Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations:

- Known prolongation of the QT interval

- Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions

- Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia,

- Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia

- Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents

- Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants

Elderly patients using intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)].

In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded.

In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed.

Morphine

No significant effect of morphine sulfate (a single 10 mg intramuscular dose) on the mean AUC and Cmaxof moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) was observed in a study of 20 healthy male and female volunteers.

Oral Contraceptives

A placebo-controlled study in 29 healthy female subjects showed that moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days did not interfere with the hormonal suppression of oral contraception with 0.15 mg levonorgestrel/0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (as measured by serum progesterone, FSH, estradiol, and LH), or with the pharmacokinetics of the administered contraceptive agents.

Probenecid

Probenecid (500 mg twice daily for two days) did not alter the renal clearance and total amount of moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) excreted renally in a study of 12 healthy volunteers.

Ranitidine

No significant effect of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for three days as pretreatment) on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin (400 mg single dose) was detected in a study involving 10 healthy volunteers.

Theophylline

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (200 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (400 mg every twelve hours for 3 days) was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers. In addition, theophylline was not shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. The effect of co-administration of 400 mg once daily of moxifloxacin with theophylline has not been studied.

Warfarin

No significant effect of moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for eight days) on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin (25 mg single dose of warfarin sodium on the fifth day) was detected in a study involving 24 healthy volunteers. No significant change in prothrombin time was observed. However, fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Cyclosporine (Neoral) [^0fff5faa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

The initial dose of Neoral is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, Neoral therapy should be discontinued.

Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient's pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if Neoral is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with Neoral doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^777020fd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 General Information

Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see Boxed Warning].

Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.

7.2 CYP450 Interactions

CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4.

Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin.
Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin.

Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.

7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3. Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.

Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.

### Toremifene citrate [^1cfd3e8a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drugs that Decrease Renal Calcium Excretion

Drugs that decrease renal calcium excretion, e.g., thiazide diuretics, may increase the risk of hypercalcemia in patients receiving toremifene citrate.

7.2 Agents that Prolong QT

The administration of toremifene citrate with agents that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects should be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with toremifene citrate be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with toremifene citrate is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval. Agents generally accepted to prolong QT interval include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide) antiarrhythmics; certain antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine, haloperidol); certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, amitriptyline); certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin); and certain anti-emetics (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron). In patients at increased risk, electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be obtained and patients monitored as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.3 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Toremifene

Strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers, such as dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort, lower the steady-state concentration of toremifene in serum.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Moxifloxacin Tablets, USP

 (mox"I flox' asin)

Read the Medication Guide that comes with moxifloxacin tablets before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

 What is the most important information I should know about moxifloxacin tablets?

Moxifloxacin tablet belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. Moxifloxacin tablets can cause side effects that can happen at the same time and could result in death. If you get any of the following serious side effects, you should stop taking Moxifloxacin tablets and get medical help right away. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take moxifloxacin tablets.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).

Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take moxifloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include:
Pain, swelling, tears and inflammation of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites.
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take moxifloxacin tablets is higher if you:
Are over 60 years of age
Are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
Have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take moxifloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
Physical activity or exercise
Kidney failure
Tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets immediately and call your healthcare provider right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider. Avoid exercise and using the affected area. The most common area of pain and swelling is in the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons.
Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of moxifloxacin tablets. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking moxifloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days after taking moxifloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after patients have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking moxifloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
Hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
Bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
Unable to move the affected area or bear weight.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride IV (also known as Avelox, Moxeza, Vigamox):
- **Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis**: avoid using moxifloxacin in patients with myasthenia gravis.
- **Tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that can occur together, including tendinitis and tendon rupture (most commonly affecting the Achilles tendon), peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects (including convulsions, increased ICP, and psychosis). Reserve moxifloxacin for acute exacerbation of COPD and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis only when no alternative treatment options are available. Discontinue moxifloxacin immediately and avoid the use of fluoroquinolones in patients who experience any of these serious adverse reactions.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^8f20bf12]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic selection for COPD exacerbations — empiric choices, cultures, and route: The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern, and initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline or, in selected patients, quinolone. For patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction, and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other lung materials should be performed because gram-negative bacteria or resistant pathogens may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to eat and antibiotic pharmacokinetics, although it is preferable that antibiotics be given orally, and improvements in dyspnea and sputum purulence suggest clinical success.

### Postpartum pulmonary cryptococcosis combined with pulmonary embolism: a case report [^2ad1e73a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary infarction is a condition in which pulmonary blood vessel obstruction leads to ischemia and alveolar hemorrhage. If the latter cannot be absorbed, it will eventually lead to lung tissue necrosis, and fibrous scars will be formed in the infarct area, lasting for weeks or even months. The clinical manifestations of patients with pulmonary infarction are not specific, but pleurisy chest pain often occurs, which may be related to the pleural inflammation, irritation and necrosis caused by alveolar hemorrhage. At present, the diagnosis of pulmonary infarction is still mainly based on imaging, which is usually wedge-shaped in the subpleura, and its imaging manifestations include consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and ground glass changes. In our case, the shadow in the patient's lung was considered to be caused by cryptococcal infection and pulmonary embolism leading to infar. It was speculated that the patient's chest pain may be related to the secondary infection caused by ischemia, hemorrhage, and swelling caused by the infarction lesion, and Gocho et al. also reported the elimination of chest pain in patients with secondary infection of pulmonary infarction by anti-infection treatment, thus we inferred that the symptoms of chest pain in this case were improved before admission by levofloxacin through the treatment of secondary infection of pulmonary infarction.

The treatment of pulmonary cryptococcosis is determined by disease severity. This case was treated with fluconazole orally after discharge with mild clinical symptoms. In the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism, anticoagulation, thrombolysis and interventional therapy can be selected according to the risk stratification. Common oral anticoagulation drugs include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Warfarin is predominantly metabolized (> 80%) by Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), As fluconazole acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, their concomitant use elevates therisk of bleeding. However, rivaroxaban exhibits rapid absorption following oral administration, and has a reduced potential for drug-drug interactions, eliminating the need for International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring. Therefore, the patient was prescribed long-term oral rivaroxaban combined with fluconazole treatment following discharge. Given that both fluconazole and rivaroxaban are excreted in breast milk, this patient was advised to discontinue breastfeeding.

1.6 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.7 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.8 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Revumenib (Revuforj) [^a3046df8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warning or precaution regarding the use of revumenib PO (also known as Revuforj) and prolonged QT interval: maintain a high level of suspicion, as revumenib can cause QT prolongation. Obtain a baseline ECG and do not initiate treatment if QTc > 450 msec. Monitor ECG weekly for the first 4 weeks, then monthly, with more frequent monitoring in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, HF, electrolyte abnormalities, or concurrent QT-prolonging agents. Interrupt revumenib if QTc increases to 480–500 msec and resume at the same dose once QTc returns to ≤ 480 msec. Interrupt if QTc > 500 msec or increases by > 60 msec from baseline, and restart at a lower dose after QTc normalizes to ≤ 480 msec. For patients weighing ≥ 40 kg, restart at 160 mg BID (110 mg BID with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors). For patients weighing < 40 kg, restart at 95 mg/m² BID (65 mg/m² BID with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors). Permanently discontinue revumenib in cases of ventricular arrhythmias or QTc prolongation with life-threatening arrhythmia symptoms.

1.6 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients (18 years of age and older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1–5.13)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.7 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1–5.13)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.8 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^722aafbf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride IV (also known as Avelox, Moxeza, Vigamox):
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of moxifloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months of use, particularly in elderly adults. Use moxifloxacin in patients with a known aortic aneurysm or at risk of aortic aneurysms only when no alternative antibacterial treatments are available.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Decreased blood glucose, increased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, can cause both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
- **Photosensitivity of skin**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, can cause moderate-to-severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions. Advise avoiding excessive exposure to sun or UV light.
- **Severe adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions, vasculitis, serum sickness, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, AKI, hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hemolytic or aplastic anemia, and TTP.

### And antimicrobial resistance among the general female and male population in Northern Spain [^43062a8e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) STIs represent a global concern, especially considering its rapid ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of MG and antibiotic resistance among the general female and male populations in northern Spain.

Methods

Between April 2019 and May 2023, individuals attending healthcare facilities for STI screening were tested for MG and macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance mutations. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using single-locus sequence-based typing of the mgpB gene and complemented by dual-locus sequence-based typing combining the mgpB and MG309 genes.

Results

Of the 6350 people tested for MG during the study period, 5269 (83%) were women. Macrolide resistance mutations were identified in 25.4% of cases, with a higher prevalence in men (40% vs 17.14%) and coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis was found predominantly in women (18.6% vs 7.5%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct epidemiological clades strongly correlated with gender. Clade A predominantly involved men with higher rates of HIV and syphilis history and detection of resistance mutations, while clade B exclusively comprised women, with only one case of macrolide resistance.

Conclusions

The predominance of women in STI screening requests reflects local trends in screening patterns and underscores the importance of understanding MG infection in women in our region. The clear separation of clades suggests two independent sexual networks, with clade A representing a high-risk population and dense connectivity. This research provides a foundation for future studies on the prevalence, transmission dynamics and impact of MG infection, particularly among the female population, where understanding remains limited.

### QT interval prolongation in acute antipsychotic poisoning: systematic review and recommendations [^1802f82e]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotic medications are often associated with QT interval prolongation, which can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. However, unstable or significant dysrhythmic events are rare. Evidence-based recommendations on the assessment and management of poisoned patients at risk for QT interval prolongation are lacking. Current practice often involves costly and lengthy cardiac monitoring, leading to delayed disposition of the patient from emergency departments or prolonged monitoring times in other hospital units. To address this issue, the QT Interval Prolongation in Clinical Toxicology Workgroup was formed by the Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative to develop evidence-based recommendations for the management and treatment of QT interval prolongation in acute overdose patients. This article reports our findings on patients with antipsychotic poisoning.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature regarding QT interval prolongation in all acute overdoses was undertaken, and the evidence was summarized for antipsychotic medication overdose. Voting statements were drafted using a predetermined format for monitoring the QT interval and use of continuous cardiac monitoring. A two-round modified Delphi method was used to reach a consensus. The strength of consensus was measured using the disagreement index as defined by the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method.

Results

From the 327 articles that were included in the systematic review of QT interval prolongation in all acute overdoses, a total of 55 articles were relevant to antipsychotic medication-induced QT prolongation in acute overdose. Medications with more than three articles were reviewed individually for recommendations, whilst medications with less than three were grouped together for discussion as miscellaneous. Individual medication recommendations were made for amisulpride (15 articles), thioridazine (11 articles), ziprasidone (eight articles) and quetiapine (13 articles), whilst consensus statements based on limited data were made for acute ingestions of clozapine, haloperidol, iloperidone, pimozide, pipamperone, olanzapine and risperidone (14 articles in total). The electrocardiogram is suggested as a risk assessment tool for ingestion of all antipsychotic medication. We recommend continuous cardiac monitoring for patients ingesting more than amisulpride 2g, thioridazine 1g, and ziprasidone 3g. We suggest continuous cardiac monitoring for the above-mentioned medications for lower dose ingestions as well as for ingestions of haloperidol, iloperidone, pimozide and pipamperone. We do not suggest continuous cardiac monitoring for acute clozapine and risperidone poisoning, and do not recommend continuous cardiac monitoring for the QT interval in acute olanzapine or quetiapine poisoning. The need for ongoing cardiac monitoring should be guided by an individual risk assessment considering the medication and dose ingested, the time since ingestion, as well as other factors such as heart rate or co-ingestions.

Discussion

The quality of evidence for the risk of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes is heterogeneous among different antipsychotics and inherently constrains the recommendations. Available data suggest that amisulpride, thioridazine and ziprasidone are associated with QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes, while the risk is likely overstated for quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone. Ongoing research is needed to improve management strategies for acute antipsychotic overdose-induced QT interval prolongation and dysrhythmias.

Conclusions

The QT Interval Prolongation in Clinical Toxicology Workgroup recommends the use of screening electrocardiograms in all patients with acute antipsychotic medication overdose and cardiac monitoring in patients with at-risk overdoses from thioridazine, amisulpride, and ziprasidone. The QT Interval Prolongation in Clinical Toxicology Workgroup suggests the same approach for patients with overdoses of haloperidol, iloperidone, pipamperone and pimozide. The risk of torsade de pointes is likely overstated for acute antipsychotic medication overdose as a general class group, and concern should rather focus on a few specific medications.

### Genomic insights into antibiotic-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates from outpatients in minhang district in shanghai [^e3566388]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) causes tens of thousands of cases of diarrheal disease worldwide each year. However, our understanding of the genome and transmission dynamics of S. enterica in Minhang District in Shanghai, China is still insufficient. This study is aimed to better understand the population structure, antibiotic resistance patterns, and evolution dynamics of local strains.

Methods

We sequenced 458 S. enterica strains from outpatients at Minhang District Central Hospital in Shanghai, China, from 2012 to 2021. Bioinformatics analyses on antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, pathogenic islands, and phylogenetic relationships were performed.

Results

Here we show that two dominant serovars are S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium isolated from outpatients in Minhang District in Shanghai, China. A total of 40 serovars and 53 sequence types (STs) are identified, two S. Montevideo strains isolated in 2013 belong to a newly identified ST10844, which is firstly identified in Minhang District in Shanghai, China. More than half of the isolates show resistance to fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams. Notably, 259 (56.6%) of the 458 isolates exhibit a multidrug-resistant pattern. Third-generation cephalosporin resistance gene bla CTX-M-55 is identified in 15 (3.3%) isolates, and fluoroquinolone resistance gene qnrS1 is identified in 42 (9.2%) isolates, both of which are strongly correlated with IS 26. Mutations of T57S in ParC and D87Y in GyrA are observed in 149 (32.5%) and 133 (29.0%) isolates, respectively. In addition, phylogenetic analysis confirms the presence of outbreaks caused by S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, respectively.

Conclusions

These results suggest local expansion and evolution in Salmonella occurred in Shanghai, China, and the underlying emergence of the undefined multidrug-resistant clone. Our findings enlarge the knowledge of local epidemics of Salmonella, especially S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium in Shanghai, and provide a piece of useful baseline information for future whole-genome sequencing surveillance.

CONCLUSION

The epidemiologic patterns observed in our cohort are mostly reflecting the known pediatric MDR/RR-TB epidemiology and include young and clinically diagnosed children who are underrepresented in other studies. The regional disparities are more pronounced than expected and pose a major challenge to the national TB services. There is a need for further research to better understand local transmission patterns and health system and patient-centered challenges along the whole TB care cascade in areas disproportionately affected by pediatric MDR/RR-TB to inform clinical and programmatic management strategies.

### Candesartan cilexetil [^8ab4df4d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Adult Hypertension

Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan cilexetil can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan cilexetil.

Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg candesartan cilexetil in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with or without food.

If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan cilexetil alone, a diuretic may be added. Candesartan cilexetil may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age

Candesartan cilexetil may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate candesartan cilexetil under close medical supervision and consider administration of a lower dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Children 1 to < 6 years of age:

The dose range is 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg per day. The recommended starting dose is 0.20 mg/kg (oral suspension).

Children 6 to < 17 years of age:

For those less than 50 kg, the dose range is 2 to 16 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 4 to 8 mg.

For those greater than 50 kg, the dose range is 4 to 32 mg per day. The recommended starting dose is 8 to 16 mg.

Doses above 0.4 mg/kg (1 to < 6 year olds) or 32 mg (6 to < 17 year olds) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Invasive candidiasis in children with HIV — epidemiology, species, and resistance are summarized, noting that invasive candidiasis is less frequent than localized disease, but candidemia occurs in up to 12% of children with HIV infection who have chronic indwelling central venous catheters placed for administration of total parenteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. While Candida albicans remains the most common cause, approximately 50% of reported Candida bloodstream infections in children are caused by non-albicans Candida spp., and resistance patterns include that C. krusei is considered resistant to fluconazole, C. glabrata isolates have an increased rate of resistance to both fluconazole and voriconazole with an increasing number also resistant to echinocandins, and C. lusitaniae is inherently resistant to amphotericin B. In one study of Cambodian children with HIV infection and oral candidiasis, seven (78%) of nine isolated C. glabrata were resistant to fluconazole, and three (40%) of seven C. parapsilosis isolated were resistant to > 3 azole agents; clinicians should be aware of local resistance trends as the epidemiology of species-specific resistance may vary widely by geographic location and hospital.

Antimicrobial stewardship and the consideration of collateral damage in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) highlight rising resistance and drug-specific risks, noting, "In the past 20 years, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens has increased dramatically". The text states, "Fluoroquinolones have been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while broad spectrum cephalosporins have been linked to subsequent infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, ESBL–producing K. pneumoniae, β-lactam resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)". Stewardship adherence "may significantly mitigate increasing fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance", yet "Non-adherence to Guidelines for the treatment of acute cystitis, however, is more common in patients who have rUTIs than patients with an isolated episode of acute cystitis". Practices such as "lengthening the antimicrobial course, broadening antibiotic treatment, or increasing antibiotic doses" lack evidence and "have not been demonstrated to be efficacious and have the potential for harm", and "Providers should combine knowledge of the local antibiogram with the selection of antimicrobial agents with the least impact on normal vaginal and fecal flora", with an antibiogram described as providing "a profile of the local results of antimicrobial sensitivity testing", and aggregate results "usually annually, providing the percentage of a given organism sensitive to a particular antimicrobial".

### Multidrug-resistant Shigella flexneri outbreak affecting humans and non-human primates in new Mexico, USA [^ca825008]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We have described a multidrug-resistant outbreak of S. flexneri 2a involving different human populations and remarkably, non-human primates. This was one of the largest identified outbreaks of shigellosis in New Mexico, and the first large outbreak involving a multidrug-resistant strain. While we have not detected macrolide or extended-spectrum beta-lactam (ESBL) resistance in this outbreak, the fact that many Shigella isolates circulating in the United States, including in New Mexico, harbor these resistance genes warrants vigilant surveillance.

Outbreak Response

This outbreak impacted various groups, such as MSM, PEH, daycare attendees, and the general public. The use of genomic similarity to determine the outbreak allowed us to identify cases – e.g. in daycares, which did not share epidemiologic similarities to other cases in this outbreak. These cases would have been missed if we were relying on traditional epidemiological data. Due to the significant impact and severity of this outbreak — which accounted for 39.3% of all shigellosis cases in New Mexico during the period and led to a 69.8% hospitalization rate — the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) implemented aggressive measures, including establishing partnerships to ensure patient care for vulnerable groups, conducting thorough epidemiological investigations, and issuing local health alerts to inform clinical providers about the outbreak and the associated resistance patterns of the isolates. It is likely that the outbreak was much larger than reported cases, since not every Shigella case in NM has an associated isolate, which we used to define this outbreak. Additionally, care-seeking behavior among affected populations may vary. For example, the high hospitalization rate in PEH may stem from varied healthcare-seeking behavior, resulting in the detection of only severe cases.

The use of active public health surveillance through the FoodNet programs provided valuable data in a population notoriously difficult to interview. Collaborating with local nonprofits and community partners allowed for the development of trust and ability to provide care to vulnerable populations. Our results spurred direct public health action as our data alerted local clinicians and veterinarians to not treat shigellosis cases with fluoroquinolones, but rather to use macrolide antibiotics. Without the genomics data, it is likely that both the connectedness of these cases and the AMR patterns would have gone unrecognized.

### Perinatal urinary tract dilation: recommendations on pre-/ postnatal imaging, prophylactic antibiotics, and follow-up: clinical Report [^c84a3325]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) in high-risk urinary tract dilation (UTD) shows mixed benefit and resistance concerns; CAP prevented UTIs in patients with high-risk UTD with concomitant ureteral dilation ≥ 7 mm and VUR, whereas registry data showed no benefit for isolated UPJ-like hydronephrosis. Two meta-analyses calculated that CAP increased the odds of multidrug-resistant infection by 6.5 to 9 times. Some studies have shown circumcision to be an equally preventive alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of UTI in boys with UTD. Clinicians should therefore consider stopping antibiotic prophylaxis at 12 months of age, unless the child has VUR or ureteral dilation ≥ 7 mm. Amoxicillin is the primary antibiotic prescribed for UTI prophylaxis in the newborn in the United States; after 2 months of life, the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for prophylaxis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Before 2 months' corrected gestational age, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can cause bilirubin displacement leading to kernicterus. Nitrofurantoin is an equally effective prophylaxis and is excreted primarily in the urine and has poor tissue penetration thus decreasing impact on the gut microbiome. If a cephalosporin is chosen, the clinician should strongly consider using a first-generation cephalosporin as bacterial resistance remains low. A shared decision-making model that includes the benefits and risks of CAP should be discussed with the family prior to implementation of therapy. In general, the higher degree of suspicion for obstructive UTD, the more CAP benefits the patient and outweighs the inherent risk of developing an infection with a multidrug-resistant organism.

### Concomitant drug interactions with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are associated with bleeding and mortality risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^2f22e50a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and increases the risk of ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) has been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, its clinical efficacy and safety depend on achieving a sustained time in therapeutic range. In a real‐world setting, achieving a high percentage of time in the therapeutic range for warfarin is a challenge in many patients because warfarin interacts with a multitude of medications and is sensitive to dietary intake of vitamin K. More recently, non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have been increasingly prescribed as a preferred anticoagulant in NVAF as they have been shown to reduce stroke and systemic embolism by 19%, all‐cause mortality by 10%, and intracranial hemorrhage by 52% compared with warfarin. In addition, long‐term monitoring of drug level is not required, and there are fewer interactions with other medications.

Despite these advantages, the plasma level of NOACs and thus their anticoagulation effects can be affected by the concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P‐glycoprotein inhibitors. Retrospective studies from Canada demonstrated that > 4% of patients prescribed an NOAC also received medications that were classified as either contraindicated or cautious use, and said use was associated with increased mortality. Moreover, recent retrospective cohort studies from a Taiwan insurance database revealed an increased risk of major bleeding when an NOAC was prescribed concomitantly with amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin. Similarly, observational study from the United States and Belgium demonstrated higher bleeding risk when diltiazem was used in conjunction with NOACs. It remains unclear whether the increased mortality was related to the presence of coexistent underlying diseases that required these medications or attributable to fatal bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage consequent to a drug interaction. In this study, we performed a territory‐wide retrospective cohort study using the comprehensive electronic health record system in Hong Kong of patients with NVAF who were prescribed an NOAC to investigate the potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, hospitalization for major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality attributable to interaction with different concomitant medications.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Testosterone (testim) [^f1d78bff]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore may decrease insulin requirements in diabetic patients. (7.1)
Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens. More frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time is recommended in patients taking warfarin. (7.2)
Use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention. Use with caution, particularly in patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (7.3)

7.1 Insulin

Changes in insulin sensitivity or glycemic control may occur in patients treated with androgens. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, may necessitate a decrease in the dose of anti-diabetic medication.

7.2 Oral Anticoagulants

Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens, therefore more frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking warfarin, especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy.

7.3 Corticosteroids

The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention and requires careful monitoring particularly in patients with cardiac, renal or hepatic disease.

Data Source and Study Procedure

Patients were identified using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. The Hospital Authority is an institution that manages all public hospitals and outpatient clinics in Hong Kong and provides health care services to > 90% of the citizens. Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System is an internationally recognized electronic health record database with large population coverage, comprehensive clinical data, and excellent data quality, and has been used to conduct high‐quality pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Demographic data, including age and date of birth, and cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, were recorded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score is a composite score incorporating congestive heart failure, age, diabetes, stroke or systemic embolism, vascular disease, and sex category. The occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hospitalization for major bleeding attributable to intracranial hemorrhage and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and all‐cause mortality, was extracted. Gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated because previous randomized controlled trials demonstrated NOAC patients are at high risk of developing the adverse event than those taking warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small and large bowels was included in this study, with details on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), codes used listed in Table S1.

Concomitant medications with possible drug‐drug interaction with NOACs listed in the 2021 European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation were extracted from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System using the British National Formulary classification, as follows: antiarrhythmic (amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, dronedarone, and verapamil), antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, trazodone, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, dosulepin, nortriptyline, and bupropion), antimicrobial (clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole), and atorvastatin. Flecainide and β‐blockers, which are not expected to have drug‐drug interaction with NOAC, were included in the analysis as control groups.

### Visceral fat and body fat as risk factors for methotrexate toxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma [^852da591]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is essential for treating lymphoblastic leukemia, but high doses (5 g/m² corporal surface) can cause significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and hematological toxicity. Body composition, particularly high body fat mass, can function as a third space and may increase toxicity by prolonging the drug's circulation time.

Aim

To analyze the associations between body composition (body fat mass, visceral fat area, and skeletal muscle mass) and the incidence of MTX toxicity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma.

Materials and Methods

A cohort of patients aged 6–18 years diagnosed with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma who received high-dose MTX without prior toxicity was included. Patients with preexisting renal failure or liver failure before MTX administration were excluded. Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioimpedance device.

Results

Regarding MTX toxicity, 30.2% of events occurred early, and this figure increased to 58.7% for late toxicity. Patients with a visceral fat area (VFA) ≥ 47 cm² had a significantly higher risk of late toxicity (RR 2.8 (1.3–5.5), p = 0.01), as did those with high body fat mass (RR 2.0 (1.1–3.4), p = 0.01). For severe late toxicity, a VFA ≥ 47 cm² was strongly correlated (RR 5.6 (1.3–22.6), p = 0.003), and high body fat mass remained a significant risk factor (RR 2.3 (1.03–5.5), p = 0.03). No significant associations were found with low phase angle, low skeletal muscle index, or overweight body mass index.

Conclusion

A VFA ≥ 47 cm 2 and a high percentage of body fat mass were associated with an increased risk of late MTX toxicity and severe late toxicity.
