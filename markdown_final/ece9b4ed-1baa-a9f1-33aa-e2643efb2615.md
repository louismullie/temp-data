## Question

What about erythema multiforme?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about erythema multiforme, including its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, triggers, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, special populations, and controversies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classification. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and epidemiology. Next, I will review clinical features and the diagnostic approach, including how to distinguish EM from SJS/TEN and urticaria. After that, I need to check the workup for triggers, especially HSV and Mycoplasma. Then, I will examine management strategies, including symptomatic care, antivirals, antibiotics, and when to consider systemic steroids or immunomodulators. I should also consider pediatric nuances and prognosis. Finally, I will synthesize controversies and outline a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any claims that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't misstate the entity. Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated mucocutaneous disorder characterized by target lesions with three concentric zones and a predilection for acral sites; it is classically divided into EM minor, with minimal or single-mucosal involvement, and EM major, with severe involvement of two or more mucosal surfaces, although newer frameworks emphasize severity-based categorization rather than minor/major labels, which I should keep in mind to avoid outdated terminology [^c74becdc] [^46d4ef5a].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The leading model is a cell-mediated immune reaction triggered by antigens, most commonly HSV DNA fragments persisting in keratinocytes, with autoreactive T cells attacking HSV antigen–expressing epidermal cells; this explains recurrence with HSV reactivation and the limited benefit of antivirals during acute flares, as the immune cascade is already underway [^e3755148] [^20ebc79f]. Hold on, I should verify the role of Mycoplasma as well; M. pneumoniae is a major trigger, particularly in children and adolescents, and can produce severe mucositis sometimes labeled MIRM/RIME, which overlaps clinically with EM but may represent a related parainfectious entity rather than classic EM, so I must be cautious in labeling these cases [^6b85e263] [^23ffbda4].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. EM affects predominantly young adults, with an estimated prevalence around 0.01–1% and a female predominance in some series; infections are the most common triggers overall, with HSV leading and M. pneumoniae prominent in pediatrics, while drugs account for a minority of bona fide EM cases, and many cases remain idiopathic despite workup [^d61f85c4] [^c401c7be] [^c7dc879d]. Wait, let me verify the drug proportion; yes, contemporary data suggest only about 6% of evaluable pharmacovigilance reports meet criteria for probable drug-induced EM, underscoring how often SJS/TEN are misclassified as EM in databases [^c7dc879d].

> I will now examine clinical presentation. Typical EM shows symmetric, acral, raised target lesions with three zones and evolve over days, often with burning or pruritus; mucosal involvement in EM major can be severe, with oral erosions impairing intake and ocular disease risking scarring, so I should confirm mucosal sites at every visit and escalate care if pain limits feeding or if there is ocular involvement [^c74becdc] [^7ee70d5b] [^bdfd6aa5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about distribution; while acral predominance is classic, M. pneumoniae–associated eruptions can be more truncal and bullous, so I need to integrate morphology with trigger probability and seasonality [^23ffbda4].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach and differential. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, anchored by target lesions and distribution; biopsy can support interface dermatitis but has overlap with SJS/TEN and RIME, so I should correlate with lesion morphology and evolution rather than rely on histology alone [^d4c366a2] [^6b85e263]. I should double-check for mimics: urticaria multiforme presents with transient, migratory annular plaques that resolve within 24 hours, whereas EM lesions are fixed for at least 7 days; SJS/TEN typically shows flat atypical targets or purpuric macules with epidermal detachment and a different risk profile, so I need to document lesion evolution and mucosal severity carefully [^f6981087] [^3d53409b] [^f417a8e7].

> Next, I should review the trigger workup. For suspected HSV-associated EM, HSV PCR from lesional swabs or serology can be informative, but I must remember that HSV may not be detectable during active EM because the immune attack clears virus; nonetheless, documenting HSV serostatus helps guide prophylaxis for recurrences [^b4a46f6c] [^20ebc79f]. For suspected M. pneumoniae, I should obtain respiratory PCR and serology, and maintain a low threshold to treat with macrolides given the potential for severe mucositis and respiratory sequelae, even if pneumonia is not overt [^198f67db] [^23ffbda4]. But wait, what if the patient is on immunotherapy or has atypical features? In that scenario, I should broaden the differential and consider drug-induced SCARs and RIME, coordinating with oncology or infectious diseases as needed [^0abc6aa7] [^6b85e263].

> I will now examine management principles. For a first acute episode, the cornerstone is supportive care: topical corticosteroids for pruritus, oral antihistamines, analgesia including topical anesthetics for oral pain, hydration support, and meticulous mucosal care; I should confirm ocular involvement early and arrange urgent ophthalmology if present to prevent scarring [^d5c138a6] [^98af9e4a] [^13580ffa] [^bdfd6aa5]. Hold on, I should verify the role of systemic corticosteroids in acute EM; evidence is limited and mixed, so steroids are not routine for uncomplicated EM, though they may be considered in severe mucosal disease for symptom control while acknowledging uncertainty and the need for randomized data [^d3a99cf6] [^0f4300a2].

> For recurrent HSV-associated EM, I need to ensure continuous antiviral prophylaxis is offered. Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily, valacyclovir 500 mg daily to twice daily, or famciclovir 250 mg twice daily for 6–12 months reduces recurrence, and responders often require 1–2 years before attempting discontinuation; if recurrences persist, I should escalate dosing or switch agents and consider combination strategies in refractory cases [^bcf7c0f8] [^20ebc79f]. Wait, let me verify alternatives when antivirals fail; small series support dapsone, thalidomide, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIG, and more recently JAK inhibitors such as upadacitinib, but I should counsel on risks and off-label status and individualize decisions given limited-quality evidence [^20ebc79f] [^e3755148] [^485d0c2e].

> For M. pneumoniae–associated EM or RIME, I should confirm the diagnosis and start macrolide therapy promptly, as antibiotics can modify the course and reduce mucosal injury; supportive care remains essential, and I should monitor for respiratory involvement even if cough is mild or absent [^198f67db] [^23ffbda4]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating RIME with SJS/TEN; RIME typically has prominent mucositis with limited skin detachment and a better prognosis, so distinguishing features and trigger-directed therapy are key to avoiding overtreatment [^6b85e263].

> I need to ensure pediatric-specific issues are addressed. In children, M. pneumoniae and HSV are leading triggers, and vaccines can rarely precipitate EM; infants are exceptionally rare presentations, so I should confirm the diagnosis carefully and avoid overcalling urticaria multiforme as EM in the ED, which is a common pitfall [^75ea147b] [^6d5d42fc]. Let me reconsider recurrence patterns; pediatric recurrent EM often responds to antiviral prophylaxis when HSV is implicated, but responses vary and some require immunomodulators, so longitudinal follow-up and trigger surveillance are important [^da66cc39].

> Next, I should review prognosis and sequelae. Most EM cases resolve within 2–4 weeks without scarring, but severe mucosal involvement, especially ocular, can leave permanent sequelae; recurrent EM is common with HSV, and persistent EM, though rare, may require prolonged immunosuppression and specialist input [^bdf459d4] [^7ee70d5b] [^20ebc79f]. I should double-check that I've emphasized ocular risk and the need for early ophthalmology, as this is a critical preventable morbidity [^bdfd6aa5].

> Let me synthesize controversies and uncertainties so I don't overstate certainties. The minor versus major dichotomy is being replaced by severity-based frameworks; the role of systemic corticosteroids in acute severe EM remains unsettled and should be individualized; and the relationship between EM, MIRM/RIME, and SJS/TEN continues to evolve, requiring clinicians to integrate morphology, distribution, triggers, and histology rather than rely on rigid categories [^46d4ef5a] [^d3a99cf6] [^6b85e263]. I should confirm that ongoing research, including RCTs of systemic steroids and JAK inhibitors, may refine management in the near future [^0f4300a2].

> Finally, I should outline a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Suspect EM with symmetric acral target lesions; confirm morphology and mucosal involvement; exclude SJS/TEN by evolution and detachment; search for HSV with PCR/serology and for M. pneumoniae with PCR/serology; treat supportively with topical steroids, antihistamines, analgesia, and ocular care; give macrolides if M. pneumoniae is suspected; and for recurrences, initiate continuous antivirals and escalate to immunomodulators if refractory, all while coordinating specialty care as indicated [^c74becdc] [^198f67db] [^bcf7c0f8] [^20ebc79f]. Hold on, I should verify that I've integrated the key red flags: severe oral pain limiting intake, ocular involvement, and extensive erosions warrant closer monitoring, hydration support, and early specialty referral to mitigate complications [^d3a99cf6] [^bdfd6aa5].

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an **acute, immune-mediated eruption** characterized by target lesions on the extremities and occasional mucosal involvement [^c74becdc]. It is most often triggered by **HSV or Mycoplasma pneumoniae**, with drugs less commonly implicated [^c401c7be] [^c7dc879d]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by histology showing interface dermatitis; management is supportive, with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for symptoms, and antiviral prophylaxis for recurrent HSV-associated EM [^d5c138a6] [^98af9e4a] [^bcf7c0f8]. EM is self-limited and usually resolves in 2–4 weeks, but severe mucosal disease can cause significant morbidity; **urgent ophthalmology referral is required for ocular involvement** to prevent sequelae [^bdf459d4] [^bdfd6aa5].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Lesions**: Typical target lesions with three concentric zones (dark center, lighter ring, outer erythema), symmetric on extensor surfaces of extremities; mucosal involvement (oral, ocular, genital) in EM major [^c74becdc] [^5eecd623].
- **Symptoms**: Pruritus, burning, pain with mucosal erosions; systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) in severe cases [^b4bd4229].
- **Course**: Acute onset, self-limited, resolving in 2–4 weeks; recurrent in ~20%, often HSV-related [^bdf459d4] [^20ebc79f].

---

## Etiology and triggers

- **Infections**: HSV (most common), M. pneumoniae, EBV, CMV, hepatitis viruses, orf, SARS-CoV-2 [^c401c7be] [^6b85e263].
- **Drugs**: Less common; sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, allopurinol, TNF inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors [^c7dc879d] [^0abc6aa7].
- **Other**: Vaccines, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, idiopathic cases [^c401c7be] [^d4c366a2].

---

## Pathophysiology

EM is a **hypersensitivity reaction** with immune complex deposition and T-cell–mediated keratinocyte injury; HSV-associated EM involves HSV DNA in lesions, supporting a viral trigger mechanism [^e3755148] [^b4a46f6c].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical**: Based on typical target lesions, distribution, and mucosal involvement [^c74becdc].
- **Histopathology**: Interface dermatitis, vacuolar degeneration, necrotic keratinocytes, dermal lymphocytic infiltrate [^notfound].
- **Differential**: SJS/TEN (flat atypical targets, > 10% detachment), urticaria (transient, non-fixed), vasculitis, fixed drug eruption, viral exanthems [^f417a8e7] [^3d53409b].

---

## Management

- **Supportive care**: Topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, analgesics, hydration, soft diet, oral hygiene [^d5c138a6] [^98af9e4a] [^d3a99cf6].
- **HSV-associated EM**: Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily; valacyclovir or famciclovir alternatives; treat for 6–12 months, then reassess [^bcf7c0f8] [^20ebc79f].
- **M. pneumoniae-associated EM**: Macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin) [^198f67db].
- **Severe mucosal disease**: Hospitalization, IV fluids, pain control, ophthalmology consult for ocular involvement [^bdfd6aa5] [^d3a99cf6].
- **Refractory/recurrent EM**: Dapsone, thalidomide, mycophenolate, IVIG, JAK inhibitors (e.g. upadacitinib) in select cases [^20ebc79f] [^e3755148].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Most cases resolve without sequelae; **severe mucosal involvement** can cause pain, dysphagia, dehydration, and ocular scarring. Recurrence is common with HSV, and persistent EM may occur with ongoing triggers or immunologic drivers [^bdf459d4] [^20ebc79f].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric EM is often infection-triggered (**M. pneumoniae**, HSV) and may require hospitalization for pain control and hydration; **immunocompromised patients** have a broader differential and may need aggressive management and specialist input [^75ea147b] [^be26c8b7].

---

EM is a **self-limited, immune-mediated eruption** with characteristic target lesions; identify and treat triggers, provide supportive care, and use antiviral prophylaxis for HSV-associated recurrences. Early recognition and appropriate management — especially for ocular involvement — are essential to minimize morbidity [^bdf459d4] [^bdfd6aa5].

The following constitutes key background information on erythema multiforme:

- **Definition**: Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by the presence of distinctive target lesions on the skin (primarily in acral regions) and/or mucous membranes.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology of erythema multiforme is not fully understood, but it is believed to be an immune reaction triggered by various factors. Infections, particularly HSV, are the most common triggers. Other viruses, such as HCV, Coxsackievirus, and EBV, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, certain medications, and vaccines have also been implicated.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of erythema multiforme is believed to be 0.01–1% annually, most commonly affecting individuals aged 18–30 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for erythema multiforme include infections, especially HSV, and exposure to certain medications. However, in many cases, no specific trigger or risk factor can be identified.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, erythema multiforme presents with symmetrically distributed target lesions on the extremities and trunk. These lesions are characterized by concentric zones of color change. The severity of erythema multiforme can vary widely, from mild forms with only skin involvement to severe forms that affect multiple mucous membranes and can be life-threatening.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for erythema multiforme is generally favorable. Most cases are self-limiting and resolve within weeks to months without long-term complications.

### Erythema multiforme: recognition and management [^5eecd623]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated reaction that involves the skin and sometimes the mucosa. Classically described as target-like, the erythema multiforme lesions can be isolated, recurrent, or persistent. Most commonly, the lesions of erythema multiforme present symmetrically on the extremities (especially on extensor surfaces) and spread centripetally. Infections, especially herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and medications constitute most of the causes of erythema multiforme; immunizations and autoimmune diseases have also been linked to erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme can be differentiated from urticaria by the duration of individual lesions. Erythema multiforme lesions are typically fixed for a minimum of seven days, whereas individual urticarial lesions often resolve within one day. Erythema multiforme can be confused with the more serious condition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome; however, Stevens-Johnson syndrome usually contains widespread erythematous or purpuric macules with blisters. The management of erythema multiforme involves symptomatic treatment with topical steroids or antihistamines and treating the underlying etiology, if known. Recurrent erythema multiforme associated with the herpes simplex virus should be treated with prophylactic antiviral therapy. Severe mucosal erythema multiforme can require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and repletion of electrolytes.

### Erythema multiforme [^86eb1da9]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a skin condition considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to infections or drugs. It consists of a polymorphous eruption of macules, papules, and characteristic "target" lesions that are symmetrically distributed with a propensity for the distal extremities. There is minimal mucosal involvement. Management involves treating the existing infectious agent or discontinuing the causal drug. Mild cases resolve without sequelae and do not require treatment. Recurrent cases have been prevented with continuous acyclovir. Patients who have no response to acyclovir may have a response to valacyclovir or famcilovir, which have greater oral bioavailability and more convenient dosing. Patients with recurrent erythema multiforme despite suppressive antiviral therapy should be referred to a dermatologist for further treatment.

### Persistent erythema multiforme treated with thalidomide [^fcb57448]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a common self-limited disorder that predominantly affects younger individuals. It is characterized by typical iris or target lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. Three clinical subgroups of erythema multiforme have been identified: classical erythema multiforme, recurrent erythema multiforme, and persistent erythema multiforme. By definition, persistent erythema multiforme is characterized by the occurrence of continuous typical and atypical lesions without interruption. We report a 15-year-old boy who developed persistent erythema multiforme for 6 months and responded to treatment with thalidomide.

Summary

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected, alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need of antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment and will be detailed in this review as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Current perspectives on erythema multiforme [^d4c366a2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Recognition and timely adequate treatment of erythema multiforme remain a major challenge. In this review, current diagnostic guidelines, potential pitfalls, and modern/novel treatment options are summarized with the aim to help clinicians with diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. The diagnosis of erythema multiforme, that has an acute, self-limiting course, is based on its typical clinical picture of targetoid erythematous lesions with predominant acral localization as well as histological findings. Clinically, erythema multiforme can be differentiated into isolated cutaneous and combined mucocutaneous forms. Atypical erythema multiforme manifestations include lichenoid or granulomatous lesions as well as lesional infiltrates of T cell lymphoma and histiocytes. Herpes simplex virus infection being the most common cause, other infectious agents like-especially in children-Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis C virus, Coxsackie virus, and Epstein Barr virus may also trigger erythema multiforme. The second most frequently identified cause of erythema multiforme is drugs. In different studies, e.g., allopurinol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid, antibacterial sulfonamides, penicillins, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, tetracyclines, chlormezanone, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, as well as different TNF-α inhibitors such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept were reported as possible implicated drugs. Recently, cases of erythema multiforme associated with vaccination, immunotherapy for melanoma, and even with topical drugs like imiquimod have been described. In patients with recurrent herpes simplex virus-associated erythema multiforme, the topical prophylactic treatment with acyclovir does not seem to prevent further episodes of erythema multiforme. In case of resistance to one virostatic drug, the switch to an alternative drug, and in patients non-responsive to virostatic agents, the use of dapsone as well as new treatment options, e.g. JAK-inhibitors or apremilast, might be considered.

### Dapsone in the treatment of persistent erythema multiforme [^474071ec]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is usually an acute and self-limited inflammatory reaction of the skin and mucous membranes. Attacks may be sporadic or recurrent, and generally last for 1 to 3 weeks. Rarely, an episode of EM may fail to abate. This continuous and uninterrupted occurrence of typical and atypical lesions is known as persistent EM. We present a case responsive to dapsone.

### Confusion in determination of two types of cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs, maculopapular eruption and erythema multiforme, among the experts: a proposal of standardized terminology [^81d75252]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical classification of cutaneous adverse reactions by drugs should be clearly distinguished to avoid conceptual confusion and inconsistency. Although dermatologists appear to have established a roughly common consensus for cutaneous adverse reactions, some types are more rigorously defined than other, possibly misleading classifications. To assess the consensus on the clinical classifications, we investigated the concordance rate of diagnosis by Japanese experts through a snap visual inspection of various clinical pictures exhibiting erythema multiforme and maculopapular eruption types of cutaneous adverse reactions. The experts were shown images on a screen and were then asked to decide whether to classify cases as maculopapular eruption or erythema multiforme type, and the concordance rates were calculated. Overall, the mean concordance rate was 71.6% (standard deviation, 17.3%), and only 33.8% of cases had a 90% or more concordance rate. Our study shows that the determinations of erythema multiforme and maculopapular eruption types by the existing classification criteria were confusing even among experts, which prompted us to standardize the terminology. We propose clinically defining erythema multiforme type as generalized macules mainly of 1 cm or more with a tendency of elevation and coalescence, and maculopapular eruption type as generalized erythema other than erythema multiforme type. Currently, the clinical definitions of cutaneous adverse reactions are poorly described, which may be problematic upon analyzing large volumes of data. Our proposal for a new terminology will enhance the accuracy and consistency of information for the correct analysis of cutaneous adverse reactions.

Introduction

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, (MP), and less commonly other agents such as Poxviruses and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Coronavirus 2(although some EM remain "idiopathic: see below). Epidemiological data of EM are scarce. The estimated prevalence ranges between 0.01% and 1%.EM predominantly affects young adults, with a female preponderance, having a worldwide distribution without any ethnic predilection. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by raised acral target lesions on the skin with sometimes mucous membranes involvement, causing significant morbidity, impaired food intake, acute pain, hospitalization, and possible long-term sequelae. The treatment is mainly symptomatic and the use of systemic corticosteroids remains debated. The objective of this review is to detail a pragmatic approach to EM, focusing on the identification of triggers, red flags and management, providing a roadmap for future research. New concepts regarding nosology and severity will be provided as well.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

On October 10th, 2023, search strategy and selection criteria data for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and references from relevant article using the following combination of search terms: "erythema multiforme" OR "EM" OR "Mycoplasma pneumonia induced rash and mucositis" OR MIRM OR "Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption" OR RIME. Candidate studies including brief reports and case reports were reviewed and articles about erythema multiforme, published only in English or French, were selected based on titles and abstracts. Abstracts and reports from meetings were included only when they related directly to previously published work. These candidate studies were obtained and read in full. Articles about drug-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, narrative reviews without any clinical patient data, and editorials were excluded (Fig. 1). The following data was obtained for analysis: triggers of EM, type of EM (minor or major), mucosal involvement, workup, histology findings, management strategies, mucosal sequelae and recurrence of the EM.

Nosology and definitions

Nosology

The first description of EM was reported by von Hebra in 1866 who described skin-limited lesions primarily localized on the extremities with a tendency to recur. In 1983, Hoff et al. proposed the separation between EM "minor" and EM "major".EM minor was defined as acute, self-limited, or episodic, symmetrically distributed, annular concentric erythematous skin lesions with absent mucosal lesions or lesions limited to 1 mucosal surface, while EM major had the same skin manifestations but with a more severe mucosal involvement, affecting two or more mucosal surfaces. Instead of the minor/major classification, categorization of EM according to severity is proposed to better guide the management. EM would be defined as severe or non-severe based on the degree of mucous membrane involvement. In severe EM, at least one mucous membrane would be heavily affected, e.g. oral mucosal involvement impairing food intake, with pain requiring opioid analgesics.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme: a therapeutic proposal for a chronic disease [^485d0c2e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recurrent erythema multiforme is a chronic relapsing disease that represents a therapeutic challenge. Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics and therapeutic response of patients with recurrent erythema multiforme and suggest a therapeutic protocol. We included patients with recurrent erythema multiforme diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2019. Clinical symptoms and a positive serology for herpes simplex virus were the inclusion criteria to initiate acyclovir in monotherapy or a combined treatment with dapsone, thalidomide, or immunosuppressants in refractory cases. Thirty-five patients were included and 71.4% were female. The median disease onset age was 35.7 years and the mean follow-up was 7.58 years. The skin was the most affected site (91.4%). Herpes simplex virus immunoglobulin (Ig)G serology was positive in 91.1% of cases. Acyclovir treatment was used in 33 of 35 patients, and complete remission was achieved in 22 of 33 after the first therapeutic course; 16 of 22 relapsed and required a second acyclovir cycle. Combined treatment with dapsone was required in nine of 33 due to partial response to acyclovir; thalidomide was an adjuvant drug in four of 33 due to adverse effects to dapsone. After the first cycle of acyclovir with or without combined therapy, 19 of 33 patients relapsed and received 2–6 additional cycles. Our results suggest that recurrent erythema multiforme presents a good response to acyclovir in monotherapy or in combined therapy with dapsone or thalidomide in the majority of patients. We propose a long-term therapeutic protocol to enable disease remission.

### Erythema multiforme due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in two children [^9dd36883]. Pediatric Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important and highly relevant cause of bullous erythema multiforme, isolated mucositis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome in children. In this article, we present two children with respiratory Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and associated cutaneous findings within the spectrum of erythema multiforme. We review the literature associating these three entities with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and discuss controversies regarding the classification of erythema multiforme, as well as update reported infectious causes of the bullous form. Many understand the erythema multiforme spectrum to include bullous erythema multiforme, mucositis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the order of increasing severity. We feel that this relationship should be reconsidered to help better understand the prognosis and outcomes. It is our opinion that bullous erythema multiforme is a separate, yet related condition that can occur in the context of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. With many similarities to mucositis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous erythema multiforme can be considered part of a spectrum of disease that includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Unlike mucositis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous erythema multiforme caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection has low morbidity for the child. Mycoplasma pneumoniae-associated mucositis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome seem to occur along a spectrum with separate prognosis and potential pathogenesis compared with bullous erythema multiforme. Making the distinction between these conditions is valuable for predicting the child's prognosis. Patients who develop symptoms consistent with these conditions should be appropriately evaluated for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and closely monitored.

### Lamotrigine-induced erythema multiforme mimicking contact dermatitis [^da82382a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an acute, hypersensitivity reaction of the skin often secondary to medications. Lamotrigine is a relatively new anticonvulsant medication approved for seizure and psychiatric disorders. Although the overall incidence of cutaneous reactions to lamotrigine is high, the incidence of serious eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis is low. Vigilant surveillance for any cutaneous eruption in patients on lamotrigine is important, particularly in the first 8 weeks, as prompt discontinuation of the medication can prevent progression. We report a case of erythema multiforme secondary to lamotrigine, which clinically resembled a contact dermatitis, and review the management of lamotrigine associated cutaneous eruptions.

### Erythema multiforme [^0f4300a2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

EM is a well-defined entity, with typical and atypical cutaneous and mucous manifestations that can sometimes be severe, warranting hospitalization. Various triggers, mainly HSV and MP, have been linked to EM. EM can affect adults as well as the pediatric population. Prompt recognition and early intervention are critical, hence the importance of increasing awareness among general practitioners, emergency physicians, pediatricians as well as intensivists. The curative role of SCS in severe EM is not determined yet. Recurrent persistent EM is a challenge and should be referred to specialized dermatologists. Further studies are needed to shed light on the molecular pathways behind the different mucocutaneous eruptions associated with MP, and the role of Jak-inhibitors in the management of EM.

Outstanding questions

This review provides a roadmap for future research, as many outstanding questions remain unanswered.

A large validation of the definitions of EM, e.g. severe vs non severe, EP vs MIRM/RIME, drug-related EM, atypical EM vs typical EM, oral mucosal EM would be very helpful.

MP was associated with EM/RIME and true SJS/TEN. Molecular analysis is warranted to determine whether the pathophysiological pathway is common or different in these entities. Further research is needed to shed light on the mechanisms implicated in MP-induced EM vs MP-induced TEN.

More evidence is needed to clarify the mechanisms of the highly variable frequency of outbreaks ranging from once in a lifetime to multiple/continuous recurrences.

A RCT evaluating the value of SCS in severe EM is mandatory.

Jak-inhibitor have been proven efficient in case-series. Larger prospective trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of Jak-inhibitors in the treatment of recurrent EM.

### Erythema multiforme associated with… [^da9a73db]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute self-limited but potentially recurrent skin condition. It is characterized by typical or atypical target lesions and may include mucosal lesions.EM major includes severe mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms, such as fever and joint pain, while these features are typically absent from EM minor. The most common causes of EM are herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Several other viral, bacterial, and, rarely, fungal infections have been reported in association with EM. We present the first case in the literature, to our knowledge, of EM associated with Entamoeba histolytica infection, a parasitic infection that causes diarrhea and mild abdominal pain.

### Erythema multiforme in a 25-day old neonate [^65fc32be]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an acute, self-limiting, mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction characterized by distinctive target lesions. Most cases have been attributed to infection. Erythema multiforme occurs mainly in young adults and is extremely rare during the neonatal period. We report a 25-day-old girl who presented with target skin lesions on both the palms and soles with no other associated symptoms. She had no remarkable maternal, birth, or past medical history. Complete blood count, urinalysis, chest radiography, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers revealed no abnormalities. Pathologic examination showed vacuolar interface change and dyskeratotic cells in the epidermis consistent with erythema multiforme. This unusual case emphasizes the importance of recognizing diagnostic clues in examining patients. Even in the presence of uncharacteristic factors, the typical target lesions of erythema multiforme are distinctive.

### Idiopathic erythema multiforme: evidence of underlying Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription activation and successful treatment with tofacitinib [^89c794a1]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, typically self-limited mucocutaneous eruption characterized by distinctive target lesions. In a subset of patients, EM has a more chronic course, with recurrent episodes or even persistent disease. In some of these patients, EM is related to chronic infections, most commonly herpes simplex virus (HSV), and will respond to antiviral therapy. However, in up to 58% of patients, the etiology is unknown, and in these cases treatment is often difficult.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme: clinical characteristics, etiologic associations, and treatment in a series of 48 patients at mayo clinic, 2000 to 2007 [^8f6d5a53]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent erythema multiforme (EM) is a condition of substantial morbidity. Our efforts toward the etiologic attribution and treatment of recurrent EM have been less fruitful than those previously described.

Objective

We sought to further characterize clinical characteristics, etiologic associations, and treatment of recurrent EM.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with recurrent EM seen between 2000 and 2007.

Results

Of 48 patients (mean age at disease onset, 36.4 years), 28 (58%) were female (mean duration of recurrent EM, 6 years). Thirty (63%) patients had oral involvement. Herpes simplex virus caused recurrent EM in 11 (23%) patients, and the cause remained unknown in 28 (58%). In all, 37 (77%) patients received systemic corticosteroids, 33 (69%) received continuous antiviral treatment, and 23 (48%) used immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents. Sixteen of 33 patients receiving continuous antiviral treatment had either partial or complete disease suppression. Patients had varied responses to immunosuppressants, with mycophenolate mofetil providing partial or complete response in 6 of 8 patients. Features of recalcitrant cases included clinicians' inability to identify a specific cause, lack of improvement with continuous antiviral therapy, severe oral involvement, extensive corticosteroid therapy, and immunosuppressive therapy (two or more agents).

Limitation

This study is retrospective.

Conclusions

More than half of patients in this study did not have an identifiable cause for recurrent EM, and herpes simplex virus was found less frequently than reported in previous studies. Response to systemic treatments, including continuous antivirals and immunosuppressants, was varied and often times suboptimal.

### Triggers, clinical manifestations, and management of pediatric erythema multiforme: a systematic review [^75ea147b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute inflammatory mucocutaneous condition. EM is rarely described in children and infants.

Objective

To investigate the triggers, clinical manifestations, and treatment of pediatric EM.

Methods

Systematic literature review of pediatric EM.

Results

After full-text article review, we included 113 articles, representing 580 patients. The mean age was 5.6 years, ranging 0.1–17 years. Infectious agents were the main triggers: herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 104 patients (17.9%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 91 patients (15.7%). In total, 140 cases (24.1%) were drug-related and 89 cases (15.3%) had other triggers, such as vaccines (19 patients, 3.2%). In total, 229 patients had EM major (39.5%). Treatment was supportive care only (180 patients, 31.1%), systemic corticosteroids (115 patients, 19.8%), antivirals (85 patients, 14.6%), and antibiotics (66 patients, 11.3%), mostly macrolides (45 patients, 7.7%). Long-term sequelae were rare (1.3%). Pediatric EM was reported in 19 infants (3.2%). The main trigger was vaccination (9 patients). Infantile EM was EM major in 2 cases and EM minor in 17. Infants were less prone to develop EM major than older children (P < .01). Pediatric EM was recurrent in 83 cases (14.3%), which was triggered by HSV in 36 patients (61%). Recurrence affected older children.

Limitations

Potential confusion between Steven Johnson syndrome and EM major in addition to publication bias.

Conclusion

Pediatric EM is a rare disease, mainly triggered by infections. This condition can affect all mucosal surfaces, most commonly the oral mucosae. The diagnosis is clinical, and management relies on supportive care. Vaccines are a particular trigger in infants. Recurrent cases are most commonly linked to HSV. Dermatologists and pediatricians should be aware of this potentially recurrent and severe condition.

### Successful management of recurrent erythema multiforme with upadacitinib: a case report [^495989f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent erythema multiforme (EM) is a treatment challenge. We present a case of recurrent EM, refractory to numerous systemic agents, which cleared and remained clear upon initiation of upadacitinib.

EM is an uncommon acute, immune-mediated mucocutaneous condition that manifests as distinctive target-like lesions. EM is most commonly caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The diagnosis of EM is clinical, as there is significant histopathologic overlap between this entity and other mucocutaneous eruptions, such as reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME). EM, as well as RIME, may follow a recurrent or persistent course.

Clinically, EM presents as targetoid lesions with concentric color variation. It is usually distributed on the extensor surfaces of the extremities in a bilateral symmetric fashion. Mucosal involvement, typically in the oral mucosa, is common. Patients generally do not exhibit systemic symptoms.

### In the pursuit of classifying severe cutaneous adverse reactions [^f417a8e7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

We suggest adding an additional type of lesion to the existing 4 types of lesions of the erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), namely "flat typical target" and call the original typical targets "raised typical target". The EM group would consist of raised typical targets and raised atypical targets, similar to the original definition, and the SJS/TEN group would consist of flat typical targets, flat atypical targets and macules with or without blisters. In our proposed modified classification (Table 1), all the lesions that are found in the EM group are raised, whereas all lesions that characterize the SJS/TEN group are flat, even though they have blisters on them.

### Clinical presentation… [^89d827f7]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an acute, self-limited, and sometimes recurring skin condition considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections and medications. 4An often-cited study from 1993 proposed a useful clinical classification of erythema multiforme, SJS, and TEN based on the pattern of individual skin lesions and the estimation of body surface area with detachment of the epidermis at the worst stage of the disease of early erythema multiforme includes drug eruption, polymorphic light eruption, urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, viral exanthems, and other hypersensitivity reactions. 32Because erythema multiforme often resembles urticaria at the onset of the eruption, it is important to distinguish the clinical features.

The individual lesions of erythema multiforme in typical cases are present and fixed for at least one week, and some evolve into target lesions. 33In contrast, the individual lesions of urticaria exist at the same site for less than 24 hours, 8and the centers of the lesions appear normal or as red as the borders.

### Detection and genotyping of human herpes simplex viruses in cutaneous lesions of erythema multiforme by nested PCR [^b4a46f6c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

A subset of erythema multiforme (erythema multiforme) is associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection; viral cultures of erythema multiforme lesions are, however, usually negative and viral antigens difficult to identify. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to demonstrate the association, hence, is currently the only available sensitive diagnostic means for HSV-associated erythema multiforme. A nested PCR, which could simultaneously detect and genotype HSV in erythema multiforme lesions and in clinical swab specimen was developed using the DNA polymerase gene of HSV as target gene because it is the only detectable HSV gene in a high proportion of erythema multiforme lesions. The PCR has demonstrated its robust sensitivity on swab samples by being able to detect further 45.3% HSV cases in comparison with virus isolation with 100% specificity in both detection and genotyping confirmed by virus isolation and DNA sequencing. This study represents the first investigation of typing HSV virus in HSV-associated erythema multiforme patients, and the finding that 66.7% of the patients was attributed to HSV1, 27.8% to HSV2, and 5.6% to HSV1 and 2 co-infection may reflect the distribution of HSV1 and 2 in local general population.

### Pediatric erythema multiforme in the emergency department: more than "Just a rash" [^6d5d42fc]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Erythema multiforme (EM) is characterized by symmetrical acrally distributed target lesions; however, other conditions can mimic the clinical features of EM. Although it is typically self-limiting, alternative diagnoses may be life-threatening and require immediate identification and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the clinical spectrum and accuracy of diagnosis of pediatric EM in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A retrospective, descriptive study of all pediatric patients with an ED information system diagnosis of EM at 2 EDs in Southeast Queensland between January 2010 and July 2013. Cases were evaluated using previously established EM classification criteria.

Results

Seventy patients (34 males and 36 females) with a diagnosis of EM were identified. From 57 cases where a diagnosis could be established, 9 cases fulfilled the classification criteria for EM. No patients had mucosal involvement, and therefore, all 9 cases were classified as EM minor, with the majority (89%) attributed to viral infection. Of the 48 cases that did not fit the criteria, the most common condition misdiagnosed as EM was urticaria multiforme (n = 20).

Conclusions

In the ED setting, EM in children is frequently misdiagnosed. Greater awareness of diagnostic factors for EM may improve diagnostic accuracy. Teledermatology and incentives to include clinical pictures in the (electronic) medical record may be useful adjuncts for patients with suspected EM and other dermatological conditions.

### Erythema multiforme limited to the oral mucosa in a teenager on oral contraceptive therapy [^88c00d28]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Erythema multiforme has been linked to numerous drugs and infectious agents. A link to oral contraceptive use has been reported in the past in the adult population but thus far has not been reported in children or adolescents.

Case

We report the case of an 18-yr-old female who developed oral erosions consistent with erythema multiforme two and a half weeks after initiating therapy with an oral contraceptive agent. A thorough examination for other inciting factors was negative, and the lesions slowly resolved over the course of 3 weeks.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that erythema multiforme should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adolescents with oral erosions who have been prescribed oral contraceptives.

### Unusual leukoderma after erythema multiforme: a case report [^fe81eb53]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory disorder of the skin that usually fades without sequelae. It is well known that after inflammatory events, hyper- or hypochromic spots can remain, especially in skin types III-VI, but achromia is very rare. We report a case of residual leukoderma after erythema multiforme.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^f6c3999c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Urticaria multiforme – Incorrect. Urticaria multiforme typically presents in a child with large, circinate or targetoid, transient urticarial plaques, with or without angioedema. Urticaria multiforme lesions self-resolve in < 24 hours with no residual pigmentation, and there is often a history of viral illness or medication usage in the days preceding development.
B. Urticarial vasculitis (UV) – Correct. UV is a subtype of cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (Fig 4), which is uncommon in pediatric patients. Compared with lesions found in urticaria multiforme, those of UV typically last longer than 24 hours, can leave behind residual hemorrhage or hyperpigmentation, and are accompanied by burning pain and/or pruritus.
C. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme generally arises as a hypersensitivity reaction to infection or medications. Lesions classically present as targetoid, well-demarcated, fixed red macules to papules with central necrosis and an edematous, pale surrounding ring.
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) (IgA-mediated vasculitis) – Incorrect. HSP is the most common multisystem vasculitis of childhood. Classic HSP presents as a triad of palpable purpura often of the lower extremities, abdominal pain, and arthritis. Although leukocytoclastic vasculitis is demonstrated on biopsy, IgA vessel deposition is found in 75% of cases of HSP, which is rare in UV.
E. Hereditary angioedema – Incorrect. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a deficiency in C1-inhibitor protein. It presents with episodes of nonpruritic facial and peripheral edema that resolve over 48 to 72 hours. Patients may have prodromal erythema marginatum, which appears as a nonpitting, nonpruritic serpiginous rash that may manifest independently of angioedema.

### Characteristics of pediatric recurrent erythema multiforme [^da66cc39]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute condition characterized by distinctive target lesions of the skin often accompanied by mucosal ulcers. A subset of individuals experience frequent episodes of recurrent EM, which is rare and poorly understood, especially in children.

Objective

To characterize clinical features, laboratory findings, and treatment responses of pediatric recurrent EM.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (2000–2015) and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (1990–2015). Inclusion criterion was a diagnosis before age 18 years with recurrent EM, defined as a symmetrically distributed, fixed eruption, including target lesions, with or without mucous membrane involvement, occurring on at least three occasions. A literature review was conducted to include individuals who met the inclusion criterion.

Results

Twenty-six patients were included, of whom 16 (62%) were male. The median age of onset was 9.1 years (range 0–15.7 years). Nine patients (35%) required hospitalization. Herpes simplex virus testing was positive in 9 of 17 (65%) patients. Remission was achieved in 5 of 16 (31%) patients while taking suppressive antivirals. Eight patients received continuous anti-inflammatory treatment, two (25%) of whom experienced remission.

Conclusion

This study of pediatric recurrent EM found a greater male predominance, more hospitalizations, fewer cases caused by herpes simplex virus, and a lower response to immunosuppression in children than in the general population.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^456b68a0]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^3d53409b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) mimicking urticaria — Summary Statement 66: EM can resemble urticaria and might be caused by viral infections (eg, herpes), mycoplasma infection, or medications (C). Patients can initially develop urticaria-like lesions before the typical targetoid lesions attributable to EM minor, and unlike urticaria, a central zone of damaged skin can appear. All lesions appear within 72 hours and are usually fixed for at least 7 days, EM minor typically lasts for no longer than 2 weeks, and when EM progresses to ulcerations of mucosal surfaces, it is classified as EM major (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS]); EM can also progress without warning to toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

### Granuloma annulare masquerading as erythema multiforme [^a65489f9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is a serious cutaneous and/ or mucocutaneous disorder that typically develops within 10–14 days of exposure to an offending medication or infection and resolves within 4 weeks. Common offending agents include antibiotics, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and various viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of recurrent EM. Although this condition may be relatively benign in its minor form, EM major can lead to serious complications and even death. As such, it is imperative to find and remove the etiologic agents in patients with EM. We present a case that presented clinically as erythema multiforme, with arcuate, indurated, erythematous plaques on the volar aspect of her hands. Histopathology, however, demonstrated the lesions to be granuloma annulare. The medications in our patient were essential and alterations to her medical regimen would have been problematic. As such, this case demonstrates the importance of histopathologic examination in patients with lesions suspected to be EM.

### Shape and configuration of skin lesions: targetoid lesions [^445b5529]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

What is probably the first description of targetoid or iris lesions, as they appear in erythema multiforme (EM), can be found in Thomas Bateman's 1836 textbook "Practical Synopsis of Cutaneous Diseases According to the Arrangement of Dr. Willan". EM was initially described by Bateman and later by von Hebra as an acute self-limiting skin disease, symmetrically distributed on the extremities with typical concentric "targetoid" or "iris" lesions, and often recurrent. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) were added to this syndrome later. A newer classification has created two disease spectra: EM consisting of EM minor and EM major (or bullous EM), and SJS and TEN. EM minor and EM major are often recurrent, postinfectious (especially after herpes and mycoplasma) disorders with low morbidity and almost no mortality. SJS and TEN are usually severe drug-induced reactions with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The target lesions found in each form of the disease are described and defined. Although the term "target lesion" originated from the description of EM and despite its being the dominant lesion in this disease, it is not pathognomonic for EM, and these lesions can sometimes appear in other diseases. Short descriptions of these other diseases are presented.

### Erythema multiforme [^23ffbda4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms

Prodromal symptoms of fatigue, malaise, and myalgia are common in severe EM. They develop a week before the onset of skin and mucosal manifestations of EM. The diagnosis of EM is made by careful skin examination The typical raised EM target lesions are characterized by 3 concentric rings located acrally or disseminated: variably bullous central portion succeeded bya dark red zone surrounding center, and a lighter edematous ring and finally erythema at the outer portion of the lesions (Supplementary Figure S2). EM lesions may later evolve into geographic, polycyclic and annular configurations. MP-EM has a distinctive clinical presentation. It more often occurs in winter and presents with less acral/more truncal predominant skin manifestations, ranging from purpuric macules to vesicles and bullae. It is often accompanied with a more severe mucositis causing longer hospital stays and more long-term sequelae compared with HAEM. Of note, clinical and radiological signs of pneumoniae were not constantly present in MP-EM. M. pneumoniae can also induce SJS and TEN.MP EM/RIME/MIRM differs from SJS/TEN by predominantly affecting the mucosal surfaces involvement with variable skin involvement, younger patients, and better prognosis. MIRM and RIME could be considered as part of the EM spectrum with severe involvement in general. Beyond the minor and major classification of EM, including the MIRM and RIME, focusing on the severity of EM is what matters in the management of the disease as mucosal involvement can be severe causing significant pain and reduced food intake for instance (see above).

### "Urticaria multiforme": a case series and review of acute annular urticarial hypersensitivity syndromes in children [^f6981087]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Acute annular urticaria is a common and benign cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction seen in children that manifests with characteristic annular, arcuate, and polycyclic urticarial lesions in association with acral edema. It is mistaken most often for erythema multiforme and, occasionally, for a serum-sickness-like reaction. Although these 3 entities may present in a similar manner, specific clinical features help to distinguish them, and it is important for the clinician to be able to differentiate among them. We present herein a series of 18 patients who were given a diagnosis of acute annular urticaria and review the clinical distinctions between acute annular urticaria, serum-sickness-like reactions, and erythema multiforme. Because of the frequency of its clinical confusion with erythema multiforme, we propose the term "urticaria multiforme" as a more apt description to highlight the distinctive clinical features of this urticaria variant.

Workup

The diagnostic workup for EM may vary based on the clinical context, severity of symptoms, and individual patient characteristics and comorbidities (Fig. 3). When EM is suspected, a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical history and drug intake is conducted, focusing on the characteristics, distribution, and progression of skin and mucosal lesions. Physical examination includes a meticulous inspection of the lesions to determine their morphology, extent, and severity. Notable details regarding associated symptoms, recent infections, drug exposure, or potential triggers are recorded. All the mucosal membranes should be examined, including the ocular, oral and anal and genital mucosae. Food and water intake should be assessed as well as a complete pulmonary examination to rule out associated lung disease. Esophageal involvement should be investigated if appropriate. Skin and mucous membrane biopsies may be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Suspicious skin and mucosal lesions, indicative of HSV infection, should be sampled for Tzanck smear, PCR studies, or viral culture to rule out HSV infection. All patients presenting with severe EM should undergo a complete lung examination, a chest radiograph and if possible, PCR testing of throat swabs, and serologic tests for MP. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the presence of IgM antibodies or a significant increase (greater than two-fold) in IgG antibodies. Recurrent episodes of EM have been linked to recurrent HSV infections, but the great majority of cases HSV and EM occurrence were not parallel. However, it's important to note that antibody titers are not reliable for detecting recurrent episodes of the disease.

Fig. 3
M anagemen t algorithm of first EM episode. Compared to HSV-associated EM, Mycoplasma-pneumoniae induced more diffuse EM lesions, more mucositis and respiratory tract sequelae; therefore, prompt detection of MP and systematic early antibiotic treatment could improve the course of the disease. MM: mucous membrane. Systemic corticosteroids were not included in the treatment algorithm of a severe acute EM flare as their potential role will be determined by an ongoing RCT. ∗SJS: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN: Toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Orf nodule with erythema multiforme during a monkeypox outbreak, France, 2022 [^8ebf14a6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

How orf virus induces erythema multiforme is not clearly understood. Other viral infections like herpes simplex viruses can also trigger hypersensitivity reaction because of release of T cells triggered by ether viral mimicry of host proteins or release of viral proteins from cells containing viral DNA fragments.

In this case, the patient experienced inaugural erythema multiforme and secondarily a suspected lesion of orf nodule in a period when monkeypox virus infection was endemic (i.e. > 4,000 orthopoxvirus infections have been reported in France since May 2022). Lesions of monkeypox and orf can be similar, but the manifestations are sufficiently distinctive. In this case, orf virus infection was suspected because of the patient's occupational exposure and clinical compatible skin lesions (e.g. single pustular lesion and erythema multiforme aspect on the rest of the body and the absence of systemic symptoms); infection was diagnosed with positive parapoxvirus PCR test. However, an unusual recent case in Portugal involved monkeypox infection after a needle stick injury. The patient had a solitary pustular lesion of the finger, similar to our patient, but that lesion was painful, and the clinical picture was completed with the appearance of diffuse vesicles and systemic symptoms.

This case highlights the importance of collecting a careful history at the time of patient care, including collection of exposures to possible zoonoses. Those measures are warranted to avoid unnecessary isolation and treatment and to enable appropriate infection control measures.

### Oral manifestations of erythema multiforme [^7ee70d5b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a reactive mucocutaneous disorder in a disease spectrum that comprises a self-limited, mild, exanthematic, cutaneous variant with minimal oral involvement (EM minor) to a progressive, fulminating, severe variant with extensive mucocutaneous epithelial necrosis (SJS and TEN). Significant differences exist among EM minor, EM major, SJS, and TEN with regards to severity and clinical expression; however, all variants share two common features: typical or less typical cutaneous target lesions and satellite-cell or more widespread necrosis of the epithelium. These features are considered to be sequelae of a cytotoxic immunologic attack on keratinocytes expressing non-self-antigens. These antigens are primarily microbial (viruses) or drugs and in rare instances histocompatibility antigens [5]. Although the precise pathogenesis is unknown, there is a tendency to consider EM both minor and major as part of one spectrum that is most often triggered by viral infections, and SJS and TEN as a separate one most often elicited by drugs with EM major and SJS representing a bridge in the continuum of EM. The oral manifestations of the spectrum of EM range from tender superficial erythematous and hyperkeratotic plaques to painful deep hemorrhagic bullae and erosions. Other mucosal surfaces including ocular, nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal, upper respiratory, and anogenital may be involved. Scarring sequelae from ocular and pharyngeal involvement cause morbidity. The oral EM variant is an underrecognized form of EM. Most patients have chronic or recurrent oral lesions only, but one third have oral and lip lesions and one quarter have oral, lip, and skin lesions. This variant is a reaction pattern similar to EM minor, EM major, SJS, and TEN. The diagnosis of oral EM is one of exclusion. Careful clinical evaluation for other chronic mucocutaneous diseases, such as pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and lichen planus, is a necessary component of the diagnosis. The value of a biopsy specimen studied by both routine histopathologic and immunopathologic methods is fundamental to excluding the other causes for this variant of EM.

### Herpes associated erythema multiforme: a retrospective study [^5f415068]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythema multiforme (EM), an acute dermatologic condition frequently encountered in the Emergency Department, classically presents with a targetoid rash. We reviewed all recent EM cases seen at the LAC-USC County Hospital in order to ascertain the proportion of Herpes associated EM (HAEM) cases and to inform the diagnostic workup of these patients.

Methods

ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were used to extract a list of EM cases at our institution from 2013 to 2019. Two non-blinded abstractors screened records to confirm an EM diagnosis and entered patient data utilizing a standardized data abstraction form. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to measure inter-rater reliability on various variables. Kappa (κ) values ranged from 0.803 to 1.0.

Results

70 pediatric and 56 adult EM patients were included in the study. A likely etiology was ascribed to 63% of pediatric and adult EM cases. Pediatric EM was most commonly attributed to upper respiratory infection (URI) (n = 23; 33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (n = 5; 7%), and medications (n = 4; 6%). Adult EM was most commonly attributed to HSV infection (n = 11; 20%), medications (n = 5; 9%), URIs (n = 4; 7%), and other infections (n = 4; 7%).

Conclusion

HSV-1/2 serologic testing should be considered in most EM patients to potentially prevent repeated ED visits. In EM cases not clearly attributable to herpes or drug exposure, physicians can consider further workup: Mycoplasma serology, nasal PCR, and a respiratory viral panel in pediatric patients. Identification of an etiologic cause may suggest a different treatment approach and prevent mislabeling of medication allergies in patient charts.

### Persistent erythema multiforme associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection [^3a7ff8a6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is a common, self-limiting condition. Recurrent EM is a well-recognised variant, often associated with herpes simplex virus infection. It is frequently managed with prophylactic aciclovir. Anecdotal reports suggest that recurrent EM may be associated with the use of corticosteroids. Persistent EM, however, is a rare variant, with few cases reported in the literature. It has a protracted course often with atypical and inflammatory lesions. It has been associated with occult viral infections, particularly Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), as well as inflammatory bowel disease and malignancy. We report a case of EM associated with EBV infection.

### Erythema multiforme following polymorphic light eruption: a report of two cases [^60008651]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We report two patients in whom episodes of polymorphic light eruption were followed by recurrent erythema multiforme on exposed and nonexposed sites. Treating the polymorphic light eruption with prophylactic PUVA and/or oral prednisolone or cyclosporin prevented the development of erythema multiforme, suggesting that the two events are related. It is possible that erythema multiforme develops as a response to the same causative antigen as polymorphic light eruption.

We describe a case of erythema multiforme in a 2-week-old boy. He had no remarkable antecedents, and a polymerase chain reaction-based technique failed to detect herpes simplex virus DNA in the skin biopsy specimen. To our knowledge, only one previous biopsy-proven case of erythema multiforme during the neonatal period has been reported.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^53c88cdb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — early illness suspicion and timing in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and related syndromes is guided by incubation and exposure windows, symptom patterns, and epidemiology. In ambulatory patients with CAP, coccidioidal infection accounted for 24% of newly diagnosed CAP. The usual incubation period for early coccidioidal syndromes is from 1 week to 4 weeks, and patients with CAP, dermatologic syndromes, or rheumatologic syndromes who have endemic exposure within the previous 1–2 months should be evaluated for coccidioidomycosis as a possible etiology. Early associated findings can include erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme, and fatigue may be the last complaint to resolve and results in many weeks to many months of convalescence. Hematogenous spread beyond the lungs normally occurs within weeks to several months following infection, with exceptions including immunosuppressed patients with more remote prior exposure and patients previously treated for primary pulmonary infection in whom relapses occurred up to 4 years after treatment had been stopped.

### Erythema multiforme like reaction to santos rosewood () and… [^7c5e9152]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a skin disorder characterised by target epithelial eruption, which is mainly caused by infection or drugs. In this case, we report an erythema multiforme like reaction caused by contact dermatitis against wood, especially santos rosewood. During the hospitalisation, we performed a patch test with lumber used in the patient's workplace, and recognised a positive response to multiple woods and a simultaneous recurring eruption (flare up) outside of the test site. The findings from this case of contact dermatitis caused by frequently used industrial wood type is important for the management of occupational environments. A review of the literature on erythema multiforme like reaction due to contact dermatitis, including past case reports, has also been provided.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor associated lichenoid dermatitis mimicking erythema multiforme major with a germline variant in human leukocyte antigen-B15 [^d73d5c75]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lichenoid dermatitis is a common reaction observed in up to 5% of patients treated with immunotherapy targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Presentation varies from typical flat topped violaceous papules to inverse, hypertrophic and bullous variants, and can involve oral and anogenital mucosa. Onset is on average 12 weeks after medication initiation but has been reported after 1 to 266 days. Erythema multiforme major is a severe form of erythema multiforme (EM) characterized by widespread targetoid plaques and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. It is frequently associated with infections, particularly mycoplasma and herpes simplex virus (HSV), or as a reaction to medications, including PD-1 inhibitors.

The role of genetic predispositions in the development of drug-induced dermatoses is gaining attention, particularly concerning germline variants. Notably, specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been linked to increased susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. In the context of PD-1 inhibitors, the identification of certain HLA alleles in patients has been correlated with a higher likelihood of developing severe mucocutaneous reactions. This connection underscores the potential for genetic screening to predict adverse drug reactions and guide personalized treatment strategies.

### Drug-mediated rash: erythema multiforme versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^1b3c7ec7]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with an acute onset generalised maculopapular rash with associated mucosal involvement, on a background of recent start of griseofulvin. The rash progressed rapidly over 2 days to involve most of her body, however, mucosal involvement was limited to her oral mucosa. Characteristic target lesions appeared at 72 h, and a diagnosis of erythema multiforme secondary to griseofulvin was made after further investigation and skin biopsy. The patient was monitored closely for progression of the rash and other indicators of more severe dermatological conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She was managed symptomatically, with resolution of the rash in 4 weeks and full recovery to her premorbid level of functioning. This case details the diagnostic and management approach to erythema multiforme, a condition that warrants thorough consideration for the differential of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### Oseltamivir induced oral-only erythema multiforme [^6f9df34a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe dermatologic and mucosal adverse reactions to oseltamivir are rare. To date, only two other case reports have described mucosal changes secondary to oseltamivir, but both cases were associated with concomitant skin changes. We report a case of a previously healthy 18-year-old-male who developed oral-only erythema multiforme after being treated with oseltamivir for influenza B. Given the frequency of which oseltamivir is prescribed, we highlight the importance of recognizing this uncommon but serious adverse reaction.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^3fb6598f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome — recognition and management in patients treated with immunotherapy note that a few cases of erythema multiforme (EM) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) involving the oral tissues have been reported in patients treated with immunotherapy. Due to the severity and possible multi-organ involvement in this irAE, the diagnostic workup, treatment decision, and approach to reduction/suspension of the immunotherapy agent should be discussed with the oncology team; a multidisciplinary team approach for best management is advisable, and the immunotherapy agent may need to be discontinued. Supportive care and prevention of secondary infections are key elements in the clinical approach, and adequate hydration and electrolyte balance monitoring are critical, especially if the body surface area involved is large. Since EM may be associated with the infection or reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV), the patient should undergo HSV-PCR and receive antiviral treatment if the test results are positive, and because mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM), also known as Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME), has a similar presentation, mycoplasma should be tested if EM or/and SJS are suspected. Local anesthesia and analgesic support, topical and systemic, may offer pain relief, topical treatment with steroids can also be used to reduce the severity and accelerate the healing, and due to oral pain with limited oral intake, patients should maintain good hydration and may benefit from a soft diet to avoid trauma to the oral mucosa and improve oral intake, as opposed to a crispy/acidic/spicy diet, which may induce mucosal sensitivity. The patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent secondary infections of oral lesions.

### Erythema multiforme [^d3a99cf6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of first acute EM episode

The mainstay of therapy involves identifying and treating the causative agent, if possible as well as providing supportive care to the disease, prevent complications and mucosal sequelae. Mucosal pain, food intake, weight loss and other systemic symptoms should be evaluated to assess the need for hospitalization. There are no validated tools specific for EM but the general tools to measure pain like the numeric rating scale and food intake can be used for follow-up and for research purposes (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Sugg ested tools to measure pain and food intake in EM.

Supportive care and symptom control

There is no consensus on supportive care in EM mucosal lesions. Due to the similarities of the mucosal lesions and functional consequences in SJS/TEN and EM, supportive care would be comparable. The standard-of-care treatment firstly relies on: analgesics, including opioids, antipyretics, antiseptics, and mucous membrane care. Vaseline or other moisturizing ointment should be applied twice a day on skin lesions. Topical corticosteroids may also be considered to control the skin lesions.

The symptomatic treatment of mucous membranes consists of antiseptic and analgesic mouthwashes composed of chlorhexidine or with corticosteroids, mycostatin, lidocaine and bicarbonate mouthwashes every 4 h, and lidocaine gel before meals for the oral mucosae, artificial tears without preservative, and vitamin A ointment for the eyes; Vaseline for the genital membranes. If the patient presents with severe pain, opioids can be prescribed and if oral intake is severely affected, diet adapted to the ability to eat/drink, hydration with a gastric feeding tube if needed.

The use of Systemic Corticosteroid (SCS) during the established phase of severe EM remains a topic of debate and lacks standardized guidelines. Most current studies are retrospective and rely on small cohorts or case reports. They would have a potential interest in alleviating pain with quicker symptom control in severe EM. We recently conducted a multicenter retrospective national study showing that in routine practice, SCS were prescribed for 15.5% of hospitalized patients with severe EM with doses ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day with a rapidly decreasing dosage over 10–15 days. However, because of the retrospective design of the study, we failed to strongly demonstrate the benefit of SCS in reducing the length of hospital stay, control of pain or impaired food intake. To properly evaluate the benefits of SCS in this disease and provide robust guidance to clinicians, an academic randomized controlled trial is currently planned.

### Erythema multiforme [^6b85e263]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, a distinct syndrome has been defined with MP, the so called Mycoplasma pneumoniae- induced rash and mucositis (MIRM). Clinically, mucocutaneous eruptions in the MIRM are very morphologically diverse. They range from mucositis alone, to prominent mucositis with respiratory tract sequelae and little to moderate skin involvement. Ramien et al.proposed the umbrella term of reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) to acknowledge the multiple non-MP pathogens, including Chlamydiae pneumoniae, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenzavirus 2, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and influenza B virus (Table 1). RIME encompasses several entities including the MIRM and infection-related severe EM.

Table 1
Potential triggers of Erythema Multiforme (EM) and Reactive Infectious Mucocutaneous Eruption (RIME).

Whether MIRM/RIME is a separate entity, or a part of the EM spectrum is still a matter of debate. Clinical and histological findings of both strongly overlap with EM. Even though MP can induce epidermal necrolysis and some patients may have a sort of overlap between EM and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/"Toxic" Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) (Supplementary Figure S1). Distinguishing between MIRM/RIME and SJS/TEN is of utmost importance as EM/RIME/MIRM and SJS/TEN warrant different management plans.

While EM is most commonly caused by infections and SJS/TEN are most commonly caused by drugs, the clinical presentation is the determining factor in making the diagnosis of EM vs SJS/TEN. Typical or atypical raised target lesions are found in EM while purpuric macules evolving into vesicles, blisters and detachment are found in SJS/TEN (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Skin detachment is usually limited in EM and the prognosis is generally better than SJS/TEN. In fact, the final nosology is complex as an "Epidermal necrolysis" pattern may be found in both entities.

### Simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine injection [^508dde64]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine injection.

Case Summary

A 33-year-old female experienced coexisting erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after lidocaine spray was used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The reaction was exacerbated after localized injection of 2% lidocaine for a skin biopsy. An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was highly probable.

Discussion

Lidocaine is the most frequently used local anesthetic agent. The coexistence of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme has been reported in lepromatous leprosy, Yersinia enterocolítica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis gastrointestinal infection (both with diarrhea), histoplasmosis, hepatitis C, and milkeŕs nodule, but not with lidocaine.

Conclusions

If clinicians observe similar lesions after lidocaine exposure, they should suspect an adverse drug reaction and exercise caution in the administration of amide anesthetics to patients with a documented history of adverse reaction to lidocaine.

Introduction

Kawasaki disease (KD; previously known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is an acute febrile vasculitis predominately affecting children. Diagnosis of KD is based on well-known clinical criteria; however, various cutaneous presentations can make diagnosis difficult and delay treatment.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^803138ea]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Erythema multiforme and Stevens Johnson syndrome

A few cases of erythema multiforme (EM) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) involving the oral tissues have been reported in patients treated with immunotherapy.
Due to the severity and possible multi-organ involvement in this irAE, the diagnostic workup, treatment decision, and approach to reduction/suspension of the immunotherapy agent should be discussed with the oncology team. A multidisciplinary team approach for best management is advisable. The immunotherapy agent may need to be discontinued.
The mainstay of treatment for EM and SJS is systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators. For oral lesions, topical treatment with steroids can also be used to reduce the severity and accelerate the healing (Table 2).
Supportive care and prevention of secondary infections are key elements in the clinical approach. Adequate hydration and electrolyte balance monitoring are critical, especially if the body surface area involved is large.
Since EM may be associated with the infection or reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV), the patient should undergo HSV-PCR and receive antiviral treatment if the test results are positive. Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM), also known as Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME), is a distinct entity with a similar presentation to EM and SJS. Therefore, mycoplasma should be tested if EM or/and SJS are suspected.
Local anesthesia and analgesic support, topical and systemic, may offer pain relief (Table 2).
Due to oral pain, the patient may experience limited oral intake that may contribute to dehydration and nutritional compromise. Therefore, patients should maintain good hydration and may benefit from a soft diet to avoid trauma to the oral mucosa and improve oral intake, as opposed to a crispy/acidic/spicy diet, which may induce mucosal sensitivity.
The patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent secondary infections of oral lesions.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may be considered an extreme presentation of SJS based on the extent of skin involvement. TEN has been reported in patients treated with immunotherapies. This serious systemic irAE often has oral involvement and presents as mucosal ulcerations, erosion, and lip bleeding. The treatment for this condition is often performed in a hospital setting.

### Pediatric topical steroid withdrawal syndrome: what is known, what is unknown [^730e2dd9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the majority of the reviewed data comes from a small number of clinicians. This may be due to under‐recognition and reporting of this clinical entity by pediatric dermatologists and highlights the need for standardized diagnostic criteria.

The differential diagnosis of TSW includes allergic contact dermatitis to TCS. Allergic contact dermatitis to TCS may present as acute weeping dermatitis with severe edema, id‐like eruptions, erythema multiforme‐like lesions at distant sites, and angioedema. Thus, allergic contact dermatitis to TCS should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient who has been on chronic steroids presents with worsening or refractory dermatitis symptoms.

While the pathophysiology of TSW has yet to be elucidated, comprehensive patient education may at least discourage the continuous use of more potent TCS, particularly in anatomically sensitive areas, which could possibly prevent the development of TSW. It is also pertinent to acknowledge that TSW may be disproportionately represented in online sources. Therefore, it is essential for pediatric dermatologists to remain informed about this topic to address patient concerns appropriately.

### Vesiculobullous eruption in neutropenic patient with Crohn's disease [^b6ced3f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Ecthyma gangrenosum
D. Cutaneous anthrax
E. Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSSV)

Answers:
A. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis – Correct. The patient fulfilled both major criteria of Sweet syndrome (SS): (1) sudden onset of painful violaceous papules or nodules and (2) neutrophilic infiltrate without leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient fulfilled minor criteria of (1) accompaniment by inflammatory bowel disease and (2) fever greater than 38°C and constitutional symptoms. Rapid improvement with 60-mg prednisone confirmed the diagnosis of SS.
B. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Although erythema multiforme favors acral surfaces, particularly the palms, the lesions characteristically display a targetoid morphology with 3 zones of coloration.
C. Ecthyma gangrenosum – Incorrect. This diagnosis was initially suspected, given the patient's neutropenia, fever, and other systemic signs of infection (increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). However, blood cultures did not show bacterial or fungal organisms, and lesional tissue did not culture Pseudomonas aeruginosa or another likely organism (only methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated).
D. Cutaneous anthrax – Incorrect. Although the cutaneous manifestation of this rare disorder often begins as a nonpainful purpuric papule evolving into an ulcerating vesicle that forms a black eschar, the eschar is typically depressed and characteristically surprisingly painless, despite the necrosis. Lack of recent travel or exposures (such as to animal hides, wool, or contaminated soil) also makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. CSSV – Incorrect. CSVV typically affects the lower extremities and usually consists of smaller purpuric macules and papules than the lesions seen in this patient, although vesicles and bullae within palpable purpuric lesions may be seen in the less common bullous variant.

### Anti-p200 pemphigoid mimicking erythema multiforme [^59681e98]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-p200 pemphigoid is a rare subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against a 200-kDa protein localized within the lower lamina lucida in the basement membrane zone. The clinical presentation of anti-p200 most often resembles bullous pemphigoid, mucous membrane pemphigoid, or an inflammatory variant of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Herein, we describe an atypical presentation of anti-p200 pemphigoid, with numerous targetoid lesions present on the extremities, with erythema multiforme (EM)-like clinical features.

### New cutaneous nodules associated with pulmonary symptoms [^5a3e8b42]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following cutaneous manifestation of this disease would likely produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy?
A. Erythema nodosum
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Sweet syndrome
D. Acute generalized exanthema
E. Solitary granulomatous plaque

Answers:
A. Erythema nodosum–Incorrect. Cutaneous manifestations of Coccidioidomycosis are categorized as reactive or organism specific. Erythema nodosum is considered the most frequent reactive manifestation.
B. Erythema multiforme–Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is characterized by target-like lesions and can include oral findings. It is also considered a reactive cutaneous finding and, as such, would not produce visible microorganisms on biopsy.
C. Sweet syndrome–Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is a very rare feature of Coccidioidomycosis. Biopsy would show abundant neutrophils but not microorganisms.
D. Acute generalized exanthema–Incorrect. Acute generalized exanthema, which can be mistaken for an allergic contact dermatitis, would not produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy.
E. Solitary granulomatous plaques–Correct. Clinically, lesions as a result of dissemination are nonspecific and include ulcerated and verrucous plaques; solitary granulomatous plaques; and papular, nodular, or pustular lesions. The clinical differential diagnosis includes histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, Cryptococcus, and sarcoidosis.

### Erythema multiforme in a child with Kawasaki disease [^725f8727]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Table I
Cases of erythema multiforme as a manifestation of Kawasaki disease

In one case of incomplete KD, S pyogenes was implicated and postulated to trigger both KD and EM. Streptococcus has been considered as an infectious etiology in EM and KD previously. Our patient had a positive throat swab for S pyogenes at initial presentation, suggesting that her streptococcal infection may have played a role in the development of KD and the cutaneous findings.

Distinguishing EM clinically from drug eruptions (mainly Stevens-Johnson syndrome), vasculitis, or viral exanthems can be challenging. In this case, SJS was initially considered because the patient was exposed to an antibiotic 1 month before this episode and bullae developed. However, she reportedly tolerated prior administration of the same antibiotic, and the timeline was delayed for typical SJS. She did not have oral or genital involvement other than erythema and edema of the tongue. Furthermore, she had no desquamation or skin pain/tenderness, and, ultimately, the tense bullae on her feet were attributed to pedal edema.

Because KD is a clinical diagnosis, it is important to recognize the variable cutaneous presentations that include EM. In children, KD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with targetoid lesions, as delay in diagnosis and treatment of KD could lead to cardiac complications. Although it may be difficult to identify the inciting factor for EM, and there may be multiple triggers for EM, including infections and medications, a full skin examination and thorough review of systems should be performed in all patients. Additionally, a throat examination and culture, if warranted, should be considered in the workup of certain patients. Our case, in accordance with the case by Vierucci et al, highlights the potential role of streptococci in mediating this disease. Thus, we recommend evaluating patients with findings of EM or KD for S pyogenes and initiating treatment when screening is positive.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme major in an 8-year-old patient with recurrence of herpetic gingivostomatitis and HLA-B✱5801 haplotype: a causal or casual relationship? [^b8a52f4d]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EM is an acute inflammatory disease presenting with annular erythematous plaques or urticarial papules that may evolve in typical target lesions, mainly involving acral sites. It occurs more frequently in young adults; however, a few pediatric cases have been reported in the literature. Several etiologies have been associated with EM (eg, drugs, autoimmune disorders, malignancy, radiation); infectious processes are, however, the most common triggers, encompassing approximately 90% of cases. HSV is estimated to be involved in about 70% of cases of EM; M pneumoniae is also a prominent pathogen.

In our patient, the close temporal relation between the onset of EM minor with a rapid worsening in EM major and its close relationship with recurrence of herpetic gingivostomatitis is highly suggestive for a causal role of HSV infection. Relapse of EM coinciding with HSV 1 or 2 infection relapses has been widely reported in the literature; the link between HSV and EM is probably caused by an autoimmune cross-reactivity mechanism, as a high number of peptides is shared between the HSV and human proteins.

Prompt hydration, pain control, accurate skin care, and early identification and management of potential triggers are the mainstay of EM major treatment. Although IVIG and systemic corticosteroids are the main therapy options, their effectiveness is still debated. In our case, we observed a rapid improvement progress into a lasting resolution of the condition after the introduction of IVIG therapy. The efficacy of IVIGs depends essentially on their ability to interfere with ligand-induced keratinocytes apoptosis.

Prognosis of EM major mainly depends on the extent of skin and mucosal involvementand on a prompt treatment. Increasing evidence suggests a role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of EM reactions, but little was known about the predisposition to these reactions until recently.

In our patient, because of the rapid disease progression with major involvement of mucous membranes, we performed HLA haplotype analysis to determine whether particular major histocompatibility complex alleles would predispose for this recurrent HSV-induced severe EM.

### Erythema multiforme [^20ebc79f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Etiological treatment

In EM, especially severe EM, macrolide antibiotics should be systematically prescribed,(Fig. 3). They would be continued if a MP infection is confirmed, otherwise they would be stopped. In suspected HAEM, antivirals do not alter the course of the acute episode and are only useful as a prophylactic regimen (see below).

Treatment of recurrent EM

The preventive treatment of recurrent (EM) poses significant challenges and often requires prolonged therapy. In cases of HAEM and idiopathic recurrent EM, continuous or intermittent antiviral therapy is the first line approach. The most effective approach was continuous antiviral therapy for a duration of at least six months (acyclovir [400 mg twice daily], valacyclovir [500 mg twice daily] or famciclovir [250 mg twice daily]). The primary treatment objective is to reduce the frequency of EM episodes and achieve clinical remission. In cases where EM does not respond to initial treatment, the medication dose may be increased, or an alternative antiviral drug may be substituted. Unfortunately, maintaining remission is challenging even with treatment. Generally, patients who respond to continuous antiviral therapy should be treated for 1–2 years before considering potential discontinuation. If EM recurs after discontinuation, medication should be restarted at the lowest effective dose, and therapy cessation may be attempted again in 6–12 months. As a note, the efficacy of antivirals demonstrates a posteriori the HSV cause of EM.

Limited evidence exists for the continuous administration of alternative treatments in cases of recurrent EM that do not respond to antivirals representing second-line treatment options. Among these treatments, thalidomide, lenalidomide, immunoglobulins, and azathioprinehave shown higher rates of complete remission (80%). However, these findings are based on small patient cohorts (Table 1). Dapsone and mycophenolate mofetil have demonstrated complete response rates in one-third of patients, while antimalarials and colchicine have shown limited or no response, respectively.

### Erythema multiforme [^c401c7be]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Etiology

Ninety percent of EM cases reported in the medical literature were triggered by infections with the most common triggering agent being HSV. HSV1 is more frequently associated with EM than HSV2.MP is the second most commonly associated infection after HSV. Currently, the World Health Organization declared clusters of respiratory illness in children in northern China and worldwide, partly due to MP and COVID-19. These clusters need to be followed closely as they might be associated in increasing incidences of EM. SARS-CoV-2 has been recently linked to EM. The reported patients classically developed EM lesions after COVID-19 classic symptoms. Most patients had only skin involvement with minimally symptomatic mucosal involvement. EM was not associated with worse outcome of the disease. Medical literature has linked other infectious agents to the development of EM. They are listed in Table 1. Vaccinations were also reported as EM triggers, which include pneumococcal vaccinations, measles-rubella, smallpox, rabies, HPV, rotavirus, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, meningitis, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B. All available COVID-19 vaccines were associated with EM. The range of disease onset after vaccination was 3 days to 2 weeks and the clinical pattern resembled the one following COVID-19 infection.

### Diagnosis of herpes simplex virus-induced erythema multiforme confounded by previous infection with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^08683d5f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction often related to viral infection or medications. Infection-induced EM is typically self-limited and commonly caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP); recurrent EM is almost always associated with HSV. We present a concise overview of diagnostic techniques for HSV and MP, as repeatedly elevated MP titers in our case led to a delayed diagnosis of HSV-induced EM.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^616c20d2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

PH symptoms and exposure history — PH is a multisystem disorder, and it is characterized by skin lesions including urticaria, eczema, erythema multiforme, papulopustular lesions, vesiculobullous and vesiculopustular lesions, as well as stomatitis; non-dermatologic hypersensitivity symptoms including asthma and anaphylaxis have also been described, and both non-dermatologic and dermatologic manifestations have been described in the same patient. Use of high-dose progestogens in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may predispose them to the development of PH and make it difficult for patients to undergo fertility treatment, and a careful history of both symptom timing and exposures is crucial to making the diagnosis of PH.

### Erythema multiforme [^c7dc879d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric EM may have similar triggers when compared to adults and with a comparable clinical presentation. In children, post vaccination EM, although rare, was reported with most vaccines currently used, including the covid-19 vaccines. The diagnosis was mainly clinical in reported cases of pediatric EM and biopsies were rarely done. Infantile EM is a much rarer condition with only 19 reported cases, most commonly with vaccines. Neither MP-EM nor mucosal membrane involvement were reported in infants with EM.

The question of the drug causality in EM is complex and controversial for several reasons: i) SJS may be misclassified as EM; ii) the presence of a culprit drug is not synonymous of the phenotype, e.g. SJS/TEN or EM; iii) EM is known to be mainly infection-related and cases of SJS were misclassified as "drug-induced EM". Demouche et al. analyzed all EM cases reported in the French pharmacovigilance database and concluded that only 6% of evaluable reports would be probable drug-induced EM and other diagnosis were excluded. Moreover, although rare, the definite drug involvement as a causative factor cannot be confirmed even if a drug intake precedes the EM eruption. An additional confounding factor is that infections can also cause true SJS/TEN. Finally, a report of a few drug-induced EM in a pharmacovigilance data base retrospective analysis does not provide any strong evidence and large epidemiologic reports are needed with strict inclusion criteria, excluding all cases of SJS/TEN.

The case of a 6-year-old boy with multiple, target-shaped lesions and a crusted nodule on his right index finger is presented. Based on clinical findings and the patient's recent contact with sheep and goats, a diagnosis of orf disease associated with erythema multiforme was suspected. Microscopy studies confirmed the presence of parapoxvirus in the primary lesion. Orf-induced erythema multiforme is a rare complication of orf in children, possibly related to the presence of orf virus DNA in erythema multiforme lesions.

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^a63de1c1]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:
A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

Question 2: Geographic tongue shares strong similarities with what common dermatologic condition?
A. Psoriasis
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Pityriasis rosea
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus
E. Rosacea

Answers:
A. Psoriasis – Correct. Current literature suggests clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical similarities between geographic tongue and psoriasis. In fact, some authors have argued that geographic tongue may represent oral manifestations of psoriasis, although this remains controversial. Moreover, a systemic review and meta-analysis indicated an association between geographic tongue and psoriasis (odds ratio: 3.53; 95% CI: [2.56–4.86]; P = 0.03). Interestingly, this patient had a streptococcal exposure, new onset headache, and was treated empirically for streptococcal pharyngitis at the time of lip symptoms. There is a well-established association between acute guttate psoriasis and preceding streptococcal infection. If ectopic geographic tongue shares similarities to the immune-mediated pathogenesis of psoriasis, it raises the possibility that the lesions on the patient's upper labial mucosa occurred secondary to streptococcal infection.
B. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between erythema multiforme and geographic tongue.
C. Pityriasis rosea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between pityriasis rosea and geographic tongue.
D. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between discoid lupus erythematosus and geographic tongue.
E. Rosacea – Incorrect. There is no clear relationship between rosacea and geographic tongue.

### A case of good's syndrome complicated by erythema multiforme [^b67ca821]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Good's syndrome (GS) is a rare, adult-onset combined B cell and T cell immunodeficiency with an associated thymoma. These patients have an increased risk of bacterial, fungal, viral and opportunistic infections. This report describes a 75-year-old female patient who presented with a full body rash and an anterior mediastinal mass. She underwent a biopsy of her rash and mass, which revealed erythema multiforme and WHO Type A thymoma, respectively. During her hospitalisation, she was also found to have oropharyngeal candidiasis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) skin lesions. Based on the number of infections and severity of her rash, an immunocompromised state was suspected. Immunological testing revealed a B cell and T cell deficiency as well as low serum immunoglobulins. This combination of hypogammaglobulinaemia and thymoma led to a diagnosis of GS. While there have been many case reports of GS, this is the first report of the immunodeficiency presenting with erythema multiforme.

### Erythema multiforme in a child with Kawasaki disease [^8f1b858c]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

KD is an acute vasculitis classically affecting Asian children less than 5 years old. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including fever for at least 5 days, plus 4 of 5 of the following criteria: rash, mucositis, conjunctivitis, peripheral extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Although laboratory studies are not considered in the diagnostic criteria, they may support KD diagnosis and include leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, elevated transaminases and acute-phase reactants, and pyuria. Cardiac sequelae are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with KD, with thrombosis or aneurysms in the coronary arteries being the most common finding. Thus, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment with aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin is essential to prevent cardiac sequalea.

Our patient fulfilled clinical criteria for KD with fever for 5 days, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate, injection of oral and pharyngeal mucosa, edema of feet, and polymorphous exanthem. Although skin eruptions in KD are variable, a diffuse maculopapular rash involving the trunk and extremities is most common. Our patient had targetoid lesions with interface changes on biopsy, consistent with a diagnosis of EM. To date, 4 cases of 5 patients have reported EM as a cutaneous manifestation of KD (Table I). Additionally, there is a report of 3 patients with annular lesions as a cutaneous finding in KD. Various morphologies have been implicated as the exanthem in KD, and awareness of the spectrum of cutaneous presentations is important in diagnosis.

### Erythema multiforme associated with… [^f25146b1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We describe the first case in the literature, to our knowledge, of E histolytica- related EM, with resolution after proper treatment of the underlying condition. This etiology was discovered through a symptom-driven workup as our patient did not present with a history or clinical examination consistent with an HSV infection, to which EM is often attributed without clear evidence.

Infections are the most common trigger for EM, followed by drugs. Systemic diseases, neoplasms, vaccinations, allergic contact dermatitis, and idiopathic etiologies have also been described. HSV is the most common precipitant of EM, followed by M pneumoniae. HSV-related EM often presents with typical target lesions in an acral distribution with little or no mucosal involvement, while M pneumoniae- related EM often has a more severe presentation than that of EM major, with severe mucositis, which has been termed as mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis. Both etiologies have resulted in bullous lesions, as in our patient.

Many cases labeled as idiopathic EM may have an associated condition that has not been discovered. We recommend a complete review of systems and a symptom-guided workup in patients with EM of unclear etiology while providing classic treatment measures (ie, antiviral medication for a possible HSV association), as was done in our patient. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough workup in investigating the precipitating factor in patients with EM to better guide treatment in resolving this condition.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^0566c0a6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Etravirine (ETR) major toxicities — more common effects are "Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash". Rash occurs most commonly during the first "6 weeks" of therapy and generally resolves after "1 to 2 weeks" on continued therapy; people with a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use "should not receive ETR". Less common (more severe) events include "Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and erythema multiforme", and clinicians should "Discontinue ETR immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop", "monitor a person's clinical status, including levels of liver transaminases", and note that "Continuing to use ETR after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction"; people with a history of severe rash while using NVP or EFV "should not receive ETR".

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^0abc6aa7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Cutaneous toxicities with immune checkpoint inhibitors — classification, onset, and presenting features: Immune-related cutaneous adverse events are characterized as inflammatory dermatoses, bullous dermatoses, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), according to the CTCAE. The median time to onset of skin toxicities is 4 weeks, but can range broadly from 2 to 150 weeks. Rash or inflammatory dermatitis irAEs encompass erythema multiforme, lichenoid, eczematous, psoriasiform, morbilliform, and palmo-plantar erythrodysesthesia, or hand-foot syndrome, and presenting symptoms often include itch or with or without rash, new or worsening skin lesions, including macules, papules, or plaques, and loss of skin pigmentation. For bullous dermatoses, presenting symptoms may include new or worsening skin lesions, including bullae, persistent urticaria, or erosions on the skin or mucosal surfaces, and SCAR includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (although note that acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is not always severe), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme major in an 8-year-old patient with recurrence of herpetic gingivostomatitis and HLA-B✱5801 haplotype: a causal or casual relationship? [^f9c7d057]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic treatment with methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d was started in association with acyclovir at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d. In the following days, a worsening with extension of de-epithelialization areas was observed. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 400 mg/kg/d for 5 days was started. A rapid improvement of signs and symptoms was observed, followed by complete resolution of mucocutaneous involvement within a week.

Because of the rapid disease progression with major extensive mucous membrane involvement, we performed HLA haplotype analysis to determine whether particular major histocompatibility complex alleles would predispose to this recurrent HSV-induced, severe EM. The presence of the HLA-B✱5801 genotype was discovered. At a 3-month follow-up visit, the patient had maintained complete clinical resolution continuing to take acyclovir 400 mg/d to prevent herpetic recurrences.

### Serum IL-17 in patients with erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis drug reaction, and correlation with disease severity [^c5e90cea]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence that drug-induced cutaneous eruptions have an immunological component. Interleukin (IL)-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that is predominantly produced by T helper 17 cells, has been linked to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Aim

To measure serum IL-17 levels in patients with cutaneous drug reactions [erythema multiforme (EM) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN)] in order to study the associations between IL-17 and disease severity.

Methods

In total, 32 patients (13 with EM and 19 with SJS/TEN) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Patients with SJS/TEN were assessed clinically using the SCORe of Toxic Epidermal Necrosis (SCORTEN) scale. Serum IL-17 levels were determined by ELISA.

Results

Serum IL-17 levels were significantly higher compared with HCs (16.46 ± 5.21 pg/mL) in the EM (35.1 ± 23.89 pg/mL, P < 0.02) and SJS/TEN (68.19 ± 35.42 pg/mL, P = 0.001) groups. IL-17 levels were also significantly higher in the SJS/TEN group than in the EM group (P = 0.004). Mean affected body surface area percentage was 0.9 ± 0.21 in the EM group and 22.8 ± 10.67 in the SJS/TEN group. The SJS/TEN SCORTEN ranged from 1 to 5, with a mean of 2.5 ± 1. Serum IL-17 level correlated positively with both percentage surface area of detached skin and SCORTEN.

Conclusions

Serum IL-17 levels may have prognostic and diagnostic value in patients with EM or SJS/TEN reactions, and can provide a valuable approach in managment.

### Persistent oral ulcers in a woman with thymoma [^9e9b7051]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcome

The patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and tacrolimus swishes with improvement.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme
B. Lichen planus
C. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP)
D. Pemphigus vulgaris
E. Bullous pemphigoid

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. While erythema multiforme shares many clinical features with PNP including targetoid lesions, histopathology does not support this diagnosis taking into account the positive IIF studies.
B. Lichen planus – Incorrect. While PNP can present as lichenoid papules or plaques with lichenoid changes on histopathology, the positive IIF results do not support the diagnosis of lichen planus.
C. PNP – Correct. The diagnosis is PNP secondary to thymoma. PNP is a rare autoimmune disease with poorly understood pathophysiology that involves both humoral and cellular autoimmune responses. It is characterized by painful stomatitis and oral lesions that may resemble erosive lichen planus, erythema multiforme, or graft versus host disease. Clinical presentation varies, making the diagnosis challenging. The diagnosis can be confirmed by serum IIF, which typically shows intercellular depositions of IgG on rat bladder epithelium as well as monkey esophagus (Fig 2, B).
D. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. Both PNP and pemphigus vulgaris demonstrate intercellular depositions of IgG on monkey esophagus, but only PNP demonstrates this finding on rat bladder epithelium, with identification of autoantibodies directed against plakins, among which autoantibodies to envoplakin and periplakin are the most specific.
E. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. IIF shows the presence of intercellular IgG deposits which are not found in bullous pemphigoid.

### Successful management of recurrent erythema multiforme with upadacitinib: a case report [^e3755148]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism of EM pathogenesis has been described in HSV-induced EM. It is believed to result from a cell-mediated immune reaction against viral antigen-positive cells containing the HSV DNA polymerase gene.

Recurrent EM is defined as 6 or more episodes per year, with 61% to 100% of cases caused by HSV infection. A Mayo Clinic study found that 60% of cases were idiopathic, but some patients may have had subclinical HSV infections.

The diagnosis of EM is made clinically, as there is significant histopathologic overlap with other mucocutaneous eruptions, notably Mycoplasma pneumoniae -induced mucocutaneous eruption/RIME.

RIME typically affects younger patients (mean age 11.9 years) and is predominantly a mucosal eruption. Proposed diagnostic criteria require the involvement of 2 or more mucosal sites to make the diagnosis. When the skin is involved, the body surface area that is affected is minimal.

The diagnosis of EM is based on the distribution of skin lesions, which are classically bilateral and symmetric and affect the extremities, including the palms, dorsal hands, elbows, knees, and feet. Mucosal involvement may be present but does not typically predominate.

Recurrent EM poses a significant treatment challenge. Antiviral prophylaxis is the primary treatment. In a study of 20 patients with EM, 7 of 11 in the daily acyclovir arm did not experience recurrence while taking the drug. Recurrence is frequently observed if antivirals are stopped.

Prophylactic antiviral treatments include valacyclovir (500 mg daily or twice a day), famciclovir (250 mg twice a day), or acyclovir (400 mg twice a day). Responsive patients are advised to continue treatment for 1 to 2 years. Should EM recur after discontinuation, treatment should resume for an additional 6 to 12 months. Dosages may be doubled for nonresponsive patients.

Alternative options for those resistant to antiviral treatments include azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine, thalidomide, and cyclosporine.

Our patient was treated with upadacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It affects the JAK-STAT pathway by binding to JAK1, blocking the phosphorylation and activation of STAT, thereby disrupting the proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascade. Upadacitinib is used for various conditions in dermatology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis.

### Recurrent-associated reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption responsive to systemic steroids: a case series [^ca322b1f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance has worked toward creating pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of severe mucocutaneous eruptions, as case definitions are taken from the adult literature without widely accepted pediatric criteria. The proposed reclassification categories are: epidermal necrolysis, which includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis due to their similar etiology and management; erythema multiforme, without major or minor forms; and a new term, reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME), to encompass diverse parainfectious eruptions, including Mycoplasma -induced rash and mucositis. Cases that are considered RIME under this categorization are usually characterized by a severe mucositis of 2 or more mucous membranes, with a prodrome that usually includes a cough.

Cases that fall within the RIME category tend to be single occurrences in most patients. However, there is a subset of patients with recurrent episodes estimated to be about 8% in a systematic review of cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae –associated mucocutaneous disease. However, recurrent episodes have not been well-characterized, especially among pediatric patients. In this case series, to raise awareness of this unique subset of cases, we describe recurrent cases of RIME due to M. pneumoniae in 3 adolescent patients. In the setting of no standard therapy for RIME, we were able to successfully treat the episodes in all 3 cases with systemic steroids.
