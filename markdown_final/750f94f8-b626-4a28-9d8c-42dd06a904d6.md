## Question

When should angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors be initiated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and reduced ejection fraction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) should be started in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), specifically regarding the timing after diagnosis, during hospitalization, after decompensation, and in relation to other guideline-directed therapies. They are also interested in whether ACE inhibitors should be initiated in the inpatient setting, how to transition to ARNI when appropriate, and practical considerations for integrating ACE inhibitors into the overall treatment plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indications for ACE inhibitors in HFrEF and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify whether ACE inhibitors remain appropriate if an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) is preferred but not immediately feasible. Next, I will examine inpatient initiation and discharge strategies, including when to continue versus start therapy and the risks of withholding or withdrawing it. After that, I need to review how to integrate ACE inhibitors within the four-pillar regimen and whether simultaneous or sequential initiation is preferred. Finally, I should confirm dose selection, titration, monitoring, contraindications, and special situations such as switching to ARNI, hypotension, renal impairment, and HFpEF, and synthesize a concise clinical recommendation with safety guardrails.

> Let me first confirm the foundational role of ACE inhibitors in HFrEF and the evidence base supporting their use, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond the data. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in symptomatic HFrEF, with benefits seen across NYHA class II–IV and in diverse populations, and these effects are consistent across different ACE inhibitors, supporting a class effect and a Class I recommendation in major guidelines for patients with LVEF ≤ 40% or ≤ 35% depending on the guideline year and context [^112etcg9] [^116fqw3B] [^112atdFE] [^1142kefx].

> Wait, let me verify the contemporary positioning relative to ARNI, because guidelines now prioritize ARNI over ACE inhibitors in many patients. ACC/AHA and ESC documents endorse ARNI as the preferred renin–angiotensin system (RAS) therapy in HFrEF, but if ARNI is contraindicated or unavailable, ACE inhibitors remain an essential alternative to reduce morbidity and mortality; direct de novo ARNI initiation without prior ACE inhibitor pretreatment is safe and effective, and a strict 36-hour washout is required when switching from ACE inhibitor to ARNI to mitigate angioedema risk, so I need to be explicit about this operational detail [^114WfeQa] [^115GMNgr] [^112LzAVo] [^111tgZod].

> I will now examine the timing relative to diagnosis and disease stage, because delays worsen outcomes. In symptomatic HFrEF (Stage C), ACE inhibitors should be initiated promptly once hemodynamics are stable, ideally at diagnosis, with continuation long term even if symptoms improve, and in asymptomatic LV dysfunction (Stage B) ACE inhibitors should be initiated to prevent progression and reduce events. Contemporary guidance also emphasizes early initiation of foundational therapies, so I should not defer unnecessarily once the patient is stable enough to tolerate neurohormonal antagonism [^114o8xWv] [^1162QVKw] [^112M6F9m] [^117FkYVe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inpatient versus outpatient starts; I should double-check the inpatient evidence. Observational data from large registries show that continuation or initiation of ACE inhibitors/ARBs at discharge after acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with significantly lower 30-day and 1-year mortality and fewer readmissions, whereas discontinuation or failure to start increases risk, and inpatient initiation of foundational therapies is explicitly recommended when feasible with close follow-up to monitor tolerance and titration [^114pZSEx] [^114HSxWk].

> Let me think about the inpatient operational approach, because timing within the admission matters. After stabilization from acute decompensation, initiating ACE inhibitors prior to discharge is appropriate, and when patients are already on therapy, it should generally be continued unless there is hemodynamic instability or contraindication. In contrast, abruptly withdrawing ACE inhibitors during hospitalization is harmful and should be avoided outside of life-threatening complications, so I need to ensure I am not inadvertently causing harm by stopping a life-saving therapy [^114pZSEx] [^114pcpB4].

> Next, I should review integration with the four-pillar regimen and the initiation sequence, because the old stepwise paradigm can delay benefit. Contemporary guidance favors early, rapid implementation of all four foundational classes (ARNI or ACE inhibitor/ARB, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor), even at subtarget doses initially, with subsequent titration, given additive and largely independent benefits; while I initially thought we should always complete ACE inhibitor titration before adding beta-blockers, I need to correct that thinking, as simultaneous initiation and early up-titration of complementary classes is now supported to accelerate clinical benefit [^117FkYVe] [^112M6F9m] [^114uom3G] [^115fUL8P].

> I should confirm practical dose selection and titration details for ACE inhibitors, because starting low and going slow can become starting low and staying low if I don't plan ahead. Typical starting doses include enalapril 2.5 mg twice daily, lisinopril 2.5–5 mg daily, or ramipril 1.25 mg daily, with up-titration every 1–2 weeks as tolerated toward target doses used in trials, and I should check renal function and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation and after dose changes, recognizing that even subtarget doses confer meaningful benefit and that many patients never reach target doses in routine practice without a deliberate titration plan [^113eDiob] [^115FpKZ8] [^114pcpB4] [^117SSeYZ].

> But wait, what if I plan to switch to ARNI soon? I need to ensure safe transition. When converting from an ACE inhibitor to sacubitril/valsartan, a strict 36-hour washout is required to reduce angioedema risk, and initial ARNI dosing should reflect prior ACE inhibitor dose, with lower starting doses in patients with lower blood pressure, older age, or reduced renal function, followed by reassessment in 1–2 weeks and titration toward 97/103 mg twice daily as tolerated; this transition should not be delayed solely because an MRA has not yet been started [^111tgZod] [^1126X48v] [^115JkSHx].

> I need to check safety and tolerability guardrails, especially for hypotension, renal function, and hyperkalemia, because these commonly derail optimization. For persistent symptomatic hypotension, I should consider reducing loop diuretic dose or using lower starting doses of ACE inhibitors, and for a creatinine rise up to about 30% from baseline with stable clinical status, continuation with close monitoring is reasonable, whereas potassium above about 6.0 mmol/L or a creatinine rise exceeding roughly 30% should prompt holding therapy temporarily. I should also remember that abrupt ACE inhibitor withdrawal is harmful unless there is life-threatening instability [^114VxH5m] [^11771YbR] [^114pcpB4].

> Let me consider special populations, because the risk–benefit calculus can shift. In patients with advanced kidney disease, ACE inhibitors can still confer benefit with careful monitoring, though evidence is more limited in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and data are sparse in dialysis, so I should individualize and not deprive patients of potential benefit without a compelling reason. Conversely, in HFpEF, ACE inhibitors are not first-line disease-modifying therapy and should not be initiated solely for HFpEF in the absence of another indication such as hypertension or CAD, given neutral mortality and modest, uncertain effects on hospitalizations in trials [^114xVJo6] [^1162Bd1N] [^111aBDwR] [^11586yZw].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and cautions to avoid preventable harm. Absolute contraindications include a history of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, hereditary angioedema, and pregnancy, while bilateral renal artery stenosis and severe hyperkalemia require caution. Coadministration with NSAIDs can blunt efficacy and worsen renal function, and potassium-sparing agents increase hyperkalemia risk, so I need to reconcile medications carefully and counsel patients accordingly [^114pcpB4] [^11771YbR].

> Next, I should review real-world implementation gaps, because recognizing barriers helps me close them. Despite strong evidence, ACE inhibitors and other foundational therapies remain underused and underdosed in many patients, with registries showing large proportions never reaching target doses; using structured titration protocols, nurse-led programs, or computable algorithms can increase dose attainment and is associated with better outcomes, reinforcing the need for a deliberate plan rather than passive observation [^113B9jVh] [^117SSeYZ] [^1175YU8h] [^115e85N2].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear clinical recommendation with checkpoints. Initiate ACE inhibitors in all patients with symptomatic HFrEF as soon as hemodynamically feasible, ideally at diagnosis, and continue long term even if symptoms improve. If ARNI is preferred but not immediately feasible, start ACE inhibitor now and transition later with the required 36-hour washout. In hospitalized patients, continue existing ACE inhibitors and initiate therapy prior to discharge when stable, avoiding withdrawal unless absolutely necessary. Integrate ACE inhibitors with the other foundational classes early, titrate toward target doses as tolerated with laboratory monitoring, and adjust for hypotension, renal function, and hyperkalemia proactively rather than abandoning therapy [^112etcg9] [^114WfeQa] [^117AQkVA] [^112M6F9m].

---

ACE inhibitors should be initiated in all patients with HFrEF as soon as they are hemodynamically stable, ideally **within 24–48 hours of hospital discharge** or at diagnosis in outpatients [^117AQkVA] [^notfound]. Start at low doses and titrate every 1–2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated doses, monitoring blood pressure, renal function, and potassium [^115FpKZ8] [^114pcpB4]. If ARNI is not available or tolerated, use ACE inhibitors as the preferred alternative [^115GMNgr] [^114WfeQa]. Early initiation reduces mortality and hospitalizations; **do not delay** unless contraindicated [^116fqw3B] [^117FkYVe].

---

## Indications for ACE inhibitor initiation in HFrEF

- **Class I recommendation**: Initiate ACE inhibitors in patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) to reduce mortality and hospitalizations [^115vBJm4] [^1156htyc].
- **Alternative therapy**: Use ACE inhibitors when ARNI is not available or tolerated [^115GMNgr] [^114WfeQa].
- **Prevention**: Use ACE inhibitors in asymptomatic LV dysfunction (Stage B) to prevent symptomatic HF [^114o8xWv] [^1162QVKw].

---

## Timing of ACE inhibitor initiation

### Inpatient initiation

Inpatients should **start ACE inhibitors as soon as they are hemodynamically stable**, ideally within 24–48 hours of discharge, because early initiation reduces mortality and readmissions [^117AQkVA] [^114pZSEx]. However, ACE inhibitors should be **avoided in acute decompensated HF until stability is achieved** [^115vBJm4].

---

### Outpatient initiation

Outpatients should **start ACE inhibitors promptly at diagnosis**, without delay, as early therapy improves outcomes [^117FkYVe] [^115vBJm4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting early initiation

Early initiation reduces **mortality and readmissions**: inpatient or early post-discharge ACE inhibitor use lowers 30-day and 1-year mortality and readmissions [^114pZSEx] [^114HSxWk]. Underuse is associated with **worse outcomes**: delayed or omitted ACE inhibitors increase mortality and hospitalizations [^116fqw3B] [^114HSxWk].

---

## Recommended dosing and titration strategy

| **ACE inhibitor** | **Initial dose** | **Target dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Enalapril | 2.5 mg twice daily | 10–20 mg twice daily |
| Lisinopril | 2.5–5 mg once daily | 20–40 mg once daily |
| Ramipril | 1.25 mg once daily | 10 mg once daily |
| Captopril | 6.25 mg three times daily | 50 mg three times daily |

---

Titrate every 1–2 weeks to the target or maximally tolerated dose, and monitor blood pressure, renal function, and potassium during titration [^115FpKZ8] [^114pcpB4].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Blood pressure**: Monitor for hypotension, especially in patients with low SBP [^113KLuuz].
- **Renal function**: Check renal function and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation and after dose changes [^1126X48v].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium, particularly with potassium-sparing diuretics or MRAs [^116HAUpi].
- **Angioedema**: Rare but serious; monitor for airway compromise [^112vLMzg].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include a history of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, hereditary angioedema, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and pregnancy; **use with caution** in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), hyperkalemia (K+ > 5.0 mmol/L), or symptomatic hypotension [^113KLuuz] [^116HAUpi].

---

## Alternative therapies if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated

- **ARBs**: Use if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated [^114v4NAi].
- **ARNI**: Preferred alternative; observe 36-hour washout if switching from ACE inhibitor [^111tgZod].
- **Hydralazine-nitrate**: Consider in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors/ARBs, especially Black patients [^111CmPfj].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with ACE inhibitor initiation

ACE inhibitors **reduce mortality** in HFrEF, with the greatest benefit at target doses [^116fqw3B] [^115y16sn]. They also **reduce hospitalizations** for heart failure and cardiovascular causes [^112atdFE] [^111uBYcB] and improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life [^115zyJeD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate early**: Start ACE inhibitors as soon as patients are hemodynamically stable, ideally within 24–48 hours of discharge or at diagnosis [^117AQkVA] [^115vBJm4].
- **Titrate promptly**: Increase doses every 1–2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated doses [^115FpKZ8].
- **Monitor closely**: Track blood pressure, renal function, and potassium during titration [^114pcpB4].
- **Use alternatives**: If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, use ARBs or ARNI [^114v4NAi] [^115GMNgr].

---

ACE inhibitors should be initiated early in HFrEF — ideally within 24–48 hours of discharge or at diagnosis — with careful titration and monitoring; **do not delay**, as this worsens outcomes.

### Contemporary pharmacological treatment and management of heart failure [^112M6F9m]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The prevention and treatment strategies for heart failure (HF) have evolved in the past two decades. The stages of HF have been redefined, with recognition of the pre-HF state, which encompasses asymptomatic patients who have developed either structural or functional cardiac abnormalities or have elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides or cardiac troponin. The first-line treatment of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction includes foundational therapies with angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and diuretics. The first-line treatment of patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction or with HF with preserved ejection fraction includes SGLT2 inhibitors and diuretics. The timely initiation of these disease-modifying therapies and the optimization of treatment are crucial in all patients with HF. Reassessment after initiation of these therapies is recommended to evaluate patient symptoms, health status and left ventricular function, and timely referral to a HF specialist is necessary if a patient has persistent advanced HF symptoms or worsening HF. Lifestyle modification and treatment of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation are crucial through each stage of HF. This Review provides an overview of the management strategies for HF according to disease stages that are derived from the recommendations in the latest US and European HF guidelines.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

### Dual angiotensin receptor and neprilysin inhibition as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with chronic systolic heart failure: rationale for and design of the prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to determine impact on global mortality and morbidity in heart failure trial (PARADIGM-HF) [^1171P8Fq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Trial design and methods

PARADIGM-HF is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active-controlled, two-arm, event-driven trial comparing the long-term efficacy and safety of enalapril and LCZ696 in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure and reduced EF (HF-REF). The trial was designed by the academic members of the Executive Committee in collaboration with Novartis personnel.

Patients

Entry criteria were as follows: (i) age 18 years or older and able to give written informed consent; (ii) NYHA functional class II–IV; (iii) LVEF ≤ 35% (initially this was ≤ 40% but changed in a protocol amendment dated 15 December 2010); (iv) plasma BNP ≥ 150 pg/mL (or NT-proBNP ≥ 600 pg/mL) at the screening visit (Visit 1, Figure 1) or a BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL (or NT-proBNP ≥ 400 pg/mL) and a hospitalization for heart failure within the last 12 months; (v) treatment with a stable dose of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day (see Table 1) for at least 4 weeks before the screening visit; and (vi) treatment with a stable dose of a beta-blocker for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit, unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Although not required, the protocol specified that an aldosterone antagonist should also be considered in all patients, taking account of renal function, serum potassium, and tolerability. If given, the dose of aldosterone antagonist should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. The key exclusion criteria are listed in Table 2.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and outcomes in heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^116WX2zm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction remains unclear.

Methods

Of the 10,570 patients aged ≥ 65 years with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (≥ 40%) in the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (2003–2004) linked to Medicare (through December 2008), 7304 were not receiving angiotensin receptor blockers and had no contraindications to ACE inhibitors. After excluding 3115 patients with pre-admission ACE inhibitor use, the remaining 4189 were eligible for new discharge prescriptions for ACE inhibitors, and 1706 received them. Propensity scores for the receipt of ACE inhibitors, calculated for each of the 4189 patients, were used to assemble a cohort of 1337 pairs of patients, balanced on 114 baseline characteristics.

Results

Matched patients had a mean age of 81 years and mean ejection fraction of 55%, 64% were women, and 9% were African American. Initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with a lower risk of the primary composite end point of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization during 2.4 years of median follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–0.99; p = 0.028), but not with individual end points of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.05; p = 0.373) or heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83–1.05; p = 0.257).

Conclusion

In hospitalized older patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction not receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, discharge initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with a modest improvement in the composite end point of total mortality or heart failure hospitalization but had no association with individual end point components.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

### Identifying optimal doses of heart failure medications in men compared with women: a prospective, observational, cohort study [^113DCkLy]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guideline-recommended doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and β blockers are similar for men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even though there are known sex differences in pharmacokinetics of these drugs. We hypothesised that there might be sex differences in the optimal dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers in patients with HFrEF.

Methods

We did a post-hoc analysis of BIOSTAT-CHF, a prospective study in 11 European countries of patients with heart failure in whom initiation and up-titration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers was encouraged by protocol. We included only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, and excluded those who died within the first 3 months. Primary outcome was a composite of time to all-cause mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure. Findings were validated in ASIAN-HF, an independent cohort of 3539 men and 961 women with HFrEF.

Findings

Among 1308 men and 402 women with HFrEF from BIOSTAT-CHF, women were older (74 [12] years vs 70 [12] years, p < 0.0001) and had lower bodyweights (72 [16] kg vs 85 [18] kg, p < 0.0001) and heights (162 [7] cm vs 174 [8] cm, p < 0.0001) than did men, although body-mass index did not differ significantly. A similar number of men and women reached guideline-recommended target doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (99 [25%] vs 304 [23%], p = 0.61) and β blockers (57 [14%] vs 168 [13%], p = 0.54). In men, the lowest hazards of death or hospitalisation for heart failure occurred at 100% of the recommended dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers, but women showed approximately 30% lower risk at only 50% of the recommended doses, with no further decrease in risk at higher dose levels. These sex differences were still present after adjusting for clinical covariates, including age and body surface area. In the ASIAN-HF registry, similar patterns were observed for both ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers, with women having approximately 30% lower risk at 50% of the recommended doses, with no further benefit at higher dose levels.

Interpretation

This study suggests that women with HFrEF might need lower doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β blockers than men, and brings into question what the true optimal medical therapy is for women versus men.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^11586yZw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors: An ARB may be used when an ARNI is contraindicated or unaffordable, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not considered a reasonable alternative due to lack of benefit with perindopril in PEP-CHF, which enrolled 850 older adults (aged ≥ 70 years) and LVEF > 40%. In CHARM-Preserved, 3,023 participants with LVEF ≥ 40% randomized to candesartan (target dose of 32 mg daily) versus placebo showed a borderline significant effect on the primary composite (adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74–1.00) and a moderate reduction in HF hospitalizations (adjusted HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.00). In I-PRESERVE, 4,128 participants aged ≥ 60 years with LVEF ≥ 45% randomized to irbesartan (target dose of 300 mg daily) versus placebo had no reduction in the primary composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86–1.05); study drug discontinuation was 34% and background ACE inhibitor use was 40%.

We explored timing, settings and predictors of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) initiation in a large, nationwide cohort of patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods and Results

Patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction < 40%) registered in the Swedish HF Registry in 2017–2021 and naïve to ARNI were evaluated for timing and location of, and their characteristics at ARNI initiation. ARNI use increased from 8.3% in 2017 to 26.7% in 2021. Among 3892 hospitalized patients, 8% initiated ARNI in-hospital or ≤ 14days after discharge, 4% between 15 and 90days, and 88% > 90days after discharge or never initiated. Factors associated with earlier initiation included follow-up in specialized HF care, more severe HF, previous HF treatment use and higher income, whereas older age, higher comorbidity burden and living alone were associated with later/no initiation. Of 16486 HFrEF patients, 8.1% inpatients and 5.9% outpatients initiated an ARNI at the index date. Factors associated with initiation in outpatients were overall consistent with those linked with an in-hospital/earlier ARNI initiation; 4.9% of 10209 with HF duration < 6months and 9.1% of 5877 with HF duration ≥ 6months initiated ARNI. Predictors of ARNI initiation in HF duration < 6months were inpatient status, lower ejection fraction, hypertension, whereas previous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with less likely initiation. Discontinuation at 1year ranged between 13% and 20% across the above-reported analyses.

Conclusions

In-hospital and early initiation of ARNI are limited in real-world care but still slightly more likely than in outpatients. ARNI were more likely initiated in patients with more severe HF, which might suggest its use as a second-line treatment and only following worsening of clinical status. One-year discontinuation rates were consistent regardless of the timing/setting of ARNI initiation.

Evidence in favor of ACE-inhibitor treatment in HFpEF

Clinical evidence of ACEI benefit in HFpEF is limited for various reasons outlined above. CONSENSUSrequired increased heart size on chest X-ray, making it likely that many patients had HFrEF. However, chest X-ray is an imperfect means to discriminate between HFrEF and HFpEF. Thus, patients with HF as a consequence of myocardial infarction, hypertensive eccentric hypertrophy (reduced LVEF), and hypertensive concentric hypertrophy (preserved LVEF) were included in the CONSENSUS population, and retrospect, the classification could not be determined. The clinical consequence of CONSENSUS and subsequent RCTs, including SOLVD, was straightforward, namely, that enalapril and other ACEIs quickly became the standard treatment for all HF patients with no immediate thoughts of LVEF or at least no thoughts of excluding HFpEF patients from this powerful treatment. It took 20 years from the publication of CONSENSUSand 15 years after SOLVDbefore a serious attempt to investigate the prognostic effect of ACEI in HFpEF patients was performed, namely Perindopril vs. Placebo in Congestive Heart Disease (PEP-CHF).

PEP-CHF was a prospective RCT with older patients but with fewer participants than planned (n = 852) and was hampered by several other challenges regarding the study design and statistical power. The investigators overestimated the event rate and underestimated the discontinuation rate, therefore encountering, in a 1-year interim analysis, lower than expected event rate, widespread drop-out and drop-in rates, and a very high rate of open-label ACEI use (Table 4), resulting in the steering committee stopping further inclusion of patients. Although PEP-CHF did not enroll the planned number of participants, the 1-year interim analysis showed a borderline significant effect on the primary endpoint, a composite of mortality and hospitalization for HF worsening. This finding was driven by the prespecified secondary endpoint of HF hospitalization, which was significantly lower in perindopril users. Although the analysis was not planned for year 1, and despite the confounding issues, PEP-CHF showed a preventive effect on hospitalization for the worsening of HF. PEP-CHF likely showed such strong results because patients included after echocardiography had confirmed cardiac disease that could explain HFpEF. The PEP-CHF investigators gave open ACEI treatment to one-third of the participating patients outside the protocol, including patients in the control group. Such liberal use of ACEI treatment contributed strongly to minimizing the visible effect of the study drug.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure — practical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) emphasizes that treatment with an ACEI should be initiated at low doses, and renal function and serum potassium should be assessed within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter; because fluid retention can blunt benefits and fluid depletion can potentiate adverse effects, healthcare providers should ensure that patients are being given appropriate doses of diuretics before and during treatment. Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials; if these target doses of an ACEI cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used, and clinicians should not delay the institution of beta-blockers in patients because of a failure to reach target ACEI doses. Once titrated, patients can generally be maintained on long-term therapy with an ACEI with little difficulty; although symptoms may improve within the first 48 hours, the clinical responses are generally delayed and may require several weeks, months, or more to become apparent, and even if symptoms do not improve, long-term treatment with an ACEI should be maintained to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment with an ACEI should be avoided in the absence of life-threatening complications; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided; the use of an ACEI can also minimize or eliminate the need for long-term potassium supplementation; and in hemodynamically or clinically unstable patients it may be prudent to interrupt treatment with the ACEI temporarily until the clinical status of the patient stabilizes.

### Titration of medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117SSeYZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have medical therapy titrated to target doses derived from clinical trials, as tolerated. The degree to which titration occurs in contemporary U.S. practice is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize longitudinal titration of HFrEF medical therapy in clinical practice and to identify associated factors and reasons for medication changes.

Methods

Among 2,588 U.S. outpatients with chronic HFrEF in the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry with complete medication data and no contraindications to medical therapy, use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) were examined at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.

Results

At baseline, 658 (25%), 525 (20%), 287 (11%), and 45 (2%) patients were receiving target doses of MRA, beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB, and ARNI therapy, respectively. At 12 months, proportions of patients with medication initiation or dose increase were 6% for MRA, 10% for beta-blocker, 7% for ACEI/ARB, and 10% for ARNI; corresponding proportions with discontinuation or dose decrease were 4%, 7%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Over 12 months, < 1% of patients were simultaneously treated with target doses of ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA. In multivariate analysis, across the classes of medications, multiple patient characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of initiation or dose increase (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, higher blood pressure, lower ejection fraction) and discontinuation or dose decrease (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, impaired quality of life, more severe functional class). Medical reasons were the most common reasons for discontinuations and dose decreases of each therapy, but the relative contributions from patient preference, health team, and systems-based reasons varied by medication.

Conclusions

In this contemporary U.S. registry, most eligible HFrEF patients did not receive target doses of medical therapy at any point during follow-up, and few patients had doses increased over time. Although most patients had no alterations in medical therapy, multiple clinical factors were independently associated with medication changes. Further quality improvement efforts are urgently needed to improve guideline-directed medication titration for HFrEF.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117QEwnM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

One trial (CIBIS III) was specifically designed to determine if initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker differed meaningfully from initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. A total of 1010 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction were randomized to bisoprolol 10 mg daily or enalapril 20 mg daily for 6 months, followed by combined therapy thereafter; the primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalization. There were 65 deaths and 151 hospitalizations for any reason in the bisoprolol‐first group, and 73 deaths and 159 hospitalizations for any reason in the enalapril‐first group. Patients treated with a beta‐blocker were less likely to die suddenly, but were more likely to experience early non‐fatal worsening of heart failure early following initiation of treatment. At 1 year, mortality was approximately 30% lower in the patients who had been first started on bisoprolol (P = 0.065). The results of the trial provide direct support for the premise that a beta‐blocker can be used successfully as the first neurohormonal antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, a situation akin to the use of beta‐blockers before angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in the post‐infarction setting.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^1142kefx]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects 2.4% of the American population and is expected to rise to 3% by 2030. Despite extensive developments in many other areas of cardiology, the prognosis of HF remains poor, with 5-year mortality above 50%.

In 1987, the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), a prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) that enrolled patients with severe HF of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril or placebo, demonstrated a 40% reduction in mortality in favor of enalapril.CONSENSUS was the first RCT in a new wave of research with modern pharmacotherapy that showed improved HF survival. CONSENSUS included patients without measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as LVEF was not yet established as a defining characteristic of HF.

Four years later, Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD)showed similar benefits with enalapril in HF patients with NYHA class II–III. SOLVD included patients with LVEF < 0.35, based on the ability of ACEI therapy to prevent LV dilatation and also because low LVEF was associated with a high event rate, allowing for a limited study sample size in patients with less severe HF. Furthermore, LVEF < 0.35 had been a major criterion for defining HF according to Framingham Study criteriaand therefore was initially acceptable to clinicians as an objective marker of systolic LV dysfunction. Selecting patients with HF and a reduced LVEF (HFrEF) became a standard procedure in subsequent RCTs, which documented the benefit of other drug classes, e.g. selected beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) over the coming decades.

### Initiation, continuation, or withdrawal of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers and outcomes in patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^114HSxWk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this large, multicenter cohort of 16 052 patients with HFrEF, we found that continuation or initiation of ACEi/ARB at the time of discharge after admission for ADHF was associated with lower 30‐day, 90‐day, and 1‐year mortality rates. In addition, patients who continued or initiated ACEi/ARB therapy had lower readmission rates at 30 and 90 days compared with those who discontinued or did not start therapy. Additional research to better understand the determinants of guideline adherence and ACEi/ARB initiation and discontinuation may be warranted.

### Implementation of guideline-recommended therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction according to heart failure duration: an analysis of 55 581 patients from the Swedish heart failure (swedeHF) registry [^1127tDF4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Guidelines recommend immediate initiation of all four class I guideline-directed medical therapies, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) following the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The extent to which this occurs in new-onset HFrEF is unclear. We assessed guideline-recommended therapies during the first year following a HFrEF diagnosis.

Methods and Results

The Swedish HF Registry was linked to additional national registries. In patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction < 40%), clinical characteristics and HF treatment from when they were available and recommended in guidelines were assessed according to time from HF diagnosis (< 3, 3 to < 6, 6–12 and > 12months). Of 55581 patients with HFrEF enrolled between 2000 and 2021, 54%, 5.8%, 4.8% and 36% had an HF duration of < 3, 3 to < 6, 6–12 and > 12months, respectively. Patients with shorter HF duration were younger, had lower New York Heart Association class and had fewer cardiovascular comorbidities. Within 3months, 3 to < 6months, 6–12months and > 12months from HF diagnosis, 93%, 92%, 90% and 89% were on RASI or ARNI, 9.8%, 17%, 19% and 22% on ARNI alone, 35%, 43%, 44% and 46% on MRA, 92%, 92%, 92% and 91% on beta-blockers, and 26%, 30%, 19% and 28% on SGLT2i, respectively. Additionally, 18% received cardiac resynchronization therapy/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator > 12months after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Most patients received RASI and beta-blockers in the first months following HFrEF diagnosis. Use of ARNI, MRA and SGLT2i was limited, both in the early and later time periods. Our findings suggest that strategies to improve guideline-directed use of HFrEF therapies remain urgently needed.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^114hmNpo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

What drug treatments should be considered essential to the management of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

Accordingly, for purposes of the present review, the treatments that are considered to be essential and broadly applicable to patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are (i) inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system; (ii) neprilysin inhibitors (i.e. sacubitril/valsartan); (iii) beta‐adrenergic blockers that have been shown to prolong life (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol); and (iv) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 1, 2, 11 The evidence base for each of these drug classes is clinically persuasive and statistically robust. The magnitude of the incremental benefit of each drug class is meaningful (at least 20% reduction in the risk of death) for neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 11 Furthermore, these three classes of drugs have each been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death 18; consequently, the utilization of these drugs cannot be reasonably delayed even if patients are clinically stable. 10, 11 In contrast, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have only a modest benefit on the risk of death (5–16% risk reduction) 19; the survival benefit cannot be enhanced by intensification of treatment 20, 21; and they do not reduce the risk of sudden death. 22

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can prolong survival, but the combination may be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality. 23 Use of this drug combination in the modern era is based on an analysis of a relatively small number of events in a select population. 11 Furthermore, sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors are not considered in the current framework, since the evidence base supporting their ability to reduce mortality in patients with established heart failure is still evolving. 24 If the survival benefits are confirmed by additional trials, these drugs can be included in our proposed system.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

Chronic heart failure — routine pharmacologic therapy states that most patients with HF should be routinely managed with a combination of 3 types of drugs: a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and a beta-blocker, that patients with evidence of fluid retention should take a diuretic until a euvolemic state is achieved with continuation to prevent recurrence, that treatment with both an ACEI and a beta-blocker should be initiated and maintained in tolerating patients even if symptoms respond to diuretics, and that therapy with digoxin as a fourth agent may be initiated at any time for symptomatic and hospitalization benefits.

### Drug treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^116cgnPM]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a progressive clinical syndrome characterised by insufficient cardiac output due to structural and functional abnormalities of the heart, which can then lead to breathlessness, fatigue and fluid overload. HF has an associated high morbidity and mortality rate as well as a significant impact on healthcare resources; for example, in the UK, it accounts for 5% of National Health Service (NHS) emergency admissions. This review focuses on pharmacological treatment of chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which affects approximately 60% of patients with HF. Patient outcomes are determined by early diagnosis and individualised treatment. The cornerstone of HFrEF management consists of four key medication classes: ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). These medications constitute the four pillars of HfrEF treatment. Each class has a distinct mechanism that when used together synergistically enhances patient outcomes. In this review we discuss drug treatment options and key considerations in the management of people with chronic HFrEF. The review also highlights the importance of medication management, addressing complications and promoting lifestyle modifications.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^1178CrTH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The fact that ACEIs or ARBs, selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and good choice and dose of diuretic clinically compensated patients with symptoms and signs of HF, whatever LVEF they might have, and improved the prognosis in HFrEF patients, did not exclude the possibility that these drugs had similar beneficial prognostic effects in patients with HF and a preserved EF (HFpEF). Additionally, for most physicians taking care of decompensated HF patients, dividing into HFrEF and HFpEF subsets when recruiting patients to RCTs and excluding HFpEF patients from these drug benefits did not make sense. When working clinically with patients most HF patients were given these drugs anyway because of hypertension and/or the HF itself with apparent clinical benefits. Later, when RCTs were organized in HFpEF patients, it was too late to do studies in untreated patients without these drugs. They were already well established as background therapies in most HF patients. Surprisingly, it became an uphill effort to document the same beneficial effects in patients with HFpEF as in HFrEF.

Additionally, the RCTs of patients with HFpEF preceded the scientific documentation that systolic LV dysfunction was present in most patients beyond the well-described diastolic LV dysfunction. More refined echocardiographic measures of systolic LV function within the preserved LVEF range showed reduced LV mid-wall shortening, stroke volume (SV), and global longitudinal strain. Longitudinal axis shortening could be partly or completely missing as a sign of extensive systolic dysfunction, an echocardiographic observation in patients with HFpEF since the 1990s or even earlier. Thus, most HF patients have systolic dysfunction, whether EF is reduced or preserved.

Furthermore, the event rate in the RCTs in HFpEF was lower than in the corresponding RCTs of patients with HFrEF (Table 1), suggesting difficulties in excluding from RCTs those patients with normal to supra-normal LVEF who did not have HF and thereby could not expect to benefit substantially of the HF medications.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### A remarkable medical story: benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiac patients [^112atdFE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) has been one of the most remarkable stories in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have several acute and sustained hemodynamic effects that are beneficial in the presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. They increase cardiac output and stroke volume and reduce systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The hemodynamic benefits are associated with improvement in the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as decreased mortality, regardless of the severity of CHF. In patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, therapy with ACE inhibitors prevented the development of CHF and reduced hospitalization and cardiovascular death. They also increase survival when administered early after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Most recently, ACE inhibition was associated with improved clinical outcomes in a broad spectrum of high-risk patients with preserved LV function. The mechanism of ACE inhibitors benefits is multifactorial and includes prevention of progressive LV remodeling, prevention of sudden death and arrhythmogenicity and structural stability of the atherosclerotic process. Evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors are underutilized in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Efforts should be directed to prescribe ACE inhibitors to appropriate patients in target doses. It is reasonable to believe that ACE inhibitors have a class effect in the management of LV dysfunction with or without CHF and acute MI. Whether the same is true for ACE inhibitors in the prevention of ischemic events is not known yet.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor washout period prior to angiotensin receptor / neprilysin inhibitor initiation in the inpatient setting [^111tBgJL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2022 AHA-ACC HFSA Guideline for Management of Heart Failure recommend initiating an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who can tolerate an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). The manufacturer recommends initiating a 36-hour washout period when switching from ACEi to ARNI due to an increased risk of adverse effects, including angioedema. This study investigated the adherence to the washout period when transitioning from ACEi to ARNI at a community hospital.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the rate of adherence to the 36-hour washout when transitioning patients from ACEi to ARNI. Secondary outcomes included heart failure exacerbation readmission rates within 90 days and the rate of adverse effects (angioedema, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with HFrEF who were transitioned from ACEi to ARNI during their hospital stay between March 1, 2016 and December 31, 2022. Patients were excluded if they did not receive an ACEi or ARNI during their admission or if they had an ejection fraction > 40%. Pearson chi-square was used to analyze categorical data.

Results

Of 33 patients included in this study, 67% received the full 36-hour washout period when transitioning from ACEi to ARNI. There were no significant differences between the rates of hospital readmissions or adverse effects between the groups. No patients experienced hyperkalemia or angioedema.

Conclusion and Relevance

This is the first study to our knowledge to describe real-world prescribing practices when transitioning patients from ACEi to ARNI for the treatment of HFrEF. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to provide more data on prescribing practices outside this single center. Future research should also include pharmacist's role in adhering to the recommended washout.

### Holistic approach to drug therapy in a patient with heart failure [^113choNT]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a growing global public health problem affecting at least 26million people worldwide. The evidence-based landscape for HF treatment has changed at a rapid rate over the last 30 years. International guidelines for the management of HF now recommend the use of four pillars in all patients with reduced ejection fraction: angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors or ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors. Beyond the main four pillar therapies, numerous further pharmacological treatments are also available in specific patient subtypes. These armouries of drug therapy are impressive, but where does this leave us with individualised and patient-centred care? This paper reviews the common considerations needed to provide a holistic, tailored and individual approach to drug therapy in a patient with HF with reduced ejection fraction, including shared decision making, initiating and sequencing of HF pharmacotherapy, drug-related considerations, polypharmacy and adherence.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — pharmacologic recommendations: In patients with HFmrEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Among patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 41%–49%), use of evidence-based beta blockers for HFrEF, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### Renin-angiotensin inhibition and outcomes in HFrEF and advanced kidney disease [^1162Bd1N]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, less is known about their effectiveness in patients with HFrEF and advanced kidney disease.

Methods

In the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF), 1582 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) had advanced kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Of these, 829 were not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) prior to admission, of whom 214 were initiated on these drugs prior to discharge. We calculated propensity scores for receipt of these drugs for each of the 829 patients and assembled a matched cohort of 388 patients, balanced on 47 baseline characteristics (mean age 78 years; 52% women; 10% African American; 73% receiving beta-blockers). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated comparing 2-year outcomes in 194 patients initiated on ACE inhibitors or ARBs to 194 patients not initiated on those drugs.

Results

The combined endpoint of heart failure readmission or all-cause mortality occurred in 79% and 84% of patients initiated and not initiated on ACE inhibitors or ARBs, respectively (HR associated with initiation, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63–0.98). Respective HRs (95% CI) for the individual endpoints of - Respective HRs (95% CI) for the individual endpoints of all-cause mortality and heart failure readmission were 0.81 (0.63–1.03) and 0.63 (0.47–0.85).

Conclusions

The findings from our study add new information to the body of cumulative evidence that suggest that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors may improve clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF and advanced kidney disease. These hypothesis-generating findings need to be replicated in contemporary patients.

Transition to angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) — washout and mineralocorticoid antagonist considerations: In patients without contraindications, when switching from an ACE inhibitor to an ARNI, a 36-hour washout period should be strictly observed; this delay is not required when switching from an ARB. The document states that lack of treatment with a mineralocorticoid antagonist should not delay initiating or switching a patient to an ARNI. Among individuals with LVEF ≤ 35% initiated on sacubitril/valsartan, after 12 months of ARNI treatment, 61% had an LVEF > 35%.

### Insights into foundational therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115Qn96Z]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The "foundational" therapies for heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; RAS, renin angiotensin system; SGLT2, sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2

Until recently, guidelines recommended a gradual, stepwise, introduction of these therapies in the order in which the landmark clinical trials using each treatment were conducted. Moreover, it was recommended that the dose of each therapy was titrated to the target dose used in the relevant trial before the next treatment was added. Practically, this meant starting with a RAS blocker i.e. an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), adding a beta‐blocker, then an MRA, followed by a neprilysin inhibitor (by switching from an ACE inhibitor or ARB to sacubitril valsartan) and, if this approach was continued, finally starting an SGLT2 inhibitor (the most recent "foundational" therapy). If the dose of each treatment was titrated to the target dose before initiating the next, the commencement of all "foundational" therapies could take as long as 6 months, with patients not receiving several of these life‐saving therapies for much of this period. This paradigm is now considered outdated and a more rapid introduction of "foundational" therapy has recently been advocated. Crucially, the newly recommended strategy prioritizes the initiation of each therapy as quickly as possible over the uptitration of the dose of any individual therapy. While attempting to titrate to the target dose is still essential, it is now considered to be a secondary goal, with starting all four life‐saving "foundational" treatments, at least in a low dose, as the primary objective. This is because, as discussed below, even sub‐target doses of these therapies have substantial benefits which are apparent within weeks of starting treatment. Also, the new guidelines no longer recommend initiating treatment in the historical sequence, following the chronology of the clinical trials, and the order in which each foundational therapy is started does not matter and may be based on other considerations such as potential pharmacological synergies related to safety and patient profile and likely tolerability. In the remainder of this article, we will explain the basis of this paradigm shift in our approach to the pharmacological management of HFrEF.

Sacubitril/valsartan dosing — specific patient populations: For patients on high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy (> 10 mg total daily dose of enalapril or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ACE inhibitor), the initial dose is 49/51 mg twice daily. For low- or medium-dose ACE inhibitor (≤ 10 mg total daily dose of enalapril or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ACE inhibitor) or low- or medium-dose angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (≤ 160 mg total daily dose of valsartan or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ARB), and for those with severe kidney impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), or elderly patients (age ≥ 75 y), the initial dose is 24/26 mg twice daily. The table notes that this severe kidney impairment population was not studied in the PARADIGM-HF trial.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^112W36r3]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have reviewed the core principles of up-to-date HFrEF management and this is timely with two recent and very significant changes in standard of care (ARNI and SGLT2i) which both represent major advances in the field. The hierarchy of medical treatments for HFrEF is a current area for guideline development in the UK, but the most recent European and North American guidelines are unequivocal in recommending the rapid initiation of all four drug classes (ACEi/ARNI, βB, MRA and SGLT2i) in HFrEF. This highlights the need for integrated heart failure services to be involved in the care of patients with HFrEF from the point at which the syndrome is diagnosed to direct further investigation and optimum management. The misconception among some in the wider cardiology community that heart failure is 'just four drugs' needs to be robustly challenged and evidence supports the concept that all patients with HFrEF should have their care directed by a physician with a subspeciality interest in heart failure and involving a wider MDT with heart failure specialist nurses at its core.

Key messages

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is distinct from that of preserved ejection fraction in its therapeutic goals. These are predominated by the four pillars of disease-modifying therapy.
The four pillars consist of ACE inhibitors/sacubitril–valsartan, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.
An approach which concentrates on the phenotype of the individual patient with the goal to establish the four pillars of treatment as rapidly as possible should be employed for all patients with HFrEF.
Heart failure nurse specialists along with involvement of other members of the multidisciplinary team are important to ensure these goals can be met as part of a supported self-management programme.
All patients with HFrEF and who are on optimal medical therapy should be considered for device therapy. Those with a broad QRS are highly likely to benefit from cardiac resynchronisation therapy and many patients stand to benefit from implantable defibrillators.

### Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction influenced by background therapy? Expectations and realities of a new standard of care [^114uom3G]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Effects of dapagliflozin in DAPA-HF according to background heart failure therapy' †, by K.F. Docherty et al. on page.

Many drugs that antagonize endogenous neurohormonal systems reduce the risk of death in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, the magnitude of the survival benefit with each agent has not been influenced by concomitant treatment with other life-prolonging drugs. In the post-infarction patient, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decreased the mortality rate in patients already receiving beta-blockers. Conversely, in patients with established heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, beta-blockers reduced the risk of death in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. The mortality reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in an early trial where few patients were treated with a beta-blocker was similar to that seen in a later trial where most patients were receiving a beta-blocker. In subgroup analyses of clinical trials, the survival benefits of a neurohormonal antagonist have not been meaningfully affected by the intensity of use of other important treatments for heart failure.

The concept that each neurohormonal antagonist exerts favourable effects that are independent of the benefits of other treatments is critically important to physicians. In clinical practice, most patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are treated with only a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system and a beta-blocker, often in doses that are much smaller than the target doses that were effective in large-scale clinical trials. Presumably, some practitioners believe that such limited neurohormonal antagonism is sufficient, perhaps based on an assumption that a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker achieves adequate normalization of the neurohormonal environment. However, this belief is not supported by the available evidence. The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a neprilysin inhibitor to an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker leads to a further substantial reduction in the risk of death; modelling estimates suggest that mortality can be reduced by an additional 40–50% with more comprehensive neurohormonal blockade.

### Indications for ACE inhibitors in vascular disease… [^113QjUXX]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Halkin and Keren reviewed the indications for this class of medication. The Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trial compared an ACE inhibitor with placebo and found that the risks of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina were reduced significantly in patients taking the ACE inhibitor. Rates of acute coronary syndromes were also reduced. In the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial, ACE inhibitors were shown to reduce all-cause mortality in MI survivors and the risk of recurrent infarction. A number of other trials have yielded similar results. The risk of cardiac events that seems to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture is reduced by the use of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors seem to have an anti-inflammatory effect that restricts vessel wall inflammation.

These agents also have antithrombotic properties. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation trial was terminated prematurely when it was discovered that ramipril-treated patients had significantly lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, cardiac arrest, worsening angina, heart failure, MI, and stroke, compared with those who received placebo. To date, there are no studies showing "definitive evidence" that one ACE inhibitor is preferable to another in terms of efficacy. ACE inhibitors are standard treatment in patients with reduced systolic left ventricular function, patients who have had an MI, and patients with diabetes who are also hypertensive or nephropathic. After MI, patients who can be projected to receive the most benefit from ACE inhibitors are those with CHF, decreased ejection fraction, and anterior myocardial damage. Almost all patients who receive ACE inhibitors will also be appropriately treated with aspirin.

One study found that five-year mortality was lower in patients taking an ACE inhibitor plus aspirin than in those taking an ACE inhibitor alone. Similar results were found in patients with CHF who were taking both medicines. The authors recommend that patients without contraindications to ACE inhibitors should receive this class of medication if they have either established atherosclerosis or diabetes mellitus plus an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Further testing is needed to determine whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists will have the same beneficial effects as ACE inhibitors.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^11771YbR]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system are cornerstones of the management of patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, RAAS inhibitors may cause decline in renal function and/or hyperkalaemia, particularly during initiation and titration, intercurrent illness and during worsening of heart failure. There is very little evidence from clinical trials to guide the management of renal dysfunction. The Renal Association and British Society for Heart Failure have collaborated to describe the interactions between heart failure, RAAS inhibitors and renal dysfunction and give clear guidance on the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with HFrEF. During initiation and titration of RAAS inhibitors, testing renal function is mandatory; a decline in renal function of 30% or more can be acceptable. During intercurrent illness, there is no evidence that stopping RAAS inhibitor is beneficial, but if potassium rises above 6.0mmol/L, or creatinine rises more than 30%, RAAS inhibitors should be temporarily withheld. In patients with fluid retention, high doses of diuretic are needed and a decline in renal function is not an indication to reduce diuretic dose: if the patient remains congested, more diuretics are required. If a patient is hypovolaemic, diuretics should be stopped or withheld temporarily. Towards end of life, consider stopping RAAS inhibitors. RAAS inhibition has no known prognostic benefit in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Efforts should be made to initiate, titrate and maintain patients with HFrEF on RAAS inhibitor treatment, whether during intercurrent illness or worsening heart failure.

### Heart failure guidelines: what's new? [^116bXTqZ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Heart Failure is a global epidemic, affecting approximately 5 million adults in the U.S. A. The cornerstone of contemporary pharmacological therapy targets the over activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic autonomic systems. The 2016 focused pharmacologic update on the current Heart Failure Guidelines introduces the use of two newly approved regimens valsartan/sacubitril and ivabradine. Over the last two decades, guideline directed medical therapy has accomplished significant improvement in survival rates among heart failure patients; however these novel compounds were reported to exert additional mortality and morbidity benefits, in heart failure subpopulations with reduced ejection fraction.

Why are patients receiving subtarget doses of critical treatments?

In clinical practice, physicians initiate treatment at a low 'starting dose', but most patients continue to receive the starting dose for long periods of time, often indefinitely, with no or minimal uptitration. When new treatments are initiated at low doses during a hospitalization for heart failure, these doses are typically maintained following discharge. 25 This pattern of practice is prevalent whether patients are treated by primary care physicians or by heart failure specialists.

A striking example is the prescribing of sacubitril/valsartan. The drug is commonly initiated at 24/26 mg twice daily, but is uptitrated only in a small fraction of patients. 26 In contrast, few patients received long‐term treatment with 24/26 mg twice daily in the large‐scale clinical trial that established the survival benefit of neprilysin inhibition (PARADIGM‐HF). 27, 28 All patients in that trial received target doses of the drug at randomization, and > 70% were maintained on this dose for the duration of the study 27; yet, in clinical practice, < 25% of patients are ever titrated to the target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Interestingly, 40% of the patients who required temporary dose reduction in PARADIGM‐HF were subsequently restored to target doses. In contrast, in clinical practice, the vast majority of dose reductions are permanent, leading to indefinite treatment with subtarget doses.

The approach to treating life‐threatening heart failure in clinical practice differs markedly from that used by oncologists to treat life‐threatening cancers. Cancer specialists initiate simultaneous therapy with multiple‐drug regimens at target doses and down‐titrate only if serious adverse reactions occur that cannot be mitigated with additional treatments. Efforts to prolong life are valued far more highly than efforts to minimize drug toxicity. In striking contrast, the treatment of heart failure is routinely initiated with low doses of a single drug; additional therapies are added at a later time; and avoidance of adverse effects represents the clinical priority. The difference in the two approaches is medically inexplicable, since heart failure is more lethal than most forms of cancer. 29 Furthermore, the median improvement in survival produced by most treatments for heart failure exceeds that for most therapies for metastatic cancer.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^112xChpH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) affects more than 64 million people worldwide and is increasing in prevalence, especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Mortality and risk of HF hospitalization remain high and quality of life and functional capacity are poor.

Since the first heart transplantation in 1967, there has been remarkable development of medical therapy beyond diuretics and digitalis. Current class I guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the form of the four foundational classes — angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), beta‐blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2/1 inhibitors (SGLT2/1i) — antagonizes or modulates neurohormonal activation and additionally has favourable effects on the heart, kidney, vasculature and on inflammation and metabolism. The clinical effects extend to important improvements in quality of life and reductions in the risk of hospitalization for HF, and cardiovascular (CV) or all‐cause mortality. While for many decades GDMT was available only for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), SGLT2/1i are now recommended across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum, and the remaining three foundational drug classes may also be considered in HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF).

Despite these advances, outcomes over time have been suggested both to be improving and to be worsening. The major reason is poor implementation of existing therapy. Implementation science analyses have described quality indicators and reasons for poor initiation, up‐titration, adherence, and persistence. However, there have been no comprehensive studies of therapeutic decision making (i.e. changes in medical therapy) according to acute and outpatient HF care, chronic and de novo HF, and across the different EF categories. The rationale and design of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF III Registry have been described. Here we present the first co‐primary analysis from the HF III Registry, providing a comprehensive analysis of contemporary HF characteristics and GDMT decisions.

Blood pressure management with ARNI: ARNIs may exert a greater blood pressure-lowering effect compared with ACE inhibitors/ARBs; therefore, for patients with lower blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg), careful administration and follow-up are advised, and in patients who are not obviously congested and have otherwise stable clinical profiles, decreasing the dose of loop diuretic agents may mitigate hypotension with sacubitril/valsartan.

Background

U.S. guidelines recommend consideration of sacubitril/valsartan in chronic heart failure (HF) and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF). Whether initiation is safe and effective in EF > 40% after a worsening heart failure (WHF) event is unknown.

Objectives

PARAGLIDE-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) assessed sacubitril/valsartan vs valsartan in EF > 40% following a recent WHF event.

Methods

PARAGLIDE-HF is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of sacubitril/valsartan vs valsartan in patients with EF > 40% enrolled within 30 days of a WHF event. The primary endpoint was time-averaged proportional change in amino terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through Weeks 4 and 8. A secondary hierarchical outcome (win ratio) consisted of: 1) cardiovascular death; 2) HF hospitalizations; 3) urgent HF visits; and 4) change in NT-proBNP.

Results

In 466 patients (233 sacubitril/valsartan; 233 valsartan), time-averaged reduction in the NT-proBNP was greater with sacubitril/valsartan (ratio of change: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73–0.999; P = 0.049). The hierarchical outcome favored sacubitril/valsartan but was not significant (unmatched win ratio: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.93–1.52; P = 0.16). Sacubitril/valsartan reduced worsening renal function (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.93) but increased symptomatic hypotension (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.09–2.76). There was evidence of a larger treatment effect in the subgroup with EF ≤ 60% for NT-proBNP change (0.78; 95% CI: 0.61–0.98) and the hierarchical outcome (win ratio: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09–1.95).

Conclusions

Among patients with EF > 40% stabilized after WHF, sacubitril/valsartan led to greater reduction in plasma NT-proBNP levels and was associated with clinical benefit compared with valsartan alone, despite more symptomatic hypotension.

### Translating the 2021 ESC heart failure guideline recommendations in daily practice: results from a heart failure survey. A scientific statement of the ESC council for cardiology practice and the heart failure association of the ESC [^114NHR33]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Real-world data show that guidelines are insufficiently implemented, and particularly guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) are underused in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in clinical practice. The Council for Cardiology Practice and the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed a survey aiming to (i) evaluate the perspectives of the cardiology community on the 2021 ESC heart failure (HF) guidelines, (ii) pinpoint disparities in disease management, and (iii) propose strategies to enhance adherence to HF guidelines.

Methods and Results

A 22-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HFrEF was delivered between March and June 2022. Of 457 physicians, 54% were general cardiologists, 19.4% were HF specialists, 18.9% other cardiac specialists, and 7.7% non-cardiac specialists. For diagnosis, 52.1% employed echocardiography and natriuretic peptides (NPs), 33.2% primarily used echocardiography, and 14.7% predominantly relied on NPs. The first drug class initiated in HFrEF was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ACEi/ARNi) (91.2%), beta-blockers (BB) (73.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (53.4%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.1%). The combination ACEi/ARNi + MRA+ BB was preferred by 39.3% of physicians, ACEi/ARNi + SGLT2 inhibitors + BB by 33.3%, and ACEi/ARNi + BB by 22.2%. The time required to initiate and optimize GDMT was estimated to be < 1month by 8.3%, 1–3months by 52%, 3–6months by 31.8%, and > 6months by 7.9%. Compared to general cardiologists, HF specialists/academic cardiologists reported lower estimated time-to-initiation, and more commonly preferred a parallel initiation of GDMT rather than a sequential approach.

Conclusion

Participants generally followed diagnostic and treatment guidelines, but variations in HFrEF management across care settings or HF specialties were noted. The survey may raise awareness and promote standardized HF care.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation and titration for HFrEF emphasize early, rapid implementation of the 4-drug regimen based on contemporary evidence. Established pharmacological therapies for chronic HFrEF include angiotensin II receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), evidence-based beta-blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, mineralocorticoid antagonists, loop diuretic agents, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat, and in contrast, use of digoxin as a treatment for HFrEF lacks contemporary data and is focused on rate control in atrial fibrillation in those with low blood pressure. Using a therapeutic standard 4-drug regimen (ARNI, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, SGLT inhibitor), 4-class initiation reduced the hazard of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for HF compared with ACE inhibitor/ARB plus a beta-blocker (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.3–0.47). Among patients admitted with acute HF, a high-intensity strategy targeting doses within 6 weeks of discharge was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a reduced risk of 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission compared with usual care. In higher-risk HFrEF with worsening symptoms, vericiguat was superior to placebo in reducing HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death and subsequently received a Class 2b recommendation in the updated 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline. The document notes the need for more frequent follow-ups, especially after initiation or titration, which may be in-person or virtual depending on patient stability and adjustments.

### Overview of randomized trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure… [^116fqw3B]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

Objective. — To evaluate the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Data Sources and Study Selection. — Data were obtained for all completed, published or unpublished, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors that were at least 8 weeks in duration and had determined total mortality by intention to treat, regardless of sample size. Trials were identified based on literature review and correspondence with investigators and pharmaceutical firms. Data Extraction. — Using standard tables, data were extracted by one author and confirmed where necessary by the other author or the principal investigator of the trial. Unpublished data were obtained by direct correspondence with the principal investigator of each study or pharmaceutical firm. Data Synthesis. — The data for each outcome were combined using the Yusuf-Peto adaptation of the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Overall, there was a statistically significant reduction in total mortality and in the combined endpoint of mortality or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. Similar benefits were observed with several different ACE inhibitors, although the data were largely based on enalapril maleate, captopril, ramipril, quinapril hydrochloride, and lisinopril. Reductions for total mortality and the combined endpoint were similar for various subgroups examined. However, patients with the lowest ejection fraction appeared to have the greatest benefit. The greatest effect was seen during the first 3 months, but additional benefit was observed during further treatment. The reduction in mortality was primarily due to fewer deaths from progressive heart failure; point estimates for effects on sudden or presumed arrhythmic deaths and fatal myocardial infarction were less than 1 but were not significant. Conclusions. — Total mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart failure are significantly reduced by ACE inhibitors with consistent effects in a broad range of patients.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^112CoAPZ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-5 — Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) defines the performance measure as the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge; prescribed may include an outpatient prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking the medication, and for inpatients a prescription at discharge or continuation after discharge documented on the discharge medication list. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with heart failure and current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with exclusions for heart transplant and LVAD; exceptions include documentation of medical reasons (eg, intolerance) or patient reasons (eg, patient refusal) for not prescribing. The measurement period specifies ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI therapy initiated within a 12-mo period of being seen in the outpatient setting or from hospital discharge, and care settings include outpatient and inpatient.

### Medical therapy during hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the VICTORIA registry [^111k7jir]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients hospitalized for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), guidelines recommend optimization of medical therapy prior to discharge. The degree to which changes in medical therapy occur during hospitalizations for HFrEF in North American clinical practice is unclear.

Methods

The VICTORIA registry (Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction) enrolled patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HFrEF across 51 sites in the United States and Canada from February 2018-January 2019. In patients with complete medication data who were not receiving dialysis, use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were assessed at admission and discharge.

Results

Of 1695 patients, the median (IQR) age was 69 (59–79) years, and 33% were women. Among eligible patients, 33%, 25% and 55% were not prescribed ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA at discharge, respectively; 99% were not prescribed SGLT2i. For each medication, > 50% of patients remained on stable subtarget doses or no medication during hospitalization. In-hospital rates of initiation/dose increase were 20% for ACEI/ARB, 4% for ARNI, 20% for beta-blocker, 22% for MRA, and < 1% for SGLT2i; corresponding rates of dose decrease/discontinuation were 11%, 2%, 9%, 5%, and < 1%, respectively. Overall, 17% and 28% of eligible patients were prescribed triple therapy prior to admission and at discharge, respectively. At both admission and discharge, 1% of patients were prescribed triple therapy at target doses. Across classes of medication, multiple factors were independently associated with higher likelihood of in-hospital initiation/dosing increase (eg, Canadian enrollment, white race, admission to intensive care units) and discontinuation/dosing decrease (eg, worse renal function, admission to intensive care units).

Conclusions

In this contemporary North American registry of patients hospitalized for worsening chronic HFrEF, for each recommended medical therapy, the large majority of eligible patients remained on stable subtarget doses or without medication at admission and discharge. Although most patients had no alterations in medical therapy, hospitalization in Canada and multiple patient characteristics were associated with higher likelihood of favorable in-hospital medication changes.

### Temporal patterns in the medical treatment of congestive heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in older adults, 1989 through 1995… [^117NAJ6s]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Evidence from clinical trials in the past decade has consistently shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. The extent to which clinical practice has adopted ACE inhibitor therapy is unknown. Methods. Results Use of ACE inhibitors to treat CHF increased slightly over time among prevalent cases at each annual examination: 26% of prevalent CHF cases were treated in 1989–1990 compared with 36% of prevalent cases in 1994–1995. This 10% increase was statistically significant. Participants with low ejection fractions were 2 times more likely to be treated with ACE inhibitors than were those with normal ejection fraction and this tendency did not change over time. Among cases newly diagnosed in the year before the 1990–1991 examination, 42% were using ACE inhibitors; among those newly diagnosed in the year before 1994–1995, 40% were using ACE inhibitors.

This 2% decrease was not statistically significant. THE EVIDENCE supporting the beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in patients with congestive heart failure has been accumulating since the publication of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study 1 in 1987. The CONSENSUS demonstrated a significant 40% reduction in mortality for participants treated with enalapril maleate compared with those treated with placebo. A recently published meta-analysis3 of 32 clinical trials of patients with CHF demonstrated a 35% overall reduction in mortality or hospitalizations for CHF among the ACE inhibitor group compared with the placebo group. The benefit was seen across all 8 ACE inhibitors. Treatment effects were even more pronounced among patients with EFs of 0. 25 or less compared with those with EFs above 0.
25. Change in the use of ACE inhibitors over time to treat prevalent CHF cases was analyzed by comparing the percentage who used ACE inhibitors at the baseline examination, 1989–1990, to the percentage who used ACE inhibitors at the last follow-up examination, 1994–1995. Comparisons were made among all prevalent cases and among those with normal and low EFs. The use of ACE inhibitors to treat CHF increased slightly over time in prevalence analyses: 26% were treated in 1989–1990 compared with 36% in 1994–1995. This 10% increase in ACE inhibitor use was statistically significant. The increases among participants with normal EF and low EF were comparable, yet only the increase among those with normal EF was statistically significant.

The relative odds of being treated with ACE inhibitors for participants with low EF compared with those with normal EF did not change from 1989–1990 to 1994–1995. Eighty-seven percent of the data were collected from hospitalization records. Among those cases with data, ACE inhibitors were used in 26%, 53%, 50%, 46%, and 42% of participants immediately after a CHF diagnosis in 1990–1991, 1991–1992, 1992–1993, 1993–1994, and 1994–1995, respectively. The 2% decrease in use was not statistically significant. Although the relative odds of using ACE inhibitors among participants with low EF increased from 1. 5 in 1990–1991 to
4. 5 in 1994–1995, the CIs overlap and we cannot conclude that the odds differ. Interestingly, the near-doubling of ACE inhibitor use in this subset between the first and second follow-up examinations coincided with the publication of SOLVD.

### Four pillars of heart failure: contemporary pharmacological therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117SdzcV]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

How did we get here?

Heart failure guidelines are based around inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems, two fundamental pathways which drive the pathophysiology of HFrEF using ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers. In both Europeanand American guidelinesadditional therapies are recommended for patients who 'remain symptomatic' with persistently impaired left ventricular (LV) function despite maximally tolerated doses of ACEi and beta-blockers. These guidelines differ subtly regarding the timing of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) relative to other therapies but are otherwise broadly similar, advocating a linear approach. This attempts to avoid 'unnecessary' treatments in patients who 'respond' but has several important limitations. First, while guidelines do not stipulate a time interval between alterations to therapy, the need for further assessment and re-evaluation of LV function inevitably results in delays initiating additional agents as well as contributing further follow-up and imaging costs. In clinical practice it typically takes many months before patients receive optimised doses of these medications, and many never do, even where integrated hospital and community care is available. Second, the barrier of 'response' is confusing and misplaced: does 'response' mean asymptomatic or merely improved? In our experience, while patients often feel better, they rarely become asymptomatic (NYHA (New York Heart Association) class 1), an observation supported by real-world data even in those receiving ARNI. Moreover, we should consider whether a highly subjective and poorly reproducible assessment is appropriate to determine our allocation of life-saving treatments. Hence, criteria requiring repeat assessment act as a barrier to initiating additional therapies such as MRA or ARNI, which are regarded as 'second-line' due to the hierarchical framework which places greater emphasis on therapies based on the chronological sequence in which the trials were performed. There is no logical basis to assume that drug classes trialled earliest would be the most beneficial, yet this is what guidelines imply. Therefore, if we are to make progress, future guidelines must address these limitations and incorporate the Four Pillars of Heart Failure into a comprehensive disease modifying programme for all people living with HFrEF.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111aBDwR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); a review of the evidence is required to determine whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with HFpEF.

Search Methods

We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and one clinical trial register on 14 May 2020 to identify eligible studies, with no language or date restrictions. We checked references from trial reports and review articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design, enrolling adults with HFpEF, defined by LVEF greater than 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 41 randomised controlled trials (231 reports), totalling 23,492 participants across all comparisons. The risk of bias was frequently unclear and only five studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Beta-blockers (BBs) We included 10 studies (3087 participants) investigating BBs. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 years to 81 years. A possible reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; three studies), however, the certainty of evidence was low. There may be little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 1105 participants; four studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, and quality of life remain uncertain. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) We included 13 studies (4459 participants) investigating MRA. Eight studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.5 to 80 years. Pooled analysis indicated that MRA treatment probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB = 41; 3714 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MRA treatment probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 4207 participants; five studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 4070 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). MRA treatment may have little or no effect on quality of life measures (mean difference (MD) 0.84, 95% CI -2.30 to 3.98; 511 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). MRA treatment was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 11; 4291 participants; six studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) We included eight studies (2061 participants) investigating ACEIs. Three studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 70 to 82 years. Pooled analyses with moderate-certainty evidence suggest that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.42; 945 participants; two studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45; 1187 participants; five studies) and heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 1019 participants; three studies), and may result in little or no effect on the quality of life (MD -0.09, 95% CI -3.66 to 3.48; 154 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on hyperkalaemia remain uncertain. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating ARBs were included. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in three the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 61 to 75 years. Pooled analyses with high certainty of evidence suggest that ARB treatment has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% 0.90 to 1.14; 7254 participants; three studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; 7964 participants; four studies), heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02; 7254 participants; three studies), and quality of life (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.86 to 1.67; 3117 participants; three studies). ARB was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; two studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) Three studies (7702 participants) investigating ARNIs were included. Two studies used ARBs as the comparator and one used standardised medical therapy, based on participants' established treatments at enrolment. The mean age of participants ranged from 71 to 73 years. Results suggest that ARNIs may have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 4796 participants; one study; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 7663 participants; three studies; high-certainty evidence), or quality of life (high-certainty evidence). However, ARNI treatment may result in a slight reduction in heart failure hospitalisation, compared to usual care (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7362 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). ARNI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia compared with valsartan (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01; 5054 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA and ARNI treatment in HFpEF probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation but probably has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and quality of life. BB treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however, further trials are needed. The current evidence for BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs is limited and does not support their use in HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication. Although MRAs and ARNIs are probably effective at reducing the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, the treatment effect sizes are modest. There is a need for improved approaches to patient stratification to identify the subgroup of patients who are most likely to benefit from MRAs and ARNIs, as well as for an improved understanding of disease biology, and for new therapeutic approaches.

### Do evidence-based treatments provide incremental benefits to patients with congestive heart failure already receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? A secondary analysis of one-year outcomes from the assessment of treatment with lisinopril and survival (ATLAS) study [^113iJnfq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), use of submaximal doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ie, low-dose ACE inhibitors) represents usual care in routine clinical practice, whereas high-dose ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and digoxin have each been shown to improve outcomes.

Objective

We examined whether treatment with high dose-ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and digoxin would each provide incremental benefits over that achieved with usual care and whether concurrent use of high-dose ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and digoxin would provide maximal benefits.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled, active-comparator trial. Specifically, we studied 1-year outcomes data from the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival trial (ATLAS), which assessed high-dose ACE inhibitors (mean dosage, 33.2 mg daily lisinopril) versus low-dose ACE inhibitors (mean dosage, 4.5 mg daily lisinopril) in patients of any age with advanced CHF in 287 centers in 19 countries in the 1990s. In our analysis, patients were classified by their use of low-dose or high-dose ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and/or digoxin at the time of randomization. The primary outcome of interest was the ATLAS composite end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for any reason at 1 year. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for baseline differences in patient characteristics.

Results

The 3164 patients in the ATLAS study had a mean (SD) age of 64 (10) years; 2516 patients (80%) were men and 648 (20%) were women; mean (SD) left-ventricular ejection fraction was 23% (6%); and 2671 patients (84%) had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. At 1 year, the mortality rate was 13% (408 patients); 43% (1369 patients) had ≥ 1 hospitalization; and the composite end point of mortality or hospitalization was 47% (1489 patients). Most patients (2873; 91%) remained on their initial treatment regimen. Compared with low-dose ACE inhibitors (n = 471), the composite end point decreased incrementally with the use of high-dose ACE inhibitors (n = 475) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.93; P = NS), high-dose ACE inhibitors plus beta-blockers (n = 72) (aOR, 0.89; P = NS), and high-dose ACE inhibitors plus beta-blockers plus digoxin (n = 77) (aOR, 0.47; P = 0.006). In absolute proportions, patients receiving high-dose ACE inhibitors plus beta-blockers plus digoxin for 1 year had 12% fewer deaths and hospitalizations than patients receiving low-dose ACE inhibitors alone.

Conclusions

Compared with usual care for patients with CHF, in this analysis, an evidence-based strategy that incorporated high-dose ACE inhibitors plus beta-blockers plus digoxin was associated with incrementally greater reductions in morbidity and mortality. These findings support treatment guidelines that recommend the concurrent use of all available proven efficacious treatment in patients with advanced CHF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renin-angiotensin system inhibition is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. The clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients is recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. In an RCT comparing valsartan/sacubitril with enalapril, the ARNI reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization significantly, by 20%. The use of ARNI is associated with the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency and may lead to angioedema, as well.

### Lessons toto for optimizing heart Failure medications [^115fUL8P]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is an established global public health burden that affects 64 million people worldwide. Hospitalizations for heart failure cost ∼$24,000 each and account for 65% of all medical costs for this morbid syndrome. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the cornerstone for reducing heart failure hospitalizations, prolonging survival, and reducing costs. The 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America heart failure guidelines recommend the initiation of 4 classes of medications in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker if use of ARNI is not feasible, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. These medications may be initiated either simultaneously or sequentially, with the goal of achieving target doses studied in landmark clinical trials.

### Time to triple therapy in patients with de novo heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a population-based study [^111YBvot]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Quadruple therapy is recommended for the management of patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In order to provide background and identify barriers to quadruple therapy, in this study, the aim was to explore the time to initiation of triple therapy in a population-based cohort of patients with de novo HF.

Methods

Adult patients with de novo hospital or emergency department (ED) diagnosis of HF between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2018, in Alberta, Canada, were included and were linked to echocardiography data to identify patients with HFrEF (EF ≤ 40%). Any treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers/ angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was captured if prescribed for ≥ 28 days and filled at least once during the 12 months after the index episode.

Results

Among 14,092 patients with de novo HF and available echocardiography data, 54.9% had HFrEF. By 1 year after diagnosis, of those in the HFrEF cohort, 9.5% had received no therapy, 27.5% monotherapy, 41.6% dual therapy, and 21.4% triple therapy. The median (interquartile range) of time to mono-, dual- and triple therapy in patients with HFrEF were 1 (0, 26), 8 (0, 44), and 14 (0, 52) days, respectively. Patients who received triple therapy were younger, more likely to be male and to have higher frequencies of coronary artery disease, higher glomerular filtration rates and lower left ventricular ejection fraction levels compared to their counterparts. Patients with triple therapy had lower rates of clinical outcomes compared to those on no, mono or dual therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.17 for the composite outcome of death, hospitalization due to HF, or ED visit due to HF).

Conclusion

Despite guideline recommendations, triple therapy is underused and is slowly deployed in patients with HFrEF, even after hospitalization and ED presentation.

### Update on therapy for heart failure [^1163wDV3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The success of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure has led to investigations of other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although ACE inhibitors remain first-line drugs in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, clinical evidence suggests that a newer class of agents — angiotensin II receptor blockers — may provide additional benefit by blocking the adverse effects of angiotensin II more completely. An improved adverse-effect profile also makes angiotensin II receptor blockers appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on the combined endpoints of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has additive benefits in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. The most recent treatment guidelines for heart failure recommend the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers and spironolactone in selected patients.

Stage B structural heart disease without heart failure symptoms — Class I care includes the following. All Class I recommendations for Stage A should apply to patients with cardiac structural abnormalities who have not developed HF (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate). Beta-blockers and ACEIs should be used in all patients with a recent or remote history of MI regardless of EF or presence of HF (see Table 3) (Level of Evidence: A). Beta-blockers are indicated in all patients without a history of MI who have a reduced LVEF with no HF symptoms (see Table 3 and text) (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in patients with a reduced EF and no symptoms of HF, even if they have not experienced MI (Level of Evidence: A). An ARB should be administered to post-MI patients without HF who are intolerant of ACEIs and have a low LVEF (Level of Evidence: B). Patients who have not developed HF symptoms should be treated according to contemporary guidelines after an acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Coronary revascularization should be recommended in appropriate patients without symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: A).

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: medical management [^114bS3nc]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has advanced in recent decades, and patients are surviving longer. The goals of HFrEF treatment are to reduce mortality, hospitalizations, and the severity of symptoms while improving functional status and quality of life. Treatments shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, known as guideline-directed medical therapy, include renin-angiotensin system/neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Guidelines recommend initiation with target dose titration within 6 to 12 weeks of diagnosis. Secondary therapies such as digoxin, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat are indicated in certain patients with persistent or worsening symptoms. Guideline-directed medical therapy may require dosage adjustment due to adverse effects such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, and worsening kidney function. Intravenous iron replacement is recommended in patients with iron deficiency to improve functional status and quality of life. Device and interventional therapies may be indicated in those with prolonged QRS duration to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death. Point-of-care ultrasonography can help diagnose heart failure and assess effectiveness of diuretic therapy.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension — treatment thresholds, targets, and agents are described as follows: in patients with HFrEF, antihypertensive drug treatment should start (if not already initiated) when BP is > 140/90 mmHg, and because outcomes for patients with heart failure have repeatedly been shown to be poor if BP values are low, it may be wise to avoid actively lowering BP to < 120/70 mmHg; heart failure guideline-directed medications are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with HFrEF, with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) all effective in improving clinical outcome; if further BP lowering is required, a dihydropyridine CCB may be considered; sacubitril/valsartan lowers BP, has also been shown to improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF, and is indicated as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs; non-dihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and verapamil), alpha-blockers, and centrally acting agents, such as moxonidine, should not be used.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — a de novo angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) approach is now preferred with close follow-up and serial assessments, and for those with contraindications to even low-dose ARNI (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg), consideration should be given for an ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at very low doses; when initiating ARNI, the Writing Committee recommends that the decision occurs within a framework of shared decision-making, and if ARNI is not accessible because of cost, an ACE inhibitor/ARB should be used to reduce morbidity and mortality, with patients who later find ARNI cost-prohibitive transitioned to an ACE inhibitor/ARB.

### Initiation, continuation, or withdrawal of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers and outcomes in patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1156htyc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Almost 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure (HF). By 2030, that figure is projected to surpass 8 million. Over the past decade, HF has accounted for over 1 million hospitalizations annually. 1 Readmission rates are also high, with over 50% of discharged patients readmitted within the next 6 months. 2 The age‐adjusted mortality, after an admission for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), is ~10% at 30 days, 30% at 1 year, and as high as 50% by 5 years. 1

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown in multiple large clinical trials to improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and improve survival in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) clinical guidelines make it a Class I, Level A recommendation to use ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with HFrEF both to "prevent symptomatic heart failure" and to "reduce morbidity and mortality". 8 In addition, the ACC/AHA HF Performance Measures recommend ACEi/ARB for outpatients with HFrEF and ACEi/ARB therapy at the time of hospital discharge for inpatients with HFrEF. 9 These clinical guidelines and quality metrics, along with their associated incentives, have led to significant improvements in the rates of ACEi/ARB use over time.

Continuation of β‐blocker therapy at the time of hospital discharge has been shown to reduce both readmission and mortality rates after ADHF admissions. 10, 11, 12 The impact of continuing or discontinuing ACEi/ARB after ADHF hospitalization has not been as well studied. This study aims to define the relationship between the continuation or withdrawal of ACEi/ARB therapy and the outcomes of patients with HFrEF hospitalized for ADHF.

Primary Measures and Definitions

Among those eligible for the study and without a contradiction to ACEi/ARB therapy, we created and defined 4 patient groups for comparison: patients on ACEi/ARB at admission and discharge (continued), those not on ACEi/ARB at admission but who were discharged on ACEi/ARB (started), those on ACEi/ARB at admission but not at discharge (discontinued), and those not on ACEi/ARB at admission or discharge (not started).

The primary endpoint of this study was the difference in all‐cause mortality at 30 days between those who continued versus discontinued ACEi/ARB at the time of discharge. Secondary endpoints included differences between those who continued and those who discontinued ACEi/ARB therapy in 90‐day and 1‐year mortality rates and differences in 30‐day, 90‐day and 1‐year readmission rates. Tertiary endpoints include differences between those who continued and those who discontinued ACEi/ARB therapy in rates of the composite endpoint of all‐cause death and all‐cause readmission at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year.

All participating institutions are required to comply with local regulatory and privacy guidelines and to submit the GWTG protocol for review and approval by their institutional review board. Because data are used mainly at the local site for quality improvement, sites were granted a waiver of informed consent under the common rule. The Duke Clinical Research Institute served as the primary analytic center for the aggregate de‐identified data. The Duke University Institutional Review Board approved the study.

### Toleration of high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure… [^115y16sn]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

After 2 weeks, a third 10-mg tablet of lisinopril or matching placebo was added, and these doses were maintained for up to 54 months. Asterisk indicates that an additional 210 patients did not have a record of previous ACE inhibitor use. Schematic diagram of the disposition of the 3793 patients who entered the trial and received lisinopril during the open-label tolerability period. ACE indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; EF, ejection fraction. Background Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure, but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses. The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose lisinopril in CHF.

Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0. 30 were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction. Withdrawals occurred in 27. 1% of the high- and
30. 7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance generally tolerated the high-dose strategy. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.

DURING THE past 15 years, a series of studies and large clinical trials have established the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 1–3 as well as in those with asymptomatic4 and postmyocardial infarction left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 5, 6 These trials demonstrated that ACE inhibitors prolong survival, prevent hospitalizations, improve clinical status, and prevent progressive left ventricular dysfunction. mg OD), was associated with a trend toward reduced mortality and a significantly lower risk for death or hospitalization for any cause. 20 The present study addresses in depth the second critical dimension of this issue, ie, whether a strategy of using these high doses can be implemented with acceptable safety and tolerability.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of sacubitril / valsartan in patients with heart failure: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112cZmkt]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, an estimated 37 million people have a diagnosis of heart failure. The lifetime risk for developing heart failure is approximately 20%. The prevalence of heart failure is increasing, presumably caused by an increase in both life expectancy and risk factors leading to heart failure as well as improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events.

Guidelines recommend treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with a beta-blocker and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)). It is recommended to add a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist in patients who remain symptomatic after this initial treatment.

New drugs for heart failure have been developed and approved that combine inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway (with an ARB) with inhibition of the neprilysin enzyme. These new types of drugs are classified as angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).

The European Society of Cardiology recommends ARNIs as a replacement for ACE-I in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (EF < 35%) who remain symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) II to IV) despite optimal medical therapy with an ACE-I, a beta-blocker and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist (unless there are contraindications). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Failure Society of America, make similar recommendations.

To our knowledge, the effects of ARNIs have not been assessed previously in a systematic review.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117AQkVA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC 2024 heart failure hospitalization focused update — executive summary highlights that heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6.7 million Americans and that patients admitted with HF have a 20% to 30% risk of death within 1 year, with goals of hospitalization including assessment and optimization of therapy to address the long-term trajectory after discharge. The update harmonizes with the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and ECDP documents concerning optimization of therapy in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and Figure 1 places increased emphasis on establishing all 4 pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF in the hospital, when possible, along with ensuring appropriate follow-up to monitor tolerance and continue titration. The figure also now includes sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition; given the robust evidence for safety and efficacy of SGLT inhibitors, their use can be considered earlier than or concomitant with neurohormonal antagonists such as beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs). For initiation strategies, patients may have a new HFrEF diagnosis, in which case initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted; patients with chronic HF on partial GDMT should receive personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI, if appropriate, and caution is required for patients with chronic Class IV HF with decompensated HF, some of whom may not tolerate neurohormonal antagonists, even in low doses.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Nurse-led titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-adrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin receptor blockers for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1175YU8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is associated with high mortality and hospital readmissions. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can improve survival and reduce hospital readmissions and are recommended as first-line therapy in the treatment of heart failure. Evidence has also shown that there is a dose-dependent relationship of these medications with patient outcomes. Despite this evidence, primary care physicians are reluctant to up-titrate these medications. New strategies aimed at facilitating this up-titration are warranted. Nurse-led titration (NLT) is one such strategy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in terms of safety and patient outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL Issue 11 of 12, 19/12/2014), MEDLINE OVID (1946 to November week 3 2014), and EMBASE Classic and EMBASE OVID (1947 to 2014 week 50). We also searched reference lists of relevant primary studies, systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and unpublished theses sources. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and/or ARBs comparing the optimisation of these medications by a nurse to optimisation by another health professional in patients with HFrEF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (AD & JC) independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. We contacted primary authors if we required additional information. We examined quality of evidence using the GRADE rating tool for RCTs. We analysed extracted data by risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous data to measure effect sizes of intervention group compared with usual-care group. Meta-analyses used the fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel method. We assessed heterogeneity between studies by Chi(2) and I(2).

Main Results

We included seven studies (1684 participants) in the review. One study enrolled participants from a residential care facility, and the other six studies from primary care and outpatient clinics. All-cause hospital admission data was available in four studies (556 participants). Participants in the NLT group experienced a lower rate of all-cause hospital admissions (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88, high-quality evidence) and fewer hospital admissions related to heart failure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) compared to the usual-care group. Six studies (902 participants) examined all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality was also lower in the NLT group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92, moderate-quality evidence) compared to usual care. Approximately 27 deaths could be avoided for every 1000 people receiving NLT of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs. Only three studies (370 participants) reported outcomes on all-cause and heart failure-related event-free survival. Participants in the NLT group were more likely to remain event free compared to participants in the usual-care group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.77, moderate-quality evidence). Five studies (966 participants) reported on the number of participants reaching target dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This was also higher in the NLT group compared to usual care (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, low-quality evidence). However, there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis. We rated the risk of bias in these studies as high mainly due to a lack of clarity regarding incomplete outcome data, lack of reporting on adverse events associated with the intervention, and the inability to blind participants and personnel. Participants in the NLT group reached maximal dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in half the time compared with participants in usual care. Two studies reported on adverse events; one of these studies stated there were no adverse events, and the other study found one adverse event but did not specify the type or severity of the adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

Participants in the NLT group experienced fewer hospital admissions for any cause and an increase in survival and number of participants reaching target dose within a shorter time period. However, the quality of evidence regarding the proportion of participants reaching target dose was low and should be interpreted with caution. We found high-quality evidence supporting NLT as one strategy that may improve the optimisation of beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulting in a reduction in hospital admissions. Despite evidence of a dose-dependent relationship of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, ACEIs, and ARBs with improving outcomes in patients with HFrEF, the translation of this evidence into clinical practice is poor. NLT is one strategy that facilitates the implementation of this evidence into practice.

### Effects of candesartan in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left-ventricular systolic function taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors: the CHARM-added trial [^111uBYcB]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have favourable effects on haemodynamic measurements, neurohumoral activity, and left-ventricular remodelling when added to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We aimed to find out whether these drugs improve clinical outcome.

Methods

Between March, 1999, and November, 1999, we enrolled 2548 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40% or lower, and who were being treated with ACE inhibitors. We randomly assigned patients candesartan (n = 1276, target dose 32 mg once daily) or placebo (n = 1272). At baseline, 55% of patients were also treated with beta blockers and 17% with spironolactone. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat.

Findings

The median follow-up was 41 months. 483 (38%) patients in the candesartan group and 538 (42%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.85 [95% CI 0.75–0.96], p = 0.011; covariate adjusted p = 0.010). Candesartan reduced each of the components of the primary outcome significantly, as well as the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. The benefits of candesartan were similar in all predefined subgroups, including patients receiving baseline beta blocker treatment.

Interpretation

The addition of candesartan to ACE inhibitor and other treatment leads to a further clinically important reduction in relevant cardiovascular events in patients with CHF and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction.

### Medical therapy for heart failure with Reduced ejection fraction: the CHAMP-HF registry [^113B9jVh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines strongly recommend patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) be treated with multiple medications proven to improve clinical outcomes, as tolerated. The degree to which gaps in medication use and dosing persist in contemporary outpatient practice is unclear.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize patterns and factors associated with use and dose of HFrEF medications in current practice.

Methods

The CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry included outpatients in the United States with chronic HFrEF receiving at least 1 oral medication for management of HF. Patients were characterized by baseline use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Patient-level factors associated with medication use were examined.

Results

Overall, 3,518 patients from 150 primary care and cardiology practices were included. Mean age was 66 ± 13 years, 29% were female, and mean EF was 29 ± 8%. Among eligible patients, 27%, 33%, and 67% were not prescribed ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA therapy, respectively. When medications were prescribed, few patients were receiving target doses of ACEI/ARB (17%), ARNI (14%), and beta-blocker (28%), whereas most patients were receiving target doses of MRA therapy (77%). Among patients eligible for all classes of medication, 1% were simultaneously receiving target doses of ACE/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA. In adjusted models, older age, lower blood pressure, more severe functional class, renal insufficiency, and recent HF hospitalization generally favored lower medication utilization or dose. Social and economic characteristics were not independently associated with medication use or dose.

Conclusions

In this contemporary outpatient HFrEF registry, significant gaps in use and dose of guideline-directed medical therapy remain. Multiple clinical factors were associated with medication use and dose prescribed. Strategies to improve guideline-directed use of HFrEF medications remain urgently needed, and these findings may inform targeted approaches to optimize outpatient medical therapy.

### Implementation of guideline-recommended therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction according to heart failure duration: an analysis of 55 581 patients from the Swedish heart failure (swedeHF) registry [^111WziWt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a global public health issue leading to reduced functional status and quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations and high mortality. In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), several guideline‐recommended HF therapies are available, including renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI, i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers), angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta‐blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), which have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity. A sequential initiation and up‐titration approach of HF medications has been advocated by international guidelines over many years, which may have contributed to delayed implementation of guideline‐recommended HF therapies in clinical practice.

New‐onset HF often manifests with an acute HF hospitalization or worsening HF episode, which may also represent a challenge to HF medication initiation due to tolerance issues during or immediately following an acute decompensation. However, there is evidence of lower mortality and morbidity with an earlier initiation of guideline‐recommended HF therapies. In patients with longstanding HF, treatments may be delayed or never initiated when symptoms are stable, potentially jeopardizing the patients outcome, which further underscores the importance of earlier initiation of guideline‐recommended HF therapies.

The aim of the present analysis was to describe guideline‐recommended HF therapies implementation following a new‐onset HFrEF diagnosis, using the contemporary, large, nationwide Swedish HF (SwedeHF) Registry.

### Initiation, continuation, or withdrawal of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers and outcomes in patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^114pZSEx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend continuation or initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), in hospitalized patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Using the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure Registry, we linked clinical data from 16 052 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) patients with Medicare claims data. We divided ACEi/ARB-eligible patients into 4 categories based on admission and discharge ACEi/ARB use: continued (reference group), started, discontinued, or not started on therapy. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the association between ACEi/ARB category and outcomes. Most, 90.5%, were discharged on ACEi/ARB (59.6% continued and 30.9% newly started). Of those discharged without ACEi/ARB, 1.9% were discontinued, and 7.5% were eligible but not started. Thirty-day mortality was 3.5% for patients continued and 4.1% for patients started on ACEi/ARB. In contrast, 30-day mortality was 8.8% for patients discontinued (adjusted hazard ratio [HR adj] 1.92; 95% CI 1.32–2.81; P < 0.001) and 7.5% for patients not started (HR adj 1.50; 95% CI 1.12–2.00; P = 0.006). The 30-day readmission rate was lowest among patients continued or started on therapy. One-year mortality was 28.2% for patients continued and 29.7% for patients started on ACEi/ARB compared to 41.6% for patients discontinued (HR adj 1.35; 95% CI 1.13–1.61; P < 0.001) and 41.7% (HR adj 1.28; 95% CI 1.14–1.43; P < 0.001) for patients not started on therapy.

Conclusions

Compared with continuation, withdrawal of ACEi/ARB during heart failure hospitalization is associated with higher rates of postdischarge mortality and readmission, even after adjustment for severity of illness.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in congestive heart failure… [^115zyJeD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have had a significant impact on the treatment of congestive heart failure. Hemodynamic and clinical improvements in patients with severe CHF fostered the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in mild to moderate CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produce acute and sustained improvements in ventricular hemodynamics and quality of life. Captopril plus diuretic therapy is an effective alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate CHF. Enalapril meleate and lisinopril have been shown to be effective in moderate to severe CHF when combined with digoxin and diuretics. Captopril and enalapril also improve survival in selected patients; captopril attenuates left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. Although all angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors are similar in mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic differences impact their clinical use.

Prolonged symptomatic hypotension compromising systemic perfusion and organ function has been reported with longer-acting agents; hypotension is usually short-lived and rarely compromises organ function with shorter-acting agents.

### Evidence-based medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease [^114xVJo6]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) as identified by a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The presence of CKD is associated with more severe heart failure, and CKD itself is a strong independent risk factor of poor cardiovascular outcome. Furthermore, the presence of CKD often influences the decision to start, uptitrate, or discontinue possible life-saving HFrEF therapies. Because pivotal HFrEF randomized clinical trials have historically excluded patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2), information on the efficacy and tolerability of HFrEF therapies in these patients is limited. However, more recent HFrEF trials with novel classes of drugs included patients with more severe CKD. In this review on medical therapy in patients with HFrEF and CKD, we show that for both all-cause mortality and the combined end point of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, most drug classes are safe and effective up to CKD stage 3B (eGFR minimum 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). For more severe CKD (stage 4), there is evidence of safety and efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and to a lesser extent, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, vericiguat, digoxin and omecamtiv mecarbil, although this evidence is restricted to improvement of cardiovascular death/heart failure hospitalization. Data are lacking on the safety and efficacy for any HFrEF therapies in CKD stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis) for either end point. Last, although an initial decline in eGFR is observed on initiation of several HFrEF drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists/angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors/sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), renal function often stabilizes over time, and the drugs maintain their clinical efficacy. A decline in eGFR in the context of a stable or improving clinical condition should therefore not be cause for concern and should not lead to discontinuation of life-saving HFrEF therapies.

### ACCF and AHA release guidelines on the management of heart failure [^114NksvT]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.

Cardiac rhythm management devices: cornerstones of comprehensive, patient‐centred management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

According to current estimates, there are 60 million individuals with heart failure (HF) worldwide, and approximately one in four persons will develop HF during their lifetime.HF is a leading cause of hospitalization and its mortality remains high, with a 1‐year risk of 15–30% post‐hospital discharge. Half of the patients diagnosed with HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. Across European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, HF accounts for 5.8% of total deaths (14.6% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in females and for 4.4% of total deaths (12.5% of cardiovascular disease deaths) in males.HF can affect quality of life (QoL) and the ability to carry out activities of daily living, as well as mental health and psychosocial well‐being. A patient‐centred, multidisciplinary approach is needed to achieve timely, evidence‐based and comprehensive care, optimizing the use of all therapeutic options including medications, medical devices, surgery or other procedures, lifestyle modifications, and regular patient monitoring, while considering patients' clinical characteristics and preferences.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is characterized by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%and affects 40% to 50% of patients with HF. Current HF guidelines make strong recommendations for quadruple drug therapy in HFrEF, namely (1) angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi) (or angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB]), (2) beta‐blockers, (3) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and (4) sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Rapid initiation of foundational pharmacological therapy is recommended, and survival advantages support early initiation of comprehensive treatment over sequential initiation and titration to target doses. Practitioners are encouraged to personalize treatment based on patient characteristics and comorbidities. After initiation and optimization of quadruple therapy, additional drug therapies can be considered in selected patients.

### Heart failure [^11372cZj]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is common in adults, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing because of ageing of the population and improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events, despite the efficacy of many therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), β blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and advanced device therapies. Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population. Although some data suggest that spironolactone might improve outcomes in these patients, no therapy has conclusively shown a significant effect. Hopefully, future studies will address these unmet needs for patients with heart failure. Admissions for acute heart failure continue to increase but, to date, no new therapies have improved clinical outcomes.

### Real-world analysis of guideline-based therapy after hospitalization for heart failure [^115VbAz8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a disabling, progressive clinical syndrome characterized by inadequate ventricular filling or ejection of blood. 1 In the United States, > 650 000 people are diagnosed with HF annually, and incidence increases with age 2; estimated 5‐year mortality after diagnosis is ≈50%. 3, 4 Over 20% of patients have an HF‐related hospitalization in the year after diagnosis. 5, 6 Outcomes following HF‐related hospitalization are poor; within 30 days of hospital discharge, 25% of patients are readmitted, and 10% of patients die. 7, 8

Approximately half of patients with HF have a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), characterized by systolic dysfunction and defined clinically by a left‐ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. 1 The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that patients with HFrEF receive dual therapy with beta‐blockers (BBs) in combination with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) if patients tolerate ACEIs or ARBs. 1, 9, 10 In patients who remain symptomatic despite these therapies, the addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is recommended as triple therapy. Diuretics are used for symptomatic management of fluid retention. Most patients with HFrEF (> 98%) are candidates for guideline‐directed medical therapy, having no absolute contraindications to treatment. 11 Despite the availability and efficacy of these therapies, suboptimal use in real‐world clinical practice remains high. 11, 12, 13 As intolerance accounts for only ≈5% to 20% of underutilization in treated patients, 14 the need for prudent initiation and uptitration of HF therapies persists.

### Determinants and clinical outcome of uptitration of ACE-inhibitors and β-blockers in patients with heart failure: a prospective European study [^1141ohGk]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite clear guidelines recommendations, most patients with heart failure and reduced ejection-fraction (HFrEF) do not attain guideline-recommended target doses. We aimed to investigate characteristics and for treatment-indication-bias corrected clinical outcome of patients with HFrEF that did not reach recommended treatment doses of ACE-inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or beta-blockers.

Methods and Results

BIOSTAT-CHF was specifically designed to study uptitration of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs and/or beta-blockers in 2516 heart failure patients from 69 centres in 11 European countries who were selected if they were suboptimally treated while initiation or uptitration was anticipated and encouraged. Patients who died during the uptitration period (n = 151) and patients with a LVEF > 40% (n = 242) were excluded. Median follow up was 21 months. We studied 2100 HFrEF patients (76% male; mean age 68 ± 12), of which 22% achieved the recommended treatment dose for ACE-inhibitor/ARB and 12% of beta-blocker. There were marked differences between European countries. Reaching < 50% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and beta-blocker dose was associated with an increased risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization. Patients reaching 50–99% of the recommended ACE-inhibitor/ARB and/or beta-blocker dose had comparable risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization to those reaching ≥ 100%. Patients not reaching recommended dose because of symptoms, side effects and non-cardiac organ dysfunction had the highest mortality rate (for ACE-inhibitor/ARB: HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.43–2.01; for beta-blocker: HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.36–2.05).

Conclusion

Patients with HFrEF who were treated with less than 50% of recommended dose of ACE-inhibitors/ARBs and beta-blockers seemed to have a greater risk of death and/or heart failure hospitalization compared with patients reaching ≥ 100%.

Methods

Data Source

Data for this analysis are from the Get With The Guidelines Heart Failure (GWTG‐HF) registry linked with Medicare inpatient data. Medicare Part A (inpatient) claims and the associated denominator file from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2013 were linked with data from the GWTG‐HF registry using previously described methods and indirect identifiers. 13 Standardized data collection variables and methods for GWTG‐HF have been previously described as well. 14 GWTG‐HF is a hospital‐based, voluntary data collection and quality improvement initiative that began in 2005. Participating hospitals submit clinical information regarding in‐hospital care and outcomes of consecutive patients hospitalized for ADHF using an online Patient Management Tool (Outcome Sciences, Inc, Cambridge, MA). Linkage of GWTG‐HF data with Medicare claims data allows for both short‐ and long‐term mortality and readmission assessment.

Study Population

Patients were eligible to be included if they had a diagnosis of HF based on their GWTG records and if their GWTG record could be linked with Medicare claims. To ensure high‐quality data, we excluded patients from hospitals with ≥ 25% missing data for past medical history. This left us with a starting population of 130 155 patients from 339 hospitals. The complete study population derivation algorithm is provided in Figure S1. We excluded patients with ejection fractions that were missing or > 40% (N = 79 986) and patients with contraindications to ACEi/ARB therapy (N = 13 268, contraindication frequencies listed in Table S1) or patients who had missing ACEi/ARB contraindication data (N = 13 379). We also excluded patients who were started on inotropes, transplanted, discharged to hospice, placed on comfort measures only, died during admission, left against medical advice, were transferred to another short‐term hospital, or who were not enrolled in Medicare fee‐for‐service. If multiple hospitalizations existed for a patient, the first hospitalization was selected as the index hospitalization. The remaining population of 16 052 was used for all analyses.

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115e85N2]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization can improve outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine if a novel computable algorithm appropriately recommended GDMT.

Methods

Clinical trial data from the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) and HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trials were evaluated with a computable medication optimization algorithm that outputs GDMT recommendations and a medication optimization score (MOS). Algorithm-based recommendations were compared to medication changes. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate the associations between MOS and the composite primary end point for both trials.

Results

The algorithm recommended initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 52.8%, 34.9%, and 68.1% of GUIDE-IT visits, respectively, when not prescribed the drug. Initiation only occurred in 20.8%, 56.9%, and 15.8% of subsequent visits. The algorithm also identified dose titration in 48.8% of visits for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers and 39.4% of visits for beta-blockers. Those increases only occurred in 24.3% and 36.8% of subsequent visits. A higher baseline MOS was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21–0.80; P = 0.009) in GUIDE-IT and all-cause death and hospitalization (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44–0.84; P = 0.003) in HF-ACTION.

Conclusions

The algorithm accurately identified patients for GDMT optimization. Even in a clinical trial with robust protocols, GDMT could have been further optimized in a meaningful number of visits. The algorithm-generated MOS was associated with a lower risk of clinical outcomes. Implementation into clinical care may identify and address suboptimal GDMT in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^112WqANv]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For the GUIDE-IT visits where the patient was already prescribed an ACEI/ARB, there were 3,494 (76.5%) visits where the patient was receiving less than the target ACEI/ARB dose. The algorithm identified 1,689 (48.3%) visits where the ACEI/ARB could be up-titrated. The titration recommendations consisted of increasing the ACEI/ARB dose (79%), switching to ARNI (16%), or initiating an ACEI/ARB (the trial documentation collected "other" as the ACEI/ARB) (5%). The patients where the algorithm recommended titration had significantly higher SBP (127.1 ± 15 vs 103.3 ± 16 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), lower serum creatinine (1.3 ± 0.4 vs 1.5 ± 0.7 mg/dL; P < 0.0001), and lower potassium levels (4.2 ± 0.4 vs 4.5 ± 0.6 mEq/L; P < 0.0001) compared to the visits where the algorithm did not recommend a dose titration. There were 1,073 (23.5%) visits where the patient was at or above the target dose for the ACEI/ARB. The algorithm identified 555 visits where an ARNI could be initiated. There were 3,025 visits where the up-titration of an ACEI/ARB was able to be evaluated at the next visit. The algorithm recommended up-titration in 1,475 visits (48.7%), while the medications were only up-titrated at 358 (24.2%) of those visits.

### Titration of medical therapy and clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from the HF-ACTION trial [^111p1KSv]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend titration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to maximally tolerated doses. Patient characteristics associated with dose titration and clinical outcomes subsequent to dose titration remain poorly characterized.

Methods

Among 1999 ambulatory patients with chronic HFrEF in the HF-ACTION trial, use and dosing of ACEi and evidence-based beta-blockers were examined at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with dose escalation (medication initation or dosing increase) or dose de-escalation (medication discontinuation or dosing decrease). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine associations between dose trajectory group (stable target, stable sub-target, dose escalation, and dose de-escalation) and subsequent mortality and hospitalization outcomes.

Results

For both ACEi and beta-blockers, hospitalization for heart failure in the 6 months prior to enrollment (odds ratio [OR] 2.32 [95% confidence interval 1.58–3.42]) for ACEi; 1.42 [1.05–1.9] for beta-blockers) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.01 [1.00–1.03] per 1 mmHg increase for ACEi; 1.01 [1.00–1.02] for beta-blockers) were associated with dose escalation. Hospitalization 6 months prior to enrollment for any cause (including HF or non-HF causes) was associated with dose de-escalation (OR 1.60 [1.14–2.25] for ACEi; 1.67 [1.20–2.33] for beta-blockers). After adjustment for patient characteristics, compared with stable target dosing, dose de-escalation of either medication was associated with greater all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.64 [1.11–2.42] for ACEi; 1.62 [1.04–2.53] for beta-blockers). Compared with stable target dosing, both dose de-escalation (aHR 1.98 [1.36–2.87]) and stable sub-target dosing (aHR 1.49 [1.18–1.87]) of beta-blockers were associated with greater cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.

Conclusions

Among outpatients with chronic HFrEF, patient characteristics including recent hospitalization status and blood pressure were associated with odds of subsequent escalation and de-escalation of ACEi and beta-blocker therapy. Compared with patients receiving guildeline-recommended target doses, dose de-escalation of either medication and sub-target dosing of beta-blockers were associated with greater morbidity and mortality over long-term follow-up.

Established Heart Failure Therapies Improve Mortality in HFrEF but not HFpEF

Heart failure practice guidelines advocate that all patients with HFrEF should be prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers in the absence of any contraindication. In those patients with a moderately to severely impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be considered, to further improve prognosis. Following initiation and dose up-titration of these medications, clinicians should consider the use of medications such as hydralazine, sacubitril/valsartan, nitrites and ivabradine or, in some cases, device therapy such as cardiac resynchronization therapy.

The use of ACE inhibitors reduces renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which reduces systemic vasoconstriction, cardiac and vascular hypertrophy and the adrenal release of aldosterone, thereby modulating sodium and water retention. Likewise, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists impede the RAAS by directly inhibiting the effect of aldosterone in the kidney, reducing sodium and water retention and improving cardiac remodelling. Thus, there is good rationale for RAAS inhibition in people with HFrEF, and evidence from trials consistently demonstrates improved clinical outcomes in these patients. Additionally, overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system in people with HFrEF is responsible for systemic vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, increased left ventricular afterload, cardiac remodelling and fibrosis. Thus, beta blockers reduce the toxic effect of adrenergic excess by inhibiting the chronotropic and inotropic effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart, supporting a regression in myocardial mass and cardiac remodelling, again with favourable cardiovascular outcomes in people with HFrEF.

Unfortunately, little clinical trial evidence supporting RAAS inhibition or beta-blockade exists for people with HFpEF, often limiting treatment to risk factor management and diuresis to improve symptoms of fluid overload. Despite current management approaches, the natural history of the disease is to progress, often with significant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, people with heart failure have a projected 5-year mortality rate of 75%, and 82% require hospital readmission. Therefore, new drug therapies for people with HFpEF are essential, and the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors is attractive due to the significant number of patients with co-morbid diabetes.
