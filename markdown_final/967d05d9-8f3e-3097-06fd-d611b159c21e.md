## Question

What medicine for vestibular migraine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what medicines are used for vestibular migraine and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and diagnostic criteria to anchor treatment decisions. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for acute versus preventive therapies. Next, I will examine specific drug classes and their certainty of evidence, including any high-quality trials. After that, I need to integrate non-pharmacologic options and comorbidity-driven choices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight uncertainties and future directions, making sure I cite the best available evidence at each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic anchors, because treatment hinges on getting the diagnosis right. Vestibular migraine is defined by recurrent vestibular symptoms of moderate to severe intensity lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours, with migrainous features in at least 50% of episodes and a personal history of migraine; importantly, there is no definitive objective test, so diagnosis is clinical and often underrecognized, which can delay appropriate therapy [^987b82d7] [^d7a85193] [^683c1055].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acute treatment. I initially thought triptans might help acutely because they work for migraine headache, but wait, let me verify the randomized data. The largest RCT to date, a double-blind study of rizatriptan 10 mg versus placebo for vestibular migraine attacks, showed no superiority at 1 hour for vertigo or unsteadiness/dizziness, with only modest signals at 24 hours and no serious adverse events, so routine use of triptans for acute vestibular attacks is not supported by high-quality evidence [^a0df7c58]. Cochrane reviews likewise conclude that triptans show little to no benefit for acute vestibular symptoms and rate the evidence as very low certainty, reinforcing that we should avoid relying on triptans for acute vestibular attacks [^14bb66e7] [^8911636a].

> Next, I should review what to do acutely when an attack occurs. Let me consider symptomatic relief rather than disease-modifying therapy. Vestibular sedatives such as prochlorperazine, cyclizine, or cinnarizine can reduce vertigo and nausea during attacks, and antiemetics like domperidone can help with nausea; however, I need to ensure we limit use to fewer than 10 days per month to avoid medication-overuse headache and tolerance, and I should acknowledge that direct RCT evidence in vestibular migraine is sparse, so this is extrapolated from general dizziness practice and migraine principles [^7c517a7d] [^8b16d69a]. For headache during attacks, simple analgesics or NSAIDs remain reasonable, again with the same caution about frequency to avoid medication-overuse headache [^7c517a7d] [^8b16d69a].

> I will now examine preventive pharmacotherapy, since most patients with frequent or disabling attacks benefit from prophylaxis. Wait, let me verify the certainty of evidence before recommending anything. Cochrane reviews identify only three small RCTs: one metoprolol 95 mg daily versus placebo for 6 months, and two flunarizine 10 mg daily versus no treatment for 3 months; all outcomes are rated low to very low certainty, so we cannot declare a first-line winner from RCTs alone, though signals of benefit exist and adverse effects appear modest in these studies [^f1caff38] [^313dbbd1] [^17588af9]. A separate meta-analysis of 13 heterogeneous studies suggested improvement across several classes, but again heterogeneity and low quality preclude ranking agents, supporting a pragmatic, patient-tailored approach rather than a rigid hierarchy [^3a5b1fa7].

> Let me consider the main drug classes used in practice and their relative merits, while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. Beta-blockers such as metoprolol or propranolol are reasonable first-line options given their long track record in migraine and favorable safety in many patients, though the single RCT in vestibular migraine did not show clear superiority over placebo for vertigo frequency or quality of life, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^f1caff38] [^17588af9]. Calcium channel blockers, particularly flunarizine, show signals of benefit in small studies and are commonly used internationally, but availability varies and adverse effects like drowsiness and weight gain can limit use, so I should screen for these risks before prescribing [^a2df34fc] [^17588af9]. Antiepileptics such as topiramate or valproate are supported by migraine guidelines and observational data in vestibular migraine, with topiramate favored when weight loss is desirable and valproate avoided in women of childbearing potential; again, I should confirm comorbidities and tolerability before choosing [^17588af9] [^f93311cd]. Tricyclic antidepressants like nortriptyline or amitriptyline are useful when patients have comorbid insomnia, anxiety, or chronic pain, and SNRIs like venlafaxine or duloxetine are attractive when coexisting anxiety, depression, or PPPD-like symptoms are present, though I need to monitor for anticholinergic effects or blood pressure changes respectively [^7c517a7d] [^e8d9ca80] [^9d3a8fb6].

> But wait, what if conventional preventives fail or are not tolerated. I should review emerging options. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies such as erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab have promising real-world data in vestibular migraine, with about 90% of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in vertigo frequency in a prospective cohort, and mean monthly vestibular symptom days dropping dramatically over 12 months; however, these are observational and not RCTs, so I should discuss uncertainty and access considerations with patients [^e6d5f29f]. Botulinum toxin has evidence for migraine headache but limited and mixed data for vestibular symptoms, so I would reserve it for patients with clear chronic migraine phenotypes and prominent headache burden rather than as a primary vestibular therapy [^6eb55b35]. Non-invasive neuromodulation devices are FDA-cleared for migraine and may help some patients, but evidence in vestibular migraine is limited and recommendations are weak, so I should frame them as adjuncts or when medications are contraindicated [^2f48c147].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic strategies, because triggers and central vestibular compensation matter. Let me verify what has been tested. Cochrane reviews of non-pharmacologic prophylaxis found only three small RCTs of probiotics, CBT, and vestibular rehabilitation, all with low to very low certainty, so I should not overstate efficacy; nonetheless, vestibular rehabilitation is reasonable for patients with chronic dizziness or motion-triggered symptoms, and CBT can be helpful when anxiety or maladaptive coping amplify disability, especially if combined with medication in comorbid presentations [^72d16730] [^2aa5eb32] [^9fe74659]. Lifestyle measures extrapolated from migraine care, such as sleep hygiene, trigger identification, hydration, and moderation of caffeine and alcohol, are sensible and low risk, and I should tailor these to the patient's pattern of attacks and preferences [^f2f360d5].

> I should double-check dosing principles and safety counseling, because tolerability drives adherence. Start low and titrate slowly, monitor for adverse effects, and reassess efficacy after an adequate trial of about 3 months before switching or combining agents; avoid medication overuse by limiting acute symptomatics to fewer than 10 days per month, and consider drug interactions and comorbidities such as asthma for beta-blockers, depression for topiramate, and pregnancy for valproate [^8b16d69a] [^7c517a7d]. Let me also remember that many patients need education about the chronic, episodic nature of vestibular migraine and the need for ongoing prevention even when acute attacks seem infrequent, to sustain benefit and reduce cumulative disability.

> Now, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach, while acknowledging the evidence gaps. For acute attacks, treat vertigo and nausea with vestibular sedatives and antiemetics as needed, and use simple analgesics for headache, keeping frequency low to avoid medication-overuse headache; do not rely on triptans for acute vestibular symptoms given negative RCT data [^7c517a7d] [^a0df7c58]. For prevention, choose a first-line agent based on comorbidities and patient preference: beta-blockers, flunarizine where available, topiramate or valproate, or TCAs/SNRIs, starting low and titrating to effect over about 3 months; if inadequate response, switch class or consider anti-CGRP mAbs in appropriate patients, recognizing the observational nature of VM data for these agents [^17588af9] [^e6d5f29f]. Throughout, incorporate trigger management, sleep and stress strategies, and consider vestibular rehabilitation or CBT when chronic dizziness, anxiety, or functional overlay is present, adjusting the plan based on response and tolerability [^f2f360d5] [^72d16730].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses uncertainties and future directions. The evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment remains limited, with very few high-quality RCTs, so shared decision-making and periodic reassessment are essential; ongoing trials and evolving pathophysiologic understanding may soon refine choices, including potential biomarkers and device-based therapies, and clinicians should remain open to updating practice as new data emerge [^ea92652d] [^dc27f9ac] [^2f48c147]. In the meantime, I should document baseline attack frequency and disability, set measurable goals with the patient, and schedule follow-up to adjust therapy proactively rather than reactively, which improves outcomes and patient engagement in this chronic condition.

For vestibular migraine, **preventive therapy is first-line** and should be individualized based on comorbidities and side-effect profiles [^7c517a7d]. The most evidence-supported options are **beta-blockers** (propranolol, metoprolol) [^f1caff38], **calcium channel blockers** (flunarizine, verapamil) [^a2df34fc], and **antiepileptics** (topiramate, valproate) [^17588af9]; tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline, amitriptyline) or SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) are reasonable alternatives, especially with anxiety or insomnia [^e8d9ca80] [^9d3a8fb6]. For acute attacks, **vestibular sedatives** (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, benzodiazepines) can relieve vertigo and nausea [^7c517a7d]; triptans are not effective for acute vestibular symptoms [^a0df7c58] [^14bb66e7]. Non-pharmacologic measures such as vestibular rehabilitation, trigger avoidance, and lifestyle changes are recommended adjuncts [^72d16730] [^f2f360d5]. Evidence quality is limited; **treatment should be tailored and monitored for response and adverse effects** [^ea92652d] [^3a5b1fa7].

---

## Preventive (prophylactic) medications

Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent or severe attacks** that impair daily functioning [^8b16d69a]. The following medication classes are commonly used, with selection tailored to patient comorbidities, side-effect profiles, and clinical response [^17588af9].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | - Propranolol <br/> - Metoprolol | Moderate | - Effective in reducing attack frequency and severity [^notfound] <br/> - Contraindicated in asthma, bradycardia, and heart failure [^notfound] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Flunarizine <br/> - Verapamil | Moderate | - Flunarizine is particularly effective but may cause drowsiness, weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms [^a2df34fc] <br/> - Verapamil is useful in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities [^notfound] |
| Antiepileptics | - Topiramate <br/> - Valproate | Moderate | - Effective in reducing attack frequency and severity [^notfound] <br/> - Topiramate may cause cognitive side effects and paresthesia [^notfound] <br/> - Valproate is contraindicated in pregnancy [^notfound] |
| Tricyclic antidepressants | - Nortriptyline <br/> - Amitriptyline | Low | - Useful in patients with comorbid anxiety, depression, or insomnia [^e8d9ca80] <br/> - Side effects include sedation, dry mouth, and weight gain [^notfound] |
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) | - Venlafaxine <br/> - Duloxetine | Low | - Effective in patients with comorbid anxiety or depression [^9d3a8fb6] <br/> - Side effects include nausea, insomnia, and hypertension [^notfound] |

## Acute (abortive) medications

Acute therapy aims to **relieve symptoms during attacks**, particularly vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Triptans, commonly used for migraine headaches, have not shown efficacy for acute vestibular symptoms in randomized controlled trials [^a0df7c58] [^14bb66e7]. Instead, the following medications are recommended:

- **Vestibular sedatives**: Meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) are effective in reducing vertigo and nausea during acute attacks [^7c517a7d].

- **Antiemetics**: Prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron are useful for managing nausea and vomiting associated with acute attacks [^7c517a7d].

- **Simple analgesics**: NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) and acetaminophen may be used for associated headache symptoms [^7c517a7d].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as adjuncts to pharmacological therapy, particularly for patients with chronic or refractory symptoms:

- **Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)**: VRT is effective in reducing vestibular symptoms, improving balance, and enhancing quality of life in patients with vestibular migraine [^9fe74659].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Trigger identification and avoidance, regular sleep patterns, stress management, dietary modifications (e.g. reducing caffeine and alcohol intake), and regular physical activity are recommended [^f2f360d5].

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or depression, or in those with persistent symptoms despite pharmacological therapy [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent research has explored novel therapeutic options, including **CGRP monoclonal antibodies** (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab), which have shown promising results in reducing vertigo frequency and severity in observational studies [^e6d5f29f]. However, **randomized controlled trials are needed** to establish their efficacy and safety in vestibular migraine [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize an **individualized approach** to treatment, considering patient comorbidities, side-effect profiles, and clinical response [^7c517a7d]. Regular follow-up and adjustment of therapy are essential to optimize outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Vestibular migraine is managed with a combination of preventive and acute medications, with **preventive therapy being the cornerstone of treatment** [^notfound]. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics are first-line preventive options, while vestibular sedatives and antiemetics are used for acute symptom relief [^17588af9] [^7c517a7d]. Non-pharmacological interventions such as vestibular rehabilitation, lifestyle modifications, and cognitive behavioral therapy are important adjuncts [^72d16730] [^f2f360d5]. Emerging therapies like CGRP monoclonal antibodies show promise but require further research [^e6d5f29f].

### Vestibular migraine: an update on current understanding and future directions [^7f856264]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is among the most common causes of recurrent vertigo in the general population. Despite its prevalence and high impact on healthcare cost and utilization, it has remained an under-recognized condition with largely unknown pathophysiology. In the present article, we aim to provide an overview of the current understanding of vestibular migraine.

Methods

We undertook a narrative literature review on the epidemiology, presentations, clinical and laboratory findings, pathophysiology, and treatments of vestibular migraine.

Results

Currently, the diagnosis of vestibular migraine relies solely on clinical symptoms since clinical tests of vestibular function are typically normal, or difficult to interpret based on inconsistent results reported in earlier studies. The challenges related to diagnosis of vestibular migraine lie in its relatively broad spectrum of manifestations, the absence of typical migraine headaches with vestibular symptoms, and its very recent definition as a distinct entity. Here, we highlight these challenges, discuss common vestibular symptoms and clinical presentations in vestibular migraine, and review the current aspects of its clinical diagnosis and evaluation. The concepts related to the pathophysiology and treatment of vestibular migraine are also discussed.

Conclusion

Vestibular migraine is still underdiagnosed clinically. Future studies are needed to address the pathophysiological mechanisms and investigate effective treatment regimens.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^ea92652d]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

### Rizatriptan vs placebo for attacks of vestibular migraine: a randomized clinical trial [^a0df7c58]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Vestibular migraine has no established treatments.

Objective

To test the efficacy of rizatriptan for treating vestibular migraine attacks.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, randomized clinical trial of rizatriptan vs placebo was conducted from December 2014 through July 2020 (data analyses in 2021 and sensitivity analyses in 2022 and 2024) at 2 tertiary neurotologic centers. Adults with vestibular migraine were included.

Intervention

All participants underwent prospective observation to confirm diagnosis and illness activity and were then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive rizatriptan 10 mg or placebo to treat up to 3 vestibular migraine attacks per participant.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants rated symptoms as absent, mild, moderate, or severe at scheduled intervals. Primary outcomes were the percentage of attacks with reductions in vertigo and unsteadiness/dizziness from moderate or severe to absent or mild at 1 hour. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of attacks with complete resolution of vestibular symptoms at 1 hour; reductions in headache and associated symptoms at 1 hour; use of rescue medications after 1 hour; reductions in vestibular, headache, and associated symptoms at 24 hours without rescue medications; treatment satisfaction and quality of life at 48 hours; and rates of serious adverse effects and discontinuation due to adverse effects.

Results

Of 222 total participants (mean [SD] age, 42.3 [11.7] years; 70.7% were women), 134 (60.4%) with active illness treated 307 attacks. Efficacy was tested using 240 attacks with vestibular symptoms rated as moderate or severe when participants took study drug. At 1 hour, rizatriptan did not differ from placebo for reducing vertigo (73/151 [48.3%] vs 50/88 [56.8%] attacks; odds ratio [OR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42–1.21]), unsteadiness/dizziness (29/151 [19.2%] vs 11/89 [12.4%] attacks; OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.80–3.57]), or any secondary outcomes. Similar percentages of participants in rizatriptan and placebo groups (26.4% for both groups) added rescue remedies after 1 hour. At 24 hours, rizatriptan had medium effects over placebo for unsteadiness/dizziness (OR, 2.65) and motion sensitivity (OR, 3.58). Post hoc analyses of all treated attacks found a medium effect favoring rizatriptan for headache and photophobia or phonophobia at 24 hours. Treatment satisfaction was equivocal. Quality of life was mixed. No participants experienced serious adverse effects or discontinued treatment for adverse effects.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, rizatriptan was ineffective at 1 hour for treating vestibular migraine attacks and had limited benefit on symptoms at 24 hours. Findings do not support using rizatriptan for vestibular migraine attacks.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02447991.

### Treatment of vestibular migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3a5b1fa7]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of the various therapies used for the prevention of vestibular migraine (VM).

Methods

Primary studies were identified though PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library by two independent investigators for articles published through April 2019. The search identified randomized comparison or observational studies pertaining to vestibular migraine treatment. Meta-analysis was performed on pre- and posttreatment Dizziness Handicap Inventory, vertigo frequency, and percentage of perceived improvement.

Results

Literature search identified 13 studies that reported sufficient outcome measures to be included in the analysis. Patients with VM had a mean age of 43.3years with female-to-male gender ratio of 2.1:1. Classes of therapeutic agents included antiepileptic drugs, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, β-blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and vestibular rehabilitation. All treatment options that were analyzed demonstrated improvement in all of the outcome parameters, but due to significant heterogeneity and lack of standardized reporting on outcomes, establishment of preferred treatment modality could not be determined.

Conclusions

Various treatment modalities have been evaluated for preventative treatment of VM. Physician familiarity, patient comorbidities, and the side-effect profiles of various interventions likely influence the selection of intervention. Future randomized controlled trials with restrictive inclusion criteria and generalizable standardized outcome measures will allow for more robust meta-analyses and for more evidence-based treatment of vestibular migraines.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^14bb66e7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, at the time of a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce the severity or resolve the symptoms. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5‐HT₃ receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol or non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with either placebo or no treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 2 hours, 2 to 12 hours, > 12 to 72 hours. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included two RCTs with a total of 133 participants, both of which compared the use of triptans to placebo for an acute attack of vestibular migraine. One study was a parallel‐group RCT (of 114 participants, 75% female). This compared the use of 10 mg rizatriptan to placebo. The second study was a smaller, cross‐over RCT (of 19 participants, 70% female). This compared the use of 2.5 mg zolmitriptan to placebo.

Triptans may result in little or no difference in the proportion of people whose vertigo improves at up to two hours after taking the medication. However, the evidence was very uncertain (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.07; 2 studies; based on 262 attacks of vestibular migraine treated in 124 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any evidence on the change in vertigo using a continuous scale. Only one of the studies assessed serious adverse events. No events were noted in either group, but as the sample size was small we cannot be sure if there are risks associated with taking triptans for this condition (0/75 receiving triptans, 0/39 receiving placebo; 1 study; 114 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for interventions used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine is very sparse. We identified only two studies, both of which assessed the use of triptans. We rated all the evidence as very low‐certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the effect estimates and cannot be sure if triptans have any effect on the symptoms of vestibular migraine. Although we identified sparse information on potential harms of treatment in this review, the use of triptans for other conditions (such as headache migraine) is known to be associated with some adverse effects.

We did not identify any placebo‐controlled randomised trials for other interventions that may be used for this condition. Further research is needed to identify whether any interventions help to improve the symptoms of vestibular migraine attacks and to determine if there are side effects associated with their use.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^f1caff38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross-over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta-blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest. Beta-blockers versus placebo One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from placebo-controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.

Dizziness is one of the most common chief complaints in both the ambulatory care setting and the emergency department. These symptoms may be representative of a broad range of entities. Therefore, any attempt at treatment must first start with determining the etiology. In this current perspective, we focus specifically on the diagnosis of and treatment of vestibular migraine, which is common and overlaps clinically with a variety of other diagnoses. We discuss the traditional treatments for vestibular migraine in addition to the recent explosion of novel migraine therapeutics. Because vestibular migraine can mimic, or co-exist with, a variety of other vestibular diseases, we discuss several of these disorders including persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, post-concussive syndrome, Ménière's disease, and cerebrovascular etiologies. We discuss the diagnosis of each, as well as overlapping and distinguishing clinical features of which the reader should be aware. Finally, we conclude with evidence based as well as expert commentary on management, with a particular emphasis on vestibular migraine.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^8911636a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, at the time of a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce the severity or resolve the symptoms. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with either placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 2 hours, 2 to 12 hours, > 12 to 72 hours. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs with a total of 133 participants, both of which compared the use of triptans to placebo for an acute attack of vestibular migraine. One study was a parallel-group RCT (of 114 participants, 75% female). This compared the use of 10 mg rizatriptan to placebo. The second study was a smaller, cross-over RCT (of 19 participants, 70% female). This compared the use of 2.5 mg zolmitriptan to placebo. Triptans may result in little or no difference in the proportion of people whose vertigo improves at up to two hours after taking the medication. However, the evidence was very uncertain (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.07; 2 studies; based on 262 attacks of vestibular migraine treated in 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any evidence on the change in vertigo using a continuous scale. Only one of the studies assessed serious adverse events. No events were noted in either group, but as the sample size was small we cannot be sure if there are risks associated with taking triptans for this condition (0/75 receiving triptans, 0/39 receiving placebo; 1 study; 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for interventions used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine is very sparse. We identified only two studies, both of which assessed the use of triptans. We rated all the evidence as very low-certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the effect estimates and cannot be sure if triptans have any effect on the symptoms of vestibular migraine. Although we identified sparse information on potential harms of treatment in this review, the use of triptans for other conditions (such as headache migraine) is known to be associated with some adverse effects. We did not identify any placebo-controlled randomised trials for other interventions that may be used for this condition. Further research is needed to identify whether any interventions help to improve the symptoms of vestibular migraine attacks and to determine if there are side effects associated with their use.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene‐related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross‐over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta‐blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest.

Beta‐blockers versus placebo

One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment

Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors' conclusions

There is very limited evidence from placebo‐controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.

### Vestibular migraine: an update [^11b444dc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE

The current understanding of vestibular migraine is likely to grow substantially in the near future. Patients with migraine and vestibular symptoms may present autonomic, inflammatory or pain concurrent comorbidities, and respond to migraine preventive treatment independent of psychological symptoms. Formulating a thorough anamnesis is fundamental to prevent an unnecessary label of a functional diagnosis. Further research focusing on understanding the different individual phenomena of this migraine phenotype is needed.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^689d0ade]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Current pharmacological treatments for patients with vestibular migraine may be prophylactic, or used to treat an acute attack. Many are based on interventions that have been widely used to treat headache migraine. This review is focused on non‐pharmacological interventions that are taken as prophylaxis to prevent attacks occurring.

A number of different non‐pharmacological interventions have been proposed to be of benefit in headache migraine, and have consequently been considered for use in vestibular migraine. Many well‐recognised triggers exist for migraine attacks, and several interventions aim to reduce or eliminate these triggers. These include:

dietary modification (including elimination of food triggers such as alcohol, caffeine or other foods);
sleep improvement techniques (to ensure regular sleep patterns);
vitamin and mineral supplements;
talking therapies and stress management (such as counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), meditation or mindfulness).

Vestibular rehabilitation may also be used for people with vestibular migraine but the mechanism by which this may work as prophylaxis is uncertain. This is an exercise‐based therapy that involves walking exercises, balance retraining, and visual and postural exercises. Exercises are tailored to the individual, to account for their specific symptoms. Vestibular rehabilitation is often provided in person, on a one‐to‐one or group basis, by a therapist. However, self‐directed booklet‐based and internet‐based packages are now available.

How the intervention might work

Triggers for migraine are widely recognised, but poorly understood. Although the pathophysiology of attacks is starting to be understood, the underlying mechanisms that initiate a migraine attack are still unclear. Nonetheless, it seems clear that a reduction in the presence of triggers should reduce the frequency of attacks.

Many of the interventions included in this review are used on this basis ‐ that dietary modification, reduction in stress, regulation of sleep or nutritional status should all reduce the frequency of triggers for a migraine attack.

Vestibular rehabilitation aims to retrain the balance system. However, it may also allow people to cope better with their vestibular symptoms during an episode.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^c81eeffa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We also did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared other interventions (as listed in Types of interventions) to either placebo or no treatment. Therefore, we do not have any information on the efficacy or harms of any other medications used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Both studies used the same method to assess improvement in symptoms ‐ the change in a four‐point scale of symptom severity was converted to a dichotomous outcome (where "improvement" meant a change from severity of 3 or 2 down to 0 or 1). We could not find any information on whether this scale has been validated for used in this context. However, we note that some people may also regard a change in symptoms from 'severe' to 'moderate' as improvement. More work is needed to identify the best ways to measure symptoms of vestibular migraine, and assess what change in symptoms is meaningful and important to people with this condition.

For the outcome 'improvement in vertigo', people with 'mild' attacks of vestibular migraine were not included. Only attacks classed as moderate or severe were assessed for improvement. In addition, one of the included studies allowed participants to treat up to three attacks of vestibular migraine with the same medication (NCT02447991). Consequently, people who suffered more frequent attacks of vestibular migraine will have contributed more outcome data to the analysis than those who suffered only one attack over the course of the trial. The overall effect of these study features means that the outcome data may be skewed towards the effect for people with more severe or frequent attacks of vestibular migraine. As a consequence, the results may not be applicable to those with less frequent, or less severe attacks.

Triptans are widely used to treat headache migraine, where there is stronger evidence of their efficacy (Derry 2014b), in contrast to the results of this review of their use in vestibular migraine. It is unclear whether this is because the underlying pathophysiology of the two conditions may differ, or simply because the studies of vestibular migraine are too small or inadequately designed to detect an effect of triptans.

### Vestibular migraine [^8a70c83c]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of vertigo, dizziness and balance disturbance with migraine is called vestibular migraine. Although it is estimated that up to 1% of the population suffers from this disease, it is still widely unknown and often underdiagnosed. Recently, the International Headache Society and the Báràny Society published the first joint document with mutually accepted diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine.

Method

This review summarizes current knowledge on vestibular migraine with regard to epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and therapeutic options.

Results

Approximately 30–50% of patients with migraine report vertigo, dizziness or balance disturbances with at least one migraine attack. Vestibular migraine often appears in a temporal delay to the first onset of migraine headache. In some patients the symptom of sudden onset disequilibrium was the main complaint and more worrisome than the accompanying migraine headache. The duration of attacks varies from a few seconds up to few days. The underlying pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is still widely unknown. As an important differential diagnosis, Ménière's disease has to be considered and excluded.

Conclusion

As randomized controlled treatment trials are still missing in vestibular migraine, the therapeutic recommendations for vestibular migraine are currently based on the guidelines of migraine.

### Vestibular migraine: an update [^90eae2a8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We performed a narrative review of the recent findings in epidemiology, clinical presentation, mechanisms and treatment of vestibular migraine.

Recent Findings

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed condition that has a high prevalence among general, headache and neuro-otology clinics. Vestibular migraine has a bimodal presentation probably associated with a hormonal component in women. These patients could have a complex clinical phenotype including concomitant autonomic, inflammatory or connective tissue conditions that have a higher prevalence of psychological symptoms, which may mistakenly lead to a diagnosis of a functional neurological disorder. A high proportion of patients with postural perceptual persistent dizziness have a migraine phenotype. Independently of the clinical presentation and past medical history, patients with the vestibular migraine phenotype can respond to regular migraine preventive treatments, including those targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathways.

Summary

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed migraine phenotype that shares the pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine, with growing interest in recent years. A thorough anamnesis is essential to increase sensitivity in patients with unknown cause of dizziness and migraine treatment should be considered (see supplemental video-abstract).

Data extraction and management

At least two review authors (of AD, LHK, KW) independently extracted outcome data from each study using a standardised data collection form. Any discrepancies in the data extracted by the two authors was checked against the original reports, and differences were resolved through discussion and consensus, with recourse to a third author where necessary.

We included key characteristics of the studies, including the following information:

study design, duration of the study, number of study centres and location, study setting and dates of the study;
information on the participants, including the number randomised, those lost to follow‐up or withdrawn, the number analysed, the age of participants, gender, features of the condition (e.g. probable or definite vestibular migraine), diagnostic criteria used, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the individual studies;
details of the intervention, comparator, and concomitant treatments or excluded medications;
the outcomes specified and reported by the study authors, including the time points;
funding for the study and any conflicts of interest for the study authors;
information required to assess the risk of bias in the study, and to enable GRADE assessment of the evidence.

Once the extracted data were checked and any discrepancies were resolved, a single author (KW) transferred the information to Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2020).

The primary effect of interest for this review was the effect of treatment assignment (which reflects the outcomes of treatment for people who were assigned to the intervention) rather than a per protocol analysis (the outcomes of treatment only for those who completed the full course of treatment as planned). For the outcomes of interest in this review, we extracted the findings from the studies on an available case basis, i.e. all available data from all participants at each time point, based on the treatment to which they were randomised. This was irrespective of adherence, or whether participants had received the intervention as planned.

In addition to extracting pre‐specified information about study characteristics and aspects of methodology relevant to risk of bias, we extracted the following summary statistics for each study and outcome:

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^f93311cd]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to a paucity of data on the management of vestibular migraine specifically, treatment recommendations have generally been extrapolated from studies on other forms of migraine. Pharmacological options for acute migraine include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiemetics and triptans. Prophylactic treatment options include beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (for example, flunarizine), antiepileptic drugs (topiramate, sodium valproate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, venlafaxine), antiserotonergic drugs (pizotifen), antihypertensives (candesartan, lisinopril) and monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab). Supplements (co-enzyme Q10, magnesium and riboflavin), greater occipital nerve block, botulinum toxin, external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS), single transcranial magnetic stimulation and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) are recommended by the British Association for the Study of Headache. Acupuncture may be helpful for some patients. A Cochrane review in 2015 that set out to identify effective pharmacological agents for the prevention of vestibular migraine failed to identify any completed study that met the strict inclusion criteria required for Cochrane reviews. A review and meta-analysis of preventive treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting.

As current migraine treatment guidelines are based on work that did not assess the efficacy of interventions to control vestibular symptoms, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Considering this, we felt that performing another meta-analysis would not be of practical utility given such a small number of appropriate studies. Equally, a narrative review would likely include publications at risk of serious bias due to poor study quality and significant heterogeneity. Thus, while others have provided comprehensive systematic reviews and meta-analyses of vestibular migraine treatment, here we sought to offer a practical, clinically oriented review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for each treatment option, upon which we offer treatment recommendations.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^1e8f7681]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials (where trials were designed as RCTs, but the sequence generation for allocation of treatment used methods such as alternate allocation, birth dates etc).

We planned to include cross‐over RCTs or cluster‐RCTs, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) (Handbook 2021, also see Unit of analysis issues).

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of either definite or probable vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and Bárány Society criteria (see Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example those of Neuhauser 2001 (see Appendix 2).

If studies had recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and headache migraine) we planned to include the study if either:

the majority of participants (≥ 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or
subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data relevant specifically to those with vestibular migraine.

However, we did not identify any studies that this applied to ‐ both included studies specifically recruited individuals with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^2aa5eb32]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. Many of these interventions include dietary, lifestyle or behavioural changes, rather than medication.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of non‐pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing dietary modifications, sleep improvement techniques, vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal supplements, talking therapies, mind‐body interventions or vestibular rehabilitation with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross‐over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included three studies in this review with a total of 319 participants. Each study addressed a different comparison and these are outlined below. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining comparisons of interest in this review.

Dietary interventions (probiotics) versus placebo

We identified one study with 218 participants (85% female). The use of a probiotic supplement was compared to a placebo and participants were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the change in vertigo frequency and severity over the duration of the study. However, there were no data regarding improvement of vertigo or serious adverse events.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus no intervention

One study compared CBT to no treatment in 61 participants (72% female). Participants were followed up for eight weeks. Data were reported on the change in vertigo over the course of the study, but no information was reported on the proportion of people whose vertigo improved, or on the occurrence of serious adverse events.

Vestibular rehabilitation versus no intervention

The third study compared the use of vestibular rehabilitation to no treatment in a group of 40 participants (90% female) and participants were followed up for six months. Again, this study reported some data on change in the frequency of vertigo during the study, but no information on the proportion of participants who experienced an improvement in vertigo or the number who experienced serious adverse events.

We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results of these studies, as the data for each comparison of interest come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was low or very low.

Authors' conclusions

There is a paucity of evidence for non‐pharmacological interventions that may be used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. Only a limited number of interventions have been assessed by comparing them to no intervention or a placebo treatment, and the evidence from these studies is all of low or very low certainty. We are therefore unsure whether any of these interventions may be effective at reducing the symptoms of vestibular migraine and we are also unsure whether they have the potential to cause harm.

### NCT04417361 | Galcanezumab for vestibular migraine… [^a93012b7]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Galcanezumab for Vestibular MigraineClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Vestibular migraine is a distinct subtype of migraine that causes episodic vertigo/dizziness, sometimes with headache, and sometimes without. However, unlike traditional migraines, patients generally seek out care because of dizziness, and not because of headache. Therefore, these patients are cared for by a variety of providers who treat dizziness, including otolaryngologists and neurologists. Galcanezumab is a calcitonin gene related peptide antagonist that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of episodic and chronic migraine. Its effects with regards to VM have not been formally studied. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that aberrant trigeminovascular inflammation may be integral to the pathophysiology of VM, similar to migraine in general.

This pilot study will be a single center, randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial comparing galcanezumab to placebo for treatment of VM. Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Participants in the galcanezumab arm will receive 240 mg via subcutaneous injection with a pre-loaded syringe at month 1, followed by 120 mg at month 2, and 120 mg at month 3. Vestibular migraine
- A: At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours
- B: Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders C: One or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes:

- **Headache with at least two of the following characteristics**: one sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity
- Photophobia and phonophobia
- Visual aura
- **D**: Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis Probable vestibular migraine.
- At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours
- Only one of the criteria B and C for vestibular migraine is fulfilled
- Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^2de5a419]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We rated all of the evidence in this review as either very low‐ or very low‐certainty, showing that we have little confidence in the effect estimates. Several factors contributed to this assessment.

Firstly, the total number of participants in these studies was relatively small, meaning that the calculated effect estimates had wide confidence intervals, leading to imprecision. In addition, the number of participants dropping out during the trials was quite considerable.

We also had concerns about the analysis methods in both studies. One study was a cross‐over trial, where participants received either the triptan, or a placebo, and then switched to the alternative treatment for their next attack (Neuhauser 2003). Ideally, these data would be analysed as 'paired data', comparing the results on each treatment for an individual person. However, the information reported in the study did not allow us to analyse the data in that way. There were also concerns with the analysis in the second study (NCT02447991), where participants received one medication and used this repeatedly to treat several attacks. We were unable to account for the correlation between data points from the same individual. Therefore, many of the analyses presented in this review must be viewed as approximate.

Potential biases in the review process

This review only included studies that compared an active intervention to no treatment or placebo. This may mean that we omitted studies that compared one active treatment to another. However, as there is currently no 'gold standard' treatment for acute attacks of vestibular migraine, we considered that this was an appropriate decision.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

A recent systematic review evaluated the use of pharmacological (and non‐pharmacological) interventions for both the prophylaxis and acute treatment of vestibular migraine (Smyth 2022). The authors of this review included both randomised and non‐randomised studies, therefore the results are not directly comparable with our own review. However, their conclusions are similar to our own ‐ that the overall evidence base for the treatment of vestibular migraine is of low certainty and that well‐designed clinical trials are required in this area.

### Pharmacological agents for the prevention of vestibular migraine [^c0581c55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is a common cause of episodic vertigo. Many preventive treatments have been proposed for this condition, including calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, selective 5-HT1 agonists, serotonin antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacological agents for the prevention of vestibular migraine.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 5 June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (over 18 years) with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine orprobable vestibular migraine according to the Bárány Society/International Headache Society (IHS) criteria, treated in any setting, comparing pharmacological treatments used in the prevention of vestibular migraine, including beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, serotonin antagonists and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Our literature search identified 558 reports, however only 11 were sufficiently relevant for further assessment. We excluded two studies because they did not use the IHS diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine. We excluded a further eight studies for various reasons related to their design (e.g. lack of placebo or no treatment comparator), aim (e.g. treatment of vestibular migraine rather than prevention) or conduct (e.g. early termination). We identified one ongoing study comparing metoprolol to placebo. The results of this study are awaited; recruitment of the last patient is expected by the end of 2016.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence from RCTs to answer the question set out in the review objectives. This review has identified the need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to answer questions about the efficacy of current and new treatments.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^d82ca997]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The overall evidence base for VM treatment in adults is low quality. Nevertheless, we have provided practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience, which should be of use to clinicians treating patients with VM. Treatments not investigated by the studies covered in this review but widely used for the treatment of migraine and headache and worthy of investigation include candesartan, greater occipital nerve block, acupuncture and CGRP inhibitors. Future work might also consider the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine, and in particular whether the headaches and episodes of vertigo are caused by the same processes and whether different clinical or pathological subtypes of VM can be identified that might show differential responses to treatment. For example, while we would argue that vestibular rehabilitation is more likely to benefit those with chronic symptoms, studies exploring the role of vestibular rehabilitation in the early stages of VM are lacking. Finally, the substantial psychological burden associated with chronic vestibular disorders along with the putative role of stress as an attack trigger in VM demands consideration of psychological intervention combined with pharmacological strategies, although in the United Kingdom such resources are often lacking. With better understanding of the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine and well-designed clinical trials, better strategies for its treatment may emerge.

### Vestibular migraine: clinical aspects and pathophysiology [^49eaa9a8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vestibular migraine is becoming recognised as a distinct clinical entity that accounts for a high proportion of patients with vestibular symptoms. A temporal overlap between vestibular symptoms, such as vertigo and head-movement intolerance, and migraine symptoms, such as headache, photophobia, and phonophobia, is a requisite diagnostic criterion. Physical examination and laboratory testing are usually normal in vestibular migraine but can be used to rule out other vestibular disorders with overlapping symptoms. The pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is incompletely understood but plausibly could include neuroanatomical pathways to and from central vestibular structures and neurochemical modulation via the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei. In the absence of controlled trials, treatment options for patients with vestibular migraine largely mirror those for migraine headache.

Search methods for identification of studies

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. There were no language, publication year or publication status restrictions. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Electronic searches

The Information Specialist searched:

the Cochrane ENT Trials Register (searched via the Cochrane Register of Studies to 23 September 2022);
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (searched via the Cochrane Register of Studies to 23 September 2022);
Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 23 September 2022);
Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 September 2022);
Web of Knowledge, Web of Science (1945 to 23 September 2022);
ClinicalTrials.gov,(to 23 September 2022);
World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP),(to 23 September 2022).

The Information Specialist modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. The strategy has been designed to identify all relevant studies for a suite of reviews on various interventions for vestibular migraine. Where appropriate, they were combined with subject strategy adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as described in the Technical Supplement to Chapter 4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.1) (Lefebvre 2020). Search strategies for major databases including CENTRAL are provided in Appendix 3.

Searching other resources

We scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional trials and contacted trial authors if necessary. In addition, the Information Specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this systematic review, so that we could scan their reference lists for additional trials. The Information Specialist also ran non‐systematic searches of Google Scholar to identify trials not published in mainstream journals.

We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects. We considered adverse effects described in included studies only.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^ad208218]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials (where trials were designed as RCTs, but the sequence generation for allocation of treatment used methods such as alternate allocation, birth dates etc).

The number of episodes of vestibular migraine may vary with time ‐ patients sometimes have periods of more active disease, followed by a period of fewer attacks. Therefore cross‐over trials are not an appropriate study design when assessing prophylaxis for this condition. Cross‐over RCTs would only have been included if data could be extracted for the first phase of the study. If cluster‐RCTs were identified then they would have been eligible for inclusion, providing we could appropriately account for the clustering in the data analysis (according to methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) (Handbook 2021). However, we did not identify any cross‐over or cluster‐randomised trials for this review.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) and Bárány Society criteria (see Appendix 1). We also included studies that used other, established criteria, for example Neuhauser 2001.

We included studies where participants were diagnosed with either 'definite' vestibular migraine or 'probable' vestibular migraine.

Where studies recruited participants with a variety of diagnoses (e.g. vestibular migraine and headache migraine) we planned to include the study if either:

the majority of participants (≥ 90%) had a diagnosis of vestibular migraine; or
subgroup data were available that allowed us to identify data specifically from those with vestibular migraine.

However, we did not identify any studies that included participants with headache migraine.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^15a3dbaf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease).

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work, and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe (Neuhauser 2006). At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition, therefore up‐to‐date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Vestibular migraine: an update [^c846bf7d]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION

Vestibular migraine (VM) is probably the second most common cause of dizziness, affecting around 3% of population. In recent years, the appearance of new studies aiming to understanding the pathophysiology of VM, alongside increasing interest by the medical and the general population (Fig. 1) may make the disorder even more important.

Box 1
no caption available

FIGURE 1
PubMed (left) and Google (right) search trends for 'vestibular migraine', accessed 13/12/23.

Despite this popularity, this condition is far from novelty, as accurately described in antiquity textbooks.

The current definition of VM has been available for slightly more than a decade. Phenotyping, collating and defining VM patients has facilitated classification and research, and the term vestibular migraine renders a link to its underlying biological mechanisms. Unfortunately, in clinical practice, this etymology may not be ideal, particularly in the nonheadache setting, where the referral reason is dizziness, vestibular tests are frequently normal, and there is a high likelihood of receiving a 'no' to the question 'Do you have any headache? '. The unconscious association of the word migraine with its archetypical manifestations, or considering exclusively the main criteria of the Barany Society and third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) may not be sensitive enough, ultimately misguiding for the specialist. Instead, the Notes section of the classification (Table 1, right) may provide a broader and more accurate clinical picture for milder or atypical phenotypes.

Table 1
Main diagnostic criteria (left) and notes (right) of VM (ICHD-3)

Additionally, a diagnosis of VM could be confusing for the patient who does not necessarily complain of headache, and received with skepticism, which could potentially hinder compliance to treatment.

Despite the above, naming VM is necessary to avoid increasing the negative predictive value of a diagnosis of psychosomatic, anxiety-related or functional neurological disorder (FND) when the presentation is not typical or upon failure of a first-line migraine preventive treatment. Recognizing a migrainous biology is crucial, given that up to 95% of patients might benefit from migraine treatment, even when headache is not an active symptom, and significantly improve quality of life.

### Vestibular migraine: a critical review of treatment trials [^2a563541]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM), also known as migraine-associated vertigo, is a common cause of dizziness in adults. We performed a comprehensive literature search regarding treatment for VM or migraine-associated vertigo during the period of 1990–2008 and used, individually or in combination, the search terms VM, migraine-associated vertigo, migraine-associated dizziness, migrainous vertigo, migraine and vertigo, migraine and disequilibrium, and headache and vertigo. We found nine publications that address treatment strategies for VM. One small randomized clinical trial found some benefit from the use of zolmitriptan for abortive treatment of VM. The other eight observational studies showed marginal improvement with migraine prophylactic medications such as nortriptyline, verapamil, or metoprolol. Until more specific treatment options become available, patients with VM need to be managed with similar prophylactic and abortive strategies as those used for migraine in adults.

Data extraction and management

At least two review authors (of AD, LHK and KW) independently extracted outcome data from each study using a standardised data collection form. Where a study had more than one publication, we retrieved all publications to ensure complete extraction of data. Any discrepancies in the data extracted by the two authors were checked against the original reports, and differences were resolved through discussion and consensus, with recourse to a third author where necessary. If required, we contacted the study authors for clarification.

We included key characteristics of the studies, including the following information:

study design, duration of the study, number of study centres and location, study setting and dates of the study;
information on the participants, including the number randomised, those lost to follow‐up or withdrawn, the number analysed, the age of participants, gender, features of the condition (e.g. probable or definite vestibular migraine), diagnostic criteria used, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the individual studies;
details of the intervention, comparator and concomitant treatments or excluded medications;
the outcomes specified and reported by the study authors, including the time points;
funding for the study and any conflicts of interest for the study authors;
information required to assess the risk of bias in the study and to enable GRADE assessment of the evidence.

Once the extracted data had been checked and any discrepancies resolved, a single author transferred the information to Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2020).

The primary effect of interest for this review is the effect of treatment assignment (which reflects the outcomes of treatment for people who were assigned to the intervention) rather than a per protocol analysis (the outcomes of treatment only for those who completed the full course of treatment as planned). For the outcomes of interest in this review, we extracted findings from the studies on an available case basis, i.e. all available data from all participants at each time point, based on the treatment to which they were randomised. This was irrespective of adherence, or whether participants had received the intervention as planned.

In addition to extracting pre‐specified information about study characteristics and aspects of methodology relevant to risk of bias, we extracted the following summary statistics for each study and outcome:

My patient has VM — what should I do?

The evidence from studies included in this review is of almost universally low quality, making interpretation complex; however, this does not necessarily imply lack of treatment effect. Treatment recommendations (Box 1) summarize the available evidence both in terms of efficacy but also side-effect profile. It seems prudent to highlight that, as for any condition, one should not treat 'vestibular migraine' but rather the patient, and thus an individualized approach may be necessary, considering both the clinical and demographic features, but also psychological variables that commonly coexist in this (and any other) chronic disorder. The sometimes violent and almost always disconcerting and incapacitating loss of control that is associated with unpredictable vertiginous attacks renders this latter point of particular importance. Such an individualized treatment approach that nevertheless utilizes available evidence to fit the particular person can maximize patient acceptance of treatment as well as the chance of a positive response. Examples of real-life scenarios are given in Box 2 and Box 3.

Box 1
Treatment options for management of vestibular migraine based on efficacy and side-effect profile data

All patients

Abortive treatment — use less than 10 days per month

Simple analgesics/NSAIDs/triptans for headache
Vestibular sedatives (cyclizine, prochlorperazine, cinnarizine) for vertigo
Consider prochlorperazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, or domperidone for nausea

Preventative treatment — best efficacy evidence and lower rates of serious unwanted effects

Tricyclics (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) — consider if comorbid pain or insomnia.

Start 10 mg at night and titrate up in 10 mg increments every 1–2 weeks. Usual dose range 10–150 mg at night. Lower doses are often effective for VM symptoms; higher doses (≥ 75 mg) may benefit patients with anxiety/depression, although in our experience patients with VM rarely tolerate this much.

The design of future clinical trials

There is a pressing clinical need for high-quality studies into the treatment of vestibular migraine in adults, but also in children. Such studies should ideally be double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with pre-published protocols, a set of validated patient-centred outcome measures and adhering to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. As such studies represent considerable expense, it is proposed that studies investigating the treatment of other types of migraine might be designed to include a subgroup of patients with vestibular migraine. Power calculations are imperative to prevent further studies being unable to draw conclusions due to being underpowered. We identified five ongoing studies into VM prophylaxis, which are detailed in Supplementary Material.

Current validated measures for vestibular symptoms/disability include the VSS, DHI, ABC, VADL, vestibular rehabilitation benefit questionnaire (VRBQ)and SF-36. Although subtle ocular motor abnormalities have been reported in up to two-thirds of patients interictally, and abnormal vestibular function tests in 10–20% of patients, these are not reliably present in VM and are unlikely to be useful outcome measures. More recently, a 'proinflammatory signature' involving interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), C-C motif chemokine ligand-3 (CCL3), C-C motif chemokine ligand-22 (CCL22) and C-X-C motif chemokine-1 (CXCL1) has been proposed to help differentiate VM from Ménière's disease: if it could be shown that treatment of symptoms corresponds with downregulation of this inflammatory cascade this may offer another outcome measure. However, comorbidities frequently present in patients with VM have been associated with systemic inflammation, including diabetes mellitus, obesity and depression, and another study found that VM patients did not have higher cytokine levels than healthy controls. Perhaps most importantly, outcome measures should reflect as closely as possible the primary goal of treatment, in this case the resolution of patient symptoms.

Potential biases in the review process

A number of RCTs were excluded from this review as the comparator was incorrect ‐ an intervention was not compared to placebo or no treatment, but was instead compared to another (potentially) active intervention. This may be regarded as a source of bias in the review, although it is in accordance with our protocol. As the efficacy for different interventions in vestibular migraine is unknown, and there is no 'gold standard' treatment, we strongly felt that interventions must be compared to no treatment (or placebo treatment) in order to accurately estimate their effects. However, future reviews may consider addressing this problem with the use of network meta‐analysis.

As noted in Selection of studies, we intended to use the Trustworthiness Screening Tool to select studies that would be included in the main analyses in this review. We had concerns regarding the methods used in two of the included studies when using this tool, but we were unable to establish contact with the authors to provide clarification. However, due to the paucity of data, and some concerns over the sensitivity of the tool, we decided to include all three studies in the main analyses of this review. Nonetheless, the evidence from these two studies is already rated as very low‐certainty, therefore the conclusions of this review are unlikely to be different, even if these studies were known to have problems in their conduct or reporting.

### Migrainous vertigo: development of a pathogenetic model and structured diagnostic interview [^58b7604e]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vestibular symptoms occur frequently in patients with migraine. This review refines recently proposed diagnostic criteria for migraine-related vestibular symptoms, and develops a pathophysiological model for the interface between migraine and the vestibular system.

Recent Findings

The epidemiological link between migraine and vestibular symptoms and signs suggests shared pathogenetic mechanisms. Links between the vestibular nuclei, the trigeminal system, and thalamocortical processing centers provide the basis for the development of a pathophysiological model of migraine-related vertigo. During the last year, several studies have increased understanding of the relationship between migraine and vestibular symptoms. A study of motion sickness and allodynia in migraine patients supports the importance of central mechanisms of sensitization for migraine-related vestibular symptoms. A study has demonstrated effective treatment of vertigo with migraine therapy. The identification of migrainous vertigo, however, is hampered by a lack of standardized assessment criteria for both clinical and research practices. The application of published criteria for the diagnosis of migrainous vertigo allows the development of a standardized, structured assessment interview.

Summary

An understanding of the relationship between migraine and the vestibular system increases knowledge of the pathogenesis of both migraine and vertigo. In addition, studies have identified successful treatment, with standard migraine therapies, of vestibular symptoms in patients with both migraine and vertigo. The use of a standardized assessment tool to identify this unique population of patients will help future studies to test both the pathological model and effective treatment options.

Description of the intervention

Current pharmacological treatments for people with vestibular migraine may be prophylactic, or used to treat an acute attack. Many are based on interventions that have been widely used to treat headache migraine. This review is focused on pharmacological interventions that are taken to relieve an attack.

A variety of pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed, for treatment of vestibular migraine symptoms. These may be administered by various routes including oral, sublingual, intranasal, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Interventions include the following:

triptans;
ergot alkaloids;
dopamine antagonists;
antihistamines;
gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists);
magnesium;
5‐hydroxytryptamine (HT)₃ receptor antagonists;
caffeine;
paracetamol;
non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^84545f69]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Migraine has long-been known to mimic other disorders such as stroke, and often the term "complex migraine" has been utilized in migraines with associated neurological deficits such as hemiplegia or aphasia. Analogously, as the criteria for VM has emerged, it is clear this disease may mimic a variety of other vestibular disorders. VM may also coexist with these disorders. A detailed history elucidating classic migraine triggers or associations, and a detailed physical examination to rule out mimics almost always leads to the proper diagnosis. Many effective treatment modalities exist, and when the diagnosis remains uncertain or VM coexists with another vestibular disorder, there are many overlap treatment strategies that can be utilized. However, just as how atypical headache histories warrant neuroimaging, an atypical VM history or abnormal ocular motor or neurologic examination findings warrants neuroimaging to exclude structural lesions.

Measures of treatment effect

We summarised the effects of dichotomous outcomes (e.g. serious adverse effects) as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We have also expressed the results as absolute numbers based on the pooled results and compared to the assumed risk in the summary of findings tables (Table 1; Table 2) and full GRADE profiles (Table 3; Table 4).

1
GRADE profile: Beta‐blockers versus placebo for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine

2
GRADE profile: Calcium channel blockers versus no intervention for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine

The reported event rate was zero for some outcomes. Therefore, we used the Peto odds ratio (OR) to analyse these data, according to the guidance in Xu 2021, as this should produce less biased estimates of the effect size when events are rare (as described in the Handbook 2021).

For continuous outcomes, we expressed treatment effects as a mean difference (MD) with standard deviation (SD). We did not need to present any data using a standardised mean difference in this review.

Unit of analysis issues

Vestibular migraine is unlikely to be a stable condition and interventions may not have a temporary effect. If cross‐over trials were identified then we planned to use only the data from the first phase of the study. If cluster‐randomised trials are identified then we will have ensured that analysis methods were used to account for clustering in the data according to the Handbook 2021. However, neither of these study designs were identified in the included studies.

If we had identified studies with three or more arms, we would have ensured these were included to avoid double‐counting of any participants. However, this was not necessary for this review.

Dealing with missing data

We tried to contact study authors via email whenever the outcome of interest is not reported, if the methods of the study suggested that the outcome had been measured. We planned to do the same if not all data required for meta‐analysis were reported (for example, standard deviations), unless we were able to calculate them from other data reported by the study authors.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed clinical heterogeneity by examining the included studies for potential differences between them in the types of participants recruited, interventions or controls used and the outcomes measured.

We used the I² statistic to quantify inconsistency among the studies in each analysis. We also considered the P value from the Chi² test. If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to report this and explore possible causes through pre‐specified subgroup analysis, however this was not necessary.

The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high certainty. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of these factors:

Study limitations (risk of bias): This was assessed using the rating from the Cochrane risk of bias tool for the study or studies included in the analysis. We rated down either one or two levels, depending on the number of domains that had been rated at high or unclear risk of bias.
Inconsistency: This was assessed using the I² statistic and the P value for heterogeneity for all meta‐analyses, as well as by visual inspection of the forest plot. For results based on a single study we rated this domain as no serious inconsistency.
Indirectness of evidence: We took into account whether there were concerns over the population included in the study or studies for each outcome, as well as whether additional treatments were offered that may impact on the efficacy of the intervention under consideration.
Imprecision: We took into account the sample size and the width of the confidence interval for each outcome. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size (i.e. < 400 people for continuous outcomes or < 300 events for dichotomous outcomes), or the confidence interval crossed the small effect threshold we rated down one level. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size and the confidence interval included both potential harm and potential benefit we rated down twice. We also rated down twice for very tiny studies (e.g. 10 to 15 participants in each arm), regardless of the estimated confidence interval.
Publication bias: We considered whether there were likely to be unpublished studies that may impact on our confidence in the results obtained.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^d8ecc6a1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) — Statement 2: Assessing for vestibular migraine (VM) — Clinicians should determine if patients meet diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine when assessing for Ménière's disease, a Recommendation with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Benefits include accuracy of diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary treatments or testing, more appropriate treatment, patient education, and promoting multidisciplinary care, while the risk/cost is extra time for assessment. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with Low confidence, and VM is a common cause of dizziness that can closely mimic MD; appropriate assessment could lead to more appropriate treatment. Supporting text notes VM patients are typically younger and more likely to be female than those with MD; a multidisciplinary panel has established diagnostic criteria for VM with migraine features in at least 50% of the vestibular episodes, and VM may present with short (< 15 minutes) or prolonged (> 24 hours) vertigo; conversely, MD should be diagnosed when characteristic audiometric hearing loss is identified on audiograms even when migraine features are present.

VM is a common yet debilitating migraine variant that has taken many monikers in the past. As a relatively new diagnostic entity, public and provider awareness of this disorder can be improved. Symptoms include vertigo episodes in addition to photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and headache. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical history as pathognomonic signs via testing are not reliable. Standardized treatment algorithms have yet to be created and current recommendations have been adopted from migraine guidelines.

### Vestibular migraine and its comorbidities [^7e064ff8]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM) is one of the most common neurologic causes of vertigo. Symptoms and International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria are used to diagnose VM because no objective tests, imaging or audiologic, have been shown to reliably diagnose this condition. Central auditory, peripheral, and central vestibular pathway involvement has been associated with VM. Although the interaction between migraine and other vestibular disorders can be a challenging scenario for diagnosis and treatment, there are data to show that vestibular rehabilitation and a variety of pharmacologic agents improve reported symptoms and vertigo frequency.

We used a minimally contextualised approach, and rated the certainty in the interventions having an important effect (Zeng 2021). Where possible, we used agreed minimally important differences (MIDs) for continuous outcomes as the threshold for an important difference. Where no MID was identified, we provide an assumed MID based on agreement between the authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we looked at the absolute effects when rating imprecision, but also took into consideration the GRADE default approach (rating down when a RR crosses 1.25 or 0.80). We have justified all decisions to downgrade the certainty of the evidence using footnotes, and added comments to aid the interpretation of the findings, where necessary.

We prepared a separate summary of findings table for the following comparisons:

beta‐blockers versus placebo/no treatment;
calcium channel blockers versus placebo/no treatment.

We included all primary outcomes in the summary of findings tables. We prioritised outcomes at the time point three to six months for presentation in the table. However, as some outcomes were only reported at earlier time points, these were also included. We have also included a full GRADE profile for all results and comparisons (Table 3; Table 4).

### Update on the pharmacotherapy of cerebellar and central vestibular disorders [^0b0e949a]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine in which the patient experiences recurrent attacks of vertigo or dizziness. More recently, the diagnostic criteria were defined more precisely by the Classification Committee of Vestibular Disorders of the Barany Society together with the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). The criteria are as follows: 1. at least five episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 h; 2. current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the ICHD; 3. one or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes: 3a. headache with at least two of the following characteristics: one-sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity; 3b. photophobia and phonophobia; 3c. visual aura; 4. not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis.

Several drugs are widely used for vestibular migraine either for the attacks or as a prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency; however, none of them has proven their efficacy in clinical trials and the need for state-of-the-art randomized controlled trials was identified in a recent Cochrane Review. There is an ongoing multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the prophylactic treatment of vestibular migraine with metoprolol 95 mg per day [University of Munich (PROVEMIG-trial, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research)].

### Vestibular rehabilitation outcomes in patients with and without vestibular migraine [^9fe74659]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Vestibular rehabilitation programs do appear to play a beneficial role in the treatment of dizziness in patients with vestibular migraine. Anecdotally, however, patients with vestibular migraine may report persistent significant symptoms at the end of a standard treatment period where other non-migrainous patients are accomplishing their treatment goals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation in patients with vestibular migraine compared to patients with vestibular symptoms without migraine. Thirty-six patients (vestibular migraine = 20, vestibular impairment = 16) with significant daily vestibular symptoms received a nine week customized vestibular rehabilitation program. Each subject attended five therapy appointments occurring at initial, two, five, nine and six months. A range of subjective and physical performance outcome measures were taken at baseline, nine weeks and six months. The vestibular migraine group showed poorer subjective performance at the onset of therapy, which was not reflected in the difference in physical performance between the groups. Both groups benefitted equally from rehabilitation. The same degree of improvement was observed in the migraine group regardless of medication regime. This study has validated vestibular rehabilitation as an effective treatment in dizzy patients both with and without vestibular migraine where the use of medication did not preclude benefit from therapy. However, further research is required to clarify the role of specific vestibular suppressant medications and the scheduling of their use in relation to physical therapy.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^99e8ec6e]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Regardless of underlying pathophysiology, if a patient meets diagnostic criteria for MD, starting with MD treatments is reasonable. Should they have features of VM however, tailoring treatment to either MD or VM is sensible. If there is symptomatic overlap between VM and MD, conservative and medication options should always be pursued prior to going to surgical route. Because verapamil has demonstrated efficacy in both MD and VM, its use was studied in VM/MD-OS with promising results. Therefore, it may be reasonable to start with verapamil as a first line migraine preventive agent in the overlap disease or MD with some VM features. Interestingly, others have studied the utility in treating definite MD patient with migraine preventives after they have failed diuretic therapy with favorable results. Therefore, if an MD patient has failed multiple lines of therapy targeting MD, it may be reasonable to pursue migraine preventive medications prior to surgical approaches.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^e21f0bb2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

For continuous data: the mean values, standard deviation and number of patients for each treatment group at the different time points for outcome measurement. Where change‐from‐baseline data were not available, we extracted the values for endpoint data instead. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. mean difference) from the studies.
For binary data: we extracted information on the number of participants experiencing an event, and the number of participants assessed at that time point. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. risk ratio) from the studies.
For ordinal scale data: if the data appear to be normally distributed, or if the analysis performed by the investigators indicated that parametric tests are appropriate, then we treated the outcome measure as continuous data. Alternatively, if data were available, we converted these to binary data for analysis.
For time‐to‐event data: we did not identify any time‐to‐event data for this review.

If necessary, we converted data found in the studies to a format appropriate for meta‐analysis, according to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2021).

We pre‐specified time points of interest for the outcomes in this review. Where studies reported data at multiple time points, we took the longest available follow‐up point within each of the specific time frames. For example, if a study reported an outcome at 16 weeks and 20 weeks of follow‐up then the 20‐week data was included for the time point three to six months (12 to 24 weeks).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two authors (of AD, LHK, KW) undertook assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies independently, with the following taken into consideration, as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2011).

sequence generation;
allocation concealment;
blinding;
incomplete outcome data;
selective outcome reporting; and
other sources of bias.

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Handbook 2011), which involves describing each of these domains as reported in the study and then assigning a judgement about the adequacy of each entry: 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^6fc5e2f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

If statistical heterogeneity was identified for any comparisons, we planned to assess this considering the following subgroups:

Different types of intervention, within a specific group.
Use of any concomitant treatment.
Diagnosis of vestibular migraine.
Age of the participants.
Sex of the participants.

However, due to the paucity of data available, and the few meta‐analyses included in this review, we did not carry out any subgroup analysis.

For the outcome 'improvement of other migrainous symptoms' we planned to pool different symptoms (such as nausea and vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia, visual aura) and assess this as a composite measure. However, as we only identified a single study that assessed these outcomes, we have presented them as separate measures.

Sensitivity analysis

As few studies were identified for meta‐analysis, the random‐effects model may provide an inaccurate measure of the between‐studies variance. Therefore, we explored the impact of using a fixed‐effect model using a sensitivity analysis.

If there was uncertainty over the diagnostic criteria used for participants in the studies (for example, if it was not clear whether participants were diagnosed using criteria analogous to the IHS‐Bárány Society criteria) then we planned to explore this by including/excluding those studies from the analysis. However, this was not necessary.

We used the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Screening Tool to identify any studies where there were concerns over the data available. We planned to exclude any studies that we identified as high risk with this tool from the main analyses in the review, but we intended to explore the impact of including the data from these studies through a sensitivity analysis. Again, as we did not exclude any studies on the basis of this tool, no sensitivity analysis was required.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^b2b23f9e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Current pharmacological treatments for patients with vestibular migraine may be prophylactic, or used to treat an acute attack. Many are based on interventions that have been widely used to treat headache migraine. This review is focused on pharmacological interventions that are taken as prophylaxis, to prevent attacks occurring.

A variety of pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed, for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine symptoms. These include:

beta‐blockers, for example propranolol;
calcium channel blockers, including flunarizine;
antiepileptics, such as sodium valproate, topiramate and gabapentin;
antidepressants, including amitriptyline;
diuretics, such as acetazolamide;
monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP);
botulinum toxin;
hormonal modification.

How the intervention might work

There are currently two main targets for headache migraine prophylaxis ‐ either modulation of the pathways that process incoming nociceptive signals, or prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability (Ramadan 2007). These principles apply equally to the interventions used for vestibular migraine.

Beta‐blockers have been used for many years in the prophylaxis of headache migraine. They may act by central blockade of β₁ receptors, resulting in a reduction in norepinephrine release and synthesis. There may be additional effects on other neuronal pathways, for example through regulation of neuronal firing in the locus coeruleus and the periaqueductal grey (reviewed in Galletti 2009).

The mechanism of action of calcium channel blockers in migraine is not fully understood. They may help to reduce cerebral hypoxia, by preventing vasoconstriction of central vessels, but other mechanisms of action have been suggested ‐ including effects on the nitric oxide pathways and serotonin (reviewed in Galletti 2009).

We excluded 14 studies (17 records) with reasons recorded in the review (seeand Characteristics of excluded studies).

We identified one ongoing study, which is listed in Characteristics of ongoing studies.

We included three completed studies (six records) where results were available.

A flow chart of study retrieval and selection is provided in Figure 1.

Included studies

We included three RCTs (Bayer 2019; Lepcha 2014; Yuan 2016). Details of the individual studies can be found in the Characteristics of included studies.

Study design

All of the included studies were described as randomised controlled trials. They all included two arms, comparing an active medication to a placebo, or to no intervention. The duration of treatment ranged from three months (Lepcha 2014; Yuan 2016) to six months (Bayer 2019). The largest study was Bayer 2019, which recruited a total of 130 participants.

Participants

All three studies recruited adult participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine.

Diagnosis of vestibular migraine

The study Yuan 2016 appeared to use the IHS and Bárány Society criteria for the diagnosis of definite vestibular migraine (see Appendix 1 for details).

Bayer 2019 and Lepcha 2014 used the criteria proposed by Neuhauser 2001. The study Bayer 2019 included participants with either 'probable' (38%) or 'definite' (62%) vestibular migraine. It was not clear whether people with both definite and probable vestibular migraine were included in Lepcha 2014.

Features of vestibular migraine

None of the included studies gave details on the duration of the disease in trial participants. The authors of Bayer 2019 did state that participants in the trial had to experience between 6 and 30 attacks in the three‐month period preceding entry to the study. Similar criteria were applied in Yuan 2016, where participants needed to experience at least two attacks per month over the preceding three months. The attack frequency at baseline was not reported in Lepcha 2014.

### Vestibular migraine: the most frequent entity of episodic vertigo [^6805f25a]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common cause of episodic vertigo in adults as well as in children. The diagnostic criteria of the consensus document of the International Bárány Society for Neuro-Otology and the International Headache Society (2012) combine the typical signs and symptoms of migraine with the vestibular symptoms lasting 5 min to 72 h and exclusion criteria. Although VM accounts for 7% of patients seen in dizziness clinics and 9% of patients seen in headache clinics it is still underdiagnosed. This review provides an actual overview on the pathophysiology, the clinical characteristics to establish the diagnosis, the differential diagnosis, and the treatment of VM.

Authors' comments

Botulinum toxin is likely to be more effective for headache than vestibular symptoms in VM, with no clear benefit for vestibular outcomes seen when given in addition to preventative medication in a non-randomized study. While a beneficial effect on vestibular symptoms is still possible, this requires further research.

### Anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of vestibular migraine: a prospective observational cohort study [^e6d5f29f]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is considered the most common cause of recurrent vertigo for which specific treatments are missing. Monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide, are effective in preventing migraine. Since CGRP is also detected in human cochlear and vestibular organs it may also play a role in vestibular physiology.

Methods

This is a prospective observational cohort study, aiming at evaluating the efficacy of erenumab, fremanezumab or galcanezumab for the treatment of fifty vestibular migraine patients. We assessed mean monthly days with headache and dizziness/vestibular symptoms, pain intensity and migraine-related clinical burden occurring for 18 months.

Results

Response to treatment was excellent as 45 (90%) patients had at least a 50% reduction in vertigo frequency, 43 (86%) had at least a 50% reduction in headache frequency, and 40 (80%) a MIDAS reduction of at least 50%. Overall, 39 (78%) patients had a concomitant reduction of all three parameters. Mean monthly days with dizziness/vestibular symptoms showed an overall significant decrease from a mean of 10.3 ± 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 ± 0.3 days, difference 9.5 (CI 95% 3.6, 15.4; p < 0.001) after twelve months.

Conclusion

We show that anti-CGRP mAbs may be effective in the treatment of Vestibular Migraine. Their use should be encouraged early in the disease course to allow for a better symptom control and quality of life improvement.

Non-prescription medication treatment

Treatment options for VM are varied, and choice of treatment modality may depend on patient preferences. In 2023, a Cochrane review analyzed non-pharmacologic lifestyle modifications and concluded that there is a paucity of evidence in favor of these interventions for VM. Therefore, until we find VM-specific evidence-based interventions, it may be reasonable to extrapolate data from the migraine headache studies. Evidence-based lifestyle modifications for standard migraines include minimizing stress, identification and avoidance of triggers (e.g. heat, loud sounds, strong odors, bright lights), proper sleep hygiene and having a regular sleep schedule, dietary change (e.g. avoiding hunger, dehydration, caffeine, alcohol), creating a headache diary to identify specific food triggers, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy body habitus. The authors discuss the above interventions extensively with patients, especially those who prefer to avoid preventive medications. For certain patients, complementary therapy for migraine such as the herbal supplement feverfew as well as the natural supplements magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme q10 may be used for vestibular migraine, as all of these have some clinical trial evidence as preventives for migraines. It should be noted that in 2015 the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) retracted their 2012 complementary therapy guidelines regarding safety concerns surrounding the supplement petasite (butterbur).

Primary outcomes

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life‐threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

TREATMENT

Completed studies using standard methods have shown that migraine treatments can also be effective for VM. Table 3 includes a variety of pharmacological options recommended in international guidelines, which have shown to be effective also for vestibular migraine, although, as discussed in recent systematic reviews, these studies have low quality and there is enormous methodology heterogeneity. It is however remarkable that, independent of the fulfillment of the current Barany criteria, when grouped by symptoms, i.e. vertigo, disequilibrium or both, response to a migraine preventive did not significantly differ in any of the groups, or that reduction of vertiginous symptoms is independent from presenting psychiatric comorbidities, as an amelioration in vertigo frequency or severity is not necessarily correlated with the improvement in anxiety or depression when comparing antidepressants with other preventives. Patients with previous failure in several preventive treatments may also benefit from longer treatment with next-line prevention, such as medication targeting the CGRP pathway. Populations with high proportion of aura had a good response to symptomatic treatment with flunarizine, and brainstem aura seems to respond to the similarly-structured drug, cinnarizine. Lifestyle or dietary modifications should be discussed when appropriate.

Table 3
Migraine pharmacological treatments, effective in vestibular migraine

When evaluating the need of symptomatic and acute treatment, associated symptom should always be characterized, and treated when possible. Despite a large number of studies assessing the role of preventive treatment in VM, systematic reviews on symptomatic treatment for vestibular migraine have been disappointingly negative and thus not promising from a practical perspective. The low power in these studies may be attributed to patients not fulfilling strict criteria.

Introduction

Vestibular migraine (VM) is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized condition that causes episodic vertigo, often accompanied by headache. A condition first clearly described by Boenheim in 1917, it is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting between 1% and 2.7% of the general population, 11% of patients in specialized dizziness clinicsand 13% of patients in headache clinics. Previously known variously as 'migrainous vertigo', 'migraine-associated vertigo', 'migraine-associated dizziness', 'migraine-anxiety-associated dizziness' and 'migraine-related vestibulopathy', vestibular migraine has been accepted by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) as the unifying term that identifies both the vestibular and migrainous symptoms.

The clinical presentation of vestibular migraine is diverse. Episodes of dizziness usually last between 5 min and 72 h, although shorter and longer episodes have been reported. Vestibular symptoms can mimic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and prominent auditory symptoms with overlap with Ménière's disease have been reported. Episodes are often, but not invariably, accompanied by other symptoms of migraine, including migrainous headache, photophobia, phonophobia and visual aura. Neurological examination is classically unremarkable, but during acute attacks can reveal spontaneous or positional nystagmus in the majority of patients, and some studies have reported mild abnormalities of semicircular canal function and eye movements interictally. The current diagnostic criteria, first proposed by Neuhauser et al.and ratified by the International Headache Society and the committee for the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD) of the Bárány Society, mandate a history of migraine and the temporal overlap of vestibular and migrainous symptoms in at least 50% of episodes, and allow for the possibility of probable vestibular migraine (see Table 1). Importantly for a disease without an objective diagnostic gold standard, these criteria have been shown to be reliable on repeated assessments over a 9-year period.

Assessment of reporting biases

We assessed reporting bias as within‐study outcome reporting bias and between‐study publication bias.

Outcome reporting bias (within‐study reporting bias)

We assessed within‐study reporting bias by comparing the outcomes reported in the published report against the study protocol or trial registry, whenever this could be obtained. If the protocol or trial registry entry was not available, we compared the outcomes reported to those listed in the methods section. If results were mentioned but not reported adequately in a way that allows analysis (e.g. the report only mentions whether the results were statistically significant or not), bias in a meta‐analysis is likely to occur. We planned to seek further information from the study authors in this situation. If no further information could be found, we noted this as being a 'high' risk of bias when the risk of bias tool was used. If there was insufficient information to judge the risk of bias we noted this as an 'unclear' risk of bias (Handbook 2011).

Publication bias (between‐study reporting bias)

We planned to assess funnel plots if sufficient studies (more than 10) were available for an outcome. However, we did not identify sufficient studies to enable this. We did not identify any unpublished studies as part of this review.

Data synthesis

Meta‐analysis of numerical data

The three studies included in this review all assessed different interventions, therefore we were unable to pool any data in a meta‐analysis. Instead, we present the results of individual studies.

Synthesis using other methods

If we were unable to pool numerical data in a meta‐analysis for one or more outcomes we planned to provide a synthesis of the results using alternative methods, following the guidance in Chapter 12 of the Handbook 2021. However, as noted above, all of the studies assessed different interventions, therefore synthesis of the results was not required.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to assess statistical heterogeneity considering the following subgroups:

Different types of intervention, within a specific group.
Use of any concomitant treatment.
Diagnosis of vestibular migraine.
Age of the participants.
Sex of the participants.

However, due to the paucity of data available, and as no meta‐analyses were included in this review, we did not carry out any subgroup analysis.

Outcome reporting bias (within‐study reporting bias)

If results are mentioned but not reported adequately in a way that allows analysis (e.g. the report only mentions whether the results were statistically significant or not), bias in a meta‐analysis is likely to occur. We then sought further information from the study authors. If no further information could be found, we noted this as being a 'high' risk of bias with the risk of bias tool. If there was insufficient information to judge the risk of bias we noted this as an 'unclear' risk of bias (Handbook 2011).

Publication bias (between‐study reporting bias)

We planned to assess funnel plots to identify the likelihood of unpublished data, however we did not identify sufficient studies to be able to do this. We also planned to report on whether there were any studies identified through trial registries and other sources (Searching other resources), with unpublished reports. However, we did not identify any unpublished trials.

Data synthesis

Meta‐analysis of numerical data

Where possible and appropriate (where participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes were sufficiently similar in the studies identified) we conducted a quantitative synthesis of results, using RevMan 2020. We anticipated that the underlying effect of the intervention may vary between studies, as there were likely to be differences between participants, settings and the interventions used for each study. We therefore used a random‐effects method for meta‐analysis. We explored whether the use of a fixed‐effect model substantially altered the effect estimates (see Sensitivity analysis).

For dichotomous data, we analysed treatment differences as a risk ratio (RR) calculated using the Mantel‐Haenszel methods.

Synthesis using other methods

If we were unable to pool numerical data in a meta‐analysis for one or more outcomes we planned to provide a synthesis of the results using alternative methods, following the guidance in Chapter 12 of the Handbook 2021. However, this was not necessary.

Traditional preventive therapies

While there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials for medical management of VM, extrapolation of data of preventive medications from migraine headache trials is reasonable, and a common practical treatment strategy for VM (see Table 2). Common classes of medications that have been used to treat migraine for years include antiepileptics such as topiramate and valproic acid, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol, and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil. Although there is a dearth of randomized controlled trials, there is evidence in the form of retrospective analyses to suggest the migraine preventive medications as a general class also work for VM. Several of these individual agents including propranolol, venlafaxine, nortriptyline, topiramate, metoprolol, and valproic acid have been individually studied and shown to be effective for VM. Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that medications such as acetazolamide and lamotrigine may be more effective for the vestibular symptoms than the headache symptoms in migraine patients. The choice of agent to initiate may be based on side effect profile versus its utility in treating coexisting conditions.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

A previous Cochrane Review was prepared on this topic in 2016 but no studies were included (Maldonado Fernández 2015). At the time of publication for the previous review, the studies Bayer 2019 and Yuan 2016 had not been completed. The study Lepcha 2014 was also excluded from the original Cochrane Review, as the study used the Neuhauser 2001 criteria for diagnosis of vestibular migraine, rather than the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria. We considered that these two sets of diagnostic criteria were sufficiently similar that studies using either should be included in the review.

We identified a recent systematic review that assessed the use of a number of different pharmacological interventions for vestibular migraine (antiepileptic drugs, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, beta‐blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), as well as vestibular rehabilitation (Byun 2021). This review differs from our own in two important ways. Firstly, the authors included non‐randomised studies as well as RCTs. In addition, meta‐analyses were conducted using data collected before and after treatment for all studies. Therefore, the comparison between randomised groups was not maintained (even when analysing data from RCTs) and the studies were analysed as if they were non‐comparative cohort studies. In this review, many of these treatments appeared to show efficacy for improvement in the frequency of vestibular migraine attacks, reduction (improvement) in Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores and overall improvement in symptoms. However, there was no comparison with an appropriate control group for any of these analyses, therefore it is not possible to comment on how much of this improvement was related to the intervention itself. Given the fluctuation in symptoms of vestibular migraine we considered that these data may not accurately reflect the efficacy of these treatments. Nonetheless, Byun 2021 and colleagues do draw some similar conclusions to our own review, including the need for a longer duration of follow‐up, and the overall paucity of evidence from randomised controlled trials.

Another recent systematic review evaluated the use of pharmacological (and non‐pharmacological) interventions for both the prophylaxis and acute treatment of vestibular migraine (Smyth 2022). Again, the authors of this review included both randomised and non‐randomised studies, therefore the results are not directly comparable with our own review. However, again the conclusions are similar ‐ that the overall evidence base for the treatment of vestibular migraine is of low certainty, and that well‐designed clinical trials are required in this area.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^213d5514]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included the following interventions:

beta‐blockers;
calcium channel blockers;
antiepileptics;
antidepressants;
diuretics;
monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor;
botulinum toxin;
hormonal modification.

The main comparisons were planned to be:

beta‐blockers versus placebo/no treatment;
calcium channel blockers versus placebo/no treatment;
antiepileptics versus placebo/no treatment;
antidepressants versus placebo/no treatment;
diuretics versus placebo/no treatment;
monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor versus placebo/no treatment;
botulinum toxin versus placebo/no treatment;
hormonal modification versus placebo/no treatment.

Concurrent treatments

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, and to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment.

Types of outcome measures

We assessed outcomes at the following time points:

 < 3 months;
3 to 6 months;
> 6 to 12 months.

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow‐up.

We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to vestibular migraine and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritised. The results of this survey were used by the review author team to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review.

We analysed the following outcomes in the review (but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies).

Vestibular Migraine

Overview

Descriptions of dizziness in association with migraine can be found in literature over 150 years ago. However, the widespread awareness of dizziness as a major component of migraine symptomatology was not well elucidated until the emergence of several case series in the 1980s and 1990s. Numerous theories for the underlying pathophysiology of this dizziness have been proposed such as a spreading wave of depression, transient vasospasm, and release of neuroactive peptides leading to hyperexcitability of primary afferent neurons. Since then, descriptions and studies of VM exploded, and in 2012, the Bárány Society published the first consensus diagnostic criteria for VM, a major victory for increased awareness, recognition, and accurate diagnosis of this condition.

Epidemiology

Based on the Bárány consensus criteria definition, a review of a large population-based survey revealed that the prevalence of dizziness in the general population meeting criteria for VM was 2.7%, which makes it the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo. Indeed, the prevalence over a one-year period was found to be 1.7x higher than that of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and 5.4–13.5x higher than that of Ménière's disease. Among those patients who meet the definition for VM, only 10% were told that migraine was likely the cause of their dizziness, and many of them were diagnosed with a mimic instead. Therefore, VM is likely both underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. Another finding in this study was that nearly a quarter of all patients with dizziness in a one-year period may have VM, which would make it the most common cause of dizziness overall.

Background

Description of the condition

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine in which a prominent symptom, often the predominant symptom, is recurrent attacks of vertigo (Dieterich 1999; Lempert 2009). These episodes of vertigo are associated with other headache migraine features, such as headache or sensitivity to light or sound.

The diagnosis of vestibular migraine is challenging because of the overlap of some symptoms with both other balance disorders (such as Ménière's disease) and with headache migraine. People suffering from headache migraine may experience occasional vestibular symptoms, but this does not amount to a diagnosis of 'vestibular migraine'.

There is now an agreed international classification system that includes categories for 'definite' and 'probable' vestibular migraine (Lempert 2012; described in Appendix 1). In brief, a definite diagnosis of vestibular migraine requires at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms (of moderate to severe intensity) lasting between five minutes and 72 hours. At least half of the episodes must be associated with migrainous features (such as headache, photophobia, phonophobia or a visual aura) and individuals must also have a history of migraine. A diagnosis of 'probable' vestibular migraine requires similar features, but individuals have either migrainous features or a history of migraines (both are not required). Prior to this internationally agreed classification, the criteria proposed by Neuhauser and colleagues were widely used to identify people with vestibular migraine (Neuhauser 2001, see Appendix 2). There is a great deal of similarity between these classification systems, although the Neuhauser criteria do not require a certain number of episodes, or duration of episodes, to make the diagnosis.

### Migrainous vertigo, tinnitus, and ear symptoms and alternatives [^170948e3]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Migraine headaches frequently coexist with vestibular symptoms such as vertigo, motion sickness, and gait instability. Migraine-related vasospasm can also damage the inner ear, which results in symptoms such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss and resultant tinnitus. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is not yet fully understood, and despite their prevalence, there is no universally approved management. This review summarizes the data on complementary and integrative medicine in treating patients with migrainous ear disorders.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^ec6ed7f1]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

One method to distinguish the above is ruling in BPPV by positional testing and noting resolution with respective treatment, as well as a thorough history to investigate spontaneous dizziness history typical of VM. When the diagnosis remains uncertain, we recommend repeated examinations and treatment maneuvers targeted at BPPV. If the nystagmus is persistent for greater than a minute yet still a classic positional pattern for BPPV, one should still consider targeted treatment at BPPV with vibration applied to the mastoid for consideration of cupulolithiasis. The rationale for these recommendations is that BPPV treatment often leads to quicker results and is very low risk. Concurrent vitamin D supplementation should be considered if levels are low. Should these treatment maneuvers fail, consideration should be given to empiric migraine preventive therapy and lifestyle modifications. Patients should still be followed over time, and regular interval assessments of history (e.g. classic migraine associations such as photophobia and phonophobia or migraine triggers), and regular assessment of positional nystagmus should be made.

Sensitivity analysis

We planned to carry out a number of sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes in this review. However, the paucity of data and the lack of meta‐analyses has meant that this was not possible.

We used the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Screening Tool to identify any studies with concerns over the data available. We had intended that any studies identified by the tool would be excluded from the main analyses in the review, but that we would explore the impact of including the data from these studies through a sensitivity analysis. However, as noted above, we had some concerns over the use of this tool, and few studies were included in the review, therefore this sensitivity analysis was not conducted.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

Two independent authors (KG, KW) used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence using GRADEpro GDT and the guidance in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2021). Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus, or with recourse to a third author if necessary. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and we applied this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high certainty of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low certainty implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.

Abortive treatment

There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific pharmacological therapy for the termination of acute vertigo attacks in VM. Neuromodulation (eTNS and VNS) may be of benefit in some patients but requires further confirmation in placebo-controlled studies. The use of so-called 'vestibular sedatives' (e.g. prochlorperazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine) is widespread across dizziness syndromes and may be of benefit in patients with VM with coexistent motion sickness or nausea, although there is no specific evidence for these agents in VM. It is important to avoid taking these medications more than 10 days per month, because regular use can cause patients to become sensitized to their effects and there is also a risk of withdrawal. Similarly, it is important to avoid taking analgesics or triptans more than 10 days per month due to the risk of analgesic-overuse headache.

Preventative treatment

No one pharmacological therapy has been shown to be clearly superior to another for VM prophylaxis. All before-and-after studies demonstrated clinical improvement, with no serious and usually low rates of adverse effects reported. Where studies involved multiple treatment arms, there was no clear superiority of one agent over another. The American Headache Society recommends starting preventative medication in patients with at least three to six (depending on severity) migraine headaches per month, and while no such recommendations exist for VM, given the relative lack of abortive treatment options, a lower threshold may be applied, in discussion with the patient. In general, medications should be started at a low dose and slowly titrated up to response: this principle was demonstrated in the study of topiramate where higher-dose treatment with was associated with increased side effects and medication discontinuation. In patients who fail a medication, we typically treat with one drug at a time to minimize adverse effects, although some authors have advocated using polytherapy.

Authors' comments

Amitriptyline and venlafaxine may reduce vertigo severity and frequency to a similar degree as other medications, although like the majority of other treatments the evidence is primarily taken from before-and-after analyses. Venlafaxine is likely to have additional benefits in VM patients with concurrent low mood.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We identified only three studies for inclusion in this review. They evaluated two of our proposed interventions of interest: beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Beta‐blockers versus placebo

One study assessed this comparison ‐ participants were randomised to receive either 95 mg metoprolol once daily or a placebo. Metoprolol may make little or no difference to the frequency of vertigo episodes, disease‐specific quality of life and the frequency of headaches at between three and six months of follow‐up. The evidence regarding the occurrence of serious adverse effects was very uncertain. The other outcomes we prioritised in this review were not reported by the authors of this study (improvement in vertigo, improvement in other migrainous symptoms and other adverse effects).

Calcium channel blockers versus no intervention

Two studies evaluated this comparison, both using a dose of 10 mg flunarizine daily. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Participants receiving flunarizine may be more likely to report improvement in vertigo (when assessed using a global score of vertigo symptoms), but the evidence is very uncertain. The frequency of vertigo episodes may also be slightly reduced for those who receive flunarizine but, again, the certainty of the evidence was very low. The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of flunarizine on improvement in vertigo (when assessed as a dichotomous outcome, rather than using a continuous scale) and headache. Flunarizine may result in an increase in the side effects of weight gain and drowsiness, but the confidence intervals were very wide and the evidence is very uncertain. We did not identify any data on serious adverse events, disease‐specific quality of life or other migrainous symptoms.

### "Vestibular migraine": effects of prophylactic therapy with various drugs. A retrospective study [^d85b4288]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Vertigo is frequently associated with migraine, and sometimes it is the cardinal symptom. This type of migraine is called "vestibular migraine", "migrainous vertigo", or "migraine-associated vertigo". Earlier findings on effective prophylactic medication for such migraine attacks and their clinical features are few and insufficient. Our aim was to study the influence of prophylactic therapy on this type of migraine and to specify its clinical features. In a retrospective approach 100 patients (median age 47 years, range 21–72 years) with definite or probable vestibular migraine were divided into two groups: those with (74 patients) and those without drug prophylaxis (26 patients). They were then interviewed by telephone at least 6 months after beginning therapy. All patients receiving medical prophylaxis showed a decrease of duration, intensity, and frequency of episodic vertigo as well as nearly all its associated features (p < 0.01). The group without medical prophylactic therapy showed only a reduction of vertigo intensity. Only 39% of the 100 patients met the current IHS criteria for a basilar-type migraine. Thus, we propose that a new category — "vestibular migraine" — should be added to the HIS criteria. Furthermore, our data show that prophylactic medication may be effective for treating vestibular migraine and its associated symptoms; therefore, patient's response to medical therapy may provide guidance in the diagnostic process of vestibular migraine.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^9d3a8fb6]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

A commonality between VM and PPPD is that both diseases may be triggered or exaggerated by passive motion (e.g. riding an escalator), visual stimuli (e.g. a bright computer screen), or complex visual cues (e.g. watching an action movie). Symptoms that are present more often than not and vary throughout the day (e.g. worse toward the end of the day) are suggestive of PPPD, whereas VM is an episodic condition lasting minutes, hours, or sometimes days in duration. Migraine specific associations such as headache or migraine triggers such as barometric pressure changes, menstruation, or specific foods may also make vestibular migraine more likely. Anxiety symptoms commonly coexist with both VM and PPPD.

VM and PPPD not only share certain clinical features (e.g. visual sensitivity), but also commonly co-exist. In these cases, treatment may focus on either disease. When treating a patient who has both VM and PPPD, it may be reasonable to treat with an SNRI such as venlafaxine or duloxetine since both have evidence in migraine as well as PPPD. Should this treatment fail, regular follow-ups to understand whether symptomatology is more VM or PPPD-related allows the clinician to tailor the treatment plan. If the patient has developed migraine triggers for symptoms and frequent headaches, migraine lifestyle modifications and a migraine preventive can be considered. Likewise, if the patient has developed constant symptoms that are worse when upright, then an SSRI and CBT may be considered.

Central vestibular disorders

Vestibular migraine

Vestibular migraine is increasingly regarded as the most common central cause of recurrent attacks of vertigo. Characteristic features include recurrent attacks of various combinations of vertigo, ataxia of stance and gait, photophobia and phonophobia, and other brainstem symptoms, accompanied or followed by head pressure, pain, nausea, or vomiting. Treatment is the same as for migraine with aura: beta-blockers (metoprolol or propranolol), valproic acid, or topiramate for at least 3–6 months. Several treatment trials have been performed in patients with vestibular migraine. Tricyclic antidepressants in combination with diet gave a good response (> 95%) in a noncontrolled trial on 81 patients. For zolmitriptan, the response rate in acute attacks was 38 versus 22% for placebo in a study on 19 patients. Another open trial on 10 patients demonstrated that lamotrigine (100 mg/day as a single dose) had a significant effect on the occurrence of headache and a more marked effect on vertigo. The treatment options have been summarized in a retrospective study. At present, only standard treatments for migraine with aura can be recommended for vestibular migraine. A placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of metoprolol on the frequency of attacks in vestibular migraine has been initiated (PROVEMIG EudraCT No. 2009-013701-34).

In summary, the pharmacotherapy of vestibular migraine has not yet been evaluated with state-of-the-art clinical trials. Consequently, only drugs that are effective for treating migraine with and without aura can currently be recommended. For the therapy of acute attacks, aspirin and an antiemetic could be offered, whereas metoprolol (100 mg/day), topiramate (50–100 mg/day), or valproic acid (300–900 mg/day) could be offered for prophylaxis.

Selection of studies

At least two review authors or co‐workers (of AD, KG, LHK, KW, SC) independently screened the remaining titles and abstracts usingto identify studies that may be relevant for this review. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus, or by retrieving the full text of the study for further assessment.

We obtained the full text for any study that may have been relevant and two authors or co‐workers (of AD, KG, LHK, KW) again independently checked this to determine whether it met the inclusion criteria for the review. Any differences were resolved by discussion and consensus, or through recourse to a third author if necessary.

We listed as excluded any studies that were retrieved in full text but subsequently deemed to be inappropriate for the review (according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria), according to the main reason for exclusion.

The unit of interest for the review is the study, therefore multiple papers or reports of a single study have been grouped together under a single reference identification. We recorded the study selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1) and the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^1b7377e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

All three studies recruited adult participants with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine.

Diagnosis of vestibular migraine

The studies Qi 2020 and Aydin 2020 appeared to use the IHS and Bárány Society criteria for the diagnosis of vestibular migraine (see Appendix 1 for details). Qi 2020 only included those with 'definite' vestibular migraine. It was not clear whether individuals with 'probable' vestibular migraine were also included in Aydin 2020.

McPhee 2017 used the criteria proposed by Neuhauser 2001 (see Appendix 2), and included those with either 'probable' or 'definite' vestibular migraine.

Features of vestibular migraine

Two studies gave some information on the duration of disease. Participants in McPhee 2017 had a mean time since diagnosis of 7.99 months in the control group and 15.05 months in the intervention group. There was a discrepancy in the reporting of the duration of symptoms in Aydin 2020. Data reported in a table indicated that the time since onset of headache symptoms was 12.5 years, and the time since onset of vestibular symptoms was 4.75 years. However, the text stated "The patients reported having headaches for about 10 years, and the duration of the vertigo symptoms was approximately 2.8 years".

Interventions and comparisons

Each of the studies considered a different comparison of interest in this review.

Dietary intervention (probiotics) versus placebo

The study Qi 2020 considered a dietary intervention (the use of probiotics) to placebo. Participants were randomised to receive either 2 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units of Lactobacillus casei Shirota daily for four months, or a corn‐starch placebo.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus no treatment

McPhee 2017 used a CBT intervention for eight weeks and compared this to no treatment (a wait‐list control group).

Vestibular rehabilitation versus no treatment

The study Aydin 2020 included three groups. The first group received "standard medical treatment" ‐ this was not standardised across the group, but typically included propranolol (or other drugs if this was contraindicated). The second group received standard medical treatment plus vestibular rehabilitation. These groups have been compared in this review (i.e. the comparison is of vestibular rehabilitation plus standard medical care versus standard medical care alone ‐ overall, estimating the effect of vestibular rehabilitation). The third arm received vestibular rehabilitation alone, but there was no relevant arm to compare this (no group received no treatment), therefore we excluded this treatment arm from the review.

### International headache society evidence-based guidelines on the use of non-invasive neuromodulation devices for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine [^2f48c147]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveTo develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for non-invasive neuromodulation devices in acute and preventive migraine treatment. MethodsA systematic review was conducted across six databases from 1946 to April 2025. Randomized controlled trials evaluating Food and Drug Administration-cleared or Conformité Européenne (CE)-marked non-invasive neuromodulation devices were included. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and recommendations were developed through consensus following GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks. The working group comprised 15 senior members and six junior members. ResultsFrom 1536 initial records, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were finally used to develop evidence-based recommendations. Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. Weak recommendations were issued for SAVI Dual, Cefaly, Relivion, and Nerivio in the treatment of acute migraine attacks, and for gammaCore Sapphire, Cefaly, and Nerivio in the preventive migraine treatment. Other cleared devices received no recommendations or have no eligible studies for the GRADE assessment. The primary limitations across studies included imprecision due to small sample sizes and various methodological concerns. Additionally, expert consensus recommendations were developed for devices and clinical scenarios not adequately covered by randomized controlled trials, including potential applications in pediatric populations, vestibular migraine, chronic migraine, menstrual migraine, and medication overuse headache. ConclusionNon-invasive neuromodulation devices offer promising alternatives to drug treatment for migraine management. These devices are safe and generally well tolerated and devoid of drug interactions. While current evidence quality varies, ongoing research and technological advancements show encouraging potential. Future studies should adhere to International Headache Society guidelines for neuromodulation device trials, address proper sham controls and blinding assessment, and account for patient adherence challenges in device use. Expanded insurance coverage would enhance cost-effectiveness and device accessibility. These guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making while highlighting areas requiring further research.

### Migraine and dizziness [^d9532d2b]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Awareness of the importance of migraine in patients with symptoms of vestibular dysfunction is increasing. This article gives an overview of the multiple facets of the link between migraine and vestibular dysfunction.

Recent Findings

The vestibular and the headache community have published a consensual definition of vestibular migraine, which is an important step to promote research on the topic and the awareness of clinicians. Vestibular migraine is considered the most common cause of spontaneous recurrent vertigo. So far, the evidence for vestibular migraine has been mainly epidemiological, but the recent follow-up of a cohort over 9 years could show the robustness of the diagnosis over time. Additionally, migraine and vestibular dysfunction have multiple potential interactions and links through a range of comorbidities such as Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, anxiety and motion sickness, which go beyond the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine.

Summary

The further refinement and wider acceptance of the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine is an important development as it is one the most common vestibular disorders. But the relationship between migraine and vestibular dysfunction is complex and has many aspects beyond vestibular migraine.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^2c7a7d4b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine in Ménière's disease — It is not uncommon for a patient to have both MD and VM, and the prevalence of VM is high (2.7% in population studies and 10% in outpatient clinics); a dizziness specialty clinic in South Korea found that 35% (88 of 251) of MD patients also met criteria for definite or probable VM. When there is uncertainty about VM or MD, treatment decisions should proceed through noninvasive therapeutic trials prior to any surgical or inner ear ablative interventions, and destructive interventions should be reserved for those with severe progressive hearing loss/lack of usable hearing. Adequate clinical trials of abortive or prophylactic medicines in VM are not available, and VM is not "ruled out" by a lack of response to typical migraine medicines; therefore, the epidemiology of VM should be respected in the decision-making process.

### Current and emerging medical therapies for dizziness [^b90ba3fa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical therapies for dizziness are aimed at vertigo reduction, secondary symptom management, or the root cause of the pathologic process. Acute peripheral vertigo pharmacotherapies include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic pharmacotherapies vary between causes. For Meniere disease, betahistine and diuretics remain initial first-line oral options, whereas intratympanic steroids and intratympanic gentamicin are reserved for uncontrolled symptoms. For cerebellar dizziness and oculomotor disorders, 4-aminopyridine may provide benefit. For vestibular migraine, persistent postural perceptual dizziness and mal de débarquement, treatment options overlap and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and calcium channel blockers.
