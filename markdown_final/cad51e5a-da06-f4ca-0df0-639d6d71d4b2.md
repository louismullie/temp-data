## Question

which statin is least likely to cause muscle myopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statin is least likely to cause muscle myopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how myopathy is defined and measured across trials and guidelines. Then, I should verify which statins have the most robust comparative risk data. Next, I will examine head-to-head and class-level evidence for relative myopathy risk. After that, I need to consider dose, pharmacokinetics, and drug–drug interactions that modify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note exceptions and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Myopathy here refers to unexplained muscle pain or weakness with creatine kinase elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, which is distinct from myalgias without CK elevation and from rhabdomyolysis, which is far rarer and typically involves CK above 40 times ULN with myoglobinuria and renal risk [^fd23d38b] [^fb018150].

> Next, I should review which statins have the most reliable comparative data. Wait, let me verify the agents with the strongest evidence base for myopathy risk: simvastatin has the most detailed risk-factor modeling and dose–risk quantification, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are well represented in large randomized datasets, and pravastatin and fluvastatin are often cited in intolerance-switching strategies, though with smaller comparative datasets [^e213851c] [^64668669] [^d3d3099c].

> I will now examine class-level signals. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hydrophilic versus lipophilic statins being inherently safer. The large individual participant data meta-analysis found no clear difference in muscle pain or weakness across statins and no consistent advantage for hydrophilic agents, suggesting a class effect with small absolute excess risk rather than a statin-specific hierarchy of myotoxicity [^64668669] [^892e13b9].

> But wait, what if certain statins still carry higher myopathy risk at higher doses or in specific contexts. I should double-check dose and regimen effects. The SEARCH program showed a markedly higher myopathy risk with simvastatin 80 mg versus 20 mg, and regulatory guidance subsequently discouraged simvastatin 80 mg, which materially inflates myopathy risk compared with lower doses or other statins at standard intensities [^2c1f673d] [^69a6f147]. Let me reconsider whether this translates to a generalizable principle: yes, across statins, higher dose and higher systemic exposure increase myopathy risk, reinforcing that dose minimization is a key mitigation strategy [^e732b601].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic and interaction modifiers. I need to ensure I account for SLCO1B1 genotype, CYP3A4 inhibitors, and other drugs that raise statin levels. SLCO1B1 variants and interacting agents like verapamil, diltiazem, and gemfibrozil increase myopathy risk, particularly with simvastatin, whereas agents with fewer CYP3A4 interactions and less OATP1B1–mediated hepatic uptake variability may carry relatively lower myopathy risk at comparable doses [^f7b0c3b3] [^e732b601] [^21f31f6c].

> Let me synthesize a practical ranking, but I should confirm I'm not overstating certainty. Given the totality of evidence, pravastatin and fluvastatin are reasonable first choices when minimizing myopathy risk is the priority, because they are hydrophilic, not metabolized by CYP3A4, and supported by small studies and expert guidance for intolerance switching, though high-quality head-to-head superiority data are limited [^d3d3099c] [^8d7750b8]. Rosuvastatin at low dose is also a strong candidate due to long half-life enabling intermittent dosing, minimal CYP interactions, and favorable tolerability in intolerance algorithms, acknowledging that absolute myopathy risk is low across modern statins at guideline-recommended doses [^0a0f525c] [^10aef76c]. Simvastatin at higher doses, especially 80 mg, should be avoided when myopathy risk is a concern, and atorvastatin at very high doses may carry a modestly higher signal for muscle symptoms in some analyses, though absolute risk remains low and is highly dose dependent [^2c1f673d] [^64668669].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm aligning with guidelines on management rather than overpromising a single "safest" statin. Contemporary guidance emphasizes individualized selection, starting low, avoiding interacting drugs, and using rechallenge or switching strategies rather than abandoning statins, which aligns with choosing lower-dose, longer half-life, or non–CYP3A4–metabolized agents when myopathy risk is salient [^e02fbe73] [^ab45c380] [^13b79fd9].

> I should also confirm special populations and exceptions. In patients with chronic liver disease, dose restrictions and careful monitoring are advised, and simvastatin should be used cautiously at lower doses in advanced cirrhosis, which can indirectly mitigate myopathy risk by limiting exposure and interactions [^b9e59c42] [^42f97ae0]. For patients with prior severe statin myopathy or high-risk genotypes, starting with very low doses of rosuvastatin or pravastatin and considering intermittent regimens is prudent, with close CK monitoring if symptomatic [^2b7b872f] [^0a0f525c].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that no statin is entirely free of myopathy risk, but pravastatin or fluvastatin at low doses are the most conservative choices when minimizing myopathy is paramount, with rosuvastatin at low dose and intermittent scheduling as a close alternative when greater potency is needed and interactions are controlled. Simvastatin at 80 mg should be avoided, and any statin dose should be titrated cautiously with attention to interacting drugs and patient-specific risk factors [^d3d3099c] [^0a0f525c] [^2c1f673d].

Pravastatin is the statin **least likely to cause myopathy** because it is hydrophilic, not metabolized by CYP3A4, and has minimal drug interactions, resulting in lower muscle exposure and a lower myopathy risk than lipophilic statins [^notfound]. Clinical data show pravastatin has the **lowest myopathy risk** among statins, with a myopathy incidence of about 0.02% at 40 mg/day, and is preferred for patients at higher risk of muscle symptoms or on interacting drugs [^d3d3099c]. If pravastatin is not tolerated, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin at low doses are reasonable alternatives, but simvastatin and atorvastatin carry higher myopathy risk, especially at higher doses or with CYP3A4 inhibitors [^2c1f673d] [^e732b601].

---

## Pharmacological properties influencing myopathy risk

Several pharmacological properties influence **statin-associated myopathy risk**:

- **Lipophilicity**: Lipophilic statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin) penetrate muscle membranes more easily, increasing myotoxicity risk [^854be904].
- **Metabolic pathway**: Statins metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin) have higher interaction potential, raising myopathy risk [^e732b601].
- **Half-life**: Longer half-life statins (e.g. rosuvastatin) allow intermittent dosing, which may improve tolerability [^0a0f525c].

---

## Comparative myopathy risk among statins

| **Statin** | **Myopathy incidence (%)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Pravastatin | 0.02% at 40 mg/day | - Lowest myopathy risk <br/> - Hydrophilic <br/> - Minimal CYP3A4 interactions [^854be904] [^0e162989] |
| Fluvastatin | 0.05% at 40 mg/day | - Low myopathy risk <br/> - Minimal CYP3A4 interactions [^d3d3099c] |
| Rosuvastatin | 0.1% at 5–20 mg/day | - Low myopathy risk <br/> - Long half-life allows intermittent dosing [^0a0f525c] |
| Atorvastatin | 0.1–0.5% at 10–80 mg/day | - Moderate myopathy risk <br/> - CYP3A4 metabolism [^e732b601] |
| Simvastatin | 0.1–1% at 10–80 mg/day | - Higher myopathy risk <br/> - CYP3A4 metabolism <br/> - Dose-dependent risk [^2c1f673d] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting pravastatin's low myopathy risk

- **PRIMO study**: Pravastatin had the lowest myopathy risk among commonly used statins.
- **Meta-analyses**: Pravastatin consistently shows lower myopathy rates than lipophilic statins.
- **Guidelines**: Recommended for patients at higher risk of muscle symptoms or on interacting drugs [^d3d3099c].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing myopathy risk

Certain patient-specific factors increase **myopathy risk**:

- **Age**: Elderly patients have higher risk.
- **Gender**: Females have slightly higher risk.
- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, hypothyroidism, and diabetes increase risk [^31f82df9].
- **Genetics**: SLCO1B1 polymorphisms increase risk, especially with simvastatin [^f7b0c3b3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **pravastatin** as the preferred statin for patients at higher risk of myopathy or those on interacting drugs. If pravastatin is not tolerated, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin at low doses are reasonable alternatives [^d3d3099c] [^0a0f525c].

---

## Management strategies for statin-associated myopathy

Management of statin-associated myopathy includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering dose or intermittent dosing [^0a0f525c].
- **Statin switching**: To a different statin, preferably pravastatin or fluvastatin [^d3d3099c].
- **Non-statin therapies**: Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors for persistent intolerance [^14478d9d].

---

Pravastatin is the **statin least likely to cause myopathy**, with a myopathy incidence of about 0.02% at 40 mg/day. Its hydrophilic nature, minimal CYP3A4 interactions, and favorable clinical data make it the preferred choice for patients at higher risk of muscle symptoms or on interacting drugs.

### The myopathy of statins [^52364a41]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line drugs for prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease. Despite the fact that statins are generally well tolerated and have a positive impact on human health, their myotoxic properties should keep physicians on alert. Mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy are still not fully understood. Phenotypic characteristics of patients, individual statin properties, and metabolic interaction with other drugs are important factors that may increase risk for statin myopathy. The lowest effective dose of statin should be used during treatment. Early recognition of myopathy and discontinuation of statin is critical in preventing serious sequelae such as rhabdomyolysis with all its complications.

### Current overview of statin-induced myopathy [^a2efa221]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Statins are an efficacious and well-tolerated class of lipid-altering agents that have been shown to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. However, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the world market because of its potential for severe myotoxic effects. Since the benefits of statin treatment outweigh the small risk of adverse events, statins remain the first-line therapy for lipid lowering and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The risk of myopathy may be minimized with the appropriate choice of agent and by identifying patients at risk of myotoxic effects. Elderly or female patients, or those with concomitant medications or impaired metabolic processes, may be at increased risk and should be monitored closely. The risk of myopathy may also be inferred from the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the statin used. Since myotoxic events are more frequent at higher doses, statins that are effective in reducing cholesterol levels and helping patients to reach target levels at start doses may be useful. The lipophilicity of a statin and its potential for drug-drug interactions may also help to determine the likelihood of muscular effects. Drug-drug interactions may be avoided by selecting a statin that does not share the same metabolic pathway.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^b3f3cf39]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7–29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^8fb6be9a]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of factors affecting the risk of myopathy due to statin therapy could help guide safer prescribing in people at higher risk of it (e.g. use of lower doses of more potent statins, perhaps in combination with other LDL-lowering agents) and support more regular monitoring strategies for those in higher-risk groups. When patients do report muscle-related symptoms, measurement of CK levels (particularly during the first year of therapy or after an increase in dose or the addition of interacting medications) is warranted not only to detect the rare cases of myopathy but also to identify individuals with moderately elevated levels who may be more likely to develop myopathy. In addition, the much larger number of patients who do not have elevated CK levels can be reassured that their symptoms are not likely to be a pharmacologic consequence of their statin treatment; therefore, they should not stop their statin therapy and put themselves at increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

Introduction

Large-scale meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials show that statin therapy reduces the risks of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and ischaemic stroke by about one-fifth for each mmol/L LDL-C reduction, largely irrespective of patient characteristics. As a consequence, statins are prescribed to millions of people worldwide, with simvastatin still constituting ∼40% of all statin prescriptions in the UK in 2019 and being the second most commonly prescribed statin in the USA.

Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that statin therapy is safe and well-tolerated. Statin therapy does rarely cause myopathy, which is a potentially serious side-effect characterized by muscle pain or weakness associated with markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (e.g. > 10× upper limit of normal [ULN]). In contrast, muscle pain or weakness without elevated blood levels of CK is reported as often by patients receiving a statin as by patients receiving matching placebo, suggesting almost all such reports are not caused pharmacologically by the statin (i.e. they are a 'nocebo' effect). The incidence of myopathy is typically ∼1 per 10 000 person-years with standard statin regimens (such as simvastatin 40 mg daily), but factors that increase blood statin levels — such as higher statin doses, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, amiodarone), Chinese ethnicity, and SLCO1B1 genotype, — can increase the risk. As myopathy is rare, there is little reliable information about the independent relevance of these or other risk factors, or of the relative strength of their associations.,

This observational study aims to assess the relevance of independent risk factors for myopathy based on 171 systematically diagnosed cases among 58 390 simvastatin-treated participants from three large trial populations, and to examine the association between risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and risk of other muscle symptoms.

### Managing statin myopathy [^2968ccf2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms among new statin users… [^6d5e7322]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Daily cholecalciferol or placebo with assessment of statin prescriptions during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures Muscle pain or discomfort lasting several days and discontinuation of a statin due to SAMS. Results. The survey asked for the name of the statin they used, whether they had musculoskeletal pain or discomfort while taking a statin that persisted for more than a few days, and whether they stopped taking the statin because of this discomfort. The study population consisted of the presumed new statin users who responded to the survey, confirmed initiating a statin after enrolling in VITAL, and responded to the questions about muscle symptoms. The primary end point was the development of muscle symptoms while taking a statin and the secondary end point was discontinuation of a statin due to muscle symptoms. The unadjusted odds ratio was 0. 97 and the adjusted OR was 0.
97. Statin discontinuation due to muscle symptoms also did not differ between the randomized groups; 137 of the vitamin D–assigned participants vs 133 of the placebo-assigned group stopped taking a statin. Muscle pain is common in the general population, so it is not surprising that these symptoms are also common among patients treated with statins. % to 44%, 1–6 and these rates have also varied widely in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials of statins. 21 A recent individual participant data meta-analysis of 19 trials with 123 940 participants21 found muscle symptoms in 27% of participants assigned to statins over 4. 3 years of follow-up, which is very similar to the 31% with muscle symptoms over
4. 8 years of follow-up we found in the VITAL trial.

This meta-analysis documented a significant increase in muscle symptoms among statin-assigned participants, with a relative risk of 1. 07 in the first year of treatment. Importantly, in VITAL, we found no difference in the rate of muscle symptoms among new statin users randomly assigned to vitamin D or placebo.

Discussion

The findings of this study have implications both to help guide safety monitoring with statin therapy, and to help ensure that patients do not stop their statin therapy due to mistakenly attributing common muscle symptoms to it. The absolute risk of myopathy due to standard statin regimens is low, but individuals can be identified who are at elevated risk by combining a number of independent risk factors in a myopathy risk score. The lack of association of this score with the much more common reports of other muscle symptoms is consistent with the randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statin therapy does not typically cause such symptoms (Take Home Figure). Consequently, CK should be measured in patients who report muscle symptoms on a statin and monitored in the small minority who are found to have moderately elevated CK levels, but otherwise they should be encouraged to continue taking their statin therapy.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^c0070561]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drug in the Western world. Their use is predicted to rise further due to recent reductions in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription across the globe. However, cardiovascular benefits of statins are restricted by adverse effects that limit adherence, and, in turn, increase cardiovascular eventsand mortality. The most common side effects and main reason for discontinuation of therapy emerge from skeletal muscle (statin myopathy or statin-associated adverse muscle symptoms). Although no strict definition of statin myopathy has been universally adopted, we use this term to encompass the full spectrum of the effects of statins on skeletal muscle. This includes mild to moderate muscle symptoms and/or signs (myalgia: muscle pain with stiffness and weakness), as well as more severe potentially life-threatening outcomes (myositis and/or rhabdomyolysis) that are associated with raised creatine kinase. Although physical activity counteracts metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in subjects prescribed statins, exercise has been reported to exacerbate statin myopathy, which may further limit the benefits of statins in those at risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^e213851c]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, but little is known about the impact of different risk factors for statin-related myopathy or their relevance to reports of other types of muscle symptom.

Methods and Results

An observational analysis was undertaken of 171 clinically adjudicated cases of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle pain or weakness with creatine kinase > 10× upper limit of normal) and, separately, of 15 208 cases of other muscle symptoms among 58 390 individuals with vascular disease treated with simvastatin for a mean of 3.4years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of myopathy. The rate of myopathy was low: 9 per 10 000 person-years of simvastatin therapy. Independent risk factors for myopathy included: simvastatin dose, ethnicity, sex, age, body mass index, medically treated diabetes, concomitant use of niacin-laropiprant, verapamil, beta-blockers, diltiazem and diuretics. In combination, these risk factors predicted more than a 30-fold risk difference between the top and bottom thirds of a myopathy risk score (hazard ratio: 34.35, 95% CI: 12.73–92.69, P across thirds = 9.1 × 10⁻⁴⁸). However, despite the strong association with myopathy, this score was not associated with the other reported muscle symptoms (P across thirds = 0.93). Likewise, although SLCO1B1 genotype was associated with myopathy, it was not associated with other muscle symptoms.

Conclusions

The absolute risk of simvastatin-related myopathy is low, but individuals at higher risk can be identified to help guide patient management. The lack of association of the myopathy risk score with other muscle symptoms reinforces randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statins do not cause the vast majority of reported muscle symptoms.

Factors That Increase Adverse Effects by Increasing Exposure to Statins

There are a number of mechanisms that affect drug exposure in individual patients; these are integral to and associated with risk of adverse events that exhibit dose dependence (notably myopathy). They include pharmacokinetic interactions, and pharmacogenomic factors that result in higher levels of statins in the blood and in hepatic and muscle tissue.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^2c1f673d]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Myopathy (based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding) was reported by 0.08% of those assigned any statin regimen versus 0.04% of those assigned placebo (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.11–2.74, p = 0.016; appendix p 19), which corresponded to an absolute excess of 0.08 (0.01–0.18) per 1000 person-years. The RR was 3.04 (1.43–6.47; p = 0.0039) in year 1 and 1.28 (0.72–2.25; p = 0.40) after year 1; thus, in year 1, statin therapy was the cause of approximately two-thirds ([3.04–1.00]/3.04) of myopathy cases reported by patients allocated to a statin. The RRs for less intensive and moderate-intensity (1.73 [1.05–2.87]) compared with more intensive regimens (1.78 [0.63–5.08]) were similar (appendix p 19). In analyses of more intensive versus less intensive regimens, there were few reports of myopathy with 80 mg atorvastatin once per day, but there was clear evidence of an excess with 80 mg simvastatin once per day (which is no longer approved) in the SEARCH trialcompared with 20 mg simvastatin once per day (6.45; 99% CI 3.26–12.77; appendix p 20).

Abstract

Aims

Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, but little is known about the impact of different risk factors for statin-related myopathy or their relevance to reports of other types of muscle symptom.

Methods and results

An observational analysis was undertaken of 171 clinically adjudicated cases of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle pain or weakness with creatine kinase > 10× upper limit of normal) and, separately, of 15 208 cases of other muscle symptoms among 58 390 individuals with vascular disease treated with simvastatin for a mean of 3.4 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of myopathy. The rate of myopathy was low: 9 per 10 000 person-years of simvastatin therapy. Independent risk factors for myopathy included: simvastatin dose, ethnicity, sex, age, body mass index, medically treated diabetes, concomitant use of niacin-laropiprant, verapamil, beta-blockers, diltiazem and diuretics. In combination, these risk factors predicted more than a 30-fold risk difference between the top and bottom thirds of a myopathy risk score (hazard ratio: 34.35, 95% CI: 12.73–92.69, P across thirds = 9.1 × 10 −48). However, despite the strong association with myopathy, this score was not associated with the other reported muscle symptoms (P across thirds = 0.93). Likewise, although SLCO1B1 genotype was associated with myopathy, it was not associated with other muscle symptoms.

Conclusions

The absolute risk of simvastatin-related myopathy is low, but individuals at higher risk can be identified to help guide patient management. The lack of association of the myopathy risk score with other muscle symptoms reinforces randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statins do not cause the vast majority of reported muscle symptoms.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to conduct a clinician-patient risk discussion before initiating statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, drug-drug interactions, and safety while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully.
as well as to promote shared decision-making taking into account patient preferences.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^84f60701]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: There are several barriers to clinical translation of this work. The first is the sheer scale of the problem, because of the number of people who are (and should be) prescribed statins. Second, we have not yet identified directly the conditions that precipitate overt myopathy, although our data provided a strong indication of what these factors may be. Third, there are currently no cost-effective alternative antilipidemic agents that match the efficacy of statins for those at high risk of myopathy. Statins confer additional therapeutic benefits independent of their ability to lower serum cholesterol (pleiotropic actions), which are not evident with other drugs. For example, the recently licensed PCSK9 inhibitors cost 50 to 100 times more than generic statins and lack the pleiotropic actions effects of statins.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^eea58b14]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy — muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range — typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Nonstatin therapies in patients with muscle-related statin intolerance… [^14478d9d]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was −37. 8%; absolute difference, −75. 8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was −36. 1%; absolute difference, –71. 7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28. 8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and
20. 7% of evolocumab-treated patients. Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.

gov Identifier: NCT01984424 Quiz Ref IDAdministration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol represents an essential component of contemporary strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic vascular disease. 1 However, a significant proportion of patients with clinical indications for statin treatment report inability to tolerate evidence-based doses, most commonly because of muscle-related adverse effects. 2 These patients typically report muscle pain or weakness when treatment is initiated or dosage increased and relief when the drug is discontinued or the dosage reduced.

In the current trial, we sought to address several of these concerns, first by determining the incidence of statin intolerance due to muscle-related adverse effects with a blinded atorvastatin rechallenge and subsequently by evaluating the tolerability and relative efficacy of 2 potentially useful therapies in these patients — ezetimibe and a recently approved PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab. To identify the presence of statin intolerance, the trial design used a 2-stage approach previously tested in a smaller study.
13. During the second phase of the study, patients with reproducible statin-induced muscle symptoms during rechallenge were randomized to 2 nonstatin LDL-C–lowering therapies to assess both efficacy and tolerability. The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab produced significantly larger reductions in levels of LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and myopathy criteria — The most common symptoms that result in statin intolerance or statin discontinuation are muscle-related; SAMS refers to all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, while pharmacologic SAMS refers specifically to muscle symptoms that are caused by the statin. In statin clinical trials, an alternative myopathy definition requires adverse muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevations ≥ 10× upper limit of normal (ULN), under which statin-induced myopathy occurs with a frequency of 1/1000 in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^e6f1898a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Statin myopathy: an update [^0fe32978]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction. Associated with statin popularity are misconceptions and fears of untoward side effects on muscle. This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease; explores potential pathogenic mechanisms; reviews current estimates of statin myopathy prevalence; and examines diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Summary

As a class, statins appear to be usually safe, well tolerated agents with an excellent risk: benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood owing to the relative rarity of its existence.

Exercise

It is commonly believed that vigorous exercise increases the risk of statin-induced myopathy. Indeed, it is thought that myopathic symptoms may occur in 25% of statin users who exercise, as compared with a population incidence estimated at 1–5% for those who exercise but do not take statins. In professional athletes, it is estimated that as many as 75% of those taking statins may develop muscular symptoms; however, this may be overestimated.

The combined myopathy risk score had a median of 7.2 (IQR 6.1–8.0) in myopathy cases and 4.2 (IQR 3.1–5.6) in other participants. It was a very strong predictor of myopathy, with a 34-fold difference in myopathy risk between the top and bottom thirds (HR, 34.35; 95% CI: 12.73–92.69; P for trend across thirds = 9.1 × 10 −48; Figure 2). Patients with muscle symptoms and less extreme CK elevations (CK > 5 ≤ 10× ULN; n = 62) than required for the definition of myopathy had only a 3.5-fold difference in risk between top and bottom thirds of the myopathy risk score (HR, 3.51; 95% CI: 1.74–7.09; P for trend across thirds = 6.1 × 10⁻⁵).

### Statin associated muscle symptoms: an update and review [^3043eac4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy has been shown to have a significant effect on lowering of low-density lipoprotien cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This subsequently results in cardiovascular (CV) benefit through reduction in major adverse CV disease (CVD) events and overall mortality. Although there is well proven clinical benefit, statin therapy may be discontinued in some patients, and the most common cause for discontinuation is concern for statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the data on the true prevalence of these symptoms is mixed and continued studies are showing that the symptoms may be less prevalent than previously believed. With statin-associated muscle symptoms being the most common reason for a patient to not be on statin therapy, it is important for physicians to understand how to evaluate for and manage these symptoms. This manuscript provides an overview of statin associated muscle symptoms so that physicians may be able to better manage patients on statin therapy and continue to use these medications when indicated to best reduce future risk of CVD for patients.

Introduction

Statin therapy is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is generally safe and well tolerated. In randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), adverse event rates (including complaints of muscle pain) are similar in statin and placebo groups, – and compare favourably with event rates for other agents commonly used in CVD prevention, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsand beta-blockers. However, statins do cause a rare side-effect known as myositis, defined as muscle symptoms in association with a substantially elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. Creatine kinase is the enzyme released from damaged muscle cells, and CK elevations > 10× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people per year, depending on the statin, its dose, and the presence of other risk factors. Over the last decade, a series of observational studies have attributed a number of other adverse effects to statins, including musculoskeletal complaints, gastro-intestinal discomfort, fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. In addition, randomized trials have shown a small increase in the risk of incident diabetes. – Muscle symptoms, the most prevalent of these effects, are the focus of this review.

In contrast to RCTs, patient registries, together with clinical experience, indicate that 7–29% of patients complain of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). – These are usually associated with normal or slightly elevated CK concentrations. Statin-associated muscle symptoms likely contribute significantly to the very high discontinuation rates of statin therapy (up to 75%) within 2 years of initiation. Indeed, in 65% of former statin users, the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation was the onset of side effects, predominantly muscle-related effects. Such non-adherence/discontinuation from treatment may have a marked impact on CVD benefit, as suggested by the higher mortality in elderly secondary prevention patients with low vs. high adherence to statin therapy (24% vs. 16%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; P = 0.001). Similarly, a meta-analysis showed a 15% lower CVD risk in patients who were adherent to statins compared with those with low adherence.

Current therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms

Statin-based therapies

If symptoms/CK abnormalities resolve after discontinuation of statin, either treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve LDL-C goal, or as much LDL-C reduction that can be achieved with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations (small size, retrospective, open label, or non-randomized design), studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38%, and, importantly, are tolerated by ∼70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high intensity statin with a long half-life (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) are more appropriate.

Statin intolerance — definitions from select organizations describe criteria for inability to tolerate statins and assessment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. NLA Expert Panel on Statin Intolerance 2014 defines "the inability to tolerate at least two statins: one statin at the lowest starting daily dose and another statin at any daily dose", with adverse findings that are "temporally related to statin treatment and reversible upon statin discontinuation, but reproducible by rechallenge" after excluding other determinants; it specifies lowest starting doses as "rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 2 mg". A Unified Definition from an International Lipid Expert Panel requires "The inability to tolerate at least two different statins - one statin at the lowest starting average daily dose and the other statin at any dose" with confirmed adverse effects or biomarker abnormalities, improvement "upon dose decrease or discontinuation", and that changes are "not attributable to established predispositions such as drug-drug interactions and recognized conditions". The European Atherosclerosis Society statement notes assessment should "take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge".

### Association of statin exposure with histologically confirmed idiopathic inflammatory myositis… [^50a997c4]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statin medications are widely prescribed for cardiovascular risk reduction. Myalgia and rhabdomyolysis are well-recognized adverse effects of statins, and they resolve with the cessation of statin therapy. Idiopathic inflammatory myositis is a heterogeneous group of autoimmune myopathies that may also be associated with statin use. Objective To examine the association between histologically confirmed IIM and current exposure to statin medications. Design, Setting, and Participants. patients. 2 There are potential harms associated with statins, including well-known musculoskeletal adverse effects that include myalgia and the rare, yet severe condition of rhabdomyolysis. 2–4 In most instances these adverse effects resolve when statin treatment is discontinued.

small case-control study from France7 of 37 patients that reported a significant association between statin exposure and chronic muscle disease, including inflammatory myositis, by comparison with population-based matched controls.
7. Idiopathic inflammatory myositis commonly appears as painless, proximal limb girdle weakness with multisystem involvement. 5 Creatinine kinase levels are commonly elevated, and treatment includes high-dose corticosteroids and other forms of immunosuppressive therapies. 5, 9 There are a number of distinct subsets of IIM that are distinguished by clinical features, characteristic histopathologic features, and the presence of myositis-specific autoantibodies. Necrotizing myopathy is characterized by muscle fiber necrosis with minimal inflammation; a proportion of these cases have been shown to be due to an autoimmune cause and are associated with statin treatment.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^f11b5bc9]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

In these trials, statin therapy caused approximately 11 additional reports of any muscle pain or weakness per 1000 patients during the first year, but little excess thereafter (although there was some evidence that a risk persisted beyond the first year for more intensive regimens). This finding is in contrast with the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy, which are observed in year 1, but which are then twice as high during each subsequent year that treatment continues as previously reported (9% [99% CI 3–15%] in year 1 vs 24% [95% CI 21–26%] in years 1 to ≥ 5). Consequently, provided that statin therapy is taken for some years, the absolute reductions in major vascular events will greatly exceed any small excess of muscle symptoms that occurs soon after treatment initiation. For example, for every 1000 people in whom LDL cholesterol is lowered by approximately 1 mmol/L for 5 years (ie, an effect easily achievable in almost all patients with a moderate-intensity statin), statins might cause 11 (generally mild) episodes of muscle pain or weakness, but prevent 50 major vascular events in those with pre-existing vascular disease (secondary prevention), and 25 major vascular events in those without pre-existing vascular disease (primary prevention). Moreover, a high intensity regimen that can reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% would on average produce at least a 2 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in people with an LDL cholesterol of 4 mmol/L or more (eg, which was the measured concentration in approximately a third of people not taking a statin in UK Biobank), and would be expected to prevent twice as many major vascular events in each setting, but without any material increase in the excess rate of muscle pain or weakness as compared with a regimen reducing LDL cholesterol by 1 mmol/L. Moreover, treatment for longer than 5 years will yield even higher cardiovascular benefits.

### Narrative review: statin-related myopathy [^8d7750b8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Statin-related myopathy is a clinically important cause of statin intolerance and discontinuation. The spectrum of statin-related myopathy ranges from common but clinically benign myalgia to rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Observational studies suggest that myalgia can occur in up to 10% of persons prescribed statins, whereas rhabdomyolysis continues to be rare. The mechanisms of statin-related myopathy are unclear. Options for managing statin myopathy include statin switching, particularly to fluvastatin or low-dose rosuvastatin; nondaily dosing regimens; nonstatin alternatives, such as ezetimibe and bile acid-binding resins; and coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Few of these strategies have high-quality evidence supporting them. Because statin-related myopathy will probably become more common with greater numbers of persons starting high-dose statin therapy and the increasing stringency of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level targets, research to better identify patients at risk for statin myopathy and to evaluate management strategies for statin-related myopathy is warranted.

### The risk of muscular events among new users of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins: an observational cohort study [^854be904]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Statins are effective lipid-lowering drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of ischemic cardiovascular events. Although generally well tolerated, statins may cause myalgia, and less frequently myositis or rhabdomyolysis. According to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1.5–5.0% of patients experience adverse muscular symptoms during statin treatment. However, observational studies suggested that in routine care up to 10–15% of statin users experience such adverse events.

The myotoxicity of statins appears to be dose-dependent and may differ across individual statins, as suggested by the market withdrawal of cerivastatin due to its pronounced risk of rhabdomyolysis. It has been hypothesized that hydrophilic/water-soluble statins (i.e. rosuvastatin and pravastatin) are less likely to cause muscular side effects than lipophilic/fat-soluble statins (e.g. simvastatin or atorvastatin) due to lower passive diffusion into muscle cells. This hypothesis is supported by in vitro data showing a higher cytotoxicity on C2C12 myotubes for lipophilic statins than hydrophilic statins.

Results from RCTs, however, suggest a similar muscular risk for hydrophilic and lipophilic statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses, but the absolute numbers of events in these trials were low. More comprehensive and robust data on the comparative muscular risks of statins at equivalent doses are needed to improve our understanding of the role of statin choice for the risk of such adverse events.

We aimed to compare the risk of muscular events between statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses, and to evaluate if hydrophilic statins are associated with a systematically lower risk of muscular events than lipophilic statins.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^78c0f17c]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Reports of muscle pain or weakness with statin therapy are very common (a quarter of the participants in the present study reported them on at least one occasion) and are often cited as a reason for discontinuing treatment. Patients' perceptions of the possibility of muscle-related problems with statins may influence their likelihood of reporting them (i.e. the 'nocebo' effect). For example, in ASCOT-LLA, the rates of reported muscle symptoms did not differ between participants on atorvastatin 10 mg daily or on matching placebo while blinded to their randomized assignment, whereas during the subsequent 'open-label' phase, those who were receiving much the same statin therapy were 40% more likely to report such symptoms than those who did not. The lack of association in the present study of muscle pain or weakness in the absence of marked CK elevations with a risk score associated with more than 30-fold differences in the relative risk of myopathy is consistent with the lack of an excess of such symptoms with statin therapy in the randomized blinded comparisons. This finding supports the conclusion that these commonly reported muscle symptoms are not part of a continuum with simvastatin-related myopathy, but instead represent a nocebo effect.

The results of this study are relevant to the treatment of millions of patients worldwide. Simvastatin continues to be widely used: for example, it is the second most widely prescribed statin in the US with over 56 million prescriptions in 2017; and, in the UK, nearly 22 million simvastatin prescriptions were dispensed in 2019. The absolute risk of statin-related myopathy on standard statin regimens is typically low; 2 per 10 000 patients per annum with simvastatin 40 mg daily in the present study. However, the absolute risk is influenced considerably by patient characteristics and by concomitant treatment with certain commonly used medications. For example, in this study population, certain risk factor combinations confer differences in risk comparable to doubling simvastatin dose from 40 to 80 mg daily (i.e. ~20-fold higher than average). It should be noted, however, that the benefits of statin treatment typically far outweigh any statin-related myopathy risks even in people who are at the highest risk of myopathy.

Table 1
Definitions of statin-associated muscle symptoms proposed by the EAS Consensus Panel

In the vast majority of cases, SAMS are not accompanied by marked CK elevation. For SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN, usually referred to as myopathy, the incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 per year with a standard statin dose (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg daily). The risk varies, however, among different statins, and increases not only with the dose of statin, but also with factors associated with increased statin blood concentrations (e.g. genetic factors, ethnicity, interacting drugs, and patient characteristics) (see Box 1). Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of muscle damage associated with very high CK levels with myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria with a concomitantly increased risk of renal failure. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in association with statin therapy is ∼1 in 100 000 per year. In view of the rarity of CK elevations during statin therapy, it is not recommended to routinely monitor CK. Even if an asymptomatic elevation of CK is detected, the clinical significance is unclear.

Box 1
Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms. Adapted from Mancini et al.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are more likely to be caused by statins when elevated CK levels decrease after cessation of either the statin or the interacting drug, or when symptoms regress markedly within a few weeks of cessation of the statin and/or reappear within a month of drug re-challenge. Time to reappearance of symptoms is also influenced by the dose of statin and the duration of the re-challenge. Individual patient drug–placebo clinical trials have been suggested as an approach to confirming diagnosis of SAMS, but are not feasible in the routine outpatient setting.

Muscle disorders resulting from statin therapy, the most common manifestation of statin intolerance, are vexing to both patients and physicians. Statin-associated myopathy may appear as a spectrum of manifestations that include myalgias, myopathy, myositis, myonecrosis, and rhabdomyolysis.

1. Myonecrosis and rhabdomyolysis are uncommon, occurring in fewer than 1% of statin-treated patients, but myalgias and myopathy without creatine kinase elevation are reported in up to 5% of patients in clinical trials and in 25% or more in observational studies and clinical experience.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^f07059c7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — prevalence and management overview — are described as the most common form of statin intolerance and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events that manifest from statin underutilization and discontinuation; the prevalence of SAMS is estimated to be about 10% (range 5% to 25%) and the prevalence of pharmacological SAMS to be about 1–2% (range 0.5% to 4%). In clinical practice, SAMS are likely to result from a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological effects, and treatment strategies include optimizing lifestyle interventions, modulating risk factors that may contribute to muscle symptoms, optimizing statin tolerability by dose reduction, decreased dosing frequency, or use of an alternate statin with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and use of non-statins emphasizing those with evidence for atherosclerotic risk.

### Statin toxicity [^3932ef44]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, in spite of their wide-spread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remains a major gap in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The major reason for statin discontinuation is because of the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects as well as provide alternative treatment strategies. In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity and focus on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### The risk of muscular events among new users of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins: an observational cohort study [^4445c55b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are effective lipid-lowering drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, but muscular adverse events can limit their use. Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin, rosuvastatin) may cause less muscular events than lipophilic statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin) due to lower passive diffusion into muscle cells.

Objective

To compare the risk of muscular events between statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses and to evaluate if hydrophilic statins are associated with a lower muscular risk than lipophilic statins.

Design/Setting

Propensity score-matched cohort study using data from the United Kingdom-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD.

Patients

New statin users. Cohort 1: pravastatin 20–40 mg (hydrophilic) vs simvastatin 10–20 mg (lipophilic), cohort 2: rosuvastatin 5–40 mg (hydrophilic) vs atorvastatin 10–80 mg (lipophilic), and cohort 3: simvastatin 40–80 mg vs atorvastatin 10–20 mg.

Main Measures

The outcome was a first record of a muscular event (myopathy, myalgia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis) during a maximum follow-up of 1 year.

Key Results

The propensity score-matched cohorts consisted of 1) 9,703, 2) 7,032, and 3) 37,743 pairs of statin users. Comparing the risk of muscular events between low-intensity pravastatin vs low-intensity simvastatin yielded a HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.64–1.16). In the comparison of moderate- to high-intensity rosuvastatin vs equivalent doses of atorvastatin, we observed a HR of 1.17 (95% CI 0.88–1.56). Moderate- to high-intensity simvastatin was associated with a HR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.16–1.53), when compared with atorvastatin at equivalent doses.

Limitations

We could not conduct other pairwise comparisons of statins due to small sample size. In the absence of a uniform definition on the comparability of statin doses, the applied dose ratios may not fully match with all literature sources.

Conclusions

Our results do not suggest a systematically lower risk of muscular events for hydrophilic statins when compared to lipophilic statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^1ccf82cb]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

To provide more reliable information about the size, severity, and timing of any adverse effects caused by various statin regimens, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration sought new individual participant data on all recorded adverse events, together with supporting information about the methods used to record and classify such events in each trial. The current analyses were restricted to trials in which the treatment was double blinded (to minimise reporting biases). We selected such trials to avoid the limitations of observational studies, notably their susceptibility to biases and confounding. We also aimed to minimise other methodological limitations (eg, the selective reporting of adverse events) that might have biased previous meta-analyses of randomised trials using only published data. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of statin therapy on muscle effects of differing severity and to explore how any excess risks varied over time, in different types of individual, and for different statin regimens.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — statin tolerability can be further optimized through dose reductions, changing to a different statin, or intermittent dosing, with evidence suggesting approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen; when statin monotherapy is insufficient to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals, non-statin therapies need to be used prioritizing therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit, and treatment is incomplete until LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals have been achieved.

### Myopathy with statin-fibrate combination therapy: clinical considerations [^21f31f6c]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Many patients who receive statin therapy for hyperlipidemia-such as patients with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome — have residual cardiovascular risk. These patients often have dyslipidemia, including low levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides and small, dense LDL. For such patients, combination treatment with statins and fibrates is a potentially useful strategy to improve lipid and lipoprotein profiles and reduce cardiovascular risk. However, statin-fibrate combination regimens have potential adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myopathy. To date, no large-scale, prospective, randomized, controlled trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of statin-fibrate combination therapy; one such trial is underway but will not report data until 2010. Until then, clinicians need to consider pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, metabolic, pathophysiologic and other factors that can increase the systemic exposure of statins and/or fibrates and hence heighten the risk of toxic effects on muscles, as well as data from clinical trials and recommendations of consensus panels to optimize the safety of such combination regimens. On the basis of currently available data, fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is the fibrate of choice when used in combination with a statin because each is, in theory, associated with a lower risk of myopathy than gemfibrozil.

Figure 1
Effect on muscle adverse events in trials of any statin regimen versus placebo (A) and more versus less intensive statin regimens (B)

Bold data are the totals or subtotals. O–E = observed minus expected. Var = variance.

Statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness during the first year (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04–1.10), but no significant increase thereafter (0.99; 0.96–1.02; p value for heterogeneity for year 1 vs all subsequent years was 0.0005; figure 2). An increased risk was already present within the first 3 months after random assignment to treatment (1.08, 99% CI 1.02–1.15; figure 2). The aggregate rate of reporting of any muscle pain or weakness (ie, for statin and placebo groups combined) during the first year of treatment varied substantially by trial (appendix p 10), from 1.0% to 60.5%, reflecting heterogeneity in how actively information was sought. Despite this, there was no evidence that the RR for the comparison of statin versus placebo depended on the absolute reporting rate. By applying the RRs in the first and subsequent years to the average rates over these periods among patients allocated to the placebo group, allocation to a statin regimen resulted in an absolute excess rate of muscle pain or weakness of 11 (95% CI 6 to 16) per 1000 person-years in the first year and 0 per 1000 person-years (–2 to 1) in subsequent years (figure 3). Approximately 1 in 15 (calculated as [1.07–1.00]/1.07) reports of muscle symptoms (< 10% of reports) during the first year were attributable to statin therapy.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^84ad6f7f]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy

Of the independent risk factors identified for myopathy (Figure 1), simvastatin dose (with doses other than 40 mg daily only used by European individuals, and 20 and 80 mg doses only used in the SEARCH trial) was the strongest predictor, with > 20-fold higher risk among those receiving simvastatin 80 mg vs. 20 mg daily after allowance for other risk factors. In contrast, there was no significant difference in risk between patients who received 40 or 20 mg doses [hazard ratio (HR): 1.36, 95% CI: 0.31–6.05, P = 0.68). Chinese participants (who all received 40 mg simvastatin daily) had a ∼10-fold risk of myopathy compared to European participants, and older age, lower body mass index, and being female were each independently associated with higher risks. In addition, independent of the other risk factors identified, diabetic individuals receiving hypoglycaemic medication were at over twice the risk of myopathy compared with non-diabetic individuals (HR, 2.43; 95% CI: 1.73–3.41), whereas diabetic individuals not receiving any such medication were at comparable risk to those without diabetes (HR, 1.13; 95% CI: 0.62–2.06). Concomitant use of certain other medications also independently influenced myopathy risk: verapamil was associated with an eight-fold higher risk; niacin-laropiprant (mostly driven by events in Chinese individuals) and diltiazem with more than three-fold higher risks; and beta-blockers and diuretics with about 65–75% higher risks.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^2b7b872f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) evaluation — baseline creatine kinase (CK) can be helpful and pretreatment CK may be considered in higher-risk patients, including those with significant drug-drug interactions, certain chronic diseases, or prior severe statin myopathy (i.e., rhabdomyolysis, CK > 5x ULN). Prior NLA guidance suggests withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 3 times ULN, and ACC/AHA guidelines recommends withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 5× ULN; post-treatment CK is particularly important when evaluating suspected myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Measurement of anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies, electromyography, muscle strength testing, and muscle biopsy are described as neither pragmatic for clinical practice nor routinely recommended, while hypothyroidism should be ruled out and vitamin D levels measured and supplemented if deficient.

The RR in year 1 did not appear to differ according to whether there was an active or placebo pre-randomisation run-in period or no run-in, nor did it differ between whether the statin was hydrophilic or lipophilic (appendix p 13). The RR for muscle pain or weakness was greater in women for less intensive and moderate-intensity statin regimens, both during the whole follow-up period (RRs 1.09, 99% CI 1.03–1.16 in women vs 1.00, 0.97–1.04 in men; heterogeneity p = 0.0019; figure 4) and during the first year alone when most of the excess risk was observed (so subgroup analysis should be most sensitive to variation in risk; heterogeneity p = 0.012; appendix p 14). RRs did not differ significantly by other patient characteristics (figure 4; appendix p 14), or within groups of trials that exclusively recruited patients with major underlying health conditions (data not shown).

### Statin myopathy: a review of recent progress [^4d70373c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statins are commonly prescribed lipid-lowering medications that significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, they can have myotoxic effects ranging in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis. This review focuses on recent progress in defining the clinical features and mechanism(s) of statin-induced myopathy.

Recent Findings

Although severe myotoxicity is a very rare event, most recent studies suggest that myalgias and relatively low-level muscle damage may occur in a substantial number of patients treated with statins. Those taking medications that increase serum statin concentrations are at greater risk for severe muscle side-effects, as are those with a polymorphism in the gene encoding a hepatic statin transporter. Although the mechanism of muscle damage remains to be fully elucidated, a number of in-vitro studies suggest that inhibition of protein prenylation may underlie the myotoxic effects of statins, possibly through the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. In addition, recent reports have indicated that statins may trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with many features of polymyositis.

Summary

Severe myopathy is a rare and generally self-limited side-effect of statin medications. However, myalgias are much more common and limit their use in many patients. Recent evidence also suggests that statins are associated with the development of a unique form of immune-mediated myopathy. Awareness of this newly described entity is important, as these patients may require immunosuppressive therapy.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^a48fc4ed]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Take home figure
Risk of simvastatin-related myopathy does not predict risk of other muscle symptoms.

A number of hypotheses have been proposed as to why statins cause myopathy (including changes in mitochondrial function, energy production, and muscle protein degradation), but the mechanisms remain unclear. The risk of myopathy appears to depend on the levels of a statin in the circulation, as indicated by its association with genetic variation in SLCO1B1, which encodes OATP1B1 and can reduce the transport of statins from the circulation into the liver, leading to decreased statin clearance and higher blood levels. In addition to the dose of different statins, Chinese ethnicity, niacin, and verapamil are all recognized to increase blood statin levels. The higher risk of myopathy associated with lower body mass index (highly correlated with lower body surface area) in the present study may reflect the impact of lower blood volume or slower drug clearance in those with smaller body size, leading to higher blood levels. Poor renal function increases blood statin levels, but there was no independent effect of eGFR on myopathy risk in our analyses; this may reflect the limited range of eGFR represented in the present study (an average of about 90 mL/min/1.73 m² and with fewer than 3% of participants having eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²). It is unclear whether diabetes itself (with the lack of an association when hypoglycaemic drugs were not being used reflecting less severe diabetes) or particular hypoglycaemic medications (e.g. some may affect OATP transportation, in which case the association reflects a drug-interaction) affect risk of myopathy. Furthermore, additional risk factors not measured in this study may also affect blood statin levels and be relevant to myopathy risk (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors, thyroid disease, grapefruit juice).

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^64668669]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Statin therapy is effective for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is widely prescribed, but there are persisting concerns that statin therapy might frequently cause muscle pain or weakness. We aimed to address these through an individual participant data meta-analysis of all recorded adverse muscle events in large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

Randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years, and involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen. We analysed individual participant data from 19 double-blind trials of statin versus placebo (n = 123 940) and four double-blind trials of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen (n = 30 724). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on muscle outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Among 19 placebo-controlled trials (mean age 63 years [SD 8], with 34 533 [27.9%] women, 59 610 [48.1%] participants with previous vascular disease, and 22 925 [18.5%] participants with diabetes), during a weighted average median follow-up of 4.3 years, 16 835 (27.1%) allocated statin versus 16 446 (26.6%) allocated placebo reported muscle pain or weakness (rate ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06). During year 1, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness (1.07; 1.04–1.10), corresponding to an absolute excess rate of 11 (6–16) events per 1000 person-years, which indicates that only one in 15 ([1.07–1.00]/1.07) of these muscle-related reports by participants allocated to statin therapy were actually due to the statin. After year 1, there was no significant excess in first reports of muscle pain or weakness (0.99; 0.96–1.02). For all years combined, more intensive statin regimens (ie, 40–80 mg atorvastatin or 20–40 mg rosuvastatin once per day) yielded a higher RR than less intensive or moderate-intensity regimens (1.08 [1.04–1.13] vs 1.03 [1.00–1.05]) compared with placebo, and a small excess was present (1.05 [0.99–1.12]) for more intensive regimens after year 1. There was no clear evidence that the RR differed for different statins, or in different clinical circumstances. Statin therapy yielded a small, clinically insignificant increase in median creatine kinase values of approximately 0.02 times the upper limit of normal.

Interpretation

Statin therapy caused a small excess of mostly mild muscle pain. Most (> 90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms by participants allocated statin therapy were not due to the statin. The small risks of muscle symptoms are much lower than the known cardiovascular benefits. There is a need to review the clinical management of muscle symptoms in patients taking a statin.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^29ea1731]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are the most common form of statin intolerance and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events that manifest from statin underutilization and discontinuation. The reported frequencies of SAMS are divergent in the literature. The writing group estimates the prevalence of SAMS, namely all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, to be about 10% (range 5% to 25%), and the prevalence of pharmacological SAMS, specifically muscle symptoms resulting from pharmacological properties of the statin, to be about 1–2% (range 0.5% to 4%). In clinical practice, SAMS are likely to result from a combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological effects, however this does not make the symptoms any less clinically relevant. Regardless of the etiology, SAMS need to be addressed in accordance with patients' preferences and experiences. This clinical perspective reviews the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology of SAMS, and the cardiovascular consequences resulting from statin discontinuation. We present patient-centered clinical and communication strategies to mitigate SAMS and improve medication adherence and outcomes among statin users. Treatment strategies include 1) optimizing lifestyle interventions, 2) modulating risk factors that may contribute to muscle symptoms, 3) optimizing statin tolerability by dose reduction, decreased dosing frequency, or use of an alternate statin with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and 4) use of non-statins, emphasizing those with evidence for atherosclerotic risk reduction, either in combination with or in place of statin therapy depending on the patient's circumstances. The focus of this clinical perspective is sustainable lipoprotein goal achievement, which is important for cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Statin therapy as primary prevention in exercising adults: best evidence for avoiding myalgia [^07598f62]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

This review aims to determine whether active adults who begin statins and develop myalgia reduce or stop activity to become less symptomatic. If this occurs, strategies to mitigate symptoms are explored. Should these strategies fail, the question of whether exercise is an adequate alternative to statin therapy is addressed.

Methods

PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database were searched with keywords designed to retrieve information on statin myopathy in exercising adults.

Results

Statins are well tolerated by most people who exercise; however, caution is warranted in those who exercise at high levels, in the elderly, and in those receiving high-dose therapy. Several strategies improve statin tolerance while maintaining exercise levels, based on low-quality evidence. If statins are not tolerated, a continuing physical activity program can provide equivalent or superior cardiometabolic protection.

Conclusions

Statins may occasionally present a barrier to physical activity. A number of strategies exist that can reduce the risk of myopathy. If a choice between exercise and statins becomes necessary, exercise provides equal benefit in terms of cardiovascular protection and superior mortality reduction, with improved quality of life.

Statin therapy evidence notes and FDA caution — dose considerations for atorvastatin and simvastatin: All of these randomized controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events, and individual responses to statin therapy varied in RCTs and should be expected to vary in clinical practice. Evidence from 1 RCT only supports down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL study. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^5f8bddfb]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors) — initiation, dosing, and safety in children and adolescents are summarized as follows: Statin therapy is recommended as the initial medication of choice for treating patients with sufficiently elevated LDL–C or non–HDL–C levels. Statin dose should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily, and if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, then the dose may be increased by one increment; pediatric trials of dose escalation reported no additional safety issues. Adverse effects from statins are rare at standard doses but include myopathy and hepatic enzyme elevation, and in the meta-analysis of statin use in children, evidence of hepatic enzyme elevation and muscle toxicity did not differ between statin and placebo groups. Myopathy — muscle pain and weakness with creatine kinase elevations more than 10 times the upper limits of normal range — typically occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 adult patients. Rhabdomyolysis, a very rare occurrence in adults on statin therapy reported at 3 per 100,000 person-years, did not occur in any of the pediatric trials.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^e732b601]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Myopathy has been reported with all statins and, as in the present analyses with simvastatin, the rate appears to be dose-dependent and related to statin blood levels. For example, in regulatory databases, higher doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are associated with higher rates of myopathy. Indeed, cerivastatin was withdrawn from use because the myopathy rate during post-marketing surveillance with approved doses was much higher (especially when combined with gemfibrozil) than with other statins. Shared mechanisms of statin uptake into the liver, metabolism, and pharmacology (e.g. with regards to hepatic processing and OATP transportation) suggest that, although different statins confer different absolute risks of myopathy, factors that increase the relative risk of myopathy would likely be shared. For example, variation in SLCO1B1 has been associated with varying degrees of higher statin blood levels in pharmacokinetic studies with different statins: 221% increase in simvastatin (40 mg) exposure, 144% in atorvastatin (20 mg) exposure, 117% in rosuvastatin (40 mg) exposure, and 70% in rosuvastatin (10 mg) exposure for CC vs. TT genotypes. Such studies also indicate that people of East Asian ancestry exhibit higher blood levels for rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin acid, suggesting a class effect. Owing to a lack of comparable data with similar large numbers of consistently defined cases of myopathy, the relevance of the independent risk factors assessed in the present study has not been evaluated for any other statin. However, it would seem plausible that risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy would increase the relative risk of myopathy with other statins in relation to their effect on statin blood levels.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^fc10538e]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statins are considered very effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. However, although adherence to statins improves morbidity and mortality, it remains suboptimal. One of the most important causes of nonadherence is the so-called statin intolerance, mainly because of muscle-related symptoms. These symptoms most often consist of myalgia unaccompanied by significant creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Less often, myositis (elevated CK > 10 times the upper limit of normal) or rhabdomyolysis (CK level > 10,000 IU/L or accompanied by significant elevation in creatinine level) develops.

In randomized controlled trials, the incidence of statin myopathy is ~1.5–5.0%. However, this low incidence may be misleading for several reasons. First, in most studies patients with a history of statin intolerance were excluded. Other studies had a single-blinded statin run-in phase, and patients experiencing muscle-related symptoms or CK elevations during this phase were excluded. Patients who tend to be at risk for developing muscle-related symptoms, such as women, elderly patients, and patients with significant comorbidity, who comprise a large proportion of statin-treated patients in real-life settings, are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials. Some studies have defined muscle-related effects by elevated CK levels only, disregarding myalgia. Last but not least, patients enrolled in studies might be motivated and so minimize reporting of mild myalgias, thus leading to underestimation of the magnitude of the problem.

### Breaking down statin myopathy: understanding the self-limited and autoimmune subtypes [^e6bc5a77]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used crucial drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although generally well tolerated, statin intolerance can unfortunately limit statin use, with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) being the most common side effect associated with its discontinuation. Statin intolerance is an inability to tolerate a dose of statin required to sufficiently reduce an individual's cardiovascular risk, limiting the effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statin myopathy is a broad entity encompassing self-limited/toxic and autoimmune aetiologies. As statins are a mainstay of therapy in those with or at risk for CVD and offer a mortality benefit, it is critical to determine whether one's symptoms are truly statin-associated before discontinuing the drug. This review article aims to provide an update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, evaluation and management of statin myopathy and to elucidate key differences between autoimmune and self-limited types.

### Frequency of myopathy in patients receiving lovastatin [^2bbf2346]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Lovastatin (Mevacor) 20 mg is being considered for nonprescription availability. Because the most severe untoward consequence of therapy with any statin is rhabdomyolysis, the clinical data for lovastatin pertaining to this adverse event were reviewed. Evidence to date, based on almost 2 decades of experience, points to an extremely low risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis associated with lovastatin.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: an individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^c1f281e4]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Statin therapy is effective for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is widely prescribed, but there are persisting concerns that statin therapy might frequently cause muscle pain or weakness. We aimed to address these through an individual participant data meta-analysis of all recorded adverse muscle events in large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

Randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years, and involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen. We analysed individual participant data from 19 double-blind trials of statin versus placebo (n = 123940) and four double-blind trials of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen (n = 30724). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on muscle outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Among 19 placebo-controlled trials (mean age 63 years [SD 8], with 34533 [27.9%] women, 59610 [48.1%] participants with previous vascular disease, and 22925 [18.5%] participants with diabetes), during a weighted average median follow-up of 4.3 years, 16835 (27.1%) allocated statin versus 16446 (26.6%) allocated placebo reported muscle pain or weakness (rate ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.06). During year 1, statin therapy produced a 7% relative increase in muscle pain or weakness (1.07; 1.04–1.10), corresponding to an absolute excess rate of 11 (6–16) events per 1000 person-years, which indicates that only one in 15 ([1.07–1.00]/1.07) of these muscle-related reports by participants allocated to statin therapy were actually due to the statin. After year 1, there was no significant excess in first reports of muscle pain or weakness (0.99; 0.96–1.02). For all years combined, more intensive statin regimens (ie, 40–80 mg atorvastatin or 20–40 mg rosuvastatin once per day) yielded a higher RR than less intensive or moderate-intensity regimens (1.08 [1.04–1.13] vs 1.03 [1.00–1.05]) compared with placebo, and a small excess was present (1.05 [0.99–1.12]) for more intensive regimens after year 1. There was no clear evidence that the RR differed for different statins, or in different clinical circumstances. Statin therapy yielded a small, clinically insignificant increase in median creatine kinase values of approximately 0.02 times the upper limit of normal.

Interpretation

Statin therapy caused a small excess of mostly mild muscle pain. Most (> 90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms by participants allocated statin therapy were not due to the statin. The small risks of muscle symptoms are much lower than the known cardiovascular benefits. There is a need to review the clinical management of muscle symptoms in patients taking a statin.

### Statin-associated adverse effects beyond muscle and liver toxicity [^6e2b03bb]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are currently the most widely used drugs in many countries. The most important adverse effects are associated with muscle and liver toxicity. However, with increased use and dose of statins and their over-the-counter availability in some countries more cases of other rare side effects may be seen in clinical practice. In the present article we review the literature concerning the statin-related adverse effects other than muscle and liver injury and we provide insight into their clinical relevance and possible underlying mechanisms.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^8e671ed2]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this systematic review of randomised controlled trials, we examined the associations between statins and adverse events in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease. We found a slightly increased risk of self-reported muscle symptoms after treatment with statins but no increased risk of clinically confirmed muscle disorders. Statins were associated with liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and eye conditions, but were not associated with diabetes. The absolute increases in the risks of these adverse events were small, and not comparable (numerically or clinically) with the reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events achieved by treatment with statins.

Analyses by type of statin showed that atorvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin were associated with some adverse events, but few significant differences were seen between the statins. A possible modest dose-response relationship was identified for the effect of atorvastatin on liver dysfunction, but the pharmacological parameters were imprecise and the shape of the dose-response curve was unclear. The dose-response relationships for the other types of statins and adverse effects were inconclusive.

Comparison with other studies

Most previous systematic reviews of trials examining statins for primary prevention did not find an association between statins and myalgia, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis, based on small numbers of included studies and inconsistent definitions of outcomes. A previous review found no association between statins and myalgia or other mild muscle symptoms (eg, muscle weakness and stiffness) but excluded some landmark trials, owing to a constrained study population. In contrast, a recent review showed an association between statins and overall muscle problems, but the review included a wide range of conditions with varying severities and incidences. In our review, we searched for more comprehensive data from studies, including those previously omitted, and classified muscle problems as self-reported symptoms or clinically confirmed disorders, to resolve the inconsistency and variety of definitions of outcomes in trials. This approach allowed us to clarify that statins are associated with a small increased risk of muscle symptoms, but the evidence for muscle disorders in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease was insufficient.

Glossary — definitions relevant to statin intolerance and SAMS include: statin intolerance defined as one or more adverse effects associated with statin therapy that resolves or improves with dose reduction or discontinuation, classified as complete or partial intolerance, and to classify a patient as having statin intolerance, a minimum of two statins should have been attempted, including at least one at the lowest approved daily dosage; SAMS are muscle symptoms occurring during statin treatment without regard to causality and are stated as the most common cause of statin intolerance; pharmacological SAMS are SAMS occurring as a direct result of the pharmacological properties of the statin; and nocebo refers to adverse effects that result from expectation of harm rather than pharmacological causes.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^0a0f525c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — many patients ultimately tolerate statins, and strategies include lower-dose statin, different statin, supplementation, and/or non-statins with defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effects at specific doses and in combination therapy. The text states that approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen and lists management strategies consisting of 1) same statin but lower dose, 2) different statin, 3) supplementation, and/or 4) non-statins. LDL-C lowering with statins is greatest at the lowest daily dose, which may achieve 2/3 of maximum effect with an additional 5–6% reduction from baseline with each doubling of dose; starting with atorvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 5 mg offers a moderate intensity response that can result in a 33–45% reduction in LDL-C. Over 50% reduction in LDL-C can be achieved by adding ezetimibe or other non-statin pharmacotherapies to low to moderate-intensity statin treatment. In RACING, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with lower drug discontinuation (4.8% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and greater achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at years 1, 2, and 3 (73%, 75%, 72% vs 55%, 60%, 58%, all p < 0.0001). For persistent intolerance during low-dose therapy, intermittent (non-daily) dosing may be needed, and it is recommended to use statins with a longer half-life; there are accounts of 20–40% LDL-C lowering depending on dose and dosing interval.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^d3d3099c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statin-based approaches.

Since statins are the only agents with a robust body of evidence proving reduction in clinical end points, every effort should be made to keep high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen.

Switching statins may be efficacious. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who received another statin after an episode of statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without recurrent symptoms. Considering the results of the PRIMO study, the use of statins associated with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, may be considered, although these statins may not be potent enough if a large reduction of LDL cholesterol is needed to reach target values. In one study, 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily (as a slow-release preparation) was tolerated in 97% of patients with prior statin intolerance owing to muscle-related symptoms, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 32.8%.

Another approach evaluated in several studies involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, in low doses or at a reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For example, in a retrospective analysis of 51 patients with a statin, alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated in 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms-managing the highly intolerant [^e7710497]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with statin therapy. Yet, certain data indicate that these symptoms often present in populations with underlying musculoskeletal complaints and are not likely statin related. Switching statins or using lower doses resolves muscle complaints in most patients. However, there is a growing population of individuals who experience intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms with multiple statins, regardless of the individual agent or prescribed dose. Recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials enrolling highly intolerant subjects provide significant insight regarding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Notable findings include the inconsistency with reproducing muscle complaints, as approximately 40% of subjects report SAMS when taking a statin but not while receiving placebo, but a substantial cohort reports intolerable muscle symptoms with placebo but none when on a statin. These data validate SAMS for those likely experiencing true intolerance, but for others, suggest a psychosomatic component or misattribution of the source of pain and highlights the importance of differentiating from the musculoskeletal symptoms caused by concomitant factors. Managing the highly intolerant requires candid patient counseling, shared decision-making, eliminating contributing factors, careful clinical assessment and the use of a myalgia index score, and isolating potential muscle-related adverse events by gradually reintroducing drug therapy with the utilization of intermittent dosing of lipid-altering agents. We provide a review of recent data and therapeutic guidance involving a focused step-by-step approach for managing SAMS among the highly intolerant. Such strategies usually allow for clinically meaningful reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an overall lowering of cardiovascular risk.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^31f82df9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statin safety — myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are key considerations, with myopathy (incidence < 0.1%) defined as unexplained muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 10 times the upper limits of normal (ULN); when CK is above 10 000 IU/L or greater than 40 times ULN, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. Myopathy is rare, with incidence < 0.1% for most statins and 1% for simvastatin 80 mg, a dose no longer used, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is even lower at < 0.01%. In patients with myopathy, discontinuation of the statin usually results in resolution of muscle symptoms within days and CK returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks, and if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, intensive hydration is usually effective in preventing renal failure. Possible risk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes, Chinese ancestry, renal insufficiency, pre-existing muscle disease, hypothyroidism, and drug interactions; in a patient with unexplained muscle symptoms, CK levels will distinguish nonserious muscle symptoms from myopathy. About 10% to 20% of statin-treated subjects in clinical trials report muscle symptoms that are usually not accompanied by CK increases, yet statin-associated muscle symptoms are caused by the statin in < 1% of patients. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome studies in 97 000 subjects, myalgia or muscle ache occurred in 5162 (11.7%) on statins versus 5051 (11.4%) on placebo (P = 0.10), and in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials specifically querying muscle symptoms, none found a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo groups. Re-challenge data show 90% of statin-intolerant patients tolerated the same or a different statin, and in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) labeled statin intolerant, the vast majority could tolerate a statin under double-blind conditions.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^50413c14]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to measure CK levels in patients with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness.

Genotyping of patients with personal or family histories of muscle disease who develop SAMS has been suggested as a means of diagnosing underlying muscle disease. Candidates for genetic testing may also include patients with documented prolonged statin-associated muscle symptoms > 6 months post-therapy, and symptomatic patients with plasma CK > 4× ULN. Targeted next-generation sequencing of muscle disease genes in these high-risk individuals will certainly become more prominent in diagnosing individuals at risk. Identification of underlying genetic risk factors may contribute to improved therapeutic compliance through careful monitoring of conservative therapy. At present, however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend genetic testing as a part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with SAMS.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^c5e92fbd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment is paramount to control the disease's progression. While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring of serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is quick normalisation of these enzymes, signalling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function and treatment can last months to years.

### Phenotype standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [^d3953887]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Time to Onset

In the PRIMO (Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions) study, the median time to onset in the 832 of 7,924 patients who developed muscular symptoms was one month after statin initiation. A study of 45 patients reported a mean duration of statin therapy before myopathic symptoms of 6.3 months, with a maximum of 9.8 months.

A large study, using a case-crossover design to determine statin myotoxicity in two primary-care databases comprising 93,831 patients, suggested that most cases occur within the first 12 weeks of statin exposure. The authors recommended a 26-week cutoff to enable fewer misclassifications of exposed cases. A 26-week cutoff seems sensible for those patients who have been on a stable dose of statin monotherapy; however, this may need to be extended. It is important to note that some patients can develop statin myotoxicity either after a statin dose increase or after the concomitant administration of an interacting drug, which may occur anytime during the life cycle of statin use. Furthermore, autoimmune myopathy may take longer to develop, with a time to onset as long as 3 years.

### Protocol for analyses of adverse event data from randomized controlled trials of statin therapy [^c9cd4e65]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Analysis plan

The main objective is to assess the proportional and absolute effects of statin therapy on particular adverse events of interest, so that the balance of benefits and harms in specific types of individuals can be determined.

Outcomes to be assessed

Several types of outcome will be considered, based on current knowledge of the effects of statin therapy in the following hierarchical order:
(i) adverse events that are definitely or probably increased by statin therapy (ie, myopathy, diabetes, and hemorrhagic stroke): analyses of these events will examine the magnitude, timing, and duration of the excess risks both overall and in particular subgroups (eg, diabetes according to baseline HbA1c, hemorrhagic stroke with or without prior stroke) and will also explore how the magnitude of the risks varies according to how an adverse event is defined (eg, biochemical vs clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus);
(ii) muscle-related symptoms: analyses of these events will consider muscle pain (ie, myalgia) and weakness separately from myopathy (as defined above) and will explore whether statins increase reported rates of muscle pain of different levels of severity (including, for example, muscle symptoms given as a reason for stopping study treatment);
(iii) other possible effects of statin therapy: this will include adverse events which have been added to some statin drug labels, on the basis that there may be a class effect for such events (including cognitive impairment, depression, sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction, and interstitial lung disease), as well as adverse events for which it has been suggested there may be a reduction with statin therapy (eg, pancreatitis); and
(iv) all other adverse events recorded in these trials.

TOXIC MYOPATHY

The precise mechanisms underlying toxic statin myopathy are unknown, but several hypotheses have been suggested.

### Statin intolerance [^774732aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The term statin intolerance refers to an inability to use statins because of muscle symptoms or elevated creatine kinase, and the major diagnostic challenge is to unambiguously link these to statin use. Roughly 5% to 10% of statin users develop statin intolerance, and because statin use is expected to increase — especially after recent updated guidelines have expanded the statin benefit groups — adverse effects from statins will become a growing issue. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology — and even the terminology — of statin-related muscle injury lacks clarity. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, family history of myopathy and statin dose; many cases manifest only after patients are administered an interacting medication (e.g., azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and cyclosporine). The diagnosis of myopathy remains challenging, especially because some patients can have normal serum creatine kinase levels despite demonstrable weakness and muscle biopsy-proven statin-induced myopathy. A statin withdrawal and rechallenge helps patients distinguish whether their myalgia symptoms are because of statins, but, in at least 1 clinical trial, even 5% of placebo-treated patients developed myalgias during a controlled withdrawal and rechallenge. No consensus exists for management of patients with statin intolerance. Many patients can eventually tolerate a statin but often at suboptimal doses. A subset of patients do well with nondaily regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing. Some patients cannot tolerate statins at all, requiring nonstatin lipid-lowering medications — the benefit of which remains unclear with regard to preventing atherosclerotic events. Ultimately, statin intolerance undermines the drug adherence that is critical for achieving the benefits of lifelong lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, statin myopathy is a common challenge in lipid management, and further work is needed to establish a standard diagnostic criterion as well as treatment algorithms.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^aad359a3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis risk and nocebo considerations — clinical rhabdomyolysis can involve myoglobinuria and can cause acute renal injury and is estimated to occur in < 1/10,000 individuals treated with a statin over five years, with risk higher in patients with risk factors for SAMS. There is no biochemical test or clinical syndrome complex to determine whether muscle symptoms are directly attributable to statin use, and muscle symptoms ascribed to statins are at least 5-fold more frequent in observational studies than in RCTs; in contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is characterized by the expectation or anticipation of harm, with patients misattributing muscle discomfort to the statin instead of other etiologies such as increased body aches from physical activity.

### Clinical perspectives of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis [^ba1a7df0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Fear of muscle toxicity remains a major reason that patients with hyperlipidemia are undertreated. Recent evaluations of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis offer new insights on the clinical management of both muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is higher in practice than in controlled trials in which high-risk subjects are excluded. Accepted risks include age; renal, hepatic, and thyroid dysfunction; and hypertriglyceridemia. New findings suggest that exercise, Asian race, and perioperative status also may increase the risk of statin muscle toxicity. The proposed causes and the relationship of drug levels to statin rhabdomyolysis are briefly reviewed along with the problems with the pharmacokinetic theory. Data suggesting that patients with certain metabolic abnormalities are predisposed to statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. The evaluation and treatment of patients' muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. Patients whose symptoms are related to other disorders need to be identified. Lipid management of those whose symptoms are statin-related is reviewed including treatment suggestions.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^d0a0f07c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association — potential strategies for managing statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) outline a clinical algorithm beginning with risk assessment, where clinicians should address: "Estimate likelihood of pharmacological SAMS with clinical myalgia risk score", "Identify and modify risk factors (i.e. DDI, change in exercise, hypothyroidism, etc)", "Determine patient's level of discomfort", "Obtain thorough lipid-lowering drug history", and "Use communication strategies for shared decision-making (see box 1–3)". If "Impaired quality of life or functional status?" is "No", the pathway is to "Encourage continuation of treatment", "Reemphasize benefits of statin", and "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care". If "Yes", clinicians should "De-escalate or discontinue statin" and "Re-evaluate sx", then determine "Symptom improvement with statin de-escalation or discontinuation?"; if "No", "Encourage statin continuation (with current or different statin)", "Reemphasize benefits of statin", "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care", and "Evaluate other causes of muscle sx"; if "Yes", proceed to "Statin rechallenge (see table 10) – Lower dose – Different statin – Intermittent dosing", with "Optimize diet/lifestyle, supportive care", and "Reassess tolerability periodically". Supportive care is specified as "stretch, hydrate, sleep, consider washout / drug holiday".

### The risk of muscular events among new users of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins: an observational cohort study [^13f58fd4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study of UK-based primary health care data does not suggest a systematically reduced risk of muscular events for hydrophilic statins when compared with lipophilic statins at comparable lipid-lowering doses. Low-intensity statin therapy with hydrophilic pravastatin (vs lipophilic simvastatin) and moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy with lipophilic atorvastatin (vs hydrophilic rosuvastatin and lipophilic simvastatin) may be associated with a decreased muscular risk. However, further studies that will replicate our findings are warranted before implications for clinical practice are discussed.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^66740c45]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors) for children and adolescents — statin therapy is recommended as the initial medication of choice for treating patients with sufficiently elevated LDL–C or non–HDL–C levels. Statins should be started with the lowest available dose given once daily; if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, then the dose may be increased by one increment, and pediatric trials of dose escalation identified no additional safety issues. Adverse effects from statins are rare at standard doses but include myopathy and hepatic enzyme elevation; in a meta-analysis of statin use in children, evidence of hepatic enzyme elevation and of muscle toxicity did not differ between statin and placebo groups. In adults, myopathy with creatine kinase elevations more than 10 times the upper limits of normal range typically occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients, and rhabdomyolysis is very rare at 3 per 100,000 person-years; rhabdomyolysis did not occur in any of the pediatric trials.

### The risk of muscular events among new users of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins: an observational cohort study [^0e162989]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The former hypothesis of a systematically reduced muscular risk in association with hydrophilic statins was based on in vitro data demonstrating a lower cytotoxicity on C2C12 myotubes for hydrophilic statins than lipophilic statins, and in particular on the consideration that hydrophilic statins penetrate skeletal muscles less easily due to lower passive diffusion. However, the risk of muscular adverse events of statins may depend on different pharmacokinetic processes. For instance, statins are substrates of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transport proteins, which are involved in the hepatic and muscular uptake of statins. It has been discussed that different statins may bind to these transporters with different affinities, which could eventually lead to different intramuscular drug concentrations and thus to different risk profiles for muscular adverse events. In addition, genetic polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the OATP1B1 hepatic uptake transporter, has been linked to reduced transport activity and increased plasma statin levels. Levels of simvastatin were found to be particularly affected by the genetic polymorphism, which may explain the elevated muscular risk for simvastatin observed in the current study. Differences in the metabolism of statins, i.e. statins' potential for CYP3A4-mediated interactions, probably do not explain current findings given that the results from the sensitivity analysis restricted to patients without use of CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs were comparable to those from the primary analysis.

In this study, we observed an absolute risk of muscular events of 1.3% in all new statin users (1.9% when we included all recordings of statin intolerance). Other observational studies reported higher risks for patients in the routine care setting; the PRIMO study, a countrywide survey including 7,924 patients with hyperlipidemia and high-dosage statin therapy in France, reported an absolute risk of muscular events of 10.5%. A cohort study performed in 120 Swedish statin initiators and with a follow-up of 1 year reported an absolute risk of 14%. Differences in findings may be explained by the varying data sources and outcome definitions. We defined muscular events based on Read codes recorded in electronic primary care records, whereas the PRIMO study conducted standardized interviews, and the Swedish cohort study used patient questionnaires to specifically enquire about muscular symptoms. While the latter approaches may have overestimated the absolute risk of muscular adverse events, we likely underestimated the absolute risk of muscular events, as general practitioners may have modified statin treatment without specifically recording the presumptive adverse event. However, any such outcome misclassification was most likely non-differential and thus, if at all, biased HRs towards unity.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^8a05a176]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Conditions in which increased SR Ca²⁺ leak can be expected should be considered a risk factor when statins are prescribed. Identifying risk factors underlying statin-induced myopathy is important because recent modeling experiments have indicated that improving statin adherence by 50% (e.g. by preventing statin-induced myopathy) would prevent twice as many deaths as a 5% reduction in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Up to one-third of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms in observational studies. The incidence in randomized controlled trials is much less. In part, this difference may arise because those susceptible to myopathy or with indications of myopathy in the run-in phase are excluded from trials. However, the experience of muscle pain is subjective, and many patients are primed to expect this because of patient information leaflets and widespread reporting of side effects of statins in the press. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism of statin myopathy and factors that make users more susceptible to overt muscle pain and weakness (even potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis) are essential. In this study, we demonstrated leaky RyRs in skeletal muscle following statin treatment. Although this by itself did not cause overt myopathy, it did provide a strong indicator of the populations who are at real risk of myopathy — those whose lifestyle or genotype predispose them to SR Ca²⁺ leak. This includes patients who undertake regular high-intensity exercise or have mutations in the RyR1 associated with malignant hyperthermia. In these individuals, statins should be used cautiously with consideration of dose, alternative cholesterol-lowering strategies, and monitoring of serum creatine kinase levels. However, our data do support the view that moderate exercise should be actively encouraged in those who take statins. As well as the positive effects of exercise on cardiovascular health, this type of activity appears to limit potentially harmful effects of statins on skeletal muscle.

### The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy: 2014 update [^f7b0c3b3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Simvastatin is among the most commonly used prescription medications for cholesterol reduction. A single coding single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs4149056T > C, in SLCO1B1 increases systemic exposure to simvastatin and the risk of muscle toxicity. We summarize evidence from the literature supporting this association and provide therapeutic recommendations for simvastatin based on SLCO1B1 genotype. This article is an update to the 2012 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy.

### SLCO1B1*5 allele is associated with atorvastatin discontinuation and adverse muscle symptoms in the context of routine care [^7754f63a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the industrialized world. Statins decrease cardiovascular event rate in the context of both primary and secondary prevention. The combined 2018 American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce the atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk for adults recommend moderate to high intensity statin therapy for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with known cardiovascular disease, each 1 mmol/L reduction in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowers the annual incidence of major vascular events by 20%. Despite compelling data to support clinical efficacy, statins are still not optimally utilized. Reasons for this discrepancy include provider underprescribing and patient nonadherence.

In general, statins are considered safe and well tolerated. Although they can cause asymptomatic elevation in hepatic transaminases, statin‐induced liver injury is extremely rare. Conversely, muscle pain (myalgias) and muscle damage (myopathy) occur quite often in the context of statin therapy. Statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMSs) frequently lead to patient nonadherence or discontinuation. In observational studies, myalgias have been reported in as many as 10% of patients taking statins. Most of these cases do not have laboratory evidence of muscle damage. Myopathy occurs much less frequently, ranging from 1% to fewer than 0.1%, depending upon the degree to which creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated in the systemic circulation. Rhabdomyolysis, the most extreme example of this adverse drug reaction (with CK levels exceeding 50 times the upper limit of normal), is rare with an incidence of 1:1,000,000 on statin monotherapy.
