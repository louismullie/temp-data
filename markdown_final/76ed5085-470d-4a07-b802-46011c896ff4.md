## Question

What are testes should be done after needle stick injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tests should be done after a needlestick injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate first aid and exposure assessment. Then, I should verify baseline laboratory testing and source patient evaluation. Next, I will consider HIV post-exposure prophylaxis decision-making and follow-up testing. After that, I need to check hepatitis B post-exposure management and hepatitis C testing and follow-up. Finally, I will review documentation, counseling, and special circumstances that modify management, anchoring to USPHS and CDC guidance throughout [^111aL6dz] [^115wm9Yy].

> Let me first confirm immediate actions after the injury: wash the wound with soap and water, irrigate mucous membranes copiously if exposed, and do not apply bleach or harsh agents; I initially thought to use a disinfectant, but wait, that could damage tissue and is not recommended, so I should correct that and stick to soap and water or saline irrigation while initiating incident reporting and occupational health notification within 1–2 hours when possible [^1169JRuY] [^111PGcUm].

> I need to check the exposure risk factors that influence HIV transmission risk: depth of injury, visible blood on device, hollow-bore needle, direct venous or arterial placement, and high viral load in the source patient increase risk; the average HIV seroconversion risk after a percutaneous exposure is about 0.3% and about 0.09% for mucous membrane exposure, so I should stratify risk while remembering that even low-risk exposures warrant evaluation and follow-up [^111aL6dz] [^112TaFwf].

> Next, I should review baseline laboratory testing for the exposed healthcare worker: obtain HIV antigen/antibody combination assay, hepatitis B surface antigen with anti-HBc and anti-HBs to define immunity, hepatitis C antibody with reflex HCV RNA if positive, CBC, ALT, AST, and a pregnancy test when applicable; I should confirm that baseline testing excludes preexisting infection and establishes organ function before any prophylaxis, and I need to ensure results are documented promptly [^115wm9Yy] [^1139Kxed].

> Now, I will examine source patient testing, but wait, I should verify consent requirements first; testing the source for HIV, HBV, and HCV requires informed consent and confidentiality protections, and if the source is unknown or unavailable, management proceeds based on epidemiologic risk and local policy; I should double-check that source testing is coordinated through occupational health or infection control to maintain confidentiality [^115CRJAR].

> For HIV post-exposure prophylaxis, I should confirm the 72-hour window: initiate as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours, and do not delay beyond 72 hours; a three-drug regimen for 28 days is standard, with expert consultation for delayed presentations, unknown sources, pregnancy, or suspected resistance, and I should not wait for source resistance results before starting; I need to ensure the exposed person receives the first dose in hand and a plan for adherence support and toxicity monitoring [^115CRJAR] [^111aL6dz] [^113fbscM].

> I will now examine HIV follow-up testing: baseline at exposure, then at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months; hold on, I should verify the 4th-generation assay exception — if a 4th-generation Ag/Ab test is used reliably, follow-up can be shortened to baseline, 6 weeks, and 4 months, but I need to ensure the lab is confirmed to be using 4th-generation methodology before shortening; extended follow-up to 12 months is reserved for HCV co-infection from an HIV/HCV co-infected source, and I should document all results and symptoms during the window period [^115VXzgk] [^1169JRuY].

> For hepatitis B, let me think about immunity status first: if anti-HBs is 10 IU/L or higher, no further action is needed; if anti-HBs is negative or less than 10 IU/L, I should administer HBIG within 24 hours (up to 7 days for percutaneous exposure) and initiate or complete the hepatitis B vaccine series; I need to check that vaccination history is verified and that follow-up anti-HBs is obtained 1–2 months after series completion to confirm seroconversion [^117X2ZxS] [^113z11kQ].

> For hepatitis C, I should confirm there is no post-exposure prophylaxis; baseline HCV antibody with reflex RNA if positive is appropriate, then repeat HCV antibody and ALT at 4–6 months, and consider an HCV RNA at 4–6 weeks for earlier detection; if acute HCV is diagnosed, I need to ensure prompt linkage to care because early treatment during acute infection achieves high cure rates and prevents chronicity [^113z11kQ] [^111NW47T].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation and counseling: record the exposure details, risk assessment, source testing, baseline and follow-up labs, medications, and adherence plans; counsel on medication side effects, adherence, and symptom vigilance for acute retroviral syndrome, and advise abstaining from blood or tissue donation and practicing safe sex until HIV serostatus is definitively negative; I should double-check that the exposed person knows when and how to seek urgent care for symptoms or adverse effects [^1169JRuY] [^113fbscM].

> But wait, what if the exposure is from an unknown source, such as a needle in a sharps container; I should confirm that PEP decisions are individualized based on severity and epidemiologic likelihood, and that needles or sharps are not tested for HIV; expert consultation via PEPline is appropriate in complex or delayed cases, and I should not delay indicated PEP while awaiting consultation [^115CRJAR] [^115PaJMJ].

> I should also consider special populations and comorbidities: in pregnancy, do not delay PEP and use regimens with favorable safety profiles; in renal or hepatic impairment, adjust drug selection and monitoring; in persons with ongoing high-risk exposures, discuss transitioning to PrEP after PEP completion; for pediatric exposures, follow age-appropriate testing and management pathways and involve guardians in consent and follow-up [^115CRJAR] [^112yp1px] [^11671FUW] [^113UKKFy].

> Finally, I need to ensure institutional compliance and prevention: confirm that the incident is reported to occupational health, that the exposure control plan is followed, and that safer sharps and practices are reviewed to prevent recurrence; I should double-check that the exposed worker receives support for adherence, mental health, and return-to-work planning during the follow-up period [^112vwjLD] [^1169JRuY].

After a needlestick injury, order **baseline HIV antigen/antibody test, HCV antibody with reflex RNA, HBV surface antigen, core antibody, and surface antibody** to establish pre-exposure status and guide prophylaxis [^115wm9Yy] [^114xaZ74] [^114SVPid]. If the source is unknown or high risk, **start HIV PEP within 2 hours** and continue for 28 days [^1169JRuY] [^115CjEXp]. For HBV, give HBIG and vaccine if unvaccinated or nonimmune; no prophylaxis is available for HCV, but test at 6 weeks and 3–6 months [^117X2ZxS] [^114Toy4F]. Repeat HIV testing at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; if a fourth-generation assay is used, testing can end at 4 months [^115VXzgk]. Add CBC, LFTs, and pregnancy test as indicated, and provide counseling on symptoms and safe sex until results are final [^115wm9Yy] [^113fbscM].

## Baseline laboratory tests (immediate, within 2 hours)

| **Pathogen** | **Test(s)** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| HIV | - HIV antigen/antibody combination assay (4th generation) <br/> - If recent PrEP/Long-acting injectables, add HIV RNA | Establish baseline HIV status; detect acute infection [^115wm9Yy] |
| Hepatitis B virus (HBV) | - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) <br/> - Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) <br/> - Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) | Determine HBV status and immunity [^114SVPid] |
| Hepatitis C virus (HCV) | - HCV antibody (anti-HCV) with reflex HCV RNA if positive | Establish baseline HCV status [^115XwgBm] |
| Additional baseline tests | - Complete blood count (CBC) <br/> - Liver function tests (ALT, AST) <br/> - Pregnancy test (if applicable) | Assess baseline health and guide prophylaxis [^115wm9Yy] |

---

## Source patient testing (if identifiable and consented)

If the source patient is identified, obtain the following tests to **guide prophylaxis and follow-up**:

- **HIV**: Rapid HIV antigen/antibody test or HIV RNA if acute infection suspected [^115wm9Yy].
- **HBV**: HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs [^notfound].
- **HCV**: Anti-HCV with reflex HCV RNA if positive [^115XwgBm].

---

## Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) based on baseline results

### HIV PEP

- **Indication**: Start if source is HIV-positive or unknown/high risk; initiate within 2 hours, no later than 72 hours [^116xgnx9] [^111PGcUm] [^115CjEXp].
- **Regimen**: Truvada (tenofovir/emtricitabine) plus raltegravir or dolutegravir for 28 days [^115CjEXp].
- **Follow-up**: CBC and liver function tests at 2 weeks to monitor toxicity [^113z11kQ].

---

### HBV PEP

For HBV PEP, **give HBIG and initiate the HBV vaccine series** if the exposed worker is unvaccinated or nonimmune (anti-HBs < 10 IU/L) [^notfound]. If the worker is fully vaccinated with documented immunity (anti-HBs ≥ 10 IU/L), **no prophylaxis is needed** [^notfound].

---

### HCV PEP

There is **no prophylaxis** for HCV; monitor with serial testing and refer for treatment if infection occurs [^111NW47T].

---

## Follow-up laboratory testing schedule

| **Pathogen** | **Follow-up testing schedule** |
|-|-|
| HIV | - 6 weeks <br/> - 3 months <br/> - 6 months after exposure <br/> - If 4th-generation assay used, testing can end at 4 months [^115VXzgk] |
| HBV | - If nonimmune, check anti-HBs 1–2 months after vaccine series completion [^113z11kQ] |
| HCV | - 6 weeks <br/> - 3–6 months after exposure [^113z11kQ] |

---

## Additional considerations

- **Counseling**: Advise on symptoms of acute HIV/HBV/HCV and safe sex until final results [^113fbscM].
- **Documentation**: Record exposure details, baseline and follow-up tests, and prophylaxis given [^115wm9Yy].
- **Support**: Provide psychological support and address anxiety during follow-up [^113fbscM].

---

Baseline testing should include **HIV antigen/antibody, HCV antibody with reflex RNA, and HBV surface antigen, core antibody, and surface antibody**, with additional tests as indicated. Start HIV PEP within 2 hours if indicated, provide HBV prophylaxis if nonimmune, and arrange follow-up testing at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months (or 4 months if a fourth-generation HIV assay is used).

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure risk and post-exposure management for health care workers — Routine patient contact has not been found to increase worker risk of acquiring HIV, and health care workers should be trained, retrained and mandated to follow CDC standard precautions guidelines, with personnel minimizing exposure to potentially infectious body fluids and appropriate personal protective equipment and training available and mandated. A 0.3% risk of HIV infection following needlestick exposures is commonly quoted, and risk of seroconversion following mucous membrane exposure has been estimated at 0.09%, with higher-risk circumstances including deep injury, visible blood on the device, placement directly into an artery or vein, or exposure to a source with elevated viral titers. For postexposure prophylaxis, the need for antiretroviral medications should be evaluated on an individual basis by the employee health physician, and drugs should be made quickly available (preferably within 1 or 2 hours) in accordance with U.S. Public Health Service guidance and provided free of charge. After the initial baseline HIV antibody is drawn, the employee should receive recall notices for follow-up HIV antibody testing at appropriate intervals for at least 6 months unless the source patient has been identified as not having HIV or another bloodborne pathogen, and a follow-up period of 4 months is regarded as adequate when 4th generation blood testing is used for follow-up.

Antibody or RNA screening is listed for persons with conditions associated with a high prevalence of HCV infection (including persons with HIV infection, persons who have ever been on hemodialysis, and persons with unexplained abnormal aminotransferase levels) and for health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after a needle stick injury or mucosal exposure to HCV-positive blood. For children born to HCV-infected mothers, the table specifies Antibody after 18 mo of age, RNA for younger ages. A footnote specifies that all positive anti-HCV antibody tests should be followed up with a HCV RNA test to determine active infection.

Handling needles

Be careful when you are handling needles to help prevent accidental needle-stick injury. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them.

Step 3: Do a safety test

Always do a safety test before each injection to:

check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly.
make sure that you get the correct insulin dose.

If the pen is new, you must perform safety tests before you use the pen for the first time until you see insulin coming out of the needle tip. If you see insulin coming out of the needle tip, the pen is ready to use. If you do not see insulin coming out before taking your dose, you could get an underdose or no insulin at all. This could cause high blood sugar.

Select 3 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the mark between 2 and 4.
Press the injection button all the way in.
When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly.

If no insulin appears:

You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin.
If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens:
change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2),
then repeat the safety test (see Step 3).
Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen.
Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^111aL6dz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US PHS occupational HIV exposure risks and modifiers — Risk of transmission after occupational exposures is estimated to be approximately 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2% — 0.5%), and after a mucous membrane exposure, approximately 0.09% (CI = 0.006% — 0.5%). Although episodes after nonintact skin exposure have been documented, the average risk for transmission by this route has not been precisely quantified but is estimated to be less than the risk for mucous membrane exposures. The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissues other than HIV-infected blood also has not been quantified but is probably considerably lower than for blood exposures. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that multiple factors might affect the risk for HIV transmission after an occupational exposure; in a retrospective case-control study of health care personnel (HCP) with percutaneous exposure, increased risk was associated with 1) a device visibly contaminated with the patient's blood, 2) a needle placed directly in a vein or artery, or 3) a deep injury, and risk also was increased for exposure to blood from source persons with terminal illness; a laboratory study further demonstrated that more blood is transferred by deeper injuries and hollow-bore needles, supporting an inoculum effect. Exposure to a source patient with an undetectable serum viral load does not eliminate the possibility of HIV transmission or the need for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and follow-up testing.

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113pGHTH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

HIV prevention — behavioral counseling, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are outlined as follows: The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy is primary prevention, or avoidance of exposure, and it recommends providing intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Prophylactic intervention with antiretroviral medications, both preexposure and postexposure, can prevent HIV infection. Postexposure prophylaxis is used in persons without HIV after possible exposure via sexual contact, occupational or nonoccupational needle stick or other injury, or sharing injection drug equipment and, when initiated soon after possible exposure, can prevent HIV infection. Preexposure prophylaxis is used in persons without HIV who are at high risk, consists of antiretroviral medication taken every day before potential exposure, and the USPSTF recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.

5.4 Risk of A ccidental N eedlestick I njury

After use, the ZIMHI needle is exposed until the safety guard is deployed. A needlestick injury could occur during use in emergency situations. In the event that an accidental needlestick occurs, medical attention should be sought. Potential exposure to blood borne pathogens including HIV, HBV, and HCV requires immediate evaluation by a medical professional. Stress to patients the importance of familiarizing themselves with the device and its operation prior to experiencing an emergency situation, so they are familiar with the safety guard and its deployment.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1169JRuY]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Post‑exposure management after HBV, HCV, or HIV exposures — clinical evaluation with a knowledgeable health care provider should be offered as soon as practicable, e.g., within 1–2 hours, and standard first aid should be provided, including washing the injury site; if the exposure is to the eyes, copious irrigation should be performed immediately; benefit and risk information regarding antiretroviral medications should be discussed when there is a possibility of HIV exposure, and medications should be prescribed in accordance with U.S. Public Health Service guidance; serological follow‑up has been recommended at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following exposure, and the HIV serological follow‑up can be shortened to 4 months when a fourth‑generation assay is used; the employee should be advised to report any illness which occurs within the initial six-month period following exposure.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112gMx8n]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck mass biopsy patient handout — what patients should expect describes biopsy types, risks, and follow-up: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the best initial test to diagnose a neck mass, is often done in your doctor's office, and risks include discomfort, bruising, infection, and not getting enough tissue for a diagnosis. A core biopsy is another way to diagnose a neck mass that may be done instead of or after an FNA; it uses a slightly larger needle to get a larger piece of tissue, is well tolerated, has a low risk of complications, and risks include bleeding, bruising, discomfort, infection, and not getting enough tissue for diagnosis. An open biopsy is a more invasive procedure done by a surgeon in the operating room with anesthesia and may remove only a portion or the whole mass; because it is more invasive there is a higher risk for complications, and risks include complications of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, discomfort, scarring, and nerve injury (numbness; paralysis). For results, the medical provider should call or set up a follow-up appointment within 1 week of the biopsy, and if results are not received after 1 week the patient should call the medical provider.

Healthcare worker bloodborne pathogen (BBP) exposure — U.S. prevalence, seroconversion risk, and postexposure management are summarized by pathogen. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), endemic rate is < 1, seroconversion risk after hollow needle stick is 0.3, and 57–138 as of December 2001 HCWs were infected; postexposure prophylaxis is Two- vs three-drug protocol, 4-wk regimen and testing includes HIV test at exposure and 6 wk, 12 wk, and 6 mo; CBC and liver function tests at exposure and 2 wk later (check treatment toxicity) with the note See www.nccc.ucsf.edu for updated HIV postexposure information. For hepatitis C virus (HCV), endemic rate is 2–5.8, seroconversion risk is 1.8, and infections include 1% of HCW (402 new cases estimated in 2009); there is No therapy, and testing is HCV antibody/liver enzymes after exposure and 4–6 mo later; consider HCV RNA at 4–6 wk. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), endemic rate is 0.2–5.3, seroconversion risk is 6–30 if not immunized, and 100 in 2009 HCWs were infected; prophylaxis is HBIG with or without HB vaccine (HB vaccine only if unimmunized.) and testing is Check for immunity in 1–2 mo if vaccinated.

Needlestick and sharps injury epidemiology from the National Surveillance System (NaSH) shows that from 1995 to 2007 there were almost 31,000 exposure incidents, 82% percutaneous and 80% involving blood or blood products, with only 9% in procedural areas, 36% on inpatient units, and 29% in the operating room; the hollow-bore needle (55% of cases) was most common and 30% of injuries involved a hollow needle on a syringe. Safety engineering measures were advanced when the NPA in 2001 required retractable or "sheathable" devices and needless systems, and 2007 NaSH data found fully 56% of needle-stick injuries were preventable by such systems.

Risk behaviors, exposures, and conditions associated with increased risk of HCV infection — Listed risk behaviors include injection drug use (current or ever, including those who injected only once), intranasal illicit drug use, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Risk exposures include persons on long-term hemodialysis (ever), percutaneous/parenteral exposures in an unregulated setting, and occupational exposures among health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after needle stick, sharps, or mucosal exposures to HCV-infected blood; children born to HCV-infected women; and persons who were ever incarcerated. Prior recipients of blood transfusion(s) or organ transplant are noted, including those notified they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV, those who received a transfusion of blood or blood components or underwent an organ transplant prior to July 1992, and those who received clotting factor concentrates produced prior to 1987. Risk conditions and circumstances include HIV infection, sexually active persons about to start preexposure prophylaxis for HIV, unexplained chronic liver disease and/or chronic hepatitis (including elevated ALT levels), and solid organ donors (deceased and living) and solid organ transplant recipients.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology — Global prevalence, genotype distribution, coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and transmission modes are characterized by the following: the estimated worldwide prevalence of HCV infection is 2% to 3%, which translates to an estimated 170 million infected individuals of whom approximately 3.2 million live in the United States; seven distinct HCV genotypes have been described, with genotype 1 accounting for approximately 75% of infections in the United States and approximately 90% of infections among blacks; approximately, 20% to 30% of HIV-infected patients in the United States are coinfected with HCV; HCV is approximately 10 times more infectious than HIV through percutaneous blood exposures and has been shown to survive for weeks in syringes; transmission via injection drug use remains the most common mode of acquisition in the United States while transmission through contaminated blood products is now rare; health care-associated transmission can occur with improper reuse of parenteral medications and equipment, and other associated factors include accidental occupation-related needlestick injuries, intranasal cocaine use, chronic hemodialysis, and tattoo placement; among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), multiple outbreaks demonstrate that sexual transmission is an important mode of acquisition, with risk factors including unprotected receptive anal intercourse, use of sex toys, non-injection recreational drug use, and concurrent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and the increase in incidence of sexual transmission among HIV-infected MSMs coincides with an increase in high-risk sexual behaviors following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART); mother-to-child transmission occurs in approximately 1% to 3% of infants born to HCV-seropositive mothers without and 4% to 7% of infants born to HCV-seropositive mothers with detectable plasma HCV RNA levels, and incidence increases when mothers are HIV-coinfected, reaching rates of 10% to 20%.

CDC nPEP — laboratory testing and follow-up emphasize baseline assessment and targeted co-infection care: At nPEP initiation, laboratory testing is required to exclude pre-existing HIV infection, obtain baseline renal and liver function tests, and evaluate other conditions depending on the circumstances of the exposure to assure selection of the safest, most appropriate ARV regimen, and laboratory testing also is recommended at the end of the nPEP course to check for HIV infection. Persons being assessed due to a known or possible exposure to HIV should be tested for HIV. Routine laboratory testing recommended for persons starting nPEP includes serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and pregnancy (when indicated) testing, and testing and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, other STIs including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, and other medical treatment should be tailored to the clinical situation.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113fbscM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) counseling and emergency department implementation — Counseling should cover the plan for follow-up and HIV testing, how and when to take postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) medications, how to obtain medications if the full 28-day course is not provided, and recognition of acute HIV symptoms with instruction to seek care and request HIV testing if these occur in the months after exposure; risk-reduction counseling during the nPEP period should include avoiding condomless sex, sharing injection equipment, and not donating blood or tissues until guideline discontinuation criteria are met. In emergency departments, implementation of protocols and multidisciplinary programs can improve evaluation, testing, medication provision, and follow-up, yet after implementation of a multidisciplinary PEP program in a U.S. emergency department only 11% of PEP patients attended their 4-week follow-up appointment; programs that provide the first dose at initial evaluation and medication in hand before discharge with either the full course or a starter pack "should be considered". Health care professionals should use a culturally sensitive, empathetic, trauma-informed approach, and factors that might improve adherence and completion include clinician encouragement to take nPEP; co-located services with HIV testing and nPEP provision at initial consultation, knowledge that the perpetrator has HIV infection, transportation support, counseling, and treatment reminders.

Vascular access cannulation in native fistulae using an antistick dull bevel — Perform a complete physical assessment of the fistula and document the findings. Remove any scabs over the cannulation sites. Disinfect the cannulation sites per facility protocol. Using an antistick dull bevel, grasp the needle wings and remove the tip protector. Align the needle cannula, with the bevel facing up, over the cannulation site and pull the skin taut. Carefully insert the needle into the established cannulation site. Advance the needle along the scar tissue tunnel track. If mild to moderate resistance is met while attempting to insert the needle, rotate the needle as you advance it, using gentle pressure. A flashback of blood indicates when the needle is in the access. Lower the angle of insertion. Continue to advance the needle into the fistula until it is appropriately positioned within the vessel. Securely tape the needle set and proceed with the dialysis treatment per facility protocol. Ensure that the same needle insertion angle and depth of penetration are used consistently for each cannulation of a constant site.

Laboratory testing and nPEP follow-up — persons being assessed due to a known or possible exposure to HIV should be tested for HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation). At the initial nPEP medical visit, a rapid (also referred to as point-of-care), laboratory-based antigen/antibody combination (Ag/Ab) HIV test, or both, is recommended (good practice statement, existing recommendation). For persons with long-acting injectable PrEP ARV exposure during the past 6 months, a diagnostic HIV nucleic acid test (NAT) is recommended at the initial medical evaluation, in addition to an Ag/Ab HIV test (NEW*: good practice statement, indirect data; existing recommendation). Perform interim HIV testing with both a laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab test plus a diagnostic HIV NAT test 4–6 weeks after exposure (good practice statement, standard of care). HIV testing 4–6 weeks post-nPEP initiation may be deferred for persons who started nPEP within 24 hours of a known or possible HIV exposure and who did not miss any nPEP doses. Perform final HIV tests using laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab combination immunoassay and diagnostic HIV NAT 12 weeks after exposure (NEW*: good practice statement, standard of care). Routine laboratory testing recommended for persons starting nPEP includes serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and pregnancy testing (good practice statement, existing recommendation). Testing and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, other sexually transmitted infections including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, and other medical treatment should be tailored to the clinical situation (good practice statement, existing recommendation).

### Management of healthcare personnel living with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus in US healthcare institutions [^112f25UX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Healthcare personnel-to-patient transmission determinants — the 5 factors identified by the 2010 SHEA guideline remain: the intrinsic transmissibility of a specific pathogen; the frequency with which HCP sustain injuries that may present a risk for transmission of bloodborne pathogens to HCP; the frequency of occupational exposure events resulting in injuries that might present a risk for bloodborne pathogens transmission from HCP to their patients; the viral load in HCP living with HBV, HCV, and/or HIV; and the magnitude of risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens following various types of exposure events; additionally, procedural and technological interventions (eg, blunt-tipped suture needles, needless connectors, self-sheathing needles) were designed to decrease risks for occupational exposures and, although precise efficacy for HCP-to-patient transmission cannot be estimated, their net effect is likely to have made the healthcare environment safer, thereby decreasing the frequency of any occupational exposure.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^115VXzgk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US Public Health Service occupational HIV exposure — postexposure testing schedules — HIV testing should be used to monitor HCP for seroconversion after occupational HIV exposure. After baseline testing at the time of exposure, follow-up testing should be performed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure. Use of fourth generation HIV Ag/Ab combination immunoassays allow for earlier detection of HIV infection, and if a provider is certain that a fourth generation combination HIV Ag/Ab test is used, HIV follow-up testing could be concluded earlier than 6 months after exposure with an alternative schedule of baseline testing, 6 weeks, and then concluded at 4 months after the exposure. Extended HIV follow-up (e.g., for 12 months) is recommended for HCP who become infected with HCV after exposure to a source co-infected with HIV and HCV; whether extended follow-up is indicated in other circumstances is unknown, routine extension is not warranted, and decisions to extend should be based on the clinical judgment of the exposed person's health-care provider and should not be precluded because of HCP anxiety.

### Insulin glargine (insulin glargine solostar) [^113F2KcW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Step 6. Remove and discard the needle

Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent:

Contamination and/or infection.
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.

Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g., a one-handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
Dispose of the needle safely. Used needles should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly.

If you are giving an injection to another person, you should remove the needle in an approved manner to avoid needle-stick injuries.
Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111NW47T]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevention after exposure — adults and adolescents with HIV: There is no available vaccine or recommended post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HCV infection. Following acute HCV infection, chronic infection can be prevented within the first 6 to 12 months after infection through antiviral treatment; high rates of viral clearance have been observed with HCV treatment during the acute phase of infection. Because most patients with acute HCV infection may transmit to others and are at risk for loss to follow-up, immediate treatment with the same regimens recommended for chronic HCV should be offered (AIII), and specific treatment regimens in acute infection are the same as those recommended for chronic HCV infection.

Screening frequency and pediatric scope — Annual HCV testing is recommended for all persons who inject drugs and for men with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection who have unprotected sex with men (IIa, C). People with an ongoing risk factor(s) for HCV infection remain vulnerable for as long as the behavior, exposure, condition, or circumstance persists, thereby warranting periodic repeat HCV testing, and there is a paucity of data addressing the optimal frequency of repeat testing, thereby leaving the periodicity to the clinician's discretion on a case-by-case basis. Because of these challenges, at least annual HCV testing is recommended. One-time, risk-based HCV screening is recommended for persons younger than 18 years old with current or past behaviors, exposures, or conditions or circumstances associated with an increased risk of HCV infection, and there is currently insufficient evidence to support universal HCV screening in the pediatric population.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^117Y64Ho]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Epinephrine delivery devices and dosing in anaphylaxis: Various devices are available to inject epinephrine (Table 6), each with advantages and disadvantages. Fixed-dose epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) have become widely available in hospitals, clinics, emergency medical services, certain public venues, and the field. They are effective, convenient to carry, and eliminate the need to draw medication into a syringe, which may decrease the risk of incorrect dosage. Many can be discharged through clothing, although thicker clothing would likely decrease the depth of delivery. Currently, EAIs are available in 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mg doses. Epinephrine is also available in sterile, prefilled syringes (0.3 and 0.15 mg doses) with a manual plunger and preattached needle. In addition, without proper training that is periodically reinforced, both prescribers and patients may use the devices incorrectly or cause unintended medication discharge and needle injury. To help prevent accidental needle sticks, manufacturers have developed safety features, such as needles that automatically retract after medication discharge.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^117Vdijz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Detailed justification — complications, management, and prevention in AV access cannulation: Infiltration of the vein can occur with needle advancement beyond the vein, perforating the wall and resulting in some degree of swelling, bruising, and/or pain, and hematomas can range to a large, firm mass that can compress the vessel, resulting in thrombosis of the AV access, with significant hematomas also causing stenosis. Pain of various degrees is common. Management is dependent on the extent of swelling, pain and patient anxiety, and analgesic administration must be assessed on an individual basis. A single infiltration injury that occurs before successful 2-needle cannulation is associated with 56% lower odds of overall AVF maturation, and a significant hematoma often requires deferral of further AV access cannulations until the hematoma is resolved, a period that may last up to 3 months. Prevention includes that an AV access check or assessment before cannulation is required and that ensuring that flow is present in the AV access and determining the direction of flow is required before needle placement.

Peel off the needle seal.
Push the needle on the clear, plastic end of the pen, and twist the needle until you cannot twist it anymore.

Do not attach the needle too tightly, the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection.

Pull off the outer needle cap and save it for removing the needle after the injection.
Keeping the needle pointing up, carefully pull off the inner needle shield and throw it away.

Do not recap the needle with the inner needle shield, or you could get a needle stick injury.

Step 4 Dial your dose

Note: Call your healthcare provider if you are unsure of today's intended dose.

Do not push or pull the dose knob while you turn it to avoid damaging it.

Turn the dose knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Information Display.

Note: You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past your intended dose.

Step 5 Inject your dose

Important

Make sure the Dose Information Display matches the intended dose recorded in Column 5 in your treatment diary.

Example: If your intended dose is 150 IU, confirm that the Dose Information Display reads "150".

Hold the pen at a 90° angle to the injection site, and push the needle into your skin.

Step 8:

Pinch the skin.
Insert the needle in the way your healthcare provider showed you.
Release the skin.
Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the insulin.
Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds (see Figure I).

Step 9:

Pull the needle straight out of your skin.
Gently press the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub the area.
Do not recap the used needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle-stick injury.

Disposing of used needles and syringes

Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash.
If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps container, you may use a household container that is:
made of a heavy-duty plastic,
can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,
upright and stable during use,
leak resistant, and
properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.
When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.
Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

PEP-in-pocket (PiP) approach — For certain persons seeking services for nPEP, a "PEP-in-pocket" (PiP) approach might be useful; the PiP approach provides education and a 28-day supply of recommended HIV PrEP medication regimen to persons with low-frequency, high-risk HIV exposures who decline to use one of the available PrEP regimens. Persons are educated to immediately start their PiP supply if they have a possible HIV exposure, and persons who initiate PiP are followed up in clinic as soon as possible for further evaluation, including for HIV and other STI testing, and assessment of whether PEP should be continued. Centers using this approach have described substantial success, including a high level of correct use and follow-up, and no reported HIV acquisitions to date.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1174vsxz]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk — Risk varies by country of origin for non–US-born persons; persons born in countries with a prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 2% or greater account for the majority of cases of new chronic HBV infection in the US. The CDC classifies HBV endemicity levels by prevalence of positive HBsAg (high [8%], moderate [2%-7%], or low [< 2%]). HBV screening should also be offered to other risk groups defined by clinical and behavioral characteristics in which prevalence of positive HBsAg is 2% or greater; persons from such risk groups include persons who have injected drugs in the past or currently, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV, and sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, and household contacts of persons known to be infected with HBV.

Presence of certain conditions — renal or hepatic disease and HBV/HCV co-infection — affects nPEP choice and monitoring: persons with impaired renal function "might require dose adjustments of ART medications used for PEP and might require additional creatinine monitoring while completing a 28-day course of PEP", and "TDF, when used for treatment of HIV infection, has been associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and higher rates of renal dysfunction, whereas TAF has less impact on renal function", with these adverse effects "less common with PEP because of its short duration". The guidance notes that "liver disease with cirrhosis might be a contraindication for certain ARV regimens or might require ARV dosage modifications in persons with Child-Pugh class B or C disease", that if "co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is present, regimens that contain agents that treat HBV might be preferred (e.g., tenofovir and 3TC/FTC-containing regimens)", and that "additional monitoring is required for persons who have HBV infection, especially when stopping agents that are active in treatment for HBV infection". It cautions that "elevation in liver transaminase level can occur when taking or after discontinuing ARVs and might be more common in persons with HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection", that "drug-induced liver injury is more common in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection", and that "treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents for chronic HCV have been reported to reactivate HBV", encourages consultation with knowledgeable clinicians, and flags bone health because "TDF and boosted protease inhibitor regimens could contribute to reductions in bone mineral density".

Blood-borne pathogens (BBPs) in the context of sports participation — confirmed transmission during sport is described as exceedingly rare, with no well-documented reports of HIV, HCV, or HBV transmission during sport, and there is also no evidence for universal testing for BBPs as a requirement for participation. The guidance states that competitive athletes and nonathletes should follow appropriate general public health agency recommendations for screening based on individual risk factors, and that standard precautions be followed by anyone providing care to athletes. Exercise and athletic participation are presented as consistent with a healthy lifestyle for everyone, including those living with BBPs. The document directs that athletes with an open wound or bleeding should be removed from competition and allowed to return after proper treatment, and that postexposure evaluation and management should be governed by relevant public health agency recommendations that consider infectivity and exposure risk. Additional directives include that appropriate immunizations be current, particularly hepatitis B, that there is no evidence BBP-positive athletes have a significant competitive advantage, and that BBP status should be kept confidential under relevant privacy laws, while emphasizing inclusion so that those with BBPs should be encouraged and not discouraged from participating when appropriate precautions are taken by all participants, coaches, and medical staff.

Caution: Never use a bent or damaged needle. Always handle pen needles with care to make sure you do not prick yourself (or anyone else) with the needle. Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your injection.

Preparing for your injection

Step 1 - Getting ready

Wash and dry your hands.
You can use your pen straight from the refrigerator. For a more comfortable injection, leave your pen at room temperature for up to 30 minutes.
Check the name, strength, and label of your pen to make sure it is the medicine your healthcare provider has prescribed for you.
Check the expiration date on the pen label. Do not use if the expiration date has passed.
Do not use your pen if:
it has been frozen or exposed to heat
it has been dropped
it looks broken or damaged
it has been more than 28 days after first use of the pen.
Do not remove the pen cap from your pen - until you are ready to inject.

Step 2 - Choose and clean your injection site

NGENLA can be given in the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, or upper arms.
Choose the best place to inject, as recommended by your healthcare provider.
If more than 1 injection is needed to complete your full dose, each injection should be given in a different injection site.
Do not inject into bony areas, areas that are bruised, red, sore or hard, and areas that have scars or skin conditions.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab.
Allow the injection site to dry.
Do not touch injection site after cleaning.

### Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration [^115YTiML]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Transcholedochal LCBDE technique — The peritoneal layer overlying the anterior surface of the supraduodenal CBD is dissected for approximately 20 mm, and a choledochotomy is made longitudinally to avoid injury to the blood supply to the CBD, located at the 3 and 9 o'clock position laterally along the duct; it is often prudent to test for bile first using a free 25-gauge needle prior to cutting to avoid portal venous injury, the incision should be made with an endoknife and/or endoscopic scissors, and the length of the incision should equal the diameter of the largest stone. Once the CBD has been entered, the stones will often spontaneously spill out; suction-irrigation may be used to flush additional stones; a choledochoscope or fluoroscopy can be used to evaluate the ducts for residual stones; unlike the transcystic approach, the choledochoscope can be inserted either proximally into the common, left and right hepatic ducts or distally into the common duct; and a stone retrieval wire basket can be used via the choledochoscope's working channel to retrieve any remaining stones. Once the CBD has been cleared of stones, the ductotomy is approximated with 4–0 or 5–0 absorbable sutures in a running or interrupted fashion, and primary closure with or without a T-tube, external biliary drain, or biliary stent may be performed at the surgeon's discretion.

### Teduglutide (Gattex) [^115EJKSf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clean the skin where you plan to give the injection with a new alcohol swab pad. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection.
Use 1 hand to gently pinch up a fold of skin around the injection site (See Figure T).

Use your other hand to hold the plastic dosing syringe. Insert the full length of the needle into the skin at a 45-degree angle with a quick, "dart-like" motion (See Figure U).

Let go of the skin. Hold the syringe barrel with 1 hand while you slowly push down the plunger until the plastic dosing syringe is empty (See Figure V).

When the plastic dosing syringe is empty, quickly pull the needle out of your skin. There may be a little bleeding at the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage to the injection site if needed.

Step 7: Dispose of syringes and needles.

Do not re-use a syringe or needle.
To help avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap a needle.
Put your needles and syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash.
If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:
made of heavy-duty plastic,
can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharp items being able to come out,
upright and stable during use,
leak-resistant, and
properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.
When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container.

### Zilucoplan (Zilbrysq) [^114sGaCk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Throw away (discard) the needle cap into your household trash or a sharps disposal container.

Do not touch the needle or let it touch anything.

Do not recap the needle at any time to avoid injury.

Do not try to remove any air bubbles from the ZILBRYSQ prefilled syringe. Air bubbles will not affect your dose and will not harm you. This is normal. You can continue to take your injection.

Step 7: Pinch your injection site

Use your other hand to pinch the area of cleaned skin and hold it firmly (Figure H).

Step 8: Insert the needle

Insert the entire needle into the pinched skin at a 45° to 90° angle. When the needle is fully inserted, hold the ZILBRYSQ prefilled syringe in place (Figure I).

Do not pull back on the plunger head at any time because this could break the prefilled syringe.

Do not touch the needle guard activation clips.

Step 9: Release the pinched skin

When the needle is fully inserted, hold the ZILBRYSQ prefilled syringe in place and release the pinched skin (Figure J).

Do not reinsert the needle into the skin if the needle is pulled out when releasing the skin. If this happens, safely throw away (dispose of) the syringe in a sharps disposal container and get a new ZILBRYSQ prefilled syringe to give the injection.

Appropriate training for FUZEON reconstitution and self-injection must be given by a healthcare provider, including a careful review of the FUZEON Patient Package Insert and FUZEON Injection Instructions. The first injection should be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare provider. It is recommended that the patient and/or caregiver's understanding and use of aseptic injection techniques and procedures be periodically re-evaluated.
Instruct patients and caregivers on the preferred anatomical sites for administration (upper arm, abdomen, anterior thigh). FUZEON should not be injected near any anatomical areas where large nerves course close to the skin, such as near the elbow, knee, groin or the inferior or medial sections of the buttocks, skin abnormalities, including directly over a blood vessel, into moles, scar tissue, bruises, or near the navel, surgical scars, tattoos or burn sites.
Instruct patients and caregivers in the proper techniques for preparation, injection and disposal of needles and syringes (including not recapping needles) in order to avoid needle stick injuries. Advise patients not to reuse needles or syringes, and of safe disposal procedures, including the use of a puncture-resistant container, for disposal of used needles and syringes. Instruct patients on the safe disposal of full containers as per local requirements. Caregivers who experience an accidental needle stick after patient injection should contact a healthcare provider immediately.
Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider for any questions regarding the administration of FUZEON.
Inform patients not to change the dose or dosing schedule of FUZEON or any antiretroviral medication without consulting their healthcare provider.
Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they stop taking FUZEON or any other drug in their antiretroviral regimen.
Inform patients that they can obtain more information on the self-administration of FUZEON at www.FUZEON.com or by calling 1–877–4-FUZEON (1–877–438–9366).

### ASGE guideline for infection control during GI endoscopy [^113F9LTs]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

ASGE infection control — transmission from patients to endoscopy unit personnel includes documented cases with potential modes such as needle stick injury, blood splashes to the conjunctiva, inhalation of aerosolized microorganisms, and transfer from direct handling of patients; endoscopy staff may be at higher risk for certain infections, including a higher prevalence of H pylori with increasing years of practice. Appropriate use of personal protective equipment and good hand hygiene should minimize these risks, and units need policies and procedures for potential workplace exposures.

Nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) guidance states that "Patients not receiving PrEP who seek care within 72 hours after an isolated sexual or injection-related HIV exposure should be evaluated for the potential need for nPEP". For isolated exposures, "nPEP should be prescribed, but PrEP or other continued antiretroviral medication is not indicated after completion of the 28-day PEP course".

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^114iFmfH]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Competing causes of liver injury — recommended testing and key mimickers: Testing for acute viral hepatitis is recommended for all patients with suspected DILI including hepatitis A IgM, HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody IgM, and HCV RNA; in the DILIN cohort, 1.3% of adjudicated cases tested positive for HCV RNA. Another mimic is acute HEV; anti-HEV IgM seroprevalence was 3% in adjudicated cases and testing for acute HEV infection should be considered in selected instances, including cases without a clear suspect agent or in cases with very high aminotransferase values arising in older adults. All patients with suspected DILI should also undergo screening for sporadic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with autoantibodies and serum Ig levels. Patients with recent hypotension, sepsis, or heart failure are at risk for ischemic liver injury with a characteristic laboratory course. In younger patients, Wilson disease can be considered using recommended testing. In cholestatic cases, testing for antimitochondrial antibody is recommended to assess for primary biliary cholangitis. In patients with a predominance of AST greater than ALT, alcohol-associated hepatitis should be considered, especially if aminotransferase elevations come close (e.g. AST generally < 300 U/L) and associated with high gamma-glutamyltransferase levels.
