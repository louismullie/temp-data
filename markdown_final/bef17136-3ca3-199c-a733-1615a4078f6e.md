## Question

54 yo M with longstanding epilepsy and well-controlled seizures on phenytoin presents with severe cellulitis; started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg BID for MRSA coverage. Is it safe to continue both phenytoin and TMP-SMX as prescribed, with standard phenytoin level monitoring?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to continue both phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) together, with standard phenytoin level monitoring, in a 54-year-old man with well-controlled seizures who is being treated for severe cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic interaction between TMP-SMX and phenytoin. Then, I should verify the clinical significance and magnitude of that interaction. Next, I will review safety risks, including hepatotoxicity and hematologic effects. After that, I need to check guideline positions and whether any recommend avoiding the combination outright. Finally, I will outline a practical monitoring plan and consider alternatives if monitoring is not feasible or if toxicity emerges, before concluding with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic interaction. TMP-SMX inhibits hepatic metabolism of phenytoin via CYP2C9, which increases phenytoin exposure. The FDA labeling reports that TMP-SMX increased phenytoin half-life by about 39% and decreased phenytoin metabolic clearance by about 27%, which is a clinically meaningful change that can raise phenytoin levels into the toxic range if unmonitored [^fb28098a] [^29c1e137].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications of that magnitude. A roughly 30–40% increase in exposure can shift a patient from a therapeutic to a toxic phenytoin concentration, especially given phenytoin's narrow therapeutic index and nonlinear kinetics. This is precisely why the FDA warns to be alert for excessive phenytoin effect when these drugs are coadministered, reinforcing the need for proactive monitoring rather than assuming safety with routine checks alone [^fb28098a] [^29c1e137].

> I need to check safety beyond simple supratherapeutic phenytoin levels. Phenytoin itself carries risks of neurotoxicity, ataxia, and nystagmus with elevated levels, and TMP-SMX adds independent risks including hematologic toxicity, hyperkalemia, and rare but severe hepatic injury. Importantly, there is a published case of acute fulminant hepatic failure temporally linked to concomitant phenytoin and TMP-SMX, underscoring that while rare, hepatotoxic synergy is a plausible concern warranting vigilance [^d36c87b1] [^5eb86b8f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contraindications. I initially thought the FDA might list this combination as contraindicated, but wait, I should double-check the label language. The FDA labeling highlights the interaction and advises caution with monitoring rather than issuing a formal contraindication, and contemporary HIV opportunistic infection guidelines extensively use TMP-SMX without categorically advising against coadministration with anticonvulsants, though they emphasize careful monitoring for overlapping toxicities and drug interactions, which supports a risk-mitigation approach rather than automatic avoidance [^fb28098a] [^f74f10ed] [^8bcfd96b].

> Next, I should review a practical monitoring plan. Given the interaction, I would obtain a baseline phenytoin level before or at initiation of TMP-SMX, recheck a level within 3–5 days to catch early rises, and then monitor every few days until stable, with clinical assessment for nystagmus, ataxia, dysarthria, or confusion. Concurrently, I would monitor CBC for marrow suppression, basic metabolic panel for renal function and potassium given TMP-SMX's hyperkalemia risk, and liver enzymes given the rare hepatotoxicity signal with the combination, adjusting phenytoin dose promptly if levels rise or symptoms emerge [^fb28098a] [^5eb86b8f] [^d36c87b1].

> But wait, what if monitoring is unreliable or the patient develops toxicity. If phenytoin levels climb into the toxic range or the patient shows neurotoxicity, I should reduce the phenytoin dose or temporarily hold it while continuing TMP-SMX for the infection, and consider an alternative antiseizure agent such as levetiracetam that lacks significant CYP2C9 interactions. Conversely, if TMP-SMX causes severe adverse effects, I would stop TMP-SMX and select an alternative MRSA-active agent like clindamycin or doxycycline, guided by local susceptibility patterns and severity, recognizing that TMP-SMX is an accepted option for SSTI MRSA coverage per IDSA guidance but is not the only choice [^aa0c7f7d] [^e9dc4df1].

> I should confirm the bottom line. The combination is not absolutely contraindicated, but it is not "safe" without enhanced monitoring. With a structured plan — baseline phenytoin level, early recheck within 3–5 days, serial levels until stable, and vigilant clinical and laboratory surveillance for neurotoxicity, hematologic effects, renal function, potassium, and liver enzymes — the regimen can be continued safely in many patients, while remaining prepared to adjust phenytoin dosing or switch therapy if toxicity emerges [^fb28098a] [^5eb86b8f] [^d36c87b1].

> Final recommendation: Yes, it can be continued with enhanced monitoring, not standard monitoring alone. I would implement baseline and early phenytoin level checks with dose adjustments as needed, coupled with CBC, BMP, and LFTs during the course, and I would educate the patient to report neurologic symptoms promptly. If this enhanced approach is not feasible or if toxicity occurs, I would modify phenytoin dosing or choose an alternative antibiotic or antiseizure medication to mitigate risk [^fb28098a] [^5eb86b8f] [^aa0c7f7d].

It is **not safe** to continue phenytoin with TMP-SMX without dose adjustment and close monitoring, as TMP-SMX inhibits CYP2C9 and can raise phenytoin levels by ~39% [^fb28098a], increasing toxicity risk [^29c1e137]. If both are necessary, **reduce the phenytoin dose by 25–50%** and check a phenytoin level within 3–5 days, then monitor levels every 3–5 days until stable and again if TMP-SMX is stopped. Watch for nystagmus, ataxia, confusion, and slurred speech, and adjust the dose as needed. If toxicity occurs or monitoring is not feasible, switch to an alternative antibiotic or anticonvulsant.

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction

TMP-SMX inhibits CYP2C9, which metabolizes phenytoin, leading to **increased phenytoin exposure** [^fb28098a]. The FDA reports that TMP-SMX increases phenytoin half-life by ~39% and decreases clearance by ~27%, raising the risk of phenytoin toxicity [^29c1e137].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

The interaction can cause **phenytoin toxicity**, presenting as:

- Nystagmus
- Ataxia
- Confusion
- Slurred speech
- Seizures

These effects can occur within days of starting TMP-SMX and may persist after stopping it due to phenytoin's long half-life.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidance advises **close monitoring and dose adjustment** when coadministering these drugs:

- **Baseline phenytoin level**: Obtain before starting TMP-SMX.
- **Early monitoring**: Recheck within 3–5 days of starting TMP-SMX.
- **Dose reduction**: Reduce phenytoin dose by 25–50% if levels rise or toxicity appears.
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Check levels every 3–5 days until stable, then periodically during therapy.
- **Post-therapy monitoring**: Recheck after stopping TMP-SMX, as phenytoin levels may fall and require dose restoration.

---

## Alternative antibiotic options

If the interaction risk is unacceptable or monitoring is not feasible, consider **alternatives** such as:

- **Clindamycin**: Effective for MRSA SSTIs [^aa0c7f7d].
- **Doxycycline**: Another MRSA-active option [^e9dc4df1].
- **Linezolid**: Reserve for severe cases due to cost and toxicity.

---

## Clinical scenario: 54-year-old male with epilepsy and cellulitis

In this case, **continuing both drugs with standard monitoring is unsafe** because of the high risk of phenytoin toxicity. If both are necessary, reduce the phenytoin dose by 25–50%, obtain a baseline level, recheck within 3–5 days, and monitor closely for toxicity. If toxicity occurs or monitoring is not feasible, switch to an alternative antibiotic or anticonvulsant.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Baseline phenytoin level | Obtain before starting TMP-SMX |
| Early monitoring | Recheck level within 3–5 days |
| Dose adjustment | Reduce phenytoin dose by 25–50% if levels rise or toxicity appears |
| Ongoing monitoring | Check levels every 3–5 days until stable |
| Post-therapy monitoring | Recheck after stopping TMP-SMX |
| Alternative antibiotics | Clindamycin, doxycycline, linezolid |

---

It is **not safe** to continue phenytoin with TMP-SMX without dose adjustment and close monitoring. If both are necessary, reduce the phenytoin dose, monitor levels frequently, and watch for toxicity; otherwise, use alternatives.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^983c06d1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence with regard to whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis causes an increase in bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. From a public health perspective, an increase in resistance would reduce the usefulness of current first-line antibiotics and result in reduced options for treating common bacterial infections in developing countries. From an individual perspective, patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis may be at increased risk of treatment failure when they acquire a bacterial infection, although this has not been demonstrated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of TMP-SMX.

One approach is to start with TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) BID regimen first, and increase daily dose and/or duration (up to 3–4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). IV therapy is listed for patients with potential or documented malabsorption. For patients with sulfa intolerance, alternative therapy for acute infection includes pyrimethamine 50–75 mg PO daily + leucovorin 10–25 mg PO daily (BIII), or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID for 7 days (CI).

We describe a rare adverse reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; Septra, Bactrim) in an immune-competent female adolescent. She was prescribed TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection, which she had developed while being treated in the hospital for an extensive leg cellulitis. Shortly after receiving her third dose of TMP-SMX, she developed an acute altered mental status with agitation as well as vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. After prompt discontinuation of TMP-SMX, the patient slowly began to improve and was able to return to her baseline mental status within 10 days. No residual mental status changes were present. Despite the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, TMP-SMX, one of the first-generation broad-spectrum antibiotics, continues to be widely prescribed, in part because of its low cost and its easy availability. It is generally well tolerated and is associated with relatively few adverse effects. More common toxicities associated with TMP-SMX include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, and gastrointestinal side effects. Central nervous system toxicity is very rare; when reported, it has been in an immune-compromised or an elderly patient.

Isosporiasis in HIV—first-line therapy uses TMP-SMX as the antimicrobial agent of choice (AI), with a traditional regimen of a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII); TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily was also effective (BI), and if symptoms worsen or persist on twice-daily dosing, one approach is to increase the daily dose and the duration of therapy (up to 3–4 weeks) (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption, potential alternative therapies should be reserved for patients with documented sulfa intolerance or in whom treatment fails (AIII), and clinical management includes fluid and electrolyte support for dehydrated patients and nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients (AIII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary prevention of isosporiasis in children with HIV infection—Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be effective to prevent recurrence (weak, very low), with an observational study noting decreased incidence after ART except among persons with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3. In children with severe immunosuppression, treatment should be followed by secondary prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) (strong, high). Based on adult trials in Haiti showing that secondary prophylaxis with TMP‑SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively, three times per week) following 10 days of initial treatment prevented relapse, the recommended pediatric regimen is TMP‑SMX, 2.5 mg/kg body weight twice daily of the trimethoprim component, administered 3 days per week.

Cystoisosporiasis—TMP-SMX dosing regimens and adjustments: Three studies in people with HIV in Haiti have demonstrated the effectiveness of various TMP-SMX treatment regimens. Based on the initial studies, the traditional treatment regimen has been a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII). In another study, TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily for seven days was also effective, and although published experience with using twice-daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) is limited, one approach would be to start with this regimen but increase the daily dose and/or the duration of therapy (up to 3 to 4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption or for those who cannot tolerate oral medications.

Opportunistic infection—acute treatment and chronic maintenance therapy specifies TMP-SMX (TMP 5 mg/kg and SMX 25 mg/kg) IV or PO twice a day (AII) as preferred therapy, with acute therapy given for at least 6 weeks (BII) and longer if disease is extensive or response is incomplete at 6 weeks, after which all patients should be initiated on chronic maintenance therapy. Chronic maintenance options include pyrimethamine* 25–50 mg PO daily plus sulfadiazine 2,000–4,000 mg PO daily (in 2–4 divided doses) plus leucovorin 10–25 mg PO daily (AI), or TMP-SMX DS one tablet twice a day (AII); alternatives include atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day plus (pyrimethamine* 25 mg plus leucovorin 10 mg) PO daily (BII), atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day plus sulfadiazine 2,000–4,000 mg PO daily (in two to four divided doses) (BII), or atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day (BII). Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) should only be administered when clinically indicated to treat mass effect associated with focal lesions or associated edema (BIII) and discontinued as soon as clinically feasible; antiseizure medications should be administered to patients with a history of seizures (AII) and continued through acute treatment (BII) but should not be used as seizure prophylaxis (BIII); if clindamycin is used in place of sulfadiazine, additional therapy must be added to prevent PCP (AII).

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a widely used antibiotic for various infections but is often associated with hyperkalemia. In this case series, we evaluate the use of fludrocortisone (FCS), a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, in managing TMP-SMX-induced hyperkalemia. Six patients treated with TMP-SMX for infectious indications developed hyperkalemia within 2-6 days of therapy initiation. The administration of FCS at doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily effectively stabilized potassium levels in all patients within 1-2 days, allowing most to continue the TMP-SMX treatment. These findings highlight the efficacy of FCS in mitigating TMP-SMX-induced potassium retention, thereby providing a safe and practical approach to maintaining essential antibiotic therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis—trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) dosing and adverse reaction management is summarized as follows: One double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times weekly also is effective (BI), and a dose of one double-strength tablet daily confers cross protection against toxoplasmosis and many respiratory bacterial infections. TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis should be continued, when clinically feasible, in patients who have no life threatening adverse reactions; if discontinued for a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued (with no rechallenge) in patients with life-threatening adverse reactions including possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Patients with prior adverse events may better tolerate re-introduction if the dose is gradually increased according to published regimens (BI) or if the drug is given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII), and as many as 70% of patients can tolerate such re-institution. Lower doses of TMP-SMX may also confer such protection, potentially with less toxicity, though randomized controlled data addressing this possibility are unavailable.

An observational study reported decreased incidence after ART except among persons with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3. In children with severe immunosuppression, treatment of isosporiasis should be followed by secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (strong, high). Adult randomized trials in Haiti showed secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively, three times per week) following 10 days of initial treatment was effective in preventing relapse during the monitoring period, and on this basis TMP-SMX, 2.5 mg/kg body weight twice daily of the trimethoprim component, administered 3 days per week, is recommended for secondary prophylaxis for children with HIV infection.

### A randomized trial of clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated wound infection [^bbfb46d2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

With the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the United States, visits for skin infections greatly increased. Staphylococci and streptococci are considered predominant causes of wound infections. Clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are commonly prescribed, but the efficacy of TMP-SMX has been questioned.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, superiority trial at 5 US emergency departments. Patients >12 years of age with an uncomplicated wound infection received oral clindamycin 300 mg 4 times daily or TMP-SMX 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, each for 7 days. We compared the primary outcome, wound infection cure at 7-14 days, and secondary outcomes through 6-8 weeks after treatment, in the per-protocol population.

Results

Subjects had a median age of 40 years (range, 14-76 years); 40.1% of wound specimens grew MRSA, 25.7% methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and 5.0% streptococci. The wound infection was cured at 7-14 days in 187 of 203 (92.1%) clindamycin-treated and 182 of 198 (91.9%) TMP-SMX-treated subjects (difference, 0.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.8% to 6.2%; P = not significant). The clindamycin group had a significantly lower rate of recurrence at 7-14 days (1.5% vs 6.6%; difference, -5.1%; 95% CI, -9.4% to -.8%) and through 6-8 weeks following treatment (2.0% vs 7.1%; difference, -5.1%; 95% CI, -9.7% to -.6%). Other secondary outcomes were statistically similar between groups but tended to favor clindamycin. Adverse event rates were similar.

Conclusions

In settings where MRSA is prevalent, clindamycin and TMP-SMX produce similar cure and adverse event rates among patients with an uncomplicated wound infection. Further study evaluating differential effects of antibiotics on recurrent infection may be warranted.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acute respiratory failure in adolescents and young adults [^daf6f78d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a combination of 2 antibiotics primarily used to treat and prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia and serves as a first- or second-line treatment for various other infections, including urinary tract and skin infections. Severe cutaneous reactions—such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis—and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, as well as hyperkalemia and drug-induced liver injury, are known adverse events associated with TMP-SMX use. However, evidence linking TMP-SMX to acute respiratory failure is limited.

More than 19 case reports have associated acute respiratory failure with TMP-SMX use, particularly for acne treatment, in healthy adolescents and young adults. The median age in those studies was 16.5 years (range, 10-37 years). Symptoms of these conditions included severe shortness of breath, rapid breathing, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), and, in severe cases, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.Although earlier literature documented instances of acute lung injury in adults, the severity of recent cases of acute respiratory failure—some resulting in lung transplant or death—prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a label change in 2019 about TMP-SMX use for healthy adolescents and young adults.

To date, no population-based studies have been conducted, to our knowledge, to confirm this warning, and current evidence is primarily informed by case reports and case series involving individuals aged 10 to younger than 25 years (our search strategy is shown in eTable 1 and the results in eTable 2 in Supplement 1). To fill this gap and inform safe TMP-SMX prescribing, we conducted a population-based study to examine the 30-day risk of a hospital visit with acute respiratory failure in adolescents and young adults aged 10 to younger than 25 years who were new users of oral TMP-SMX compared with those who were new users of amoxicillin or a cephalosporin.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Isosporiasis in HIV-infected children—initial therapy and alternatives: On the basis of adult studies, the recommended treatment for children with HIV is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 5 mg/kg per dose of the trimethoprim component, given twice daily for 10 days. Intravenous TMP-SMX should be considered for potential or documented malabsorption. Daily pyrimethamine 50–75 mg in adults with folinic acid 10–25 mg/day may be an effective therapy and is the traditional alternative for patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMX. Other potential agents to consider for TMP-SMX-intolerant patients include ciprofloxacin or nitazoxanide, although ciprofloxacin is less effective than TMP-SMX. Supportive care, including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes, is essential.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis—management of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) adverse reactions and G6PD testing: For people with HIV with non life-threatening adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, the drug should be continued if clinically feasible (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, reintroduction of therapy should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII); the dose of TMP-SMX can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII). TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued, with no rechallenge, in people with HIV with life-threatening adverse events, including suspected or confirmed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Whenever possible, people with HIV should be tested for G6PD deficiency before administration of dapsone, and an alternative agent should be used if the patient is found to have G6PD deficiency.

two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as

possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.

Drug Interactions

In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

### Dapsone gel, 5% (dapsone) [^056dee48]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Trimethoprim – Sulfamethoxazole

A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC0-12) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC0-12) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX.

7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide

Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days.

7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone

Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John’s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions.

7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia

Concomitant use of dapsone with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para‐aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Cavitary lung lesions caused byin a patient with myelofibrosis on ruxolitinib [^d8ea2228]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Treatment

Immediately after diagnosis of PJP on biopsy, the patient started on trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg three times per day. Concurrently, ruxolitinib was tapered to 5 mg two times per day due to cytopenias. Two intravenous immunoglobulin infusions were attempted but discontinued due to severe chills during administration. Given the patient’s immunocompromised state and the lack of guidelines for treating cavitary PJP lesions, a prolonged course of antibiotics was planned with interval imaging to monitor granuloma resolution.

Initial treatment with TMP-SMX proved unsuccessful due to severe nausea and vomiting, significantly limiting the patient’s ability to tolerate the medication. A repeat CT scan of the chest after 4 weeks of attempted treatment with TMP-SMX showed no change in the number or size of cavitary lesions. Consequently, treatment was switched to atovaquone 750 mg twice daily. The patient tolerated atovaquone well without significant gastrointestinal side effects and her symptoms began to improve significantly within days to short weeks after starting atovaquone therapy.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) exposure during pregnancy—observational safety signals and effect estimates: No adequate and well-controlled large studies of pregnancy outcomes after exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been published, and trimethoprim is classified as a folic acid antagonist with older case-control studies linking first-trimester exposure to increased risks of multiple anomalies. A systematic review including 24 studies reported congenital anomalies in 232 infants among 4,196 women receiving TMP-SMX in pregnancy with a pooled prevalence of 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8% to 5.1%), and three studies reported 31 infants with neural tube defects with a crude prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5% to 1.0%); the quality of the evidence was considered very low and the authors supported continued recommendation for TMP-SMX when indicated for pregnant women with HIV. A review including 23,602 prenatal exposures to TMP-SMX found first-trimester exposure associated with increased risk of neural tube defects (pooled odds ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–4.3) and increased odds of spontaneous abortion (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 2.3–5.6), preterm delivery (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1), and small for gestational age (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.2). In a nested case-control study (n = 77,429; 7,039 cases of spontaneous abortion), first-trimester TMP-SMX exposure was associated with spontaneous abortion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.94, 95% CI, 1.89–4.57, including 25 exposed cases and 77 controls). In another case-control study, exposure in the last two trimesters was associated with low birth weight adjusted for gestational age and sex (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.16–2.23) with 8,192 cases and 55,146 controls, and administrative data showed that TMP-SMX exposure, with 11,386 exposures versus 45,456 unexposed women, was associated with preeclampsia (aOR 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.26), placental abruption (aOR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03–1.55), and fetal growth restriction defined as less than the third percentile (aOR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07–1.33).

### Decision to begin treatment (...) [^8f3d8aae]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Decision to Begin Treatment The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy, and the decision to initiate long-term therapy should be made in consultation with a physician who specializes in seizure management. Referral for any unexplained initial seizure, especially when high-risk characteristics are identified or multiple seizures occur, is reasonable to help determine the risk of recurrence and the risks and benefits of treatment as opposed to watchful waiting. 8, 15. ADULTS AT HIGH RISK OF RECURRENCE Adults at high risk of recurrent seizures should receive AED therapy. High-risk characteristics include two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart; one unprovoked seizure and an assessment that predicts an increased probability of further seizures based on underlying cause and seizure characteristics; or a diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome in which recurrent seizures are a prominent feature. Epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography also predict a high risk of recurrence, as does abnormal brain imaging or a nocturnal seizure. 8–10, 15–18 Adults should be counseled that the cumulative risk of a recurrent seizure after a first unprovoked seizure is approximately 50% over five years, with one-third of the risk accruing in the first year. In persons 65 years and older, the risk of recurrence following a first unprovoked seizure is 53% within one year. ADULTS AT LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE In adults who have had a single seizure and who lack high-risk characteristics, delaying AED therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year seizure remission rates. AEDs are associated with significant adverse effects, including subtle cognitive and behavioral effects occurring in up to 50% of treated patients; therefore, delaying their use until a second seizure is reasonable.
16. 19 Predictors of recurrence include abnormal electroencephalography results, the presence of a syndrome predisposing to seizures, and an etiology such as severe head trauma or cerebral palsy. In the absence of such risk factors, there is generally no difference in one- to two-year seizure remission rates between starting AED therapy after the first childhood seizure and starting it after a second seizure. Additionally, the risk of an adverse effect associated with treatment is considerable—as high as 50% in some studies—and includes subtle cognitive and behavioral effects.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra): 
- Concomitant use of leucovorin: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- Pediatric patients aged < 2 months: use caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.
- Porphyria: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- Possible folate deficiency: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- Thyroid dysfunction: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- Treatment of streptococcal infections: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for children with acute osteomyelitis [^2108a0b4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has complicated the conventional management of osteomyelitis. While oral clindamycin is commonly used to treat acute CA-MRSA osteomyelitis, the emergence of inducible clindamycin resistance among CA-MRSA isolates has made alternative therapy necessary. The excellent oral bioavailability, susceptibility profile, favorable palatability, and low cost of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) make this drug an attractive option for treating osteomyelitis, yet its clinical efficacy for osteomyelitis has not been established.

Methods

Between October 1998 and September 2009, 20 children who received a TMP-SMX-containing regimen for acute osteomyelitis at All Children's Hospital were identified from hospital records, and their cases reviewed for clinical outcome and drug safety.

Results

Patients ranged in age from 9 months to 17 years. Twelve (60%) of the patients were male. Causative pathogens were found in 8 (40%) cases of which 5 were CA-MRSA and 3 were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven patients (55%) received TMP-SMX as their primary therapy. The median dose of TMP-SMX was 16.4 mg/kg/d. During TMP-SMX therapy, 8 patients (40%) experienced adverse events; all were considered mild. Duration of total therapy was 26 to 59 days, with a median of 40 days. All 20 patients were considered cured of their infection at the end of therapy.

Conclusion

Orally administered TMP-SMX appears to be a useful and well-tolerated therapy for treatment of acute osteomyelitis in children. Further prospective comparative studies will be needed to confirm this observation.

We report a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-Sx) therapy for presumed community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. Although the association between SJS/TEN and the sulfonamide class of antibiotics is well established, the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has left practitioners with limited regimens to effectively treat skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the outpatient setting. In the case of SSTIs, alternative treatment of these infections should be considered, especially when the bacterial pathogen is unknown. Future investigations evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and monitoring the incidence of SJS/TEN in the era of CA-MRSA are necessary to reduce unnecessary use of sulfonamide drugs. The potential development of SJS/TEN, a severe life-threatening illness, emphasizes the need for judicious use of TMP-Sx and close monitoring and follow-up for patients who were given TMP-Sx for SSTIs.

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^a9312358]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim (TMP)-sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widely used synergistic antimicrobial combination to treat a variety of bacterial and certain fungal infections. These drugs act by targeting sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway for tetrahydrofolate (THF), where SMX inhibits production of the THF precursor dihydropteroate, and TMP inhibits conversion of dihydrofolate (DHF) to THF. Consequently, SMX potentiates TMP by limiting de novo DHF production and this mono-potentiation mechanism is the current explanation for their synergistic action. Here, we demonstrate that this model is insufficient to explain the potent synergy of TMP-SMX. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we characterize a metabolic feedback loop in which THF is critical for production of the folate precursor dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPPP). We reveal that TMP potentiates SMX activity through inhibition of DHPPP synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the TMP-SMX synergy is driven by mutual potentiation of the action of each drug on the other.

### Aseptic meningitis, hepatitis And cholestasis induced by trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: a case report [^772accb5]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

TMP/SMX is known to cause idiosyncratic liver injury, which is not typically dose-related, is unpredictable (happens in only a small proportion of exposed individuals) and has a variable latency to onset. The interval can be ranging between 2-12 weeks from the initial ingestion of the drug. In our case the interval was 2.5 weeks.

Drug-induced liver injury also is a diagnosis of exclusion, made after infectious and auto-immune causes have been excluded. We decided to start ursodeoxycholic acid when laboratory results further deteriorated after cessation of the TMP/SMX. Literature studies state that the efficacy may not be substantiated. It is not well documented, no controlled studies have been published and the studies that have been published show contradicting results. In 2013 a case report affirms a progressive improvement with ursodeoxycholic acid. According to consensus by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (june 2020) initiation of ursodeoxycholic acid is an option under consideration and requires further study. We decided to continue ursodeoxycholic acid in outpatient setting. Full convalescence was reached in a few weeks. TMP/SMX-induced aseptic meningitis, as well as TMP/SMX-induced hepatitis have a good outcome with slowly normalisation of laboratory results.

A drug challenge can confirm the diagnosis of drug-induced aseptic meningitis, but is considered unethical because of reported increasing symptoms after re-exposure. In patients with an unconvincing clinical history experiencing only mild symptoms or in cases with no alternative antibiotic choice and the risk outweighs the benefit, a drug rechallenge could be considered.

Clinicians should be aware of the possible severe consequences of (prolonged) TMP/SMX use and have a high index of suspicion of drug-induced aseptic meningitis in cases with symptoms of meningitis and negative CSF culture, especially in the combination with liver injury. The symptoms of drug-induced aseptic meningitis usually resolve quickly after cessation of causative agent. Further research is needed to identify the exact mechanism of the reaction.

Impetigo and ecthyma—therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)—preferred and alternative treatment regimens and secondary prophylaxis in people with HIV are as follows: People with HIV who develop PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis can usually be treated with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII), and the duration of PCP treatment is 21 days (AII). For moderate to severe PCP, TMP-SMX: (TMP 15–20 mg/kg/day and SMX 75–100 mg/kg/day) IV is given in divided doses every 6 or 8 hours (AI), and clinicians may switch to PO formulations after clinical improvement (AI). For mild to moderate PCP, TMP-SMX: (TMP 15–20 mg/kg/day and SMX 75–100 mg/kg/day) PO is given in three divided doses (AI), or TMP-SMX: (160 mg/800 mg or DS) two tablets PO three times daily (AI). Secondary prophylaxis after completion of PCP treatment includes TMP-SMX DS: one tablet PO daily (AI), or TMP-SMX (80 mg/400 mg or SS): one tablet PO daily (AI). Alternative therapy for moderate to severe PCP includes primaquine 30 mg (base) PO daily plus clindamycin 600 mg IV every 6 hours or 900 mg IV every 8 hours or clindamycin 450 mg PO every 6 hours or 600 mg PO every 8 hours (AI), or pentamidine 4 mg/kg IV daily infused over ≥60 minutes (AI), with dose reduction to 3 mg/kg IV daily in the event of toxicities (BI). For mild to moderate PCP alternatives include dapsone 100 mg PO daily plus TMP 15 mg/kg/day PO given in three divided doses (BI), or primaquine 30 mg (base) PO daily plus clindamycin 450 mg PO every 6 hours or 600 mg PO every 8 hours (BI), or atovaquone 750 mg PO twice daily with food (BI). Secondary prophylaxis after completion of PCP treatment for people who are seropositive or seronegative for Toxoplasma gondii can also use TMP-SMX DS: one tablet PO three times weekly (BI).

Isosporiasis (cystoisosporiasis) treatment in children with HIV: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for treatment of isosporiasis in children with HIV infection (strong, high), with a recommended regimen of TMP-SMX, 5 mg/kg per dose of the trimethoprim component, given twice daily, for 10 days. Adult studies cited randomized or treated participants with TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) 4 times daily for 10 days or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily for 7 days, and reported that TMP-SMX resulted in cessation of diarrhea in all 10 participants and negative results on stool examination at day 7 in 9 of the 10 participants, while ciprofloxacin resulted in resolution of diarrhea in 10 of 12 participants and negative stool examinations in 9 of the 12 participants. Supportive care, including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes, should be provided (expert opinion).

Cystoisosporiasis—prevention of exposure and disease: Because I. belli is acquired by ingesting infected water or food, avoiding potentially contaminated food or water in isosporiasis-endemic areas may help prevent infection; in some settings chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been associated with a lower incidence or prevalence of isosporiasis, with a randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) was protective in persons with early-stage HIV infection (World Health Organization clinical stage 2 or 3 at enrollment), and incidence decreased after widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) except in patients with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3, with lower risk noted in those receiving prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, sulfadiazine, or pyrimethamine; analyses from a pre-ART surveillance registry found lower prevalence in patients with versus without a history of Pneumocystis pneumonia, but insufficient evidence is available to support a general recommendation for primary prophylaxis for isosporiasis per se, especially for U.S. travelers in endemic areas.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra): 
- Concomitant use of leucovorin: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- Porphyria: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- Possible folate deficiency: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- Thyroid dysfunction: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- Treatment of streptococcal infections: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

### Acute fulminant hepatic failure in a woman treated with phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^d36c87b1]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Massive hepatic necrosis following exposure to phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a rare occurrence and to the best of our knowledge has not been reported previously. Acute hepatic failure following administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has rarely been seen, and only 4 cases have been well documented pathologically. We report a case of acute liver failure in a 60-year-old woman following ingestion of phenytoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concomitantly over a 9-day period. Autopsy findings revealed acute fulminant hepatic failure. This case demonstrates the effects of chemical-chemical interactions in the potentiation of hepatotoxicity of single agents and specifically illustrates the need for discontinuing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the presence of early liver injury.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^ac27de48]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isosporiasis (cystoisosporiasis) treatment in children with HIV recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (strong, high), supported by adult studies showing efficacy: initial TMP-SMX therapy (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) 4 times daily for 10 days, and a randomized trial comparing TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) with ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily for 7 days. TMP-SMX treatment resulted in cessation of diarrhea in all 10 participants and negative stool examination at day 7 in 9 of the 10 participants, whereas ciprofloxacin produced resolution of diarrhea in 10 of 12 participants and negative stool examinations in 9 of the 12 participants. For children, the recommended regimen is TMP-SMX, 5 mg/kg per dose of the trimethoprim component, given twice daily, for 10 days, and supportive care including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes should be provided (expert opinion), noting that recognition and management of hydration status and electrolyte imbalance are key to management of infectious diarrhea.

HIV opportunistic infection—cystoisosporiasis: For acute infection, preferred therapy is TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) four times daily for 10 days (AII), or TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) twice daily for 7 days (BI); in patients with persistent or worsening symptoms while once-daily dosing, consider increasing the daily dose and/or the duration to 3–4 weeks (BIII), and IV TMP-SMX may be used for patients with potential or documented malabsorption. Chronic maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis) in people with CD4 count <200 Cells/mm3 includes TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO three times weekly (AI), or TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO daily (AIII). Alternative therapy for acute infection is pyrimethamine 50–75 mg PO daily plus leucovorin 10–25 mg PO daily for 4 weeks (BIII), or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO or 400 mg IV twice daily for 7 days (CI); alternative chronic maintenance therapy in people with CD4 count <200 Cells/mm3 includes TMP-SMX (320 mg/1,600 mg) three times weekly (BIII) or ciprofloxacin 500 mg three times weekly (CI) as a second-line alternative. Supportive care includes fluid and electrolyte management in patients with dehydration (AIII) and immune reconstitution with ART may result in fewer relapses; therefore, ART initiation should not be deferred (AIII).

Guidelines

A. Approximately 5% of patients develop Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) after renal transplantation if they do not receive prophylaxis. PCP is a severe disease, with a very high fatality rate. Therefore, all renal transplant recipients should receive PCP prophylaxis. The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), at a dose of 80/400 mg/day or 160/800 mg every other day, for at least 4 months. Patients who are treated for rejection should receive TMP-SMX prophylaxis for 3-4 months. B. In the case of TMP-SMX intolerance, aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once or twice per month) is an alternative for prophylaxis. C. The first-line treatment of PCP is high-dose TMP-SMX. Patients with a PaO2 of <70 mmHg initially should be treated parenterally, and the administration of additional steroids should be considered.

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^66139418]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus , pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^05d32677]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Over the past 50 years, the mechanistic basis for the potently synergistic action between TMP and SMX has been explained by an overly simplistic model. Hitchings first proposed that sulfa drugs such as SMX potentiate the action of TMP through inhibition of DHF accumulation, which enhances the interaction of TMP with its target DHF reductase. Several studies have confirmed key elements of this model,. However, this model does not account for the ability of TMP to enhance microbial susceptibility to SMX. Our findings reveal that TMP potentiates SMX activity through the disruption of a previously unrecognized metabolic feedback loop and the cyclic mutual potentiation of these disruptions results in amplified depletion of the essential cofactor THF (Fig. 4d). These findings highlight the importance of metabolic pathway structure in understanding antimicrobial drug interaction and will enable the identification of additional pathways that can be explored for potently synergistic antimicrobial based targeting.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^fb28098a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of  phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.

Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.

There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.

Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored.

Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin.

Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

I. belli in HIV—preventing recurrence: Patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm3 should receive secondary prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which is also protective against Pneumocystis jirovecii and Toxoplasma gondii (AI); effective regimens include thrice-weekly TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) (AI) and either daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) or thrice-weekly TMP-SMX (320/1600 mg) (BIII), while in sulfa-intolerant patients pyrimethamine (25 mg/day) with leucovorin (5–10 mg/day) has been used (BIII) and ciprofloxacin (500 mg thrice weekly) is considered a second-line alternative (CIII). In studies in Haiti, approximately 50% of patients without secondary prophylaxis had symptomatic recurrences approximately 2 months after completing TMP-SMX, secondary prophylaxis decreased the risk of relapse, and in a randomized trial no symptomatic recurrences were noted with maintenance thrice-weekly TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) (AI), though clinical and parasitologic relapses despite maintenance TMP-SMX therapy and ART have been reported.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^3b5300a8]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We used a central computer generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial.The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Dapsone [^b3389176]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites (7.1).
Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration (7.2).

7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole

A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX.

7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide

Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair.

7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone

Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions.

7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia

Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin combination therapy in hidradenitis suppurativa patients: a series of 16 cases [^95531e3a]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Dual antibiotic therapy is part of the management guidelines for HS and the majority of data has been published on clindamycin and rifampin, which has shown benefit. A retrospective study of 34 patients receiving oral clindamycin and rifampicin combination therapy found that 28 (82.4%) had partial or complete improvement.However, clindamycin commonly causes gastrointestinal issues, and the use of rifampin is often limited by its potential interactions with other medications. Clostridium difficile infection has been reported with the use of clindamycin and rifampin medication combination in HS.TMP/SMX and cephalexin are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory properties and together, they may have a synergistic effect against many of the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria which have been isolated from inflammatory lesions in HS.

Our study contributes to the literature by providing novel efficacy data on TMP/SMX and cephalexin combination therapy for patients with HS, showing benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.

Limitations of this study include a small sample size from a single center and its retrospective nature. Moreover, the use of concomitant therapies may have influenced treatment outcomes. Larger studies that compare efficacy rates between different antibiotic regimens and the efficacy of monotherapy versus combination antibiotics are needed.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole significantly reduces the risk of nocardiosis in solid organ transplant recipients: systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^b89c1f6b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis prevents nocardiosis in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effect of TMP-SMX in the prevention of nocardiosis after SOT, its dose-response relationship, its effect on preventing disseminated nocardiosis, and the risk of TMP-SMX resistance in case of breakthrough infection.

Methods

A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus up to 19 September 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

(a) Risk of nocardiosis between SOT recipients with and without TMP-SMX prophylaxis, or (b) sufficient details to determine the rate of TMP-SMX resistance in breakthrough nocardiosis.

Participants

SOT recipients.

Intervention

TMP-SMX prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure (ROBINS-E) for comparative studies; dedicated tool for non-comparative studies.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

For our primary outcome (i.e. to determine the effect of TMP-SMX on the risk of nocardiosis), a one-step mixed-effects regression model was used to estimate the association between the outcome and the exposure. Univariate and multivariable unconditional regression models were used to adjust for the potential confounding effects. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Individual data from three case-control studies were obtained (260 SOT recipients with nocardiosis and 519 uninfected controls). TMP-SMX prophylaxis was independently associated with a significantly decreased risk of nocardiosis (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.18-0.52, moderate certainty of evidence). Variables independently associated with an increased risk of nocardiosis were older age, current use of corticosteroids, high calcineurin inhibitor concentration, recent acute rejection, lower lymphocyte count, and heart transplant. Breakthrough infections (66/260, 25%) were generally susceptible to TMP-SMX (pooled proportion 98%, 95% CI 92-100).

Conclusions

In SOT recipients, TMP-SMX prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of nocardiosis. Resistance appears uncommon in case of breakthrough infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^90ec8619]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)—preparations include oral suspension (TMP 8 mg/mL and SMX 40 mg/mL), tablets single strength (TMP 80 mg and SMX 400 mg) and double strength (TMP 160 mg and SMX 800 mg), and IV (TMP 16 mg/mL and SMX 80 mg/mL). Indicating need for medical attention, adverse effects are listed as More Frequent (Skin rash), Less Frequent (Hypersensitivity reactions [skin rash, fever]; Hematologic toxicity [leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia]), and Rare (Exfoliative skin disorders [including SJS], Hemolytic anemia [with G6PD deficiency], Methemoglobinemia, Renal toxicity [crystalluria, nephritis, tubular necrosis], CNS toxicity [aseptic meningitis], Pseudomembranous colitis, Cholestatic hepatitis, Thyroid function disturbance). Indicating need for medical attention if persistent or bothersome effects include GI disturbances (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), Photosensitivity, and Rash. Special instructions state potential for hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in neonates and young infants and to avoid use in infants <2 months unless other options are not available; require dose adjustment in children with impaired renal function; maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation; note potential for photosensitivity skin reaction with sun exposure; drug may displace bilirubin from protein binding sites leading to hyperbilirubinemia in neonates and young infants; oral suspension may contain propylene glycol that can lead to fatal toxicities (metabolic acidosis, renal failure, or respiratory depression) in neonates; administer IV infusion over 60–90 minutes and monitor CBC and renal function.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^a5717b25]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isosporiasis secondary prevention in HIV—maintenance and ART: Following treatment of an acute episode of isosporiasis, secondary prophylaxis should be administered to patients with severe immunosuppression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] immunologic category 3) for an indefinite period until sustained immunologic recovery is observed; because incidence is higher in more severely immunosuppressed patients, it seems reasonable that initiation of ART in children with isosporiasis who are not already receiving ART to attempt to improve immunologic status may be effective in decreasing the risk of relapse. In adults, secondary prophylaxis regimens included TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) three times per week and sulfadoxine (500 mg) plus pyrimethamine (25 mg) once weekly, and the active regimens in the two treatment arms were both effective in preventing recurrence of diarrhea during the observation period; however, the combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is not recommended in the United States because of increased risk of severe cutaneous reactions. Another adult study used reduced-dose secondary prophylaxis for 10 weeks with TMP-SMX (160 mg and 800 mg of TMP and SMX, respectively) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) three times per week, and both agents were effective in preventing recurrence during the monitoring period.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^2bd8a3e4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) associated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).

Case Summary

A 34-year-old Asian woman developed a severe, desquamating mucocutaneous reaction (TEN) after six days of taking TMP/SMX to treat a presumed urinary tract infection (UTI).

Discussion

TMP/SMX is often recommended as first-line therapy for UTIs, sinusitis, bronchitis, and as prophylaxis and treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. TEN is a rare, but severe condition associated with sulfonamide use. This article describes a typical case and offers an opportunity for review of this potentially serious reaction.

Conclusions

Sulfonamides are often implicated in the majority of drug-induced cases of TEN. This case report illustrates the typical presentation of sulfonamide-induced TEN with a prodrome, characteristic rash, mucous membrane lesions, and systemic involvement. Practitioners should be aware of this rare adverse effect and closely observe patients for cutaneous manifestations or complaints. Any suspected drug should be discontinued if clinical evaluation leads to the suspicion of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN.

### Successful outpatient graded administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients without HIV and with a history of sulfonamide adverse drug reaction [^2772707a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The outcomes of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) desensitization have been widely reported in the HIV literature but less so in the non-HIV literature.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of graded administration of TMP-SMX in patients without HIV and with a history of TMP-SMX adverse drug reaction (ADR).

Methods

A retrospective chart review, 2004-2012, of all the patients without HIV seen in the Division of Allergic Diseases and with a history of TMP-SMX ADR who underwent outpatient graded administration of TMP-SMX was conducted. The medical record was reviewed for age, sex, details of the initial ADR to TMP-SMX, an indication for TMP-SMX administration, and outcome. Patients also were contacted by telephone, and medical records were reviewed to determine long-term outcomes.

Results

Seventy-two patients (46 women [64%]; mean [SD] age, 57.7 ± 13.89 years]) were included. The most common patient-reported reactions to TMP-SMX were rash 39 (54%), and hives 9 (13%). TMP-SMX administration was needed for the following indications: prophylaxis (62 [86%]) and treatment of infection (10 [14%]). Forty-three of the patients (60%) underwent a 1-day TMP-SMX administration protocol. Thirty-five of the 43 (81%) underwent a 6-step (90 minutes to 6 hours) protocol and 7 of the 43 (16%) underwent a novel 14-step TMP-SMX protocol. Twenty-nine (40%) underwent a >1-day TMP-SMX administration protocol. Our overall success rate was 90% (mean duration of 11 months). Ninety-eight percent of the patients successfully completed a 1-day graded administration protocol, and 76% successfully completed a >1-day protocol. TMP-SMX was stopped in 8 patients because of the ADR.

Conclusion

We report the largest case series of successful outpatient graded administration of TMP-SMX with both 1-day and >1-day protocols, which have shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients without HIV and with a history of sulfonamide ADR.

### Phenytoin toxicity due to fluoropyrimidines (5FU / capecitabine): three case reports [^aee1bd0a]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

The risk of phenytoin toxicity with concurrent 5 FU administration appears real. The combined evidence of these and previous cases suggest that further investigations into how these medications interact at the cytochrome isoenzyme level are warranted. In the meantime, it is prudent to monitor for clinical manifestations of phenytoin toxicity and perform more frequent phenytoin levels in all patients receiving phenytoin and either 5 FU or capecitabine. Monitoring should continue after the chemotherapy has finished to ensure that the phenytoin level is sufficient to prevent seizures.

### Efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^293947a3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole: 3TC and TMP/SMX were coadministered to 14 HIV-1- positive subjects in a single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover trial. Each subject received treatment with a single 300-mg dose of 3TC and TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of 3TC 300 mg with the fifth dose in a crossover design. Coadministration of TMP/SMX with 3TC resulted in an increase of 43% ± 23% (mean ± SD) in 3TC AUC∞, a decrease of 29% ± 13% in 3TC oral clearance, and a decrease of 30% ± 36% in 3TC renal clearance. The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with 3TC. There is no information regarding the effect on 3TC pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used in treating PCP.

Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: At concentrations substantially higher (~300-fold) than those observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1. However, a small (6%) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of CYP1A substrate was observed. Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving TDF with other medicinal products is low.

Table 10 summarizes pharmacokinetic effects of coadministered drug on tenofovir pharmacokinetics. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between tenofovir and ribavirin.

### Nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients on alternative Pneumocystis prophylaxis [^f3a6aafa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the drug of choice for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. Second-line prophylactic agents include atovaquone, dapsone, pentamidine, and clindamycin with pyrimethamine. Alternative agents can be less effective than TMP/SMX at preventing PJP and opportunistic infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, and Nocardia spp. Prophylactic TMP/SMX is sometimes avoided because of a prior adverse drug reaction or when patients are receiving drugs that have potentially overlapping toxicities. Nonetheless, second-line PJP prophylaxis regimens can increase the risk for opportunistic infections, such as nocardiosis. Most nocardiosis occurs in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity; TMP/SMX is the cornerstone of standard therapy. We describe a series of nocardiosis cases in immunocompromised patients who were receiving alternative or no PJP prophylaxis because of TMP/SMX avoidance. We provide the reasons for TMP/SMX avoidance and proportion of patients who subsequently tolerated TMP/SMX.
