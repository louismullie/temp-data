## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Prevention of variceal hemorrhage in adults with gastroesophageal varices?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for preventing variceal hemorrhage in adults with gastroesophageal varices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is primary versus secondary prophylaxis. Then, I should verify which nonselective beta-blockers are recommended and why. Next, I will extract dosing regimens for propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol from major guidelines and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to check titration targets, maximum doses, and special situations like ascites or decompensation. Finally, I will consider alternatives if beta-blockers are contraindicated and synthesize a concise, practical recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: this is about primary prophylaxis to prevent a first variceal bleed in adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices, not secondary prevention after a prior bleed, which uses different strategies and dosing considerations, so I should keep those separate to avoid confusion.

> I need to verify the recommended agents. Multiple high-quality guidelines endorse nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) — propranolol, nadolol, or carvedilol — or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for primary prophylaxis in patients with medium/large varices or high-risk small varices, with the choice individualized to patient factors and preferences [^01270ae2] [^f42fa589] [^174a2002].

> Now, let me extract propranolol dosing. The BSG recommends starting propranolol 40 mg twice daily and titrating every 2–3 days to the maximum tolerated dose or until a resting heart rate of 50–55 bpm is achieved, with a typical ceiling of 320 mg/day; AASLD similarly advises 20–40 mg twice daily with titration to a resting heart rate of 55–60 bpm and systolic blood pressure not below 90 mmHg, and to continue indefinitely if tolerated, which aligns with standard practice [^notfound] [^a7179fde].

> Wait, let me verify nadolol dosing. BSG states nadolol 40 mg once daily, titrating to effect or a heart rate of 50–55 bpm, with a maximum of 240 mg/day; AASLD notes 20–40 mg once daily with the same titration principles and lower maximums in patients with ascites, which I should remember for decompensated patients [^79fb9056] [^a7179fde].

> I will now examine carvedilol, since it is increasingly favored in compensated patients. BSG recommends carvedilol 6.25 mg once daily for 1 week, then increase to 12.5 mg once daily if tolerated or to a heart rate below 50–55 bpm, with a typical maintenance of 12.5 mg/day; the FDA label concurs with 6.25 mg daily for 1 week, then 12.5 mg daily, and not to exceed 12.5 mg/day, which I should explicitly state to avoid overdosing [^8aa7654a] [^aeb9f566].

> Hold on, I should verify titration targets and safety cutoffs. Across guidelines, the practical endpoint is to titrate to a resting heart rate of about 50–60 bpm while maintaining systolic blood pressure at or above 90 mmHg; if hypotension, bradycardia, or intolerance emerge, dose reduction or discontinuation is advised, and in decompensated cirrhosis with ascites, lower maximum doses are prudent to avoid renal hypoperfusion and encephalopathy, so I need to ensure I communicate those guardrails clearly [^a7179fde] [^e8fa5590].

> Let me consider special populations and caveats. In patients with severe or refractory ascites, EASL cautions against high-dose NSBBs and advises avoiding carvedilol in decompensated settings, whereas AASLD allows NSBBs with careful monitoring and dose limitation; this discrepancy means I should tailor the agent and dose to hemodynamics and decompensation status, and be ready to adjust or stop therapy if SBP, AKI, or progressive hypotension occur [^4f4d5859] [^c809d5d9] [^e8fa5590].

> Next, I should review alternatives if NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated. EVL is the endoscopic prophylaxis of choice and should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until eradication, with surveillance EGD every 3–6 months in the first year; importantly, combination therapy with NSBB plus EVL is not recommended for primary prophylaxis, even though some clinicians use it, so I need to emphasize monotherapy selection based on shared decision-making [^174a2002] [^7ab5e947] [^0f971cd4].

> But wait, what if the patient has compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension and no varices yet? The PREDESCI trial and subsequent guidance support NSBBs, particularly carvedilol, to reduce decompensation risk even before varices appear, so in that scenario carvedilol 6.25–12.5 mg daily is reasonable with ongoing reassessment of hemodynamics and liver disease stage [^0e04c6c4] [^f4d438f6].

> I should double-check that I am not mixing primary and secondary prophylaxis. For secondary prevention after a prior bleed, combination NSBB plus EVL is recommended, and carvedilol may be used as the NSBB component in some protocols, but that dosing context differs from primary prophylaxis and should not be conflated with the question at hand [^2ea17385] [^71f47d9a].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable dosing summary is as follows: for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in adults with gastroesophageal varices, use propranolol 40 mg twice daily titrated every 2–3 days to a resting heart rate of 50–60 bpm or a maximum of 320 mg/day if tolerated, or nadolol 40 mg once daily titrated to effect up to 240 mg/day, or carvedilol 6.25 mg once daily for 1 week then 12.5 mg once daily if tolerated, not exceeding 12.5 mg/day; monitor heart rate, blood pressure, renal function, and decompensation at each visit, reduce dose or stop if SBP falls below 90 mmHg or adverse effects occur, and choose EVL if NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated [^79fb9056] [^a7179fde] [^aeb9f566] [^174a2002].

---

For primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage in adults with gastroesophageal varices, **carvedilol 12.5 mg once daily** is the preferred first-line therapy [^notfound] because it achieves greater portal pressure reduction and is better tolerated than traditional beta-blockers [^notfound]. If carvedilol is not tolerated, **propranolol 40 mg twice daily** [^79fb9056] or **nadolol 40 mg once daily** [^a7179fde] are acceptable alternatives, titrated to a heart rate of 50–55 bpm or the maximum tolerated dose. Endoscopic variceal ligation is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to beta-blockers [^174a2002]. Combination therapy with beta-blockers plus ligation is not recommended for primary prophylaxis [^7ab5e947].

## Recommended pharmacological agents and dosages

Key characteristics of recommended pharmacological agents and dosages:

| **Aspect** | **Carvedilol** | **Propranolol** | **Nadolol** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 6.25 mg orally once daily for 1 week [^aeb9f566] | 40 mg orally twice daily [^79fb9056] | 40 mg orally once daily [^cac332b9] |
| Maintenance dose | 12.5 mg orally once daily if tolerated [^aeb9f566] | Titrate to maximum tolerated dose or until heart rate reaches 50–55 bpm; maximum dose 320 mg/day [^79fb9056] | Titrate to maximum tolerated dose or until heart rate reaches 50–55 bpm; maximum dose 240 mg/day [^cac332b9] |
| Titration | Increase to 12.5 mg once daily after 1 week if tolerated [^aeb9f566] | Adjust dose every 2–3 days based on heart rate and blood pressure [^a7179fde] | Adjust dose every 2–3 days based on heart rate and blood pressure [^notfound] |
| Monitoring | Heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical tolerance [^e8fa5590] | Heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical tolerance [^a7179fde] | Heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical tolerance [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting carvedilol

Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking activity, provides **greater portal pressure reduction** than traditional beta-blockers [^0d4dc26a]. A Cochrane review found carvedilol achieved a larger HVPG reduction than propranolol or nadolol, though clinical outcomes were similar [^0d4dc26a]. Carvedilol is also associated with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability, making it the preferred first-line agent in many guidelines [^notfound].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

Propranolol and nadolol remain effective alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate carvedilol. Both agents are titrated to a **target heart rate of 50–55 bpm** or the maximum tolerated dose, with regular monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure [^79fb9056].

---

## Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)

EVL is recommended for patients with contraindications to or intolerance of beta-blockers [^174a2002]. EVL is performed at **2–4 week intervals** until variceal eradication, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 3–6 months in the first year [^174a2002].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy with beta-blockers plus EVL is **not recommended** for primary prophylaxis because it does not improve outcomes and increases adverse events [^7ab5e947] [^ecd88229].

---

## Special considerations

- **Ascites**: Use caution with beta-blockers in patients with severe or refractory ascites; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if hypotension or renal dysfunction occurs [^4f4d5859] [^6d6b39ac].
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: NSBBs are generally avoided in acute decompensation; consider temporary discontinuation during acute events [^6d6b39ac] [^83245834].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor heart rate, blood pressure, renal function, and clinical tolerance during therapy [^a7179fde].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Recommended dose** | **Titration** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Carvedilol | 6.25 mg once daily for 1 week, then 12.5 mg once daily | Increase to 12.5 mg after 1 week if tolerated | Heart rate, blood pressure, tolerance |
| Propranolol | 40 mg twice daily | Titrate to HR 50–55 bpm or max 320 mg/day | Heart rate, blood pressure, tolerance |
| Nadolol | 40 mg once daily | Titrate to HR 50–55 bpm or max 240 mg/day | Heart rate, blood pressure, tolerance |
| EVL | Every 2–4 weeks until eradication | Repeat until eradication | Surveillance endoscopy |

---

Carvedilol 12.5 mg once daily is the **preferred first-line therapy** for primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, with propranolol or nadolol as alternatives. EVL is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers, and combination therapy is not recommended.

Discussion

Both EVL and BBs are effective in the primary prevention of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, and guidelines recommend the use of either of these therapies to prevent hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis with medium/large-sized varices. In this study, 39% of the physicians surveyed chose both BBs and EVL as their preferred choice for prevention of first variceal hemorrhage for a 60-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Thus it appears that combination therapy may be commonly used in clinical practice despite practice guidelines recommending the use of either, but not both options, for primary prophylaxis.

Preference for using both options may be based on data demonstrating that combined therapy is superior to either monotherapy for prevention of recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices. While combination therapy is recommended for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (where the risk of rebleeding is in the order of 60% in one year), a more conservative approach is recommended for primary prophylaxis (where the risk of hemorrhage is ~15% in one year). Failure to adhere to guideline recommendations, however, is well recognized across specialties, and may be due to multiple factors including the level of the guidelines trustworthiness, the perceived relevance of the guideline recommendations to the individual patient, and the strength of the evidence underlying each recommendation.

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^e896b4d2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal varices are a common complication of portal hypertension, developing in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis. The risk of bleeding in patients with moderate to large varices (where moderate refers to varices elevated above the mucosal surface but occupying less than one-third of the esophageal lumen and large occupy more than one-third of the esophageal lumen) is up to 15% per year and variceal hemorrhage is associated with a mortality rate of 20% at six weeks. Given the high prevalence of gastroesophageal varices among patients with cirrhosis, and the high risk of mortality associated with bleeding, screening for varices and use of prophylactic therapies to prevent a first variceal hemorrhage are critical components of care.

Two treatment options have been proven to be effective in preventing first variceal bleed in patients with cirrhosis and moderate to large gastroesophageal varices: non-selective beta-blockers (BBs) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Meta-analyses show that, compared to no treatment or placebo, both options reduce the risk of first variceal hemorrhage and improve survival in patients with medium/large varices. BBs, have the added benefit of potentially decreasing other complications of portal hypertension (such as ascites), but they have disadvantages including the need for daily medication and adverse events such as fatigue, dizziness and impotence. EVL has the added benefit of visually confirming variceal eradication, but requires conscious sedation, periodic endoscopic surveillance, and is associated with a risk of dysphagia and bleeding ulcers. Combination therapy with both BBs and EVL has not been shown to improve outcomes. Thus, evidence-based guidelines recommend that patients with moderate to large gastroesophageal varices be treated with either BBs or EVL (but not both) to prevent an initial hemorrhage.

Editorials and a previous pilot study demonstrate variability in physician preferences for EVL versus BBs. The reasons underlying this variability, however, have not been studied. The objectives of this study were to examine whether gastroenterologists can be classified into at least two distinct subgroups based on how they prioritize the specific attributes related to BBs and EVL and whether physician characteristics are associated with group membership and treatment preference.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^9c9ac334]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in almost half of patients with cirrhosis at the time of initial diagnosis. Variceal bleeding occurs in 25% to 35% of patients with cirrhosis. Effective and timely care can prevent variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis). For example, clinical studies demonstrate that both beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation are effective in preventing a first episode of variceal bleeding. The major challenge is to screen patients in a timely manner and institute a form of therapy that has the highest chance of success in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^ecd88229]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

### Challenges in the management of esophagogastric varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis – A narrative review [^79041189]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advancements in pharmacological, endoscopic, and radiographic treatments have emerged in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices or variceal hemorrhage. These advances have been in several areas, including the role of screening and primary prophylaxis (preventing an initial variceal bleed), evaluation and management of acute esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, and in preventing variceal rebleeding. Therefore, we believe there is a need for an updated, evidence-based "narrative review" on this important clinical topic that will be relevant for internists, hospitalists, intensive care unit physicians, and those in training. We believe the guidance presented in this narrative review will enhance daily medical practice of health care professionals and has the potential to improve quality of care for these complex patients.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in children with portal hypertension: a framework for future research [^6ca75e8b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Nonselective β-blocker therapy and endoscopic variceal ligation reduce the incidence of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic adults, but their use in children is controversial. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the prophylactic management of children at risk of variceal hemorrhage due to the lack of appropriate randomized controlled trials. In a recent gathering of experts at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting, significant challenges were identified in attempting to design and implement a clinical trial of primary prophylaxis in children using either of these therapies. These challenges render such a trial unfeasible, primarily due to the large sample size required, inadequate knowledge of appropriate dosing of β-blockers, and difficulty in recruiting to a trial of endoscopic variceal ligation. Pediatric research should focus on addressing questions of natural history and diagnosis of varices, prediction of variceal bleeding, optimal approaches to β-blocker and ligation therapy, and alternative study designs to explore therapeutic efficacy in children.

### Ligation or propranolol for esophageal varices?… [^5fbd622d]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Eligible patients included those with portal hypertension and grade 3 or grade 4 varices diagnosed by endoscopy. None of the patients had a prior history of variceal bleeding. After application of exclusion criteria, patients were randomly assigned at the time of the first endoscopic examination to undergo ligation or receive propranolol. Baseline electrocardiography and cardiac evaluation were performed after 15 minutes of rest. Propranolol was administered in a dose of 40 mg, with monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure 12 hours and 24 hours after dosing. The dosage of the beta blocker was increased in increments of 20 to 40 mg per day until a 25 percent decrease in baseline heart rate was attained. Treatment was stopped if the heart rate dropped below 55 beats per minute or if the systolic blood pressure was less than 80 mm Hg.

Patients assigned to the ligation group underwent ligation at the first endoscopy session or within 24 hours, with as many bands as possible placed in the distal 5 to 7 cm of all variceal columns. Ninety patients were enrolled in the study, with 46 assigned to receive ligation and 44 to propranolol therapy. The mean dose of propranolol was 70 mg per day. In patients receiving ligation, the mean number of endoscopy sessions was 3. 2, which were performed over an average of
4. 1 weeks. During the study period, four patients in the ligation group and 12 patients in the medication group experienced variceal bleeding. In three of the four patients from the ligation group, the bleeding occurred within the first six weeks, before all of the varices could be eradicated. After 18 months of follow-up, the cumulative risk of bleeding was 43 percent in the propanolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group.

The authors conclude that in patients with significant grade 3 or grade 4 esophageal varices, rubber band ligation is superior to propranolol therapy in preventing primary bleeding. They suggest further study to evaluate the combination of these two therapies in hopes of achieving even better results.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b92cb0b1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, carvedilol is a safe and efficacious treatment option for the primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In addition, it may also delay variceal progression. However, our confidence in these conclusions is very low, given the imprecision, heterogeneity and potential risk of bias of the available evidence. This underlines the need for adequately powered, high-quality clinical trials.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Carvedilol is a guideline-recommended treatment option for the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding
Carvedilol's efficacy in the context of secondary prevention of variceal bleeding is under consideration
Randomized controlled trials present data regarding its efficacy and safety

What the new findings are:

Carvedilol is equally efficacious to endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), for both primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence indicates that carvedilol reduces all-cause mortality compared to EVL in patients with a previous history of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence suggests that carvedilol is as efficacious as propranolol for the prevention of variceal rebleeding after variceal eradication

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of variceal hemorrhage, primary prevention, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate nonselective β-blockers or perform variceal band ligation for primary prophylaxis. Consider initiating pharmacotherapy with propranolol (40 mg BID, titrate dose to the maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg) as first-line primary prophylaxis. Offer variceal band ligation if nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Take into account patient choice when deciding between variceal band ligation and nonselective β-blockers.

### Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^a36f75a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. Forty-six trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The follow-up ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), beta-blockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the follow-up period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very low-certainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on low-certainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. Beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed.

Summary of all recommendations

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 2)
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB) or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of < 50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by the clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate nonselective β-blockers or perform variceal band ligation for primary prophylaxis. Consider initiating pharmacotherapy with propranolol (40 mg BID, titrate dose to the maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg) as first-line primary prophylaxis. Offer variceal band ligation if nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Take into account patient choice when deciding between variceal band ligation and nonselective β-blockers.

### Carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective β-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices [^0d4dc26a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Non-selective beta-blockers are recommended for the prevention of bleeding in people with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional intrinsic alpha 1 -blocking effects, which may be superior to traditional, non-selective beta-blockers in reducing portal pressure and, therefore, in reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of carvedilol compared with traditional, non-selective beta-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices.

Search Methods

We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 08 May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, irrespective of publication status, blinding, or language. We included trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and verified gastroesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (AZ, RJ and LH), independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I² values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains and the quality of the evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

Eleven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One trial did not report clinical outcomes. We included the remaining 10 randomised clinical trials, involving 810 participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices, in our analyses. The intervention comparisons were carvedilol versus propranolol (nine trials), or nadolol (one trial). Six trials were of short duration (mean 6 (range 1 to 12) weeks), while four were of longer duration (13.5 (6 to 30) months). Three trials evaluated primary prevention; three evaluated secondary prevention; while four evaluated both primary and secondary prevention. We classified all trials as at 'high risk of bias'. We gathered mortality data from seven trials involving 507 participants; no events occurred in four of these. Sixteen of 254 participants receiving carvedilol and 19 of 253 participants receiving propranolol or nadolol died (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.53; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be no differences between carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers and the risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.37; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 45%, very low-quality evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 14%, low-quality evidence). Significantly more deaths, episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events occurred in the long-term trials but there was not enough information to determine whether there were differences between carvedilol and traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, by trial duration. There was also insufficient information to detect differences in the effects of these interventions in trials evaluating primary or secondary prevention. There appeared to be no differences in the risk of non-serious adverse events between carvedilol versus its comparators (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.29; 596 participants; 6 trials; I² = 88%; very low-quality evidence). Use of carvedilol was associated with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than traditional, non-selective beta-blockers both in absolute (MD -1.75 mmHg, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.89; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) and percentage terms (MD -8.02%, 95% CI -11.49% to -4.55%; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). However, we did not observe a concomitant reduction in the number of participants who failed to achieve a sufficient haemodynamic response (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 42%; very low-quality evidence) or in clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no clear beneficial or harmful effects of carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers on mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, serious or non-serious adverse events despite the fact that carvedilol was more effective at reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality, and hence the findings are uncertain. Additional evidence is required from adequately powered, long-term, double-blind, randomised clinical trials, which evaluate both clinical and haemodynamic outcomes.

### Preventing the development of varices in cirrhosis [^61d3caf1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are a direct consequence of portal hypertension. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and are effective in preventing variceal hemorrhage. However, a large multicenter placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are not effective in preventing the development of varices and are associated with a significant rate of adverse events. This therapy is, therefore, not recommended in compensated cirrhotic patients without varices at large. In this very compensated group of patients with cirrhosis (stage 1, ie, without varices and without ascites or encephalopathy) the predictive value (both for the development of varices and for the development of clinical decompensation) of a baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg is confirmed, supporting this threshold level as one that defines a clinically significant portal hypertension. Importantly, reductions in hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10% are associated with a significant reduction in the development of varices, a therapeutic goal that could be achieved through the use of beta-blockers or other drugs being developed for the treatment of portal hypertension.

### Propranolol for the prevention of first esophageal variceal hemorrhage: a lifetime commitment? [^9d0d2304]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although beta blockers have had significant impact in the treatment of portal hypertension, the question of how long they should be continued for prevention of variceal hemorrhage remains unknown. Prospective studies on beta blockers to prevent variceal hemorrhage lack long-term follow-up, and indefinite administration of beta blockers for primary prevention of variceal bleeding has become standard practice. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients in whom beta blocker therapy was discontinued. Patients completing a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage were tapered off of propranolol and placebo and followed prospectively for subsequent events. Of the 49 patients in the follow-up study (25 former propranolol, 24 former placebo), 9 experienced variceal hemorrhage (6 former propranolol, 3 former placebo). Following withdrawal of propranolol, the freedom from variceal bleeding was not significantly different between these 2 groups of patients, suggesting that the protective effect of propranolol against variceal hemorrhage, noted previously, was no longer present. Seventeen patients died (12 former propranolol, 5 former placebo) during the follow-up study. Cumulative survival was longer in the placebo group. These trends for EVH and survival were opposite to those observed in the original study population while patients were taking medication. When propranolol is withdrawn, the risk of variceal hemorrhage returns to what would be expected in an untreated population. Patients who discontinue beta blockers experience increased mortality compared with an untreated population. These observations support the current practice of indefinite prophylactic therapy.

Primary prophylaxis

Since 30–50% of patients with portal hypertension will bleed from varices and about 20% will die from the effects of the first bleed, it seems rational to develop prophylactic regimens to prevent the development of, and bleeding from, these varices. However, most of the published trials do not have sufficient power to identify favourable treatment effects. Based on the expected bleeding and death rates in the control group, the minimum number of patients needed to detect a 50% reduction in bleeding would be 270, and 850 patients in each arm to detect the same reduction in mortality. A proposed algorithm for surveillance and prophylaxis of varices is shown in figure 2. At this time there is insufficient evidence to support treating patients without varices or 'pre-primary prophylaxis'. A large randomised placebo-controlled trial of timolol in patients without varices and portal hypertension defined as HVPG > 6 mm Hg did not show any effect on the development of varices or variceal bleeding. The role of drug treatment in preventing bleeding in patients with small varices is unclear. Three randomised placebo-controlled trials have studied this. Cales et al showed that propranolol in patients with small, or no, varices resulted in greater development of varices. However, patients without varices were included and there was significant loss of patients to follow-up. The second trial showed that nadolol reduced variceal bleeding without survival benefit and increased adverse events. Sarin et al did not show any effect with propranolol, despite a significant effect on portal pressure.

### Primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding: β-blockers, endoscopic ligation, or both? [^b922fac9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the complications of cirrhosis that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. It is recommended that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for gastroesophageal varices and those with large varices should be offered primary prophylaxis. Nonselective beta-blockers (nadolol or propranolol) are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis but there are a number of limitations to their use. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of variceal band ligation (VBL) in providing primary prophylaxis, either in comparison to no treatment or to beta-blockers. VBL is very effective in preventing the initial bleed when compared to no treatment, but it is not superior to beta-blockers. In this issue of the journal the effect of beta-blockers on bleeding in patients undergoing VBL is examined and no benefit compared to VBL alone is shown. Thus, patients with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers and VBL should be offered to those cirrhotics who are unable to take beta-blockers. Further study is required to determine if VBL in combination with beta-blockers is more effective than the beta-blockers alone.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^75f516e6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis

Guidance Statement 1. Terlipressin is recommended for the treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is one of serious complications of liver cirrhosis, and gastroesophageal varices are the most common source of gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. Terlipressin has been recommended as the first-line treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. – In 1990, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for the first time explored the role of terlipressin for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Sixty patients were assigned to terlipressin (n = 29) and placebo (n = 31) groups. The rate of control bleeding was significantly higher in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving placebo (90% versus 59%, p < 0.01). Since then, several studies have also confirmed the efficacy of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding. Recently, a meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 3344 cases compared the efficacy and safety of terlipressin versus placebo, pituitrin, somatostatin, octreotide, endoscopic therapy, or balloon tamponade for the management of acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Patients receiving terlipressin had a significantly higher rate of control bleeding and a lower mortality than those receiving placebo, but were not significantly different from those receiving pituitrin, somatostatin, or octreotide. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving pituitrin [odds ratio (OR) R = 0.15, p = 0.02], but higher than those receiving somatostatin (OR = 2.44, p = 0.04). Terlipressin alone had significantly higher 5-day treatment failure than endoscopic variceal ligation plus terlipressin (OR = 14.46, p = 0.01). Terlipressin group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than balloon tamponade group (OR = 0.05, p < 0.01). In addition, terlipressin in combination with octreotide or somatostatin did not further reduce portal pressure. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that the dosage of terlipressin is 2 mg/4 h by intravenous boluses for 2–5 days. Notably, recent evidence suggested that continuous infusion of terlipressin could reduce portal pressure stably and increase treatment success rate. Considering the use of terlipressin in our clinical practice, we recommend that the initial dosage of terlipressin is 1–2 mg/4 h by slowly intravenous boluses (> 1 min) or continuously intravenous infusion and that the maintenance dosage is 1–2 mg/6 h by continuously intravenous infusion. Generally, the maximum daily dosage is 120–150 μg/kg, and its duration is 3–5 days. Certainly, the dosage and duration of terlipressin can be adjusted according to the severity of variceal bleeding and patients' conditions.

Sclerotherapy

Nineteen trials have compared endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with no treatment. Owing to the marked heterogeneity between these studies a meta-analysis is clinically inappropriate. Sclerotherapy does not offer any benefit in combination with NSBB or VBL compared with VBL or NSBB alone, and increases iatrogenic complications such as strictures. At this time sclerotherapy cannot be recommended for prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis.

Recommendations: primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 2)
What is the best method for primary prophylaxis? We recommend NSBB or variceal band ligation (VBL). We suggest pharmacological treatment with propranolol as first line. VBL is offered if there are contraindications to NSBB. The choice of VBL or NSBB should also take into account patient choice (level 1a, grade A). We suggest carvedilol or nadolol as alternatives to propranolol (level 1b, grade A). Dose: Propranolol: 40 mg twice daily. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once heart rate (HR) of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg (level 1a, grade A). Nadolol: 40 mg daily dose. Dose titrated to maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached a maximum dose of 240 mg (level 1a, grade A). Carvedilol: 6.25 mg once daily to increase to maintenance of 12.5 mg after a week if tolerated or once HR of < 50–55 bpm is reached (level 1a, grade A). It is suggested that NSBB are discontinued at the time of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, renal impairment and hypotension (level 2b, grade B). In cases of contraindications or intolerance to NSBB, we recommend variceal band ligation (level 1a, grade A).
Who should have surveillance for variceal bleeding? We recommend all patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at the time of diagnosis (level 1a, grade A). There is no indication to repeat endoscopy in patients receiving NSBB.
How often should cirrhotic patients be endoscoped? If at the time of first endoscopy no varices are seen, we suggest that patients with cirrhosis should be endoscoped at 2–3-year intervals (level 2a, grade B). If grade I varices are diagnosed, we suggest that patients should be endoscoped at yearly intervals (level 2a, grade B). If there is clear evidence of disease progression we suggest that the intervals can be modified by a clinician. Endoscopy should also be offered at time of decompensation (level 2a, grade B).
Which patients with cirrhosis should have primary prophylaxis? If grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices are diagnosed, we recommend that patients have primary prophylaxis irrespective of the severity of the liver disease (level 1a, grade A).
Treatments not recommended: Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B). Isosorbide mononitrate monotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1b, grade A). There is insufficient evidence to recommend isosorbide mononitrate in combination with NSBB (level 1b, grade A). Shunt surgery or TIPSS is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A). Sclerotherapy is not recommended as primary prophylaxis (level 1a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of NSBB in patients without varices, with focus on carvedilol. Role of NSBB in patients with small varices, with focus on carvedilol. Comparison of carvedilol versus propranolol in primary prophylaxis. Identification of, and trials assessing, new drugs for primary prophylaxis such as statins.
Quality indicator: Percentage of patients at diagnosis of cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy to screen for varices (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have had an endoscopy either before or after diagnosis within 6 months. Denominator; patients newly diagnosed with cirrhosis. Percentage of patients receiving primary prophylaxis among those newly diagnosed with grade I varices and red signs or grade 2–3 varices. Numerator; patients who have grade 1 varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices receiving primary prophylaxis. Denominator; patients diagnosed with cirrhosis who have grade I varices with red signs or grade 2–3 varices.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^b192527d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

Prevention of recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage — dosing, targets, and follow-up: Propranolol is given as 20–40 mg orally twice a day with adjustment every 2–3 days until the goal is achieved; maximal daily dose is 320 mg/day in patients without ascites and 160 mg/day in patients with ascites, with therapy goals of resting heart rate of 55–60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure should not decrease < 90 mm Hg, and maintenance to verify at every outpatient visit that heart rate is on target and to continue indefinitely. Nadolol is given as 20–40 mg orally once a day with adjustment every 2–3 days until the goal is achieved; maximal daily dose is 160 mg/day in patients without ascites and 80 mg/day in patients with ascites, with the same therapy goals and maintenance. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is performed every 1–4 weeks until eradication, with the goal of variceal eradication (no further ligation possible) and follow-up with first EGD performed 3–6 months after eradication and every 6–12 months thereafter; the combination of either propranolol or nadolol plus EVL is recommended, and carvedilol is not recommended in this setting.

### Preventing first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis [^ee379b9f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is still a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension responsible for an appreciable rate of morbidity and mortality. The most appropriate treatment approach, whether drugs (nonselective beta-blockers) or endoscopic (variceal band ligation) therapy, to prevent the initial bleed, or primary prophylaxis, is an issue of controversy. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that banding seems to be somehow slightly more effective than beta-blockers at preventing a first bleeding episode, but this does not translate to improved survival. The firmness of this conclusion is, in addition, diminished by the small sample size and short follow-up of most studies. Moreover, adverse events due to banding are more severe than those associated with beta-blockers. Thus, beta-blockers remain as first-line therapy in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers can be considered in patients with small varices, especially in those with red signs or Child class C liver disease. The available evidence does not support the idea that organic nitrates improve the efficacy of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis. The method used to establish the dose of beta-blockers and check its effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) has also been disputed. An attractive strategy is to measure the HVPG response to beta-blockers as a guide to primary prophylaxis, with the aim of switching to another therapy, that is, band ligation, in HVPG nonresponders. However, no study has yet demonstrated that banding as rescue therapy in nonresponders lowers the risk of first bleeding and improves survival.

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^5f03cf1e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we found that most of the physicians in this study (the majority of whom performed endoscopies and had practices with a small number (< 25%) of liver patients) preferred to a strategy including EVL to prevent first variceal bleed in patients with cirrhosis. This may be due to the strong appeal of being able to visualize eradication of varices. Further research is needed to better understand and confirm this practice pattern and to develop interventions to improve adherence to guidelines.

Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is a lethal complication of portal hypertension and should be suspected in every patient with liver cirrhosis who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleed. AVH-related mortality has decreased in the last few decades from 40% to 15%-20% due to advances in the general and specific management of variceal hemorrhage. This review summarizes current management of AVH and prevention of recurrent hemorrhage with a focus on pharmacologic therapy.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^70aaee47]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

AASLD practice guidance — nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and screening in decompensated cirrhosis — Patients with decompensated cirrhosis not taking NSBBs who have never bled from varices should undergo annual endoscopic screening. If high-risk varices are detected, NSBBs or endoscopic band ligation are recommended; preference is given to NSBBs (including carvedilol) because of benefits beyond prevention of variceal hemorrhage. NSBBs should be dose reduced or discontinued in patients who develop persistently low systolic arterial pressure < 90 mm Hg or severe adverse effects, and NSBB discontinuation should prompt endoscopic evaluation for presence of high-risk varices requiring band ligation.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7282ccbc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our analyses support the Baveno VI consensus guidelines for portal hypertension, in which carvedilol is considered to be a valid first-line treatment in patients with medium or large size varices and no previous history of variceal bleeding. On the other hand, existing guidelines do not support the use of carvedilol for secondary prophylaxis, given the lack of evidence comparing carvedilol to standard of care. However, we identified 2 small trials in which carvedilol was found to be as efficacious as propranolol in preventing rebleeding after variceal eradication with EVL. In addition, our review showed that carvedilol improves survival compared with EVL, even though they have a similar effect on the risk of rebleeding. This indicates that carvedilol might have a beneficial impact, not only via a reduction in portal hypertension, but also through other protective properties of NSBBs, such as reduction in bacterial translocation and bacterial infections. Although our findings indicate that carvedilol is equally efficacious to EVL or propranolol for the prevention of variceal rebleeding, the small number of participants included in these analyses undermines the certainty of our results. Overall, our evidence supports the use of carvedilol in combination with EVL for secondary prevention. However, the limitations of the available trials (small sample size, short duration of follow up, and unclear risk-of-bias estimation) underline the need for high-quality trials to confirm these initial findings. In the absence of adequate direct evidence, a network meta-analysis evaluating the different therapeutic options of patients on prophylaxis for variceal bleeding could provide a better and more precise insight into this area.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^07f406a1]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication.

### Beta blocker prophylaxis for patients with variceal hemorrhage [^6064da41]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Goals

To characterize beta blocker therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of variceal hemorrhage.

Background

Variceal hemorrhage is one of the more frequent and severe complications of portal hypertension due to liver disease. Beta blocker therapy has been demonstrated to decrease risk of first bleed in patients with evidence of varices and recurrent bleeding and mortality in patients with history of prior variceal hemorrhage.

Study

A total of 106 patients with liver disease hospitalized with suspected variceal hemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Half of patients had known varices, 44 (41.5%) of whom had experienced prior variceal hemorrhage. Only 21 (20%) were receiving beta blocker therapy at admission and 41 (48%) at discharge. The majority were not receiving therapy for primary prophylaxis (94%). Specific characteristics associated with beta blocker use could not be identified, although more patients with history of greater than two variceal hemorrhages were receiving beta blocker at admission (73% vs. 41%, P = 0.04)

Conclusions

This study suggests that liver disease patients with varices are often not receiving beta blocker therapy to reduce risk of first or subsequent variceal hemorrhage. Opportunity exists to optimize use of this proven prophylactic treatment and bridge an apparent gap in standard of care.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^e6da1aaf]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — statins and other investigational agents for portal hypertension: Phase II studies have shown significant effects on HVPG reduction and a single double-anonymized RCT demonstrated improved survival with the addition of simvastatin to standard secondary prophylaxis after acute variceal bleeding. For decompensated cirrhosis, simvastatin should not be used at doses greater than 20 mg/day, and for atorvastatin it may be prudent to use low doses (10–20 mg) pending additional data. Presently, at least four prospective RCTs are testing physiological or clinical endpoints with statins in CTP A or B cirrhosis.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^8b5ad6dd]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) portal hypertension — variceal prophylaxis and hemorrhage management is as follows: The CFF cannot recommend for or against primary variceal prophylaxis for children with CF and advanced liver disease with portal hypertension and varices due to insufficient evidence. The CFF recommends that for children with CF and advanced liver disease with portal hypertension, varices, and prior variceal hemorrhage, current guidelines for secondary prophylaxis be followed in consultation with a pulmonologist and anesthesiologist with expertise in CF, and The CFF recommends that adults with CF and advanced liver disease and portal hypertension (with or without prior variceal hemorrhage) should undergo primary or secondary prophylaxis according to current guidelines in consultation with a pulmonologist and anesthesiologist with expertise in CF. Existing literature in non-CF liver disease supports EVL, sclerotherapy, and nonselective beta-blockers for adult prophylaxis and hemorrhage management, but there is a notable lack of data in both adults and children with aCFLD; the preferred intervention is EGD with EVL or injection sclerotherapy if limitations require it, EVL and sclerotherapy are preferred methods for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage and the prevention of rebleeding, and there are no data on the safety and efficacy of the use of nonselective beta-blockers in children.

### Beta-blockers to prevent gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis [^8bcc5a82]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and prevent variceal hemorrhage. Their effectiveness in preventing varices is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned 213 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (minimal hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] of 6 mm Hg) to receive timolol, a nonselective beta-blocker (108 patients), or placebo (105 patients). The primary end point was the development of gastroesophageal varices or variceal hemorrhage. Endoscopy and HVPG measurements were repeated yearly.

Results

During a median follow-up of 54.9 months, the rate of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the timolol group and the placebo group (39 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P = 0.89), nor were there significant differences in the rates of ascites, encephalopathy, liver transplantation, or death. Serious adverse events were more common among patients in the timolol group than among those in the placebo group (18 percent vs. 6 percent, P = 0.006). Varices developed less frequently among patients with a baseline HVPG of less than 10 mm Hg and among those in whom the HVPG decreased by more than 10 percent at one year and more frequently among those in whom the HVPG increased by more than 10 percent at one year.

Conclusions

Nonselective beta-blockers are ineffective in preventing varices in unselected patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension and are associated with an increased number of adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00006398.)

### Preventing initial bleeding in cirrhosis-induced varices… [^0f1d451b]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Esophagogastric varices accompanying cirrhosis are a significant cause of hemorrhagic morbidity and mortality. Primary prophylaxis of the initial bleeding episode would reduce the inpatient mortality rate. Nonselective beta blockers and isosorbide-5-mononitrate have been used to reduce bleeding episodes. Because pharmacotherapy does not significantly lower portal pressure and because of medication contraindications and adverse effects, many patients who might benefit cannot use these medications. Variceal band ligation has been used effectively during the acute bleed or to prevent rebleeding. Lui and associates used a prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare VBL with propranolol and ISMN therapy to prevent initial episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding.

Researchers randomized 172 participants to repeated VBL via endoscopy until the varices disappeared, incremental twice-daily dosing of PPL, or incremental twice-daily dosing of ISMN. Patients who did not tolerate ISMN were offered PPL. Patients who could not take PPL did not receive additional treatment. The primary end point was esophageal variceal bleeding. VBL eradicated esophageal varices in 82 percent of the treated group. The most serious adverse event was perforation of a patient's upper esophagus. The mean dosage of PPL in the second group was 113. 5 mg per day. Patients randomized to receive ISMN took a mean dosage of 55. 1 mg per day. Among participants in both medically treated groups, there was no significant blood pressure drop. More than 40 percent of patients reported side effects, that prompted high drop-out rates. Variceal bleeding occurred in 6.

8 percent of patients who received VBL, in
13. 8 percent of patients who took PPL, and in 22. 6 percent of patients who took ISMN. The authors conclude that VBL is as effective as PPL and more effective than ISMN in decreasing the rate of first cirrhosis-induced variceal bleeding among persons with more than just minimal esophageal varices. Side effects are more common among patients receiving medical therapy, which may limit regularity of treatment. Although combinations of beta blockers and ISMN have been shown to be more effective than either medication alone in preventing first bleeds, this study did not look at the efficacy of combination therapy.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis [^10755e9d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the result of portal hypertension, which is a major complication of liver cirrhosis and carries a high mortality rate. Because of the mortality associated with variceal bleeding, strategies for prevention of the first bleed is important. Risk stratification is important in determining those at risk of bleeding from varices and current data suggest that patients with large varices with red signs, severe underlying liver disease and those who have a hepatic venous pressure gradient of greater than 12 mmHg are at high risk of bleeding. Surveillance for varices in patients with cirrhosis is therefore important. The current review evaluates the role of various treatments in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The current first choice treatment is non-selective beta-blockers; which is cheap, easy to administer, and reduces the risk of first variceal haemorrhage significantly. Combination of beta-blockers and nitrates looks promising but needs further evaluation. Endoscopic variceal band ligation compares favourably with non-selective beta-blockers in preventing the first bleeding episode in cirrhotic patients and may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to beta-blockers. The role of monitoring the hepatic venous pressure gradient in those being treated with pharmacological agents, the role of newer drugs such as non-selective beta-blockers with intrinsic alpha-adrenergic activity and angiotensin receptor blockers require further evaluation.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^ed83b154]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertension and varices in cystic fibrosis–associated liver disease: The CFF cannot recommend for or against the use of nonselective beta-blocker treatment for the prevention or treatment of variceal bleeding in PwCF and advanced liver disease with portal hypertension due to insufficient evidence, whereas in adults with portal hypertension and gastro-esophageal varices, nonselective beta-blocker treatment is recommended for both primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding; randomized clinical trials for primary prophylaxis are lacking for children with chronic liver disease and in children or adults with aCFLD, and although nonselective beta-blockers may have potential adverse pulmonary effects, no studies assessing the worsening of CF lung disease were identified.

### Stratifying risk in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage: results of an individual patient meta-analysis [^ece93177]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Endoscopic variceal ligation plus beta-blockers (EVL+BB) is currently recommended for variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, a recommendation that extends to all patients with cirrhosis with previous variceal bleeding irrespective of prognostic stage. Individualizing patient care is relevant, and in published studies on variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, there is a lack of information regarding response to therapy by prognostic stage. This study aimed at comparing EVL plus BB with monotherapy (EVL or BB) on all-source rebleeding and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding stratified by cirrhosis severity (Child A versus B/C) by means of individual time-to-event patient data meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials. The study used individual data on 389 patients from three trials comparing EVL plus BB versus BB and 416 patients from four trials comparing EVL plus BB versus EVL. Compared with BB alone, EVL plus BB reduced overall rebleeding in Child A (incidence rate ratio 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.89; P = 0.025) but not in Child B/C, without differences in mortality. The effect of EVL on rebleeding was different according to Child (P for interaction < 0.001). Conversely, compared with EVL, EVL plus BB reduced rebleeding in both Child A and B/C, with a significant reduction in mortality in Child B/C (incidence rate ratio 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.85; P = 0.013).

Conclusion

Outcomes of therapies to prevent variceal rebleeding differ depending on cirrhosis severity: in patients with preserved liver function (Child A), combination therapy is recommended because it is more effective in preventing rebleeding, without modifying survival, while in patients with advanced liver failure (Child B/C), EVL alone carries an increased risk of rebleeding and death compared with combination therapy, underlining that BB is the key element of combination therapy.

### Dose-dependent effect of propranolol on the hemodynamic response in cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices [^3d8cde9d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Portal hypertension that resulted from liver cirrhosis often leads to gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. This is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For years, nonselective β-blockers (NSBBs) have been the drug of choice for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. The efficacy mainly depends on the decrease in portal vein pressure, which varies widely from patient to patient. According to a number of previous studies and practical guidelines, hemodynamic response to NSBBs has been used to evaluate the changes in portal vein pressure, which is defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) reduction of at least 20% or to less than 12 mmHg–. However, many patients do not achieve the hemodynamic response to propranolol.

Propranolol is one of the most widely used NSBBs. In most published studies, the dose of propranolol was titrated to reduce the heart rate by 25% from baseline as HVPG measurement was not widely available. However, it has been proved that the reduction in heart rate does not correlate with reduction in HVPG; therefore, the target dose of propranolol is always adjusted to the maximal tolerated dose. This usually means that the dose is increased stepwise to 320 mg/day until the heart rate has decreased by 25% or below 55 bpm or the systolic blood pressure is below 90 mm Hg. A newly updated guideline also showed that the therapeutic goals are a heart rate of 55–60 bpm and a systolic blood pressure not below 90 mmHg.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^0e04c6c4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, in the recent Baveno portal hypertension consensus conference, the recommendation was to consider the use of NSBB in patients with compensated cirrhosis and evidence of CSPH with the purpose of preventing cirrhosis decompensation (i.e. not only VH but also ascites). This paradigm shift was mostly based on the results of the PREDESCI trial, a multicenter randomized trial studying the effect of NSBB in preventing decompensation of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. In the study, 201 patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with none or small varices, were randomized to NSBB (propranolol 40–160 mg twice a day or carvedilol 6.25–25 mg daily) versus placebo. The results showed that the primary outcome, which was any decompensation (ascites, VH, hepatic encephalopathy) or death, was significantly lower in the NSBB group compared with the placebo group (17% versus 27%, HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.97). The difference was mostly driven by ascites, which is usually the first and most common decompensation to occur. Progression to large varices (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.30–1.21) was also lower in the NSBB group. In addition, carvedilol seemed to outperform propranolol with lower rates of ascites, death, and greater reduction in HVPG. The new paradigm would aim at using NSBB to prevent any decompensation rather than only VH and therefore patients who would benefit from carvedilol would be not only those with high-risk varices but also those with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH, which are at the highest risk of developing any decompensation.

In compensated patients who cannot receive NSBB, EGD should be performed and, in the presence of high-risk varices, EVL would be performed to prevent variceal hemorrhage (Figure 2).

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^bebe8eb5]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal hemorrhage in cACLD: Patients who have decompensated cirrhosis by definition have CSPH, and patients with high-risk varices (moderate/large varices or any size varices with red wale marks or in a patient with CTP C) should undergo primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding; if the high-risk varices are small, the only method that is technically feasible is the administration of nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB), whereas if the high-risk varices are large, both NSBB as well as EVL are possible approaches; a recent systematic review with network meta-analysis showed a lower risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and a trend for mortality reduction, and administration of carvedilol in patients with high-risk varices and ascites has been associated to improved survival in a prospective study (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19–0.96) and a retrospective study (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.81).
