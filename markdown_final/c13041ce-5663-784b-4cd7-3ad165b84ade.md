## Question

does age cause leukopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether age causes leukopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of leukopenia and its subtypes. Then, I should verify what large, population-based cohorts say about age trends in total leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Next, I will examine mechanistic explanations for any age-related shifts, including myeloid skewing and lymphopoiesis decline. After that, I need to check for confounders that could masquerade as age effects, such as medications, comorbidities, and clonal hematopoiesis. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and outline when age-related cytopenias warrant further evaluation versus observation.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misinterpret the question. Leukopenia is typically defined as a white blood cell count less than 4,000 cells per microliter, and it encompasses neutropenia, lymphopenia, or combined cytopenias, so I need to keep these subsets in mind as I evaluate age effects [^5f37b297].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality population data. The Lifelines cohort of 167,729 community-dwelling individuals found that anemia and thrombocytopenia increased with age, but neutropenia did not increase with age, which argues against a general age-related decline in total leukocytes or neutrophils in healthy older adults [^060c8803]. Wait, let me verify the directionality of neutrophil changes with age; multiple large studies show aging is associated with higher neutrophil and monocyte counts and lower lymphocyte counts, indicating a myeloid-biased shift rather than leukopenia per se [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d] [^214de07a].

> I will now examine lymphocyte dynamics, because that's where age-related declines are most consistent. Large cohorts and reviews show that absolute lymphocyte counts decline with age, driven by thymic involution and impaired lymphopoiesis, which can manifest as relative or absolute lymphopenia in older adults, particularly in the context of stressors like infection or inflammation [^35aa55ca] [^4444f739] [^3fdee71f]. Hold on, I should verify clinical implications; lymphopenia is associated with higher mortality in population studies, reinforcing that it reflects immune vulnerability rather than a benign aging quirk [^4444f739] [^295baeab].

> Let me consider mechanisms so I don't jump to conclusions. Aging hematopoiesis exhibits a myeloid skew with increased neutrophil and monocyte output and decreased lymphocyte production, amplified by inflammaging and cardiometabolic comorbidity; clonal hematopoiesis may contribute to lineage biases but does not fully explain the myeloid shift seen with aging and comorbidity [^ac0617b8] [^3ab9c233] [^bc278f00]. I should double-check that these are human data; yes, these observations come from human cohorts and mechanistic reviews, not just animal models [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d].

> But wait, what if apparent "age-related leukopenia" is actually drug-induced or disease-related. I need to ensure I account for confounders: chemotherapy, antipsychotics, antiseizure medications, antivirals like ganciclovir, and immunosuppressants can all cause leukopenia, and older adults are more likely to be exposed to these agents or to have renal or hepatic impairment that amplifies toxicity, so medication review is essential before attributing cytopenias to age alone [^7dd75ff0] [^5bbdfdb2] [^8a8dd992] [^1efb3afa] [^75e4a55b]. I should also remember that infections, including COVID-19, commonly produce lymphopenia and occasionally leukopenia, which can confound age-effect interpretations in acute settings [^2862c85d] [^3fdee71f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benign ethnic neutropenia either. Population data show that Black individuals have lower mean neutrophil counts and higher prevalence of mild neutropenia, which can be mistaken for disease; this is a key reason why age-specific and ancestry-aware reference intervals matter when interpreting neutrophil counts in older adults [^049d871f]. I should confirm that this is considered in the differential so we don't overcall pathology in otherwise healthy older adults with stable, mild neutropenia.

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Age itself does not cause a generalized leukopenia; in fact, neutrophil and monocyte counts tend to rise with age, while lymphocyte counts decline, producing a myeloid-skewed profile rather than overall leukopenia. Therefore, isolated leukopenia in an older adult should prompt evaluation for secondary causes rather than being attributed to aging alone [^060c8803] [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d]. I should confirm the clinical corollary: when lymphopenia is present, especially if persistent or severe, it carries prognostic significance and warrants assessment for underlying disease, nutrition, or iatrogenic causes, even though it reflects age-related immune remodeling [^4444f739] [^3fdee71f].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical guidance is clear. In older adults with new leukopenia, I should review medications, assess for infection or inflammatory disease, evaluate renal and hepatic function, and consider hematologic etiologies such as MDS if cytopenias are persistent, progressive, or accompanied by macrocytosis or dysplasia; routine hematology referral is reasonable when neutropenia is severe or unexplained, whereas mild, stable lymphopenia may be observed with appropriate follow-up if no secondary cause is found [^bf1babca] [^29916fd9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all age-related lymphopenia is benign; that would be misleading, as lymphopenia is independently associated with worse outcomes, so even when no immediate cause is identified, it should flag increased risk and prompt closer surveillance and risk modification where feasible [^4444f739] [^295baeab].

Age does not directly cause leukopenia, but **older adults have a higher risk** of leukopenia due to age-related immune changes, comorbidities, and medications [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d]. The most consistent age-related change is a **decline in lymphocytes** (lymphopenia) [^35aa55ca], while neutrophil counts are generally preserved or slightly increased [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d]. Clinically significant leukopenia in older adults should prompt evaluation for drugs, infections, autoimmune disease, or hematologic malignancies, rather than attributing it to age alone [^29916fd9] [^bf1babca].

## Age-related changes in white blood cell counts

### Lymphocytes

- **Lymphopenia**: Aging is consistently associated with a decline in lymphocyte counts, particularly T cells, due to thymic involution and impaired lymphopoiesis [^35aa55ca] [^3fdee71f].
- **Clinical significance**: Lymphopenia is common in older adults and correlates with increased mortality and infection risk [^4444f739] [^295baeab].
- **Reference intervals**: Age-specific lymphocyte reference intervals are recommended to avoid overdiagnosis of lymphopenia in healthy elderly [^057eb2a0].

---

### Neutrophils

- **Neutrophil counts**: Neutrophil counts are generally preserved or slightly increased with age, reflecting a myeloid bias in hematopoiesis [^bc278f00] [^3e60270d].
- **Function**: Neutrophil function declines with age, increasing susceptibility to infection despite normal or near-normal counts [^183c6bde] [^79c3efa6].
- **Neutropenia**: Isolated neutropenia is not a typical age-related change and warrants evaluation for secondary causes [^060c8803].

## Factors contributing to leukopenia in older adults

Several factors contribute to **leukopenia in older adults**, including:

| **Factor** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Medications | Bone marrow suppression or immune-mediated destruction | - Chemotherapy <br/> - Immunosuppressants <br/> - Antipsychotics <br/> - Antibiotics (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) [^7dd75ff0] [^5bbdfdb2] [^b6bb310d] |
| Infections | Viral suppression of hematopoiesis or immune-mediated destruction | - HIV <br/> - COVID-19 <br/> - Hepatitis B/C [^7623cead] [^2862c85d] |
| Autoimmune diseases | Immune-mediated destruction or suppression | - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Felty syndrome [^notfound] |
| Hematologic malignancies | Bone marrow infiltration or suppression | - Leukemia <br/> - Lymphoma <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | Impaired hematopoiesis | - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency <br/> - Copper deficiency [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Increased infection risk**: Leukopenia, particularly neutropenia, increases infection risk in older adults, necessitating vigilance and prompt management [^b1096f51].
- **Evaluation**: Persistent or unexplained leukopenia should prompt evaluation for secondary causes, including medications, infections, autoimmune diseases, and hematologic malignancies [^29916fd9] [^bf1babca].
- **Management**: Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, with supportive care and growth factors considered in select cases [^b1096f51].

---

## Conclusion

Age itself does not directly cause leukopenia, but **older adults are more likely to develop leukopenia** due to age-related immune changes, comorbidities, and medications. Lymphopenia is the most consistent age-related change, whereas neutropenia is uncommon and warrants further evaluation. Clinicians should avoid attributing leukopenia to age alone and pursue appropriate diagnostic workup to identify and treat underlying causes.

### Anemia at older age: etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^698424be]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and is a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia at older age is increasing, and this is mainly attributable to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies. The etiology of anemia at older age is complex and ranges from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear-cut etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In others, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled, a condition termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance. Management of anemias at older age depends on (1) the severity of the anemia, (2) underlying condition(s), and (3) patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even a mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that because of age-related changes, organ function such as erythropoietin production in the kidney may become suboptimal. Management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function. In this article, we review current concepts around anemias at older age, with special emphasis on etiologies, clinical implications, and innovative concepts in the management of these patients.

### Age-related changes in lymphocyte development and function [^35aa55ca]. Nature Immunology (2004). Medium credibility.

The effects of aging on the immune system are widespread and extend from hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow and thymus to mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs. These changes combine to result in a diminution of immune responsiveness in the elderly. This review aims to provide an overview of age-related changes in lymphocyte development and function and discusses current controversies in the field of aging research.

### Interplay between hereditary and acquired factors determines the neutrophil counts in older individuals [^3ab9c233]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

To this date, the phenomenon of age-related myeloid skewing remains incompletely understood. Several underlying causes have been posited including a state of chronic, low-grade, sterile inflammation associated with aging, commonly referred to as inflammaging.Inflammaging is characterized by increased levels of cytokines and echoing the phenomenon of emergency granulopoiesis observed in acute inflammation, these inflammatory mediators may promote HSC proliferation and myelopoiesis.In addition, inflammatory exposure has been associated with the functional attrition of murine HSCs and accelerated hematopoietic aging phenotypes with myeloid-skewed hematopoiesisInflammaging is a major risk factor for the development of cardiometabolic diseases as endothelial damage, alteration of vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance are adverse events induced by increased proinflammatory cytokines in the setting of inflammaging.In turn, cardiac ischemic damage, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome may further the production of damage-associated molecular patterns by necrotic cells thus increasing the proinflammatory cytokine burden (such as IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α). We hypothesize that the increased level of neutrophil, monocyte, and platelet counts observed in patients with diverse cardiometabolic comorbidities in our study may reflect a state of low-grade inflammation associated with these diseases and be entwined in the phenomenon of inflammaging. In accordance with this hypothesis, in a large-scale GWAS, Vuckovic et al have suggested that abnormal blood counts may be the result of chronic diseases.Alternatively, it remains possible that the observed increase in myelopoiesis could feedforward an inflammatory response and promote or perpetuate aging-related diseases. Our findings are in line with a model proposed by Salminen et al that states that age-related peripheral changes lead to the release of proinflammatory factors, which then stimulate myelopoiesis and hamper lymphopoiesis. Subsequently, this fuels a vicious cycle by which enhanced myeloid output can foster peripheral tissue damage.

### Longitudinal analysis of blood markers reveals progressive loss of resilience and predicts human lifespan limit [^7e39ad17]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Most important factors that are strongly associated with age are also known as the hallmarks of agingand may be, at least in principle, modified pharmacologically. In addition to that, by analogy to resilience in ecological systems, the dynamic properties such as physiological resilience measured as the recovery rate from the organism state perturbations, were also associated with mortalityand thus may serve as an early warning sign of impending health outcomes,. Hence, a better quantitative understanding of the intricate relationship between the slow physiological state dynamics, resilience, and the exponential morbidity and mortality acceleration is required to allow the rational design, development, and clinical validation of effective antiaging interventions.

We addressed these theoretical and practical issues by a systematic investigation of aging, organism state fluctuations, and gradual loss of resilience in a dataset involving multiple Complete Blood Counts (CBC) measured over short periods of time (a few months) from the same person along the individual aging trajectory. Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Red cell distribution width have been already suggested and characterized as biomarkers of aging –. Instead of focusing on individual factors, to simplify the matters, we followed, and described the organism state by means of a single variable, henceforth referred to as the dynamic organism state indicator (DOSI) in the form of the log-transformed proportional all-cause mortality model predictor. First, we observed that early in life the DOSI dynamics quantitatively follows the universal ontogenetic growth trajectory from. Once the growth phase is completed, the indicator demonstrated all the expected biological age properties, such as association with age, multiple morbidity, unhealthy lifestyles, mortality and future incidence of chronic diseases.

### Neutropenia in the age of genetic testing: advances and challenges [^556849b0]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Identification of genetic causes of neutropenia informs precision medicine approaches to medical management and treatment. Accurate diagnosis of genetic neutropenia disorders informs treatment options, enables risk stratification, cancer surveillance, and attention to associated medical complications. The rapidly expanding genetic testing options for the evaluation of neutropenia have led to exciting advances but also new challenges. This review provides a practical guide to germline genetic testing for neutropenia.

### Aging: a temporal dimension for neutrophils [^6fc62642]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are first-responders, providing early protection against invading pathogens. Recent findings have revealed a temporal dimension to neutrophil function, associated with the clearance cycles for aging neutrophils, and also with a program that endows circulating neutrophils with distinct phenotypic and functional properties at different times of the day, before they are cleared from blood. We review here the process of neutrophil aging and its impact on homeostasis and inflammation. We outline the features of aged neutrophils, examine proposed mechanisms that drive aging, and discuss how these processes may contribute to tissue homeostasis and pathology. In this context we propose that neutrophil aging may optimize host defense by allowing neutrophils to anticipate infections while avoiding permanent activation and subsequent damage.

### Impact of age on switching or stopping disease modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^4beae66b]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Age-related safety considerations of specific disease modifying therapies (Table 1)

Cladribine

Cladribine is a highly effective lymphotoxic oral treatment agent for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. A retrospective observational study evaluated safety and effectiveness of cladribine in MS patients over 50 years of age revealed that while post-treatment lymphopenia was comparable between both older and younger cohorts, there were numerically more frequent adverse effects and infections during treatment in individuals aged more than 50 years. In a post-hoc analysis of cladribine clinical trials, a risk of malignancies was observed, however a follow-up meta-analysis of phase 3 trials of approved DMTs and phase 3 trial of cladribine concluded that the rate of cancer development in the treatment group with cladribine was not increased compared to groups receiving other DMTs. However, in a meta-analysis evaluating specific DMT risks with age, in depleting agents such as cladribine, the risk of malignancy is concerning after age 45. While efficacy and safety of cladribine is well-established in clinical trial cohorts, there remains a need to evaluate this therapy in older patients, to enhance real-world applicability to a growing aging MS population.

Fumarates

Lymphopenia remains a primary safety concern with use of fumarates, as it relates to risk of serious and opportunistic infections. Particularly, lymphopenia may predispose to developing PML. CD8 + T cells play a central role in immune surveillance and fumarate-induced suppression may interfere with protection against JC virus infection. Older age >55 years, has been demonstrated as a risk factor for development of grade 3 (absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ​< ​500) and combined grade 2 (ALC 500–799) and grade 3 lymphopenia which may relate to an age-related decline in lymphopoiesis with thymic involution. A wide spectrum of other opportunistic infections with dimethyl fumarate use has also been described however association with degree of lymphopenia remains uncertain. Nevertheless, monitoring of lymphocyte count every 6–12 months is recommended, and changing therapies should be considered for persistent (>6 months) ALC <500 (grade 3 or higher).

### Peripheral blood cytopenias in the aging general population and risk of incident hematological disease and mortality [^060c8803]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood cytopenias may precede the development of hematological malignancies and frequently pose clinical challenges in the older population. The natural course of (mild) cytopenias during aging and their association with hematological disorders in community-dwelling individuals are not well studied. Within the population-based Lifelines cohort (n = 167729), we studied changes in peripheral blood counts, occurrence of cytopenias, and associated hematological outcomes in the context of aging. Development of hematological malignancies and (cause-specific) mortality were evaluated by linkage to nationwide registries. Anemia and thrombocytopenia emerged with older age, in line with a general age-related decline in these blood counts. For neutropenia, no increase in prevalence with older age was observed. Using standard reference limits to define cytopenias, anemia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.12), thrombocytopenia (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32-1.89), and, especially the concomitant presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia (HR, 4.75; 95% CI, 2.98-7.55) were associated with inferior overall survival. Only a minor proportion of deaths was explained by diagnosed hematological malignancies, with the majority attributable to other causes. Neutropenia, either isolated (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73-1.06) or combined with another cytopenia, did not affect overall survival. For individuals aged ≥60 years, 5-year cumulative incidence of hematological malignancies was 0.60% (95% CI, 0.50-0.70), with higher incidences among those with anemia (P < .001) or thrombocytopenia (P < .001) but not neutropenia (P = .201). Highest cumulative incidences of diagnoses and mortality from hematological malignancies were observed in individuals with >1 cytopenia. We conclude that anemia and thrombocytopenia, but not neutropenia, are associated with inferior overall survival of community-dwelling individuals. Hematological malignancies develop in a small fraction of these cases.

### Leukopenia in children on antiseizure medication is common and has minor clinical impact [^75e4a55b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of leukopenia among children treated with antiseizure medication (ASM) in a real-world setting.

Study Design

The most recent 198 pediatric (<18 years) patients treated with ASMs at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital were included in a retrospective cohort study. Clinical variables were collected from electronic medical records. Patients who did and did not develop leukopenia were compared.

Results

Ninety-seven (49%) patients developed at least 1 episode of leukopenia. Most episodes (180 [88%]) were mild (ie, lower normal limit - 3.0 × 10 9 cells/L) and no patient developed life-threatening leukopenia or died. Clinical actions (ie, ASM switch or tapering) were taken in only 9 (4%) episodes of leukopenia. The clinical impact was leukopenia symptoms in 7 (3%) episodes, and other blood cell cytopenias more frequently (62% vs 18%; P < .001) compared with children without leukopenia. The risk factors for developing leukopenia were dysfunction in other organ systems (eg, endocrinologic disorders, heart disease, or kidney disease), longer treatment duration, ASM combination treatments, and slightly older age (mean 11 vs 9 years, P = .03). Leukopenia was seen in treatments with almost all ASMs (ie, substances) with only a few significant differences between the groups. There was no difference in leukopenia incidence between older vs newer ASMs.

Conclusions

Leukopenia is a far more common side-effect of ASMs than earlier described. However, this leukopenia is mostly asymptomatic and without complications. If mild leukopenia occurs, ASM discontinuation or adjustment may not be necessary.

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^9cec7809]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

ACS NSQIP/AGS best practice guideline—white blood count (WBC) testing in selected geriatric surgical patients—states “NOT RECOMMENDED for routine preoperative screening,” but “Recommended for patients with symptoms suggesting infection, known or suspected myeloproliferative disease (splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy), or at high risk for leukopenia from drugs or other known disease,” and it “May be included as part of a complete blood count.”

### Human neutrophil kinetics: a call to revisit old evidence [^6eef8940]. Trends in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

The half-life of human neutrophils is still controversial, with estimates ranging from 7-9 h to 3.75 days. This debate should be settled to understand neutrophil production in the bone marrow (BM) and the potential and limitations of emergency neutropoiesis following infection or trauma. Furthermore, cellular lifespan greatly influences the potential effect(s) neutrophils have on the adaptive immune response. We posit that blood neutrophils are in exchange with different tissues, but particularly the BM, as it contains the largest pool of mature neutrophils. Furthermore, we propose that the oldest neutrophils are the first to die following a so-called conveyor belt model. These guiding principles shed new light on our interpretation of existing neutrophil lifespan data and offer recommendations for future research.

### How we evaluate and treat neutropenia in adults [^29916fd9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Isolated neutropenia is a common clinical problem seen by primary care physicians and hematologists. The evaluation of neutropenia is dictated by the acuity of the clinical presentation and the duration, age, and clinical status of the patient. In this review, we provide a practical approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with neutropenia, with the major focus on the evaluation of neutropenia in the outpatient setting.

### Perphenazine [^5bbdfdb2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including perphenazine tablets. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue perphenazine tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) should discontinue perphenazine tablets and have their WBC followed until recovery.

Pregnancy

Non-teratogenic Effects: Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

Perphenazine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of perphenazine products did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the side effects of antipsychotics, including perphenazine. These side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, akathisia), anticholinergic effects, sedation and orthostatic hypotension (see WARNINGS). Elderly patients taking psychotropic drugs may be at increased risk for falling and consequent hip fractures. Elderly patients should be started on lower doses and observed closely.

### Aripiprazole oral (aripiprazole) [^7907d7a3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.

5.11 Seizures/Convulsions

In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years).

As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

### Interplay between hereditary and acquired factors determines the neutrophil counts in older individuals [^ac0617b8]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematopoiesis is a complex and tightly orchestrated process. It enables the lifelong replenishment of blood cells to ensure homeostasis, in addition to allowing the modulation of production in response to various stressors. Nevertheless, there is important interindividual variation in blood cell counts.

It has been estimated that 40% to 60% of the variance observed in blood cell traits is heritable. In fact, large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recently allowed to identify thousands of germline genetic variants associated with quantitative traits of specific blood lineages or blood cell indices.,,Deciphering the relative contribution of these numerous loci and their interrelation is a daunting task,yet certain loci may have a predominant effect and can be prioritized for further investigation. Blood counts are also influenced by nonhereditary factors. It is well recognized that blood and immune cell production is altered in response to insults such as infection, inflammation, therapy, and exogenous factors, such as smoking. Furthermore, hematopoiesis is also subjected to several alterations with aging, such as a functional decline of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with a reduction in self-renewal potential, a lymphoid-to-myeloid bias,,,,,,the acquisition of somatic mutation(s) leading to clonal hematopoiesis (CH),,,,and an increased incidence of myeloid blood cancers.

A better understanding of how germline and acquired factors modulate blood cell production may yield insight into the vulnerability of aging hematopoiesis to develop premalignant and malignant hematopoiesis. Accordingly, we performed a GWAS study and assessed factors such as lifestyle factors, chronic disease status, and CH to capture the hereditary and acquired determinants significantly associated with peripheral blood cell counts in a cohort of older women of French ancestry from Quebec. We document that aging is associated with a myeloid proliferation bias, which may be partly mediated by cardiometabolic diseases. The contribution of aging and these acquired age-related diseases undermined the effect of genetic hereditary factors on neutrophil count variability.

### Diagnostic value of leukopenia in young febrile infants [^de3f98b0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We performed a 7-year registry-based retrospective study. We included 1365 infants younger than 3 months of age with fever without a source; 81 (5.9%) had <5000 leukocytes/mm(3). Among the 1021 well-appearing 29- to 90-day-old infants, prevalence of serious bacterial infection (SBI) was 13.8% for those with a normal white blood cell count, 6.8% for those with leukopenia (odds ratio, 0.45), and 36.6% for those with leukocytosis (odds ratio, 3.59). None of the 9 well-appearing febrile neonates with leukopenia developed an SBI. Leukopenia, in well-appearing young febrile infants, should not be considered as an SBI risk factor.

### Age, exercise, and the outcome of sepsis [^fa0a9269]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Elderly septic patients often do not have typical clinical responses to sepsis, making diagnosis by the Sepsis-3 quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) criteria difficult. Older patients may present with inverse signs and symptoms (hypothermia, leukopenia), or nonspecific signs of infection. Accepted thresholds for biomarkers levels for diagnosis may not be appropriate in the older population, particularly among patients with pre-existing organ dysfunction. Thus, given the protean manifestations of infection in the elderly, diagnosis of sepsis is often delayed.

Once infected, older patients experience a disadvantaged host immune response with defects in humoral and cellular immune function. The pattern of cytokine release during sepsis in the elderly demonstrates higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. A smoldering inflammatory state during aging termed “inflammaging” can affect sepsis physiology. However, despite evidence of increased baseline inflammation, after insult, an immunosuppressed state is commonly observed in the elderly. This is part of the “immunosenescence” of aging, which results in quantitative and qualitative changes in lymphocytes (CD4, CD8 T cells and B cells) and myeloid cells. Specifically, elderly patients experience attenuated cell-mediated immunity in the form of a truncated T-cell repertoire, decreased IL-12 release, decreased lymphocyte proliferation, and dampened signal transduction. Humoral immunity is also adversely affected with aging. Decreased B-cell function with blunted antibody responses to neoantigens is commonplace due to lack of helper T-cell signals and decreased expression of costimulatory molecules.

### Interplay between hereditary and acquired factors determines the neutrophil counts in older individuals [^bc278f00]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study draws a portrait of the determinants underlying peripheral blood cell counts in the aging population of women. We identified variants in the region of the GSDMA and PSMD3-CSF3 genes which are associated with neutrophil counts, and the association decreased with increasing age. In parallel, neutrophil counts increased in the setting of acquired chronic cardiometabolic comorbidities. Taken together, these observations suggest that the effect of genetic variants may be undermined by aging and acquired factors, which explain increasing proportions of trait variability. More broadly, we document that aging is associated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes and reduced lymphocyte counts, indicating a shift toward myelopoiesis. This myeloid-biased proliferation is further increased among individuals with chronic cardiometabolic diseases, possibly through the perpetuation of a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Our study shows that CH does not contribute to the age-associated myeloid shift, in further support of this phenomenon being mediated by cell-extrinsic factors. Prospective studies are nonetheless required to evaluate if the cardiometabolic-driven myeloid proliferation bias is a risk factor for CH acquisition or clonal expansion.

### Persistent eosinopenia is associated with in-hospital mortality among older patients: unexpected prognostic value of a revisited biomarker [^44b45f03]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in older patients. Between 2000 and 2009, mortality associated with infection accounted for 5% of all deaths worldwide. Currently used biological markers (biomarkers) such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) lack discriminatory power to diagnose infection in older patients (> 65 years). Regarding prognostic approach, several biomarkers were evaluated on the day before treatment initiation to predict mortality among critically ill patients suffering from bacterial infection in an intensive care unit (ICU). Jensen et al. evaluated CRP value> 9 mg/L, leukocytes> 10 G/L and PCT > 1 ng/mL and showed that the only relevant parameter to identify patients at increased risk of all-cause mortality on day 90 was PCT in adults (median age 57 years). However, PCT has shown deviations with imperfect sensitivity and specificity in older adults. Clinical need for reliable biomarkers in older patients is particularly important as they may present without classical signs and symptoms of infection.

In common practice, evaluation of inflammation encountered during a bacterial infection is provided by a white blood cell (WBC) count. It is cost-effective and used in medicine or surgery wards as well as in primary care to support clinical findings which, when abnormal, provoke further investigation. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are usually increased in bacterial infection or inflammation cases whereas lymphopenia is suggestive of a viral infection in the general population. Eosinophils are WBCs that normally account for 1 to 3% of total leukocytes. Eosinopenia is defined by a reduced eosinophil count (EC) and was considered as a possible marker of infection by Zappert et al. in early 1893. In 1929, Schilling et al. suggested that eosinopenia was related to bacterial infection, whereas at a later date, Bass et al. suggested that its pathophysiology was related to the migration of eosinophils into the inflammatory site during the acute phase of inflammation. To date, only a few studies confirm this hypothesis, however, there is no consensual definition of eosinopenia without a defined threshold of values ranging from 10 to 140 eosinophils/mm 3.

### Age-dependent manifestations and case definitions of paediatric zika: a prospective cohort study [^bd6c4c4b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Paedeatric Zika remains an understudied topic. WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Zika case definitions have not been assessed in children. We aimed to characterise clinical profiles and evaluate the diagnostic performance of the WHO and PAHO case definitions in a large cohort of paediatric Zika cases.

Methods

From January, 2016 to February, 2017, encompassing the major 2016 Zika epidemic, participants in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) in Managua, Nicaragua, were encouraged to visit the study health centre at first indication of any illness. PDCS participants were aged 2-14 years, healthy at enrolment, and recruited before the initiation of the present study. Molecular and serological assays were used to test participants exhibiting any of four broad clinical profiles suspected of resulting from a symptomatic Zika virus infection. These clinical profiles were: fever and at least two of headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia; fever and at least two of nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, and any dengue warning sign; undifferentiated fever without evident cause, with or without any other clinical finding; and afebrile rash with or without any other clinical finding. We characterised acute clinical findings (signs, symptoms, and complete blood counts) in both Zika cases and non-Zika cases.

Findings

We prospectively followed a cohort of about 3700 children, of which 1110 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Four participants with laboratory-confirmed Zika (three co-infections with dengue virus, one missing complete blood count data) and two participants who were non-Zika cases (missing complete blood count data) were excluded from analysis. We analysed 556 laboratory-confirmed Zika and 548 non-Zika cases. The WHO case definition captured 176 confirmed Zika cases, and the PAHO definition 109 confirmed Zika cases, who presented with the most clinical findings and a dengue-like clinical profile. The remaining two thirds of Zika cases, principally characterised by undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash, were missed. Among Zika cases, rash (n=440)-particularly generalised erythematous rash (n=334)-fever (n=333), leukopenia (n=217), and headache (n=203) were most common and peaked within 3 days of illness onset. The most common Zika presentation over the first week of illness was rash only (n=80). The sensitivity of Zika case definitions increased across paediatric age (from 11·3% to 56·1% for the WHO case definition and from 6·0% to 36·6% for the PAHO case definition), as the prevalence of most clinical findings (particularly arthralgia) increased with age, irrespective of previous dengue virus infection. Consequently, Zika manifested differently across paediatric age; older Zika cases presented with a dengue-like clinical profile while younger Zika cases presented with undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash.

Interpretation

We provide the most thorough description of paediatric Zika to date. Most paediatric Zika cases go undetected under the WHO and PAHO case definitions, suggesting that current standards for Zika case ascertainment require revision. Zika manifests with mild but differing clinical profiles across paediatric age, presenting major challenges to diagnosis, surveillance, and efforts to control future Zika epidemics.

### Treatment of older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: key questions and current answers [^d57174e3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the advanced age at onset, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) shortens the life expectancy of the majority of newly diagnosed patients. The management of elderly patients with CLL is more complex than that of younger patients due to the greater frequency of comorbidities and functional impairment as well as reduced organ function. Many of the recent advances in the care of CLL patients (prognostication, more intense combination therapy regimens) are of unclear relevance for elderly patients. This review addresses 5 key questions in the management of elderly patients with CLL: (1) why is classifying the "fitness" of CLL patients necessary; (2) what criteria should be used to classify patient fitness; (3) when should elderly patients be treated; (4) how should therapy be selected for elderly patients; and (5) which therapy is best (for this patient)?

### Combining clinical and candidate gene data into a risk score for azathioprine-associated leukopenia in routine clinical practice [^9da390e3]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Leukopenia is a serious, frequent side effect associated with azathioprine use. Currently, we use thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing to predict leukopenia in patients taking azathioprine. We hypothesized that a risk score incorporating additional clinical and genetic variables would improve the prediction of azathioprine-associated leukopenia. In the discovery phase, we developed four risk score models: (1) age, sex, and TPMT metabolizer status; (2) model 1 plus additional clinical variables; (3) sixty candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms; and (4) model 2 plus model 3. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the risk scores was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.54-0.64), 0.75 (0.71-0.80), 0.66 (0.61-0.71), and 0.78 (0.74-0.82) for models 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. During the replication phase, models 2 and 4 (AUC=0.64, 95% CI: 0.59-0.70 and AUC=0.63, 95% CI: 0.58-0.69, respectively) were significant in an independent group. Compared with TPMT testing alone, additional genetic and clinical variables improve the prediction of azathioprine-associated leukopenia.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Recommendations for the use of WBC growth factors: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^99fd7ad7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering prophylactic colony-stimulating factors in patients ≥ 65 years of age with diffuse aggressive lymphoma treated with curative chemotherapy, particularly in the presence of comorbidities.

### Clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2862c85d]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Since, most of the studies have not provided prevalence of abnormal laboratory findings in the cohort of older patients, we were able to extract data for only four variables. Lymphopenia (52%) followed by leukopenia (20%) were found to be quite common among the patients. Bilateral lung infiltrates (76%) was the most common radiological finding reported in older patients. These findings had a similar WPP to that reported in other age groups.

Most common complication seen in these patients is secondary infection (34%) followed by AKI (22%) and ARDS (20%). WPP of AKI and ARDS in others studies vary from 2.7 to 25.5% and 15.7 to 19.5% respectively. Of note, most of the patients (84%) required oxygen support and a significant number of patients (21%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. A few of them (4%) were also on non-invasive ventilation. Considering the high proportion of patients needing respiratory therapy, clinicians should keep a close watch on older patients with COVID-19 and keep a low threshold for hospitalization. Only 2 studies reported mortality among patients needing mechanical ventilation; future studies should explore this further.

Though there have been few meta-analyses describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients [–,,,], this is the first one focussing on the older adults who are the most vulnerable patient cohort. We have reported on a comprehensive list of various comorbidities, clinical features, hospital course and outcomes. Unlike other systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19, we included studies from various centres and countries other than Wuhan, China. Since a large number of initial studies were from China, we also did subgroup analyses of studies from China and outside China. As the pandemic progressed, awareness of the disease, its manifestations and outcomes evolved. The subgroup analyses thus enable us to account for reporting bias and for regional differences in outcomes.

As this study comprised of data primarily from first wave, it is also important to view it within the context of subsequent waves of infection. As compared to the first wave, second wave infected patients were younger, though had similar clinical presentation but had lower mortality. However, the mean age of died patients was same or older as compared to the first wave. This is interesting and needs to be studied further. Possible reasons may be increased awareness about the disease, new therapeutic options and new strains of the virus.

### The immuno-oncological challenge of COVID-19 [^bb813c89]. Nature Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, pose considerable challenges for the management of oncology patients. COVID-19 presents as a particularly severe respiratory and systemic infection in aging and immunosuppressed individuals, including patients with cancer. Moreover, severe COVID-19 is linked to an inflammatory burst and lymphopenia, which may aggravate cancer prognosis. Here we discuss why those with cancer are at higher risk of severe COVID-19, describe immune responses that confer protective or adverse reactions to this disease and indicate which antineoplastic therapies may either increase COVID-19 vulnerability or have a dual therapeutic effect on cancer and COVID-19.

### Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^303eb148]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neutropenia is a well-recognised complication of chemotherapy, associated with an increased risk of infection, febrile neutropenia (FN), and as a consequence, can lead to mortality. Interventions to prevent neutropenic events (NEs) such as FN can reduce incidence and associated complications. Inventions include chemotherapy dose reductions and delays, prescribing prophylactic antibiotics and more commonly prescribing primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). This latter strategy is favoured to maintain dose intensity. Guidelines are available that recommend the use of CSFs when a risk of FN is 20% or greater. However, the start time and duration of treatment remain at the discretion of the patient’s clinician.

In clinical practice, decisions on the best strategy to prevent NEs in patients treated with chemotherapy are challenging. With a diverse treatment population varying in weight, ethnicity, age, and co-morbidity, judgement has to be made on appropriate treatments and management strategies. Toxicity information from clinical trials is used to guide whether CSF prophylaxis is indicated. However, data on neutropenic complications from clinical studies may not be representative of the wider population and this has caused uncertainty in using toxicity information as a guide.

Internationally recognised guidelines reflect this doubt, advising that individual patient factors such as age, and line of treatment should additionally be considered alongside toxicity information to guide management decisions. Yet, inconsistencies exist in the reported studies for associations with factors such as increasing age and neutropenic events, where one study showed an increase in neutropenia risk and another reported a reduced risk. Additionally, there is no quantification of risk associated between factors and neutropenic events within guidelines, which is essential for clinical decision-making.

The aim of this review was to therefore investigate factors that have demonstrated influence on neutropenic episodes and synthesise their significance. There is already a recognition of the importance of the chemotherapy regimen and an additional understanding of other risk factors would enable clinicians to appropriately prescribe preventative measures.

### Prognostic significance of leukopenia at the time of diagnosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [^f16c570d]. ASCO (2009). Low credibility.

Methods: Single institution retrospective analysis of 225 consecutive, newly diagnosed AML patients, homogeneously treated between July 1996 and February 2005; and divided into 2 groups based on presenting WBC: < 2, 000/uL and > 2, 000/uL. Simultaneously obtained peripheral blood and marrow blasts were analyzed for cell surface expression of CD34, cKit, CXCR4, PCAM, VLA-2, VLA-3, VLA-4, VLA-5, and FLT3 using flow cytometry. Results: Patients’ characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. Leukopenic AML pts were older, and had lower induction complete remission rates: 63% vs. 81% by univariate analysis. Induction mortality was 0% for leukopenic and 5% for non-leukopenic pts. In primary refractory pts, median survival was longer for leukopenic vs. non-leukopenic pts: 137 vs. 81 d. Median follow-up was 22 mos.

Event-free, disease-free, and overall survivals were lower in the leukopenic group: 12 vs. 14; 14 vs. 17; and 17 vs. 19 mos, respectively; but did not reach statistical significance. By multivariate analysis, age and CTG risk group were independent predictors of OS, while CTG risk group predicted RFS. The level of expression of cell surface adhesion molecules on blood and marrow blasts was comparable for the 2 groups. Conclusions: AML pts presenting with leukopenia have comparable outcomes to those presenting with normal or high WBC despite a lower likelihood of achieving remission. Leukopenic AML did not have over-expression of cell surface adhesion molecules. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Age of blood: does it make a difference? [^415fbfae]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

During the past 20 years, the perceived value of blood transfusions has changed as it has become appreciated that transfusions are not without risk. Red blood cell transfusion has been associated with disease transmission and immunosuppression for some time. More recently, proinflammatory consequences of red blood cell transfusion have also been documented. Moreover, it has become increasingly evident that stored red blood cells undergo time-dependent metabolic, biochemical, and molecular changes. This 'storage lesion' may be responsible for many of the adverse effects of red blood cell transfusion. Clinically, the age of blood has been associated with multiple organ failure, postoperative pneumonia, and wound infection. The relationship between age of blood and clinical adverse effects needs further study.

### Hematological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in children [^317f7de7]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), though mainly a respiratory disease, can impair many systems, including causing hematological complications. Lymphopenia and hypercoagulability have been reported in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are considered markers of poor prognosis. This review summarizes the hematological findings in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of infected children had a normal leukocyte count, while the most common white blood cell abnormality was leukopenia. Lymphopenia, which may be a marker of severe disease, was rarer in children than in adults, possibly due to their immature immune system or due to the less severe manifestation of COVID-19 in this age group. Age may have an impact, and in neonates and infants the most common abnormality was lymphocytosis. Abnormalities of red blood cells and platelets were uncommon. Anemia and hypercoagulability were reported mainly in children presenting the novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) associated with SARS-CoV-2.

### Advancing age and immune cell dysfunction: is it reversible or not? [^ee656cd7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Decline in immune function with advancing age is a hallmark of aging. As a result, infectious diseases cause more morbidity and mortality to the elderly. These age-related changes significantly alter the functionality of both innate and adaptive immune components.

Objectives

Although age-associated dysfunction of the immune system is well reported, not much is known about the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that progressively bring about functional changes in immune cell types.

Methods

This review focuses on our current understanding of age-associated changes in innate and adaptive immune cell types and how this knowledge could be used to improve the immune competence of elderly individuals.

Results/Conclusion

Therapeutic approaches to rejuvenate the exhausted immune system in the elderly need more attention.

### Ziprasidone [^a622443d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) should discontinue ziprasidone and have their WBC followed until recovery.

5.13 Seizures

During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer’s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

5.14 Dysphagia

Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer’s dementia. Ziprasidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see Boxed Warning].

### Persistent eosinopenia is associated with in-hospital mortality among older patients: unexpected prognostic value of a revisited biomarker [^cd998be7]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study found that persistent eosinopenia below 100/mm 3 within 4 days of the diagnosis of bacterial infection appears to be a predictor of in-hospital mortality in older patients. Further research is needed to investigate whether the evolution of EC could help guide antimicrobial therapy duration physician decisions. Eosinopenia is easy to detect with a simple WBC count in any patient suspected of bacterial infection with no additional processing cost.

### Older but not wiser: the age-driven changes in neutrophil responses during pulmonary infections [^4bdb854a]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Elderly individuals are at increased risk of life-threatening pulmonary infections. Neutrophils are a key determinant of the disease course of pathogen-induced pneumonia. Optimal host defense balances initial robust pulmonary neutrophil responses to control pathogen numbers, ultimately followed by the resolution of inflammation to prevent pulmonary damage. Recent evidence suggests that phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in neutrophils impacts host resistance to pulmonary pathogens. Apart from their apparent role in innate immunity, neutrophils also orchestrate subsequent adaptive immune responses during infection. Thus, the outcome of pulmonary infections can be shaped by neutrophils. This review summarizes the age-driven impairment of neutrophil responses and the contribution of these cells to the susceptibility of the elderly to pneumonia. We describe how aging is accompanied by changes in neutrophil recruitment, resolution, and function. We discuss how systemic and local changes alter the neutrophil phenotype in aged hosts. We highlight the gap in knowledge of whether these changes in neutrophils also contribute to the decline in adaptive immunity seen with age. We further detail the factors that drive dysregulated neutrophil responses in the elderly and the pathways that may be targeted to rebalance neutrophil activity and boost host resistance to pulmonary infections.

### COVID-19 vaccines and risks of hematological abnormalities: nested case-control and self-controlled case series study [^05e088db]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

3.3 Risk of leukopenia

In total, 1947 leukopenia cases were included in the nested case–control and 4601 cases (3396 unvaccinated, 550 CoronaVac, 655 BNT162b2) in the SCCS analysis. There was no increased risk of leukopenia following CoronaVac vaccination in neither the nested case–control (Table 3) nor SCCS analysis (Table 4). In contrast, we observed an increased risk of leukopenia following the second dose of BNT162b2 in the nested case–control analysis (aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.24–2.02, Table 3). In the SCCS analysis, we further found that the increased risk was only significant within the first 2 weeks following the second dose (IRR 2.21; 95% CI 1.59–3.08, Table 4). The association remained significant after excluding COVID‐19 cases (Tables S8 and S9). In subgroup analysis, we only observed similar results in people aged <60 years but not in people aged ≥60 years (Tables S4–S7). For the association beyond 28 days of vaccination, the findings in the nested case–control analysis were similar to the main analysis (Table S10). In the SCCS analysis, there was an increased risk on day 28–55 post second dose CoronaVac (IRR 2.15, 95% CI 1.25–3.71, Table S11).

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^3fdee71f]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity

Aging is correlated with alterations in lymphocytes. In older individuals severely affected by sepsis, a pronounced decrease in lymphocytes, especially in T cells, is evident, with these reductions persisting over extended periods. In a study involving 2300 sepsis patients, 42.6% demonstrated enduring lymphopenia, primarily observed in elderly individuals who also presented a higher prevalence of chronic complications and elevated APACHE IV and SOFA scores. Further, elderly sepsis patients manifested exacerbated apoptosis and proliferative disturbances in CD4 + T cell subsets. Aging and nutritional changes could augment the effects of cellular apoptosis. Additionally, diminished TCR diversity, spurred by lymphopenia, aggravates immune aging, potentially escalating the readmission rates in elderly patients. Remarkably, similar trends of persistent lymphopenia and raised regulatory T cell frequencies have been noticed not only in the elderly but also in neonates with hospital-acquired sepsis and early clinical infections.

Different pathogens may induce diverse lymphopenic patterns. Numerous studies distinctively addressing bacterial and viral-induced sepsis have yielded results beneficial for precision therapy. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections can reduce B/T cells, albeit more pronounced in the former case. Prolonged lymphopenia was significantly associated with worse clinical prognoses in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections but not other respiratory viruses. Moreover, extensive replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is conjectured to be a plausible cause of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients, as high viral loads might diminish peripheral blood lymphocyte counts either by inducing more significant cell apoptosis or by prompting lymphocyte migration to infected tissues. The research also indicated a positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels with viral load and a negative correlation with lymphocyte count, suggesting that control of viral replication could ameliorate lymphopenia. This hints at the necessity of considering tissue infiltration effects in lymphocyte count evaluations and proposes the potential utility of CRP and ferritin as readily accessible clinical indicators to reflect the correlation between lymphocyte levels and specific viral loads. Research also highlights that host genetic variations might affect lymphocyte quantities. A broader discussion encompassing more heterogeneous evidence is underway.

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among adults in the US general population [^4444f739]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Immune dysregulation can increase the risk of infection, malignant neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease, but improved methods are needed to identify and quantify immunologic hazard in the general population.

Objective

To determine whether lymphopenia is associated with reduced survival in outpatients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included participants enrolled from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2010, a large outpatient sample representative of the US adult population. Associations were evaluated between lymphopenia and other immunohematologic (IH) markers, clinical features, and survival during 12 years of follow-up, completed on December 31, 2011. Spearman correlations, Cox proportional hazards regression models, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used in univariable and multivariable models, allowing for nonlinear associations with bivariate cubic polynomials. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2018, through July 24, 2019.

Exposures

Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause survival.

Results

Among the 31 178 participants, the median (interquartile range) age at baseline was 45 (30-63) years, 16 093 (51.6%) were women, 16 260 (52.2%) were nonwhite, and overall 12-year rate of survival was 82.8%. Relative lymphopenia (≤1500/μL) and severe lymphopenia (≤1000/μL) were observed in 20.1% and 3.0%, respectively, of this general population and were associated with increased risk of mortality (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios [HRs],1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4] and 1.8 [95% CI, 1.6-2.1], respectively) due to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. Lymphopenia was also associated with worse survival in multivariable models, including traditional clinical risk factors, and this risk intensified when accompanied by bone marrow dysregulation (elevated RDW) and/or inflammation (elevated CRP level). Ten-year mortality ranged from 3.8% to 62.1% based on lymphopenia status, tertile of CRP level, and tertile of RDW. A high-risk IH profile was nearly twice as common as type 2 diabetes (19.3% and 10.0% of participants, respectively) and associated with a 3-fold risk of mortality (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.6-4.0). Individuals aged 70 to 79 years with low IH risk had a better 10-year survival (74.1%) than those who were a decade younger with a high-risk IH profile (68.9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that lymphopenia is associated with reduced survival independently of and additive to traditional risk factors, especially when accompanied by altered erythropoiesis and/or heightened inflammation. Immune risk may be analyzed as a multidimensional entity derived from routine tests, facilitating precision medicine and population health interventions.

### Ziprasidone hydrochloride (ziprasidone) [^d19b24ad]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.11 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3) should discontinue ziprasidone and have their WBC followed until recovery.

5.12 Seizures

During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

5.13 Dysphagia

Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Ziprasidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see Boxed Warning] .

### Aging and innate immunity in the mouse: impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [^3b0c092f]. Trends in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Aging affects every innate immune cell, including changes in cell numbers and function. Defects in the function of some cells are intrinsic, whereas for other cells, defects are extrinsic and possibly the consequence of the complex interactions with other cell types or the environmental milieu that is altered with aging. Abnormal function contributes to worsened outcomes after injury or infection and leads to diseases observed in the elderly. Knowing the mechanisms responsible for the aberrant function of innate immune cells might lead to the development of therapeutic strategies designed to improve innate immunity in aged individuals. Herein, advances in the field of innate immunity and aging with a focus on neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells in laboratory animals are discussed.

### Comparison of dengue, chikungunya, and zika among children in Nicaragua across 18 years: a single-centre, prospective cohort study [^076ae3b2]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

We compared the age-varying presentation of clinical profiles used for laboratory testing. As age increased, a growing proportion of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases met the 1997 WHO dengue case definition (appendix 2 p 19). Conversely, the proportion of cases exhibiting undifferentiated fever decreased with age across the three diseases. Zika cases were substantially more likely to have afebrile rash than dengue cases at any age.

We then examined age-prevalence trends of the underlying clinical features and found many pronounced differences between the three diseases (figure 1). For example, the prevalence of leukopenia was more than 25·0 percentage points higher among dengue than Zika cases across every age (figure 1). We also found disease-specific age patterns. Among dengue cases, the prevalence of all types of rash decreased linearly, and the prevalence of nausea increased linearly by age. The prevalence of basophilia was constant and high across ages for dengue cases, whereas rapid age-based waning was seen for chikungunya and Zika cases (figure 1). Among chikungunya cases, the prevalence of generalised, erythematous rash decreased from ages 2–10 years but then rebounded and continued increasing throughout adolescence. Among Zika cases, the prevalence of fever increased with age and the prevalence of lymphocytopenia decreased until age 9 years before increasing throughout adolescence. Age-prevalence trends did not differ by sex (appendix 2 p 20).

### COVID-19 bacteremic co-infection is a major risk factor for mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation [^e54a419e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in over 6.3 million deaths worldwide. Studies conducted in the first year of the pandemic identified advanced age, select comorbidities, male sex, leukopenia, neutrophilia, and several small nucleotide polymorphisms as major risk factors for disease severity and post-infection mortality. Bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 was initially reported to have low prevalence with limited contribution to overall severity and mortality. Despite these early reports, recent evidence suggests that bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 may influence mortality, although large-scale multicenter studies have not validated this hypothesis.

Reported COVID-19 co-infection rates have ranged from 2 to 8% but consistently appear less than the influenza co-infection rates as reported in the 1918 pandemic and the estimated 34% co-infection rate of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [,,–]. Mortality rates from COVID-19 co-infection have varied widely from twofold compared to non-co-infected COVID-19 patients, to having no effect on mortality among co-infected ICU patients. Several issues confound a reliable determination of co-infection prevalence and associated morbidity, notably inconsistent definitions of co-infection, limited sample size without independent multicenter cohorts, and inclusion of outpatient encounters in co-infection event rate calculations. Here, we defined bacterial co-infection as the presence of a pathogenic isolate from a sterile site, blood, as determined by positive blood cultures taken within 48-h of admission. This approach provides an analysis that discriminates true pathogens from incidental or colonizing organisms, enabling a consistent assessment of co-infection across cohorts and their impact on clinical outcomes.

The primary aims of this retrospective study were to define: (1) the prevalence of COVID-19 co-infections, (2) the impact of COVID-19 co-infection and SARS-CoV-2 variant strain on clinical outcomes including ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality utilizing two independent cohorts, and (3) early biomarkers associated with bacterial co-infection. We hypothesized that bacterial co-infection contributes to poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 subjects irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 variant, and that early recognition of co-infection is possible with routinely gathered laboratory and vital sign measurements.

### Relative effectiveness and safety of chemotherapy in elderly and nonelderly patients with stage III colon cancer: a systematic review [^9f93c1bc]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chemotherapy effectiveness in clinical practice may differ from the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, particularly among populations underrepresented in clinical trials, such as elderly patients with cancer. This review aims to examine the relative effectiveness of chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in elderly versus nonelderly patients.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality approach. Literature searches were performed in Medline and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews databases. Chemotherapy regimens approved for stage III colon cancer were reviewed. Four effectiveness and 15 safety outcomes were extracted.

Results

From 708 identified articles, 25 articles provided data on the relative effectiveness and safety of chemotherapy among elderly versus nonelderly patients. Four of 14 studies showed lower overall survival treatment effects, whereas one of five and one of four studies indicated more favorable treatment effects for time to progression and overall response rate. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher among elderly patients for cardiac disorder (2/5 studies), leukopenia (1/5), neutropenia (4/16), thrombocytopenia (2/13), febrile neutropenia (1/4), infection (2/10), dehydration (2/6), diarrhea (6/20), and fatigue (6/13). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were lower for neutropenia (2/16 studies), nausea/vomiting (1/16), and neuropathy (1/9).

Conclusion

The majority of the evidence suggests that chemotherapy has similar relative effectiveness and safety for patients >65 years of age versus younger patients with stage III colon cancer. When differences are reported, treatment effects are more often worse among the elderly. This review suggests that without other reasons for withholding treatment, elderly patients should receive chemotherapy as often as nonelderly patients.

### A pooled analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected colon cancer in elderly patients [^6f4dbbfb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard treatment for patients with resected colon cancer who are at high risk for recurrence, but the efficacy and toxicity of such treatment in patients more than 70 years of age are controversial.

Methods

We performed a pooled analysis, based on the intention to treat, of individual patient data from seven phase 3 randomized trials (involving 3351 patients) in which the effects of postoperative fluorouracil plus leucovorin (five trials) or fluorouracil plus levamisole (two trials) were compared with the effects of surgery alone in patients with stage II or III colon cancer. The patients were grouped into four age categories of equal size, and analyses were repeated with 10-year age ranges (< or =50, 51 to 60, 61 to 70, and >70 years), with the same conclusions. The toxic effects measured in all trials were nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and leukopenia. Patients in the fluorouracil-plus-leucovorin and fluorouracil-plus-levamisole groups were combined for the efficacy analysis but kept separate for toxicity analyses.

Results

Adjuvant treatment had a significant positive effect on both overall survival and time to tumor recurrence (P<0.001 for each, with hazard ratios of death and recurrence of 0.76 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.85] and 0.68 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.76], respectively). The five-year overall survival was 71 percent for those who received adjuvant therapy, as compared with 64 percent for those untreated. No significant interaction was observed between age and the efficacy of treatment. The incidence of toxic effects was not increased among the elderly (age >70 years), except for leukopenia in one study.

Conclusions

Selected elderly patients with colon cancer can receive the same benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant therapy as their younger counterparts, without a significant increase in toxic effects.

### Expanding roles of neutrophils in aging hosts [^79c3efa6]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Neutrophils' role in the clearance of pathogens is well documented, but there is increasing appreciation that neutrophils can participate in the resolution of infection and inflammation. An obvious implication is that alteration of neutrophil functions with old age could significant impact both susceptibility of the host to infection and inflammatory conditions. Advances in recent years suggest additional chinks in the neutrophil antimicrobial arsenals in aged hosts, which render neutrophils less capable of killing pathogens. Moreover there is evidence that changes in neutrophil cross-talk with other immune cells also contribute to poor resolution of inflammation. These advances provide new insight on how these phagocytic cells could contribute to age-related diseases.

### Relative lymphocyte count as an indicator of 3-year mortality in elderly people with severe COPD [^e83c234f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Relative lymphopenia has a homogeneous and strong effect on mortality across the whole follow-up period, but the inherent mechanisms remain to be clarified. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that relative lymphopenia is associated with a poor prognosis in elderly patients with severe COPD. This finding seems worthy of attention because lymphocyte count is a simple, reproducible, widely available and inexpensive prognostic tool. Further research is needed to verify to which extent lymphopenia improves the prognostic definition based on well-established markers, as well as to assess the relationship linking lymphopenia with indices of neurohormonal activation and inflammation. Clarifying these issues would enable quantification of the weight of this new prognostic marker and, possibly, the design of interventions, e.g. immunological therapy, aimed at its correction.

### Neutrophils in community-acquired pneumonia: parallels in dysfunction at the extremes of age [^183c6bde]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunosenescence: impact of an ageing host on neutrophil function

Senescence or biological ageing is the gradual deterioration of functional characteristics associated with age and can refer to a whole organism (such as the ageing human), a tissue or cell. Immunosenescence is an age-associated immune dysfunction and is associated with ‘inflamm-ageing’,demonstrated by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in older adults, leaving their immune system continuously activated.

Neutrophil functions also demonstrate immunosenescence. Neutrophil numbers are maintained, both in the periphery and as progenitors in the bone marrow; however, older adults are more prone to neutropenia during infection as response to G-CSF appears blunted.Some studies suggest that neutrophils from older adults display altered cytokine production, but there is inconsistency as to whether this manifests as decreased or increased proinflammatory cytokines, and this might be stimuli specific. Chemotaxis is impaired in healthy older adults, demonstrating reduced accuracy of migration without impeding the ability of cells to move.Neutrophils from healthy older adults display a decreased capacity to phagocytose opsonised bacteria.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and associated antimicrobial killing are impaired,although these defects are not uniform and again may be stimuli specific.Generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis) is impaired in healthy older adults and in older mice in a S. aureus infection model.Neutrophils from older donors have increased susceptibility to spontaneous and induced apoptosis and reduced capacity to prolong their lifespan.These blunted functions predispose towards infection. Of note, however, age-related neutrophil dysfunction does not appear ubiquitous or permanent. A recent study in aged cyclists has shown reduced features of immunosenescence across a number of cell types and functions,and physical activity has been shown to reduce systemic inflammation in a prospective study of older adults.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) criteria—validated definition includes either one major criterion or three or more minor criteria, with minor criteria including respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion/disorientation, uremia (blood urea nitrogen level ≥ 20 mg/dl), leukopenia (white blood cell count < 4,000 cells/μl), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100,000/μl), hypothermia (core temperature < 36°C), and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation; major criteria are septic shock with need for vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Leukopenia is specified as “Due to infection alone (i.e., not chemotherapy induced).”

### Clinical efficacy and tolerability of direct-acting antivirals in elderly patients with chronic hepatitis C [^5808bd9e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis by Yang et al. concluded that the overall SVR in patients aged older than or equal to 65 years treated with a prolonged course of IFN/RBV regimens was significantly lower and had a significantly higher risk of relapse than in patients younger than 65 years of age. IFN and RBV discontinuation rate were also significantly higher in older patients than in younger patients. We did not find any significant difference in RBV dose reduction or discontinuation rate (P =0.913) in patients aged 65 years and older compared with younger patients. These findings indicate that elderly patients are tolerating equally the shorter course of treatment involving IFN-based and RBV-based regimens as younger patients. ETR and SVR12 for elderly patients were similar to those of younger patients (93.06 vs. 94.12%), supporting previous observations, but with the improved virologic response rate in combination with DAAs. Fatigue is the most common adverse event observed in both IFN-based and IFN-free treatment regimens (Tables 6 and 7). Most of the incidences of anemia and leukopenia noted in IFN-free regimens were because of RBV in combination with newer agents. None of the patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, supporting the fact that a shorter duration of IFN/RBV-based treatment is better tolerated and can be administered to any age group safely with close monitoring during the treatment.

### Prevalence of neutropenia in the U.S. population: age, sex, smoking status, and ethnic differences [^049d871f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Benign reductions in neutrophil counts may be more common at certain ages and in certain ethnic groups and may be affected by sex and smoking status.

Objective

To determine differences in neutrophil counts in the U.S. population according to ethnicity, age, sex, and smoking status.

Design

Population-based, cross-sectional study.

Setting

Various locations in the United States.

Participants

25,222 participants in the 1999 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were 1 year of age or older.

Measurements

Complete blood counts and comparison of means and the proportion of participants with neutropenia.

Results

Relative to white participants, black participants had lower leukocyte counts (mean difference, 0.89 x 10(9) cells/L; P < 0.001), lower neutrophil counts (0.83 x 10(9) cells/L; P < 0.001), and similar lymphocyte counts (0.022 x 10(9) cells/L; P = 0.36), whereas Mexican-American participants had slightly higher mean leukocyte counts (0.16 x 10(9) cells/L; P = 0.014), higher neutrophil counts (0.11 x 10(9) cells/L; P = 0.026), and higher lymphocyte counts (0.095 x 10(9) cells/L; P < 0.001). The prevalence of neutropenia (neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(9) cells/L) was 4.5% among black participants, 0.79% among white participants, and 0.38% among Mexican-American participants. The prevalence of neutropenia was higher among males and children younger than 5 years of age. Neutrophil counts less than 1.0 x 10(9) cells/L were observed in fewer than 1% of the overall sample (0.57% in black participants, 0.11% in white participants, and 0.08% in Mexican-American participants). Smoking was associated with higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts but had a smaller effect among black and Mexican-American participants than among white participants.

Limitation

Because estimates are based on single measures, fluctuations over time could not be determined.

Conclusions

In the United States, neutrophil counts are lower in black persons than in white persons and neutropenia is more prevalent in black persons. Neutrophil counts are slightly higher in Mexican-American persons than in white persons, and neutropenia is uncommon in both groups. The clinical implications of these findings are unclear, but they suggest that when determining the need for a diagnostic evaluation for neutropenia, clinicians should consider the patient's age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status.

### Valganciclovir (valcyte) [^1efb3afa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hematologic Toxicity

Severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow failure including aplastic anemia have been reported in patients treated with VALCYTE or ganciclovir. VALCYTE should be avoided if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/µL, the platelet count is less than 25,000/µL, or the hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL. VALCYTE should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Cytopenia may occur at any time during treatment and may worsen with continued dosing. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors may be considered.

Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving VALCYTE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in infants, in patients with renal impairment, and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/µL at the beginning of treatment. Increased monitoring for cytopenias may be warranted if therapy with oral ganciclovir is changed to VALCYTE because of increased plasma concentrations of ganciclovir after VALCYTE administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

5.2	Acute Renal Failure

Acute renal failure may occur in:

Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering VALCYTE to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)] .
Patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering VALCYTE to patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs.
Patients without adequate hydration. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.

5.3	Impairment of Fertility

Based on animal data and limited human data, VALCYTE at the recommended human doses may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with use of VALCYTE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] .

### Prevention of febrile neutropenia: use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [^2a7ab688]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Elderly patients

Elderly patients account for only a small proportion of the population with early-stage breast cancer (prevalence approaching 7% among the over-70 s). This group is worth mentioning, however, as elderly patients present particular challenges, including reduced tolerance to chemotherapy and greater susceptibility to the development of FN. Importantly, with careful patient selection, chemotherapy can be effective and tolerable in older as well as younger individuals.

It is important to note that chronological age, by itself, is not a reliable indicator of life expectancy, functional reserve or the risk of treatment complications. Elderly patients require a comprehensive geriatric assessment, looking at function, comorbidities, nutritional status, cognition, emotional evaluation and socioeconomic issues.

A systematic review of the literature has provided evidence to support the use of haematopoietic growth factors in elderly people, to reduce the risk of neutropenic events and the need for reduced DI, but specific evidence for the benefits of primary prophylaxis of FN in elderly breast cancer patients is currently lacking. Further studies are needed.

### Recommendations for the use of WBC growth factors: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^b1096f51]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to do not use colony-stimulating factors routinely as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy in patients with fever and neutropenia. Consider administering colony-stimulating factors in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications or who have prognostic factors predictive of poor clinical outcomes. High-risk features include expected prolonged (≥ 10 days) and profound neutropenia (≤ 0.1×10⁹/L), age > 65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection, or hospitalization at the time of fever development.

### Lymphocyte count and mortality risk in older persons. the Leiden 85-plus study [^295baeab]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether a low peripheral blood lymphocyte count is associated with increased mortality risk in older persons and to determine whether this association could be ascribed to ill health.

Design

A cohort study with a total follow-up period of 1,602 person years.

Setting

Leiden, the Netherlands.

Participants

Four hundred thirty-six community-dwelling residents aged 85 and older.

Measurements

Health status and leukocyte total and differential counts were assessed at baseline. Lymphocyte subsets were measured with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Age- and sex-adjusted mortality risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

Results

There was no association between lymphocyte count and mortality in persons with ill health (mortality risk lowest vs highest quartile=1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.85-1.58, P=.35), but mortality was dependent on lymphocyte count if disease was excluded (mortality risk lowest vs highest quartile=2.14; 95% CI=1.08-4.23, P=.03). A similar increase in mortality risk was found when the cluster designation (CD)4+, CD8+, and CD16+ lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Within individuals, low values of the lymphocyte subsets were related and there was no compensatory increase in CD16+ lymphocyte counts. A low lymphocyte count was not associated with specific causes of death.

Conclusion

A low lymphocyte count was associated with an increased mortality risk in older persons without apparent disease. This association was not only found for the total lymphocyte count but also for the CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ lymphocyte subset counts.

### Patient factors and their impact on neutropenic events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^48253fc7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Our findings cannot yet be fully incorporated into practice guidelines, primarily because there is yet to be a strong, prospective study that evaluates all factors that may affect NEs. These factors include those such as performance status, severity of co-morbidity and ethnicity. The recently updated NCCN guidance has acknowledged the increased risk with advanced age ; however, age could simply be a proxy measure for frailty or organ function. Within the meta-analysis, only studies adjusting for confounders were included but frailty was not studied by any author, which limits our findings. The diversity in study methods and criteria for inclusion limited us to only being able to pool data for one co-morbid condition compared to zero. Equally, we could not aggregate results of baseline bone marrow function or the effect of renal and liver function tests. The influence of gender has also been recently highlighted as an area where further research is required and should also be considered when assigning treatment. The majority of studies that were appropriate for meta-analysis included women receiving treatment for breast cancer. This limited evaluation of gender and may also limit the findings of the study to patients treated with breast cancer.

Despite only including studies that included similar confounders, we found heterogeneity was inherently present due to differences in collection methods. One source of heterogeneity was our grouping of grade 3–4 NE and FN as outcome measures. Interestingly, there were no reports of mortality in any of the articles, which may be an effect of the collection methods. Further work is needed to define how neutropenic episodes translate to mortality following the developments in rescue medications such as CSFs.

A prospective study incorporating the findings of our work could guide the development of a risk prediction model. We found a number of model development studies; however, many were excluded from our review as individual OR and HR were not reported. We have identified weaknesses with some of the risk prediction models included in our analysis, consistent with other models developed for use in cancer patients, limiting their current use.

Neutropenia is one of the most common and most dangerous AEs of chemotherapy. For this reason, a strategy to prevent the event occurring is essential. Trial data of new treatment regimens can help us to understand the effects of treatment on the bone marrow. However, these studies are often undertaken in a controlled group of patients and it is difficult to assess other patient-related factors that increase the risk.

### Differential white blood cell count and epigenetic clocks: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study [^e2e33db5]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

However, our study has several limitations. Firstly, although WBC counts possess characteristics of a stable trait to some extent, they vary over time, including fluctuations within one day, potentially leading to errors. Secondly, our study results pertain primarily to European population. Further investigations are needed to examine other populations. Thirdly, as WBC play a crucial role in immune response and inflammatory processes, future studies should consider broadening the scope by including inflammation factors to comprehensively investigate their potential effects in these causal pathways.

In summary, our research provides additional evidence of a potential genetic causal link between WBC count and the acceleration of epigenetic age. Nevertheless, further research could investigate the impact of more specific cell subtypes or other biomarkers on epigenetic age.

### Profound dysregulation of T cell homeostasis and function in patients with severe COVID-19 [^a1c17de6]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

T cell lymphopenia and perturbations of T cell homeostasis are very prominent features of severe COVID‐19, but their pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. A better understanding of the T cell alterations occurring in severe COVID‐19 can provide insight into important disease mechanisms and inform therapeutic strategies. We performed detailed investigations of relative and absolute changes to the peripheral T cell compartment in our well characterized COVID‐19 cohort. Our analysis revealed marked T cell loss across naïve and memory cells in the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell compartment in patients with COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. However, certain T cell populations such as cytotoxic, activated and exhausted cells were expanded, especially in severe COVID‐19. We were able to identify apoptosis as a possible mechanism driving the lymphopenia and observed signs of T cell reconstitution at later time points from symptom onset.

The occurrence of peripheral lymphopenia has been described in several human acute respiratory viral infections.In severe COVID‐19, the extent of lymphopenia is closely linked to disease severity and mortality.Since disease severity in COVID‐19 is strongly associated with biological age, age‐associated decline in lymphocyte counts could in part account for the observed lymphopenia. A recent study, which showed a strong correlation between T cell lymphopenia, diminished SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cell responses and severe disease also suggested an association between age and decline in the fraction of naïve CD8 + T cells.Investigating the effect of age in our patient cohort poses a challenge, as this is strongly linked to disease severity. In our healthy control group, however, we saw a correlation between age and CD8 + T cell decline, while this was not the case for CD4 + cells. Despite association with disease severity and male gender, we did not observe CD8 + T cell reduction when comparing males to females among healthy controls, but saw a modest reduction of CD4 + T cells. Given the limited number of subjects, these data must be interpreted with caution, but it is conceivable that age and gender account for pre‐existing alterations of the T cell compartment that influence the course of COVID‐19 disease.

### Cisplatin-based therapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: implications of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 5592, a randomized trial [^45709686]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Older patients, even if fit, are often considered incapable of tolerating platinum-based systemic therapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 5592, a phase III randomized trial of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and compared outcomes in enrollees 70 years of age and older with those in younger patients.

Methods

ECOG carried out a randomized phase III trial of cisplatin plus either etoposide or paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naïve NSCLC patients with stages III(B) or IV disease. Toxic effects, response rates, and survival rates were compared between age groups. All P values were two-sided.

Results

A total of 574 patients enrolled from August 1993 through December 1994 were evaluable. Eighty-six (15%) were 70 years old or older. Older patients had a higher incidence of cardiovascular (P =.009) and respiratory (P =.04) comorbidities and nonanalgesic medication use (P =.02). Leukopenia (P<.001) and neuropsychiatric toxicity (P =.002) were more common in elderly men than in younger men. Elderly women lost more weight than younger women (P =.006). Other toxic effects were similar in older and younger patients. The proportions with clinical partial or complete response (21.5% versus 23.3%; Fisher's exact test, P =.66), median time to progression (4.37 versus 4.30 months; log-rank test, P =.29), and survival distribution (log-rank test, P =.29; median survival, 9.05 versus 8.53 months; 1-year survival, 38% versus 29%; and 2-year survival, 14% versus 12%) were similar in patients younger than 70 years and 70 years old or older. Baseline quality-of-life and treatment-outcome indices were similar. Equivalent declines over time in functional well-being occurred in both groups.

Conclusion

Response rate, toxicity, and survival in fit, elderly NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based treatment appear to be similar to those in younger patients, although patients 70 years old or older have more comorbidities and can expect more leukopenia and neuropsychiatric toxicity. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment.

### Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) [^4379de78]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Abnormalities

The percentage of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities in Studies 542 and 511 are presented in Table 5. Marked laboratory abnormalities are defined as a Grade 3 or 4 abnormality in a patient with a normal baseline value, or a Grade 4 abnormality in a patient with a Grade 1 abnormality at baseline.

6.2	Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatrics (2 to less than 13 years of age)

VIRACEPT has been studied in approximately 400 pediatric patients in clinical trials from birth to 13 years of age. The adverse event profile seen during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adults.

The most commonly reported drug-related, treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the pediatric studies included: diarrhea, leukopenia/neutropenia, rash, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Diarrhea, regardless of assigned relationship to study drug, was reported in 39% to 47% of pediatric patients receiving VIRACEPT in 2 of the larger treatment trials. Leukopenia/neutropenia was the laboratory abnormality most commonly reported as a significant event across the pediatric studies.

6.3	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRACEPT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Body as a Whole : hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, moderate to severe rash, fever, and edema).

Cardiovascular System : QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes .

Digestive System : jaundice.

Metabolic/Nutritional System : bilirubinemia, metabolic acidosis.

### Hematologic complications with age in shwachman-diamond syndrome [^9f1fd224]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this SDS Registry study found that, although marrow cellularity decreased with age, as expected for a genetic BMF condition, blood counts unexpectedly improved with age. Severe BMF was observed in early childhood, whereas myeloid malignancy was observed in later childhood/early adulthood. Further study is needed to investigate the potential mechanistic link between clonal hematopoiesis and improvement in blood counts with age for patients with SDS. These data will guide clinicians in discussions with families and in clinical decision making, as well as inform further work addressing improved surveillance strategies.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^17d653b0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases—MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials)—for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: “(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte).” We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Adult and Pediatric Patients ages 3 to 17 years of age

In the pooled, double-blind, adjunctive therapy studies in adult and pediatric patients ages 3 to 17 years of age, the most common (≥10%) adverse reactions in rufinamide-treated patients, in all doses studied (200 mg to 3,200 mg per day) with a higher frequency than in patients on placebo were: headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, and nausea.

Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years) with epilepsy treated with rufinamide in controlled adjunctive studies and were numerically more common in patients treated with rufinamide than in patients on placebo.

At the target dose of 45 mg/kg per day for adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (ages 3 to less than 17 years), the most common (≥3%) adverse reactions with an incidence greater than in placebo for rufinamide were somnolence, vomiting, and headache.

### Clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3e787346]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

Most common symptoms were fever (83, 95% CI – 66-97%, I 2 – 91%), cough (60, 95% CI – 50-70%, I 2 – 71%), dyspnoea (42, 95% CI – 19-67%, I 2 – 94%) and fatigue (33, 95% CI- 16-52%, I 2 – 88%) (Supplementary Fig. S14 - S16). Among gastrointestinal symptoms, anorexia (31, 95% CI – 1-67%, I 2 – 96%) followed by diarrhoea (18, 95% CI- 2-39%, I 2 – 91%) were most common ones (Table 2). In some studies, presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms were reported without any additional details or specific information (Supplementary Table S3). These have reported as ‘gastrointestinal symptoms’ only. Wherever, specific information was available, it was reported and analysed separately.

Laboratory and radiological findings

On analysing from various studies (Supplementary Table S4), lymphopenia (52, 95% CI – 24-81%, I 2 – 94%) and leukopenia (20, 95% CI – 6-38%, I 2 – 89%) were most commonly reported haematological findings while bilateral lung infiltrates (76, 95% CI – 44-100%, I 2 – 97%) was the most common radiologic finding (Supplementary Table S7).

Complications

Based on the few studies detailing complications in older patients (Supplementary Table S5), most common complications observed in these patients were secondary infection (34, 95% CI – 6-66%, I 2 – 91%), AKI (26, 95% CI 0–65%, I 2 – 98%) (Supplementary Table S7).

### Differential white blood cell count and epigenetic clocks: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study [^214de07a]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Empirical data corroborate the link between aging and variations in WBC count. Notably, research has shown that the absolute count of lymphocytes diminishes with age. Among lymphocyte subtypes, T cells and B cells exhibit a decline, while natural killer (NK) cells tend to increase with aging. Neutrophil and monocyte counts also increase with age, while eosinophils and basophils remain relatively unchanged throughout life. A multi-omic study suggested that immune cells are associated with epigenetic clocks through cell-type enrichment analysis. In a cohort of 2996 women from Quebec aged from 55 to 101 years, it was demonstrated that aging is associated with elevated neutrophil and monocyte counts, while lymphocyte count decreases.

Epigenetic clocks have emerged as effective indicators of biological age, providing insights that may differ from chronological age. These clocks are based on DNA methylation patterns at specific CpG sites that correlate with aging. The first-generation epigenetic clocks, such as HannumAge, trained on blood samples, and Intrinsic HorvathAge, a multi-tissue predictor, exhibit strong correlations with chronological age. The second-generation clocks, including PhenoAge and GrimAge, go beyond estimating chronological age by integrating data on disease and mortality risk factors, such as smoking habits, plasma protein levels, and WBC counts, to better predict health outcomes and longevity. Although epigenetic clocks were developed using bulk methylation data, which is inherently confounded by WBC counts, the causal relationship between epigenetic clocks and WBC counts remains relatively unexplored.

Mendelian randomization (MR) offers a method to establish causality between exposures and outcomes through genetic variants. UVMR (two-sample univariable MR) uses two different samples to focus on one exposure variable, while multivariate MR (MVMR) concurrently investigates the causal effects of multiple exposures on an outcome. McCartney et al. utilized the two-sample MR approach to study the genetic predictors of lymphocyte count on epigenetic age acceleration. Expanding on this analysis, we incorporate additional common WBC counts (neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts), leveraging the latest aggregated data, including from the Blood Cell Consortium, which integrate meta-analysis from the UK Biobank and other cohorts (Additional file 3 : Supplementary Table 1–2).

### Revised surveillance case definition for HIV infection – United States, 2014 [^7623cead]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV infection staging—age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte thresholds are defined by count or percentage and vary by age group. For <1 yr, stage 1 is ≥1,500 cells/µL or ≥34%; stage 2 is 750–1,499 cells/µL or 26–33%; and stage 3 is <750 cells/µL or <26%. For 1–5 yrs, stage 1 is ≥1,000 cells/µL or ≥30%; stage 2 is 500–999 cells/µL or 22–29%; and stage 3 is <500 cells/µL or <22%. For ≥6 yrs, stage 1 is ≥500 cells/µL or ≥26%; stage 2 is 200–499 cells/µL or 14–25%; and stage 3 is <200 cells/µL or <14%. The stage is based primarily on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count takes precedence over the CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage, which is considered only if the count is missing; exceptions specify that if criteria for stage 3 are met or if stage 0 criteria are met with a stage 3-defining opportunistic illness or with missing information, classification follows those specified rules.

PRECAUTIONS

Peripheral blood counts should be monitored weekly. Liver function should be monitored periodically. Neurologic examination should also be performed regularly (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Drug Interactions

Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents may become subtherapeutic during cisplatin therapy.

In a randomized trial in advanced ovarian cancer, response duration was adversely affected when pyridoxine was used in combination with altretamine (hexamethylmelamine) and cisplatin.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category D

See WARNINGS .

Nursing Mothers

Cisplatin has been reported to be found in human milk; patients receiving cisplatin should not breastfeed.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

All children should have audiometric monitoring performed prior to initiation of therapy, prior to each subsequent dose, and for several years post therapy. Advanced testing methods may allow for earlier detection of hearing loss in an attempt to facilitate the rapid initiation of interventions that can limit the potential adverse impact of hearing impairment on a child’s cognitive and social development.

Geriatric Use

Insufficient data are available from clinical trials of cisplatin in the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors or advanced bladder cancer to determine whether elderly patients respond differently than younger patients. In four clinical trials of combination chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, 1484 patients received cisplatin either in combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel. Of these, 426 (29%) were older than 65 years. In these trials, age was not found to be a prognostic factor for survival. However, in a later secondary analysis for one of these trials, elderly patients were found to have shorter survival compared with younger patients. In all four trials, elderly patients experienced more severe neutropenia than younger patients. Higher incidences of severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were also seen in elderly compared with younger patients, although not in all cisplatin-containing treatment arms. In the two trials where nonhematologic toxicity was evaluated according to age, elderly patients had a numerically higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience suggests that elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression, infectious complications, and nephrotoxicity than younger patients.

Cisplatin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.

### Hematologic parameters in pediatric uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria in sub-saharan Africa [^e36f92b2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Hematologic changes in acute and convalescent uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria have not been well studied, particularly in young children in Africa. Hematologic data were obtained for 3,044 children less than five years of age in seven randomized controlled trials at 14 sites. Using paired analysis between day 28 and baseline in patients without parasitologic failure as a proxy for malaria-induced effects, we found a statistically significant but clinically modest increase in leukocyte counts (5%) resulting from a larger increase in neutrophils (43%) than the decrease in lymphocytes counts (-16%); levels of hemoglobin and platelets decreased (-13% and -49%, respectively). Multivariate random effects analysis showed trends during follow-up (increased levels of hemoglobin, platelets and lymphocytes, and decreased levels of leukocytes and neutrophils) and identified explanatory variables. The risk of neutropenia increased with follow-up time independent of treatment outcome, and was lower with age, higher baseline parasitemia, and artemisinin combination treatment. These analyses provides information on hematologic variations caused by malaria.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^3de16d01]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV—CD4 monitoring and clinical use: However, some clinicians find it useful to monitor CD4 percentages because they remain relatively consistent, whereas absolute CD4 counts vary with age and changes in total leukocyte counts, and CD4 counts and percentages are best measured when patients are clinically stable; Low CD4 values should be confirmed by a repeat test at least 1 week after the first test to inform clinical decisions. CD4 count and percentage decline as HIV infection progresses; patients with lower CD4 counts or percentage values have a poorer prognosis than patients with higher values. Children with higher baseline CD4 percentages, younger ages (<4 years), or early ART initiation can potentially recover normal CD4 counts, whereas children with severe baseline immune suppression may not achieve normal CD4 levels with ART. Some clinicians find CD4/CD8 ratios useful for gauging overall immune dysfunction, and Guidelines recommend that all people with HIV receive ART, regardless of their CD4 count and clinical stage.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 Hodgkin lymphoma—Stage III–IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), SWOG S1826 randomized trial: In patients ≥12 years with stage III–IV HL (n = 970; median age 27.6 years [range 12–83.7 years]) receiving 6 cycles, nivolumab-AVD significantly improved 2-year progression-free survival versus BV-AVD, 92% vs 83% (HR for disease progression or death, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.3–0.65), with benefit noted among all age groups and IPS scores; 2-year event-free and overall survival were 90% and 99% with nivolumab-AVD versus 81% and 98% with BV-AVD (EFS: HR for death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.71; OS: HR for death, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15–1.03). Radiotherapy use was low in both arms (0.6% vs 0.8%). The majority of adverse events were more common with BV-AVD (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, transaminitis, peripheral neuropathy), whereas leukopenia and neutropenia were more common with nivolumab-AVD.

### A clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy alloimmunized to red blood cell antigens [^a28184b8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Intrauterine transfusion (IUT) timing and neonatal outcomes—procedural risk and gestational-age effects are outlined as follows: in a series of 937 IUTs performed for 334 fetuses, the risk of a procedure-related emergency cesarean delivery was 0.4% per procedure, and neonatal morbidities are highest at 35 weeks’ gestational age with a gradual decrease until 39 weeks’ gestational age; in the DIONYSIUS study of 1855 neonates treated at 31 centers in 22 countries, the incidence of neonatal exchange transfusion decreased from 38% at 34 weeks’ gestational age to 17% with delivery after 37 weeks’ gestational age, and neonatal exchange transfusions are associated with an 8-fold increased risk of proven sepsis, a 36-fold risk of leukopenia, a 31-fold risk of thrombocytopenia, a 27-fold risk of hypocalcemia and an 8-fold risk of hypernatremia; a Delphi survey of 107 experts from 25 countries reached a 78% consensus that IUTs should be continued until a gestational age between 35 weeks 0 days and 35 weeks 6 days’ gestation.

### The complete physical (...) [^dc8d03c7]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

It is quite common for patients to ask me for “complete physicals. ” I suppose if I were to ask why they wanted one, they'd be surprised by the question and say: “So I'll know that I'm healthy, of course. ” In these instances, I usually do a reasonably complete examination, emphasizing screening modalities appropriate for the patient's age, and ordering laboratory tests if the patient has a particular problem. For example, if the patient says he has been anemic in the past, I'll order a complete blood count. In the case of this patient, the results of his physical examination brought him a large bill, because he had misinterpreted what his insurance company was willing to pay for. And it brought me a headache, because his laboratory tests revealed mild leukopenia and a single elevated liver enzyme level, neither of which I could readily interpret, but which I didn't feel comfortable ignoring, either.

Medical students are the group most likely to obtain complete histories and perform complete physical examinations on a regular basis. Experienced clinicians generally conduct less-complete examinations and for good reason—their experience allows them to gather important details while filtering out findings that are of no consequence. To perform a “complete” physical examination does not mean returning to the ways of medical students; instead, our efforts should be directed toward maximizing the benefit to the patient. 4 revealed a strong belief that certain basic history and physical examination items should be covered. More than 90 percent of a mostly well-educated, affluent patient cohort believed that they should discuss diet, exercise, and tobacco and alcohol consumption with their physician on an annual basis. A similar percentage thought that blood pressure and major organ systems should be examined.

A majority favored the use of certain laboratory tests, such as Papanicolaou smear, mammography, serum cholesterol, and prostate-specific antigen. A significant minority also thought they should have an annual chest x-ray. These results support the notion that the periodic health examination should include elements of physical examination, lifestyle counseling, and preventive care. 5 While not cost-effective in the strictest sense, in healthy adults, evidence supports the efficacy of screening blood pressure, annual clinical breast examinations in women older than 40 years, and periodic pelvic examinations with Papanicolaou tests in sexually active women. Beyond these three is a larger group of possibly useful services for which the optimal frequency is not known. 6.

### Safety and effectiveness of ipragliflozin in elderly versus non-elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: subgroup analysis of STELLA-LONG TERM [^a92eabf9]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of frail older patients with diabetes must be carefully managed. Compared with elderly patients without diabetes, sarcopenia/muscle mass loss appears to be accelerated in elderly patients with diabetes ; thus, we paid careful attention to older patients with a lower BMI. In elderly patients in this study, the incidence of ADRs was significantly lower in patients with a baseline BMI < 25 kg/m 2 than ≥ 25 kg/m 2. Among elderly patients with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2, the incidence of ADRs was significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 75 years than in those aged 65 to < 75 years, suggesting that there is no increased risk of ADRs among the older frail population.

Statistically significantly greater decreases in WBC and eGFR were observed in non-elderly compared with elderly patients in this study. However, in both cohorts, mean values at the study endpoint were still well above those that would indicate even mild renal impairment or leukopenia. Further, studies of some other SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, tofogliflozin) in Japanese patients have also shown decreases in eGFR.

In addition to confirming the long-term safety of ipragliflozin in a real-world setting, this trial showed ipragliflozin to be effective in both elderly and non-elderly patients. Throughout 3 years of treatment, mean HbA1c and body weight were reduced from baseline at every measured time point in both age groups. These significant reductions in mean HbA1c were observed regardless of whether baseline HbA1c was < 8% or ≥ 8%. Significant reductions in mean HbA1c were also recorded in those aged ≥ 75 years, regardless of whether their baseline BMI was < 25 kg/m 2 or ≥ 25 kg/m 2.

This study was not without limitations. The main objective of post-marketing surveillance studies is to collect real-world data on the safety and effectiveness of a drug from as many patients as possible. As such as study, STELLA-LONG TERM had a single-arm, observational methodology and was carried out in routine clinical practice; therefore, it lacked a control arm and the results may have been influenced by variables other than the study treatment (such as the use of other antidiabetic drugs or selection bias in the use of ipragliflozin in elderly patients). Further, patients who completed or discontinued the study were not followed up, and these missing data need to be taken into account when interpreting our results. Finally, we did not specifically investigate factors relevant to sarcopenia or frailty in the elderly subgroup.

### Human innate immunosenescence: causes and consequences for immunity in old age [^8b96b4eb]. Trends in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen an explosion in research focusing on innate immunity. Through a wide range of mechanisms including phagocytosis, intracellular killing and activation of proinflammatory or antiviral cytokine production, the cells of the innate immune system initiate and support adaptive immunity. The effects of aging on innate immune responses remain incompletely understood, particularly in humans. Here we review advances in the study of human immunosenescence in the diverse cells of the innate immune system, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer and natural killer T (NKT) cells and dendritic cells-with a focus on consequences for the response to infection or vaccination in old age.

### Interplay between hereditary and acquired factors determines the neutrophil counts in older individuals [^3e60270d]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we assessed some of the inherited and acquired factors that contribute to the variability of peripheral blood traits in the older population. We performed a GWAS and assessed comorbidities and lifestyle factors in a cohort that included related and unrelated women from a population enriched for French ancestry from the province of Quebec, Canada. We identified genetic variants significantly associated with neutrophil and total white blood cell counts as well as those associated with platelet counts. A statistical interaction effect between age and genetic variants in the region of the GSDMA gene with neutrophil counts was found. In addition, aging was associated with higher neutrophil and monocyte counts and lower lymphocyte counts, reflecting a myeloid proliferation bias in hematopoiesis. This myeloid skewing was also present with cardiometabolic comorbidities. CH was not associated with peripheral blood cell traits and the myeloid proliferation bias.

### Predictors of acute hematologic toxicity in women receiving extended-field chemoradiation for cervical cancer: Do known pelvic radiation bone marrow constraints apply? [^fedc184a]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Toxicity endpoints

Toxicity grading was based on the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria. The HT endpoints included (1) any grade 2 or higher hematologic acute toxic effect, not including lymphopenia, and (2) grade 2 or higher leukopenia. These endpoints were chosen as a measure of toxicity because these may result in modifications to systemic or RT and were previously used as HT endpoints in RTOG 0418.Previously published HT endpoints were used for examination of their respective published BM dosimetric constraints in this patient cohort, which included HT ≥2,leukopenia ≥2,, neutropenia ≥2 (grade 2-4 neutropenia),HT ≥3 (grade 3-4 HT),and leukopenia ≥3 (grade 3-4 leukopenia).

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA, version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station). Univariate analysis was performed using the χ 2 test and logistic regression. The χ 2 test or Fisher exact test was used to compare rates of hematologic adverse events for patients with a volume of BM irradiation from 5 to 45 Gy (V5Gy to V45Gy), dichotomized at the median, and to compare rates of hematologic adverse events for patients according to dichotomized patient characteristics (African American race vs other; CCI), as appropriate. Tests for normality were performed for age and BMI with the Shapiro-Wilk statistic, and these variables were transformed using the natural logarithm to eliminate skew. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between natural log-transformed age or natural log-transformed BMI and hematologic endpoints. Variables with a P value <.1 from univariate logistic models were included in the multivariate model. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using logistic regression to correlate HT ≥2 and leukopenia ≥2 with patient or dosimetric characteristics. Firth's logistic regression was used in cases of rare events.Previously published BM constraints from both the nonextended-field setting (V10Gy ≥90%, V20Gy ≥75%, and V40Gy ≥37%),, and the extended-field setting were evaluated (BM mean >V30.3Gy)as described in each respective publication, including covariates. Associations of hematologic endpoints with V5Gy ≥98% and V20Gy ≥70% were performed using the Fisher exact test.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for treating newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults [^6c4e00b1]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

ASH 2020 AML in older adults—harms and burden comparing antileukemic therapy vs best supportive care: Low-quality evidence suggests the risk of febrile neutropenia is likely higher with intensive antileukemic therapy than with best supportive care (RR 1.13 [0.57-2.21]). For less-intensive therapy vs best supportive care, very low-quality evidence suggests there may be increased febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Low-quality evidence also suggests hospitalization may be 2 days longer, on average, with less-intensive antileukemic therapy. Patients receiving antileukemic therapy may experience more burden related to how treatment is administered, particularly with intensive therapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^67e5d447]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma in adults aged ≥60 years or adults unfit for intensive therapy—bleomycin considerations and outcomes: CHL in patients >60 years is associated with worse disease outcomes, and selection of standard versus alternate first-line regimens for patients who are older or unfit for intensive therapy should be based on clinical judgment and patient’s performance status. In HD10 and HD13, 287 patients ≥60 years with stage I–II favorable HL were randomized across ABVD/AVD strategies with IFRT; overall grade III–IV toxicity and grade III–IV leukopenia and infection were higher with 4 cycles of ABVD, and the results suggested limited benefit in patients ≥60 years receiving >2 cycles of bleomycin. Due to pulmonary toxicity, bleomycin should be used with caution in older patients; in a retrospective series of 147 patients aged ≥60 years treated with ABVD, all received at least 1 full course, 50 received RT (30–40 Gy), bleomycin was removed or reduced in 53 due to pulmonary toxicity, CR occurred in 117 patients (80%), and 5-year OS was 67% (95% CI, 58–74). Risk factors that may be associated with bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity include a history of smoking and use of G-CSF during treatment.

### Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes of SARS patients [^e2d36386]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytotic syndrome was documented in our second patient by bone marrow biopsy. Her initial clinical signs and symptoms included fever, severe leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Her hemophagocytotic syndrome was relieved after using IVIG. This treatment was suggested because of its immune modulating effect. The other 21 patients in whom severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia developed in the first week of disease also received IVIG therapy empirically. IVIG appeared effective for controlling leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: after infusion, the patients’ leukocyte and platelet counts increased to a significantly higher level (p = 0.002). The increase of leukocyte and platelet counts might have prevented some further complications directly resulting from severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, such as infection and tendency to bleed. Although we had no control group, we believe that IVIG may play a role in treating selected SARS patients.

Advanced age, co-existing conditions, high peak LDH level, and high initial ANC count had been reported as factors that predict poor prognosis for SARS patients. By univariate analysis, many parameters predicted death or respiratory failure (Table 3). However, by using the logistic regression model for multivariate analysis, severe underlying disease and high initial CRP level were the only two factors that predicted death; age, initial CRP level, and worst chest radiographic findings predicted respiratory failure. The role of CRP in predicting the outcome of SARS patients has not been discussed in previous studies. The discovery of CRP was reported in 1930 by Tillet and Francis. CRP parallels the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a useful marker for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery. Although initial CRP level was not available in eight patients in this cohort, our findings suggest that CRP also parallels well with the severity and outcome of SARS patients. Age and underlying disease were strongly correlated: all our patients with severe underlying disease were older (age >65 years). In a statistical model, these two factors might interfere with each other and lead to the conclusion that age, not underlying disease, was an independent risk for respiratory failure; however, the opposite was true. The worst chest radiographic finding outlined the most severe extent of impaired lung function. This finding might explain why it was an independent factor for respiratory failure. However, other conditions unrelated to pulmonary condition, such as underlying disease or complications during hospitalization, contributed to death. These findings might explain why worst chest radiographic finding was not an independent factor for death.

Leukopenia versus normal WBC

Compared to normal WBC, leukopenia (n = 112; 1.04%) did not significantly change the odds for any outcome (poor functional outcome OR adjusted 1.05, 95% CI 0.66–1.65; mortality OR adjusted 1.32, 95% CI 0.69–2.38; sICH OR adjusted 1.02, 95% CI 0.35–2.30) (Table 3).

WBC as a continuous variable

Increasing WBC was associated with poor outcome (increase by 1 × 10 9 /l, OR unadjusted 1.07, 95% CI 1.05–1.08) but not with mortality (OR unadjusted 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.01) and sICH (OR unadjusted 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.00) (Table 3). After adjusting for potential confounders the association of poor outcome (OR adjusted 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06) with WBC remained. The maximum variance inflation factor for this model was 1.06, suggesting no relevant collinearity disturbing the model.

### Radiation exposure and longitudinal changes in peripheral monocytes over 50 years: the adult health study of atomic-bomb survivors [^2a516ac5]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Enhanced inflammatory responses have been suggested decades after radiation exposure in atomic-bomb survivors, but cellular and molecular alterations related to prolonged inflammation remain unclear. This study, utilizing longitudinal haematological data over 50 years for 14 000 persons, investigated whether radiation exposure promoted the relative increase in peripheral myeloid cells, known as an aging-associated indicator of low-grade inflammation. Statistical modelling was performed with a linear mixed-effects model for leucocyte subsets, together with a proportional hazards regression model for all-cause mortality. We found that age trends in lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte percentages or counts differed before versus after age 60 years. Radiation dose was associated with monocyte percentages and counts, but not with the lymphoid-myeloid cell ratio. Radiation effects on monocytes were stronger after versus before age 60 years. Increases in monocyte percentages and counts were associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. Studies of chromosomal aberrations have shown a clonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells among atomic-bomb survivors. Therefore, radiation exposure might accelerate aging-associated clonal haematopoiesis, which could result in a long-lasting elevation of circulating monocytes.

### Distinct clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 in children during the pre-delta, delta and omicron wave [^30d28678]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit distinct features in terms of transmissibility and virulence. This study compared the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children during pre-Delta, Delta and Omicron waves.

Methods

Medical records of 1163 children <19 years of age with COVID-19 admitted to a designated hospital in Seoul, South Korea, were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory findings during the pre-Delta (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021; 330 children), Delta (July 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021; 527 children) and Omicron (January 1, 2022, to May 10, 2022; 306 children) waves were compared.

Results

Children during the Delta wave were older and had a higher proportion of fever ≥5 days and pneumonia than children during the pre-Delta and Omicron waves. The Omicron wave was characterized by younger age and a higher proportion of fever ≥39.0 °C, febrile seizure and croup. More children <2 years of age and adolescents aged 10 to <19 years experienced neutropenia and lymphopenia, respectively, during the Delta wave. Children aged 2 to <10 years had a higher incidence of leukopenia and lymphopenia during the Omicron wave.

Conclusions

Distinct features of COVID-19 were observed in children during the Delta and Omicron surges. Continuous scrutiny of the manifestations of variants of concern is needed for appropriate public health response and management.

### Neutrophils in community-acquired pneumonia: parallels in dysfunction at the extremes of age [^94e5ab00]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CAP can be considered as a sentinel event that signals high risk of short-term and long-term mortality and future readmission in both young children and older adults. Despite widespread use of vaccination, low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and improvements in sepsis care, mortality and reinfection rates remain high, with survivors often left with significant impairments. Age-related changes in neutrophil function may be one of the reasons that the very young and the very old are more likely to develop CAP, and heightened dysfunctional responses during infection may be causally associated with poorer outcomes and the increased likelihood of secondary infection. Our evolving understanding of immunology has allowed us to harness the immune system to better target cancer cells, and more recently, there is building evidence that immunosenescent neutrophil dysfunction can be improved. Individual cellular functions can be modified by focusing on selective pathways, but in the face of global cellular dysfunction at the extremes of age, there may be more benefit if fundamental biological pathways are targeted, such as cellular energetics. Modifying neutrophil therapeutically remains a challenge, but perhaps now is the time to walk the tightrope Heinrich Rohrer referred to and see if we can use this highly effective phagocyte to improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of PSTPIP1-associated myeloid-related proteinemia inflammatory syndrome [^d669334f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, PAMI is a monogenic autoinflammatory disease caused by genetic mutations. It can clinically manifest as pyogenic arthritis, PG, acne, trilineage hypoplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, and growth retardation, as well as autoimmune diseases. Storid and immunosuppressive therapy is partially effective and cytokine antagonists can be used in refractory cases. Leukopenia is the most severe manifestation and difficult to treat for our 3 cases. Steroid play an important role in the treatment of PAMI. Cyclosporine may be effective in the treatment of leukopenia. Patients with pyogenic arthritis with early age of onset, recurrent trilineage hypoplasia, and associated skin lesions should undergo whole-exome genetic testing to achieve early diagnosis and precise treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^b6bb310d]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) antibiotic-specific safety and preferences: Clindamycin is notably associated with Clostridioides difficile-associated colitis in adults, and prospective data on the risk of C. difficile colitis in otherwise healthy children receiving clindamycin therapy for 2 to 3 weeks for ABA do not exist, but the risk is likely lower than that documented in adults; colonization with C. difficile in children under the age of 2 years is common and its detection in young children with diarrhea does not necessarily indicate causation. In prospective pediatric pre-licensure evaluations of linezolid, hematologic abnormalities occurred but were no more frequent than with other antibiotics; long-term adverse events, such as optic and peripheral neuropathies, have been described in both adults and children receiving more than 4 weeks of linezolid, and linezolid is a reversible, nonspecific inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and should be used with caution in patients who are on an SSRI medication. For children, non-fluoroquinolone oral antimicrobial agents are preferred if appropriate for the clinical scenario; however, for convalescent therapy, oral therapy with a fluoroquinolone is preferred over parenteral therapy with a non-fluoroquinolone β-lactam. During fluoroquinolone therapy, attention is required for development of arthritis/arthralgia, primarily in weight-bearing joints, and families should return for evaluation should symptoms consistent with a persistent arthropathy or tendinopathy occur for more than 2–3 days during therapy. TMP/SMX may cause drug-related rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), as well as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
