## Question

What does the presence of foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the presence of foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus indicates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and histologic features of foveolar hyperplasia. Then, I should verify where in the esophagus it typically occurs and why that matters. Next, I will consider the main etiologies, including reflux, bile injury, medications, and metaplastic/dysplastic contexts. After that, I need to distinguish reactive foveolar hyperplasia from dysplasia and neoplasia. Finally, I should integrate clinical implications, surveillance, and management, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these threads together.

> Let me first confirm the definition and histology. Foveolar hyperplasia refers to an expansion of the superficial foveolar (pit) epithelium with mucin-rich cells, typically showing mucous cell prominence and often accompanied by mucin vacuolation; in the stomach it is classically seen in reactive gastropathy/chemical gastritis, and in the esophagus it reflects columnar metaplasia with foveolar differentiation rather than native squamous epithelium, so its presence outside the stomach signals metaplastic change at the gastroesophageal junction or distal esophagus [^113GfrEP] [^114kfLu7].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic context in the esophagus. True foveolar epithelium does not belong in the squamous-lined esophagus; when seen in esophageal biopsies, it indicates columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus, often in the setting of Barrett's esophagus or cardia-type mucosa extending above the Z-line, and it may also be seen in heterotopic gastric mucosa (inlet patch) in the proximal esophagus, which is a different entity altogether and should not be conflated with distal reflux-related metaplasia [^111mx6qP] [^1176DuRh] [^111mx6qP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check the main drivers. Chronic gastroesophageal reflux is a leading cause, with refluxed acid and pepsin provoking a cytokine-mediated injury that drives basal cell and papillary hyperplasia in squamous mucosa and, in columnarized segments, foveolar expansion as part of the metaplastic response; bile reflux may also contribute, particularly around the cardia and GE junction, where bile-related reactive gastropathy correlates with foveolar hyperplasia and intestinal metaplasia, and long-term potent acid suppression (for example with vonoprazan) can increase gastrin and drive foveolar hyperplasia in the stomach, with potential extension of metaplastic changes proximally depending on reflux dynamics [^111xAriL] [^111RTcHd] [^116KHb1e] [^111HB1eE].

> I should confirm the distinction from dysplasia. Foveolar hyperplasia itself is a reactive or metaplastic change and not dysplasia; however, foveolar-type dysplasia does exist in Barrett's esophagus and is characterized by architectural distortion and cytologic atypia with loss of polarity and increased mitoses, and it carries a higher risk of progression than conventional intestinal-type dysplasia, so I need to ensure that any foveolar expansion I interpret is not actually low-grade dysplasia mimicking hyperplasia, which requires careful architectural and cytologic scrutiny and often expert pathology review [^1157T5R5] [^112VH8C9] [^111fkeqK].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and risk. In nondysplastic Barrett's segments, foveolar hyperplasia reflects metaplastic columnar mucosa that may be biologically intestinalized even without goblet cells and can carry neoplastic risk, albeit generally lower than when intestinal metaplasia is present; nonetheless, the presence of any dysplasia, including foveolar-type dysplasia, substantially increases progression risk, and emerging data suggest that gastric-type dysplasia in BE may behave more aggressively than intestinal-type dysplasia, reinforcing the need for accurate grading and surveillance planning [^1147LxNb] [^112VH8C9] [^113RJ1dz].

> Next, I should review how to handle this at endoscopy. I need to ensure adequate sampling of the columnar segment using the Seattle protocol with at least eight biopsies when Barrett's is suspected, because goblet cells and dysplasia are patchy; I should avoid labeling short segments of cardia-type mucosa as Barrett's without intestinal metaplasia unless applying contemporary consensus definitions, and I should not biopsy a normal-appearing Z-line routinely, reserving biopsies for visible abnormalities or when the endoscopic extent meets accepted criteria for Barrett's [^115R9Gaf] [^113144cF] [^113Kitup].

> I will now examine management implications. If foveolar hyperplasia is identified in a nondysplastic Barrett's segment, standard reflux management and surveillance intervals based on dysplasia grade apply; if dysplasia is present, expert pathology confirmation and endoscopic eradication therapy are indicated, and in cases where potent acid suppression is used long term, I should monitor for hypergastrinemia-related gastric mucosal changes while recognizing that foveolar hyperplasia itself is not an indication to stop therapy absent other concerns [^112XKyF8] [^116QRtch] [^116KHb1e].

> But wait, what if the foveolar hyperplasia is in the proximal esophagus. I should double-check for inlet patch, where heterotopic gastric mucosa can show foveolar features and, rarely, dysplasia or carcinoma; routine biopsy of all inlet patches is not universally recommended, but any irregularity or symptoms should prompt targeted sampling to exclude neoplasia, and the presence of an inlet patch does not by itself establish Barrett's esophagus or mandate distal esophageal surveillance in the absence of distal columnar metaplasia [^111mx6qP] [^115s7pKt] [^116dYHye].

> Let me synthesize. Foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus indicates columnar metaplasia with expansion of foveolar-type mucous cells, most commonly reflecting chronic reflux injury at the distal esophagus or GE junction, and it may also arise in heterotopic gastric mucosa proximally; it is a reactive-metaplastic change that is not itself dysplasia but can coexist with or evolve toward dysplasia in the right clonal and inflammatory milieu, so accurate histologic grading, adequate sampling, and guideline-concordant surveillance are essential to align risk and management [^116KbrTw] [^1147LxNb] [^115R9Gaf].

---

Foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus reflects **reactive columnar metaplasia** [^114kfLu7] of the distal esophagus, most often due to chronic GERD and/or bile reflux [^114kfLu7] [^111RTcHd]. It is a **nonspecific adaptive response** [^114Mwm23] of foveolar cells to mucosal injury and is not itself dysplasia or malignancy [^1157T5R5]. Clinically, it signals ongoing mucosal injury and may coexist with Barrett's metaplasia; management focuses on reflux control and surveillance for dysplasia if Barrett's is present [^111Q1ozR] [^115i9c4Y].

---

## Histological features

Key histological features of **foveolar hyperplasia** include:

- **Foveolar cell expansion**: Enlargement and increased number of foveolar (pit) cells in the superficial epithelium [^114Mwm23].

- **Mucin-rich cytoplasm**: Clear to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical mucin [^112uiPgb].

- **Architectural distortion**: Elongation, branching, or tortuosity of foveolar pits [^113Jq4TC].

- **Chronic inflammation**: Often present in the lamina propria, reflecting ongoing injury [^114y252G].

- **Absence of dysplasia**: No cytologic atypia, loss of polarity, or mitotic abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and associations

Foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus is most commonly associated with **chronic GERD** [^notfound], reflecting reactive columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus in response to acid and bile exposure [^114kfLu7] [^111RTcHd]. It may also occur with bile reflux, which contributes to mucosal injury and reactive changes at the gastroesophageal junction [^111RTcHd] [^111YDLSJ]. Within Barrett's esophagus, foveolar hyperplasia can be seen in cardia-type or gastric-type mucosa and may coexist with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis of foveolar hyperplasia requires **careful histopathological evaluation** to distinguish it from dysplasia or other neoplastic processes [^113EijGN]. Key diagnostic considerations include:

- **Differentiation from dysplasia**: Foveolar hyperplasia lacks cytologic atypia, nuclear pleomorphism, and architectural complexity seen in dysplasia [^1157T5R5].

- **Immunohistochemical markers**: Ki-67 proliferation indices and aberrant proliferative patterns may aid in distinguishing reactive hyperplasia from dysplasia [^notfound].

- **Clinical correlation**: Endoscopic findings, reflux symptoms, and bile exposure history should be considered in conjunction with histology [^111YDLSJ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Foveolar hyperplasia itself is a **benign, reactive change** and does not confer a direct risk of malignancy [^notfound]. Its presence indicates ongoing mucosal injury, necessitating identification and management of underlying causes:

- **Reflux control**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and lifestyle modifications are recommended to reduce acid exposure and promote mucosal healing [^116W5u4T].

- **Bile reflux management**: In cases of bile reflux, therapeutic interventions may be considered to reduce bile exposure and mucosal injury [^111YDLSJ].

- **Surveillance**: If foveolar hyperplasia is associated with Barrett's esophagus, regular endoscopic surveillance is recommended to monitor for dysplasia or progression to adenocarcinoma [^115i9c4Y] [^11638Wuk].

---

## Conclusion

Foveolar hyperplasia in the esophagus is a **reactive epithelial change** [^114Mwm23] most often due to chronic GERD and/or bile reflux. It is a nonspecific adaptive response and not dysplasia or malignancy; management centers on reflux control and surveillance for dysplasia if Barrett's metaplasia is present [^11638Wuk].

### Non-adenomatous forms of gastro-oesophageal epithelial dysplasia: an under-recognised entity? [^1157T5R5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Foveolar dysplasia is an uncommon form of dysplasia that is encountered in the stomach and oesophagus in the context of Barrett's oesophagus. Glands displaying foveolar dysplasia also show architectural abnormalities that are similar to those encountered in adenomatous dysplasia. However, from a cytological point of view, foveolar dysplasia glands are lined by low-cuboidal to columnar epithelium, the cytoplasm is often clear with round-to-oval nuclei. Nuclear stratification as seen in adenomatous dysplasia is not common, although there is loss of nuclear polarity, pleomorphism and mitotic activity. It is important to distinguish low-grade foveolar dysplasia from regenerative change.

### What the gastroenterologist needs to know about the histology of Barrett's esophagus [^1147LxNb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians with an up-to-date summary of the terminology, classification, biological characteristics, and limitations of pathology regarding Barrett's esophagus and associated neoplastic precursor lesions in order to optimize decision making when evaluating patients with this disorder.

Recent Findings

This review summarizes some of the advancements and controversies regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria for Barrett's esophagus, difficulties that arise when trying to differentiate esophageal versus gastric epithelium in gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) biopsies, the histology and biology of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus including columnar metaplasia without goblet cells, and the limitations and diagnostic variability in interpretation of conventional and nonconventional types of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.

Summary

The definition of Barrett's esophagus is controversial, particularly with regard to the need to identify goblet cells in esophageal biopsies. In most cases, morphologic evaluation of GEJ biopsies cannot help distinguish whether the columnar epithelium comes from the distal esophagus versus the proximal stomach. Metaplastic esophageal columnar epithelium that does not contain goblet cells nevertheless is biologically intestinalized, shows molecular abnormalities, and has been shown to be at risk for progression to cancer, but the magnitude of that risk is unknown. Interobserver agreement on the presence, grade, and type of dysplasia remains moderate at best, particularly in light of the recent recognition of nonconventional types of dysplasia, such as foveolar, serrated, and early crypt dysplasia, which make interpretation difficult. Close cooperation between clinicians and pathologists is essential in order to ensure proper interpretation of biopsy results and to provide optimal surveillance and treatment decisions.

### Foveolar hyperplasia at the gastric cardia: prevalence and associations [^114y252G]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

In the gastric antrum and body, foveolar hyperplasia is a feature of reactive gastritis resulting from — for example, duodenogastric bile reflux and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence and clinical relevance of gastric cardiac foveolar hyperplasia.

Methods

The study population was drawn from a consecutive series of 1698 patients sent for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Only cases without chronic gastritis or Barrett's oesophagus were included. The final study population consisted of 307 patients.

Results

Foveolar hyperplasia was seen in the gastric cardiac mucosa in 31 (10%) patients with histologically normal stomach mucosa, but none had endoscopically noticeable hyperplastic polyps. Compared with patients without gastric cardiac hyperplasia, those with hyperplasia more often had chronic inflammation and complete intestinal metaplasia in the junctional biopsies (48% v 77% and 9% v 26%, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that chronic cardiac inflammation (odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3 to 7.8) and intestinal metaplasia of the complete type (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.1) were independent risk factors for cardiac foveolar hyperplasia. In univariate analysis, endoscopic erosive oesophagitis (endoscopy positive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) and the use of NSAIDs were not related to the presence of foveolar hyperplasia.

Conclusions

Foveolar hyperplasia in the gastric cardiac mucosa occurs in patients with histologically normal non-gastritic stomachs and may develop as a consequence of chronic inflammation limited to the gastro-oesophageal junction ("junctitis"). It is not associated directly with endoscopy positive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or the use of NSAIDs.

### Cellular plasticity, reprogramming, and regeneration: metaplasia in the stomach and beyond [^114Mwm23]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The mucosa of the body of the stomach (ie, the gastric corpus) uses 2 overlapping, depth-dependent mechanisms to respond to injury. Superficial injury heals via surface cells with histopathologic changes like foveolar hyperplasia. Deeper, usually chronic, injury/inflammation, most frequently induced by the carcinogenic bacteria Helicobacter pylori, elicits glandular histopathologic alterations, initially manifesting as pyloric (also known as pseudopyloric) metaplasia. In this pyloric metaplasia, corpus glands become antrum (pylorus)-like with loss of acid-secreting parietal cells (atrophic gastritis), expansion of foveolar cells, and reprogramming of digestive enzyme-secreting chief cells into deep antral gland-like mucous cells. After acute parietal cell loss, chief cells can reprogram through an orderly stepwise progression (paligenosis) initiated by interleukin-13-secreting innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). First, massive lysosomal activation helps mitigate reactive oxygen species and remove damaged organelles. Second, mucus and wound-healing proteins (eg, TFF2) and other transcriptional alterations are induced, at which point the reprogrammed chief cells are recognized as mucus-secreting spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia cells. In chronic severe injury, glands with pyloric metaplasia can harbor both actively proliferating spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia cells and eventually intestine-like cells. Gastric glands with such lineage confusion (mixed incomplete intestinal metaplasia and proliferative spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia) may be at particular risk for progression to dysplasia and cancer. A pyloric-like pattern of metaplasia after injury also occurs in other gastrointestinal organs including esophagus, pancreas, and intestines, and the paligenosis program itself seems broadly conserved across tissues and species. Here we discuss aspects of metaplasia in stomach, incorporating data derived from animal models and work on human cells and tissues in correlation with diagnostic and clinical implications.

### Gastric (foveolar) dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus: a clinical, molecular and long-term outcome study [^112VH8C9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The aim of this long-term progression study was to evaluate the clinical and pathologic features of gastric type dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE).

Methods

Baseline biopsies from 208 BE patients from the Seattle prospective cohort were evaluated for the type and grade of dysplasia (gastric or intestinal). Twenty-seven patients progressed to cancer and 181 did not over the long term follow up period. Patients with gastric or intestinal dysplasia were compared to each other with regard to their flow cytometric DNA content abnormalities and progression rates to cancer.

Results

Of the 59 patients with dysplasia at baseline, 12 (20%) had gastric dysplasia only, 24 (41%) had mixed gastric and intestinal dysplasia, and 23 (39%) had intestinal dysplasia only. Patients with any gastric dysplasia component (alone or mixed with intestinal dysplasia) showed a significantly higher rate of high-grade dysplasia (72% vs 23%, P < 0.001) at baseline and cancer development (47% versus 22%, P = 0.05), and a significantly shorter time frame to cancer development (32 versus 64 months, P = 0.008), as well as a longer BE segment length (P = 0.05), and higher rate of aneuploidy (P = 0.04), compared to patients with pure intestinal dysplasia. By multivariable analysis, gastric dysplasia showed a higher hazard ratio of progression to cancer compared to intestinal dysplasia patients.

Conclusion

Gastric type dysplasia is common in BE. Our study suggests that this type of dysplasia may represent a more aggressive form of neoplastic precursor than conventional intestinal type dysplasia.

### Clonal transitions and phenotypic evolution in Barrett's esophagus [^111VrSwn]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our clonal analysis data suggest that the cardiac-type gland is the fulcrum on which all other gland types observed in BE are based. Cardiac-type glands are characterized as simple glands, containing only foveolar cells at their surface and mucous-secreting cells at their base. It has been suggested that the presence of non–goblet cell–containing columnar-lined esophagus is associated with shorter lengths of BE and a lower cancer risk. However, we have previously shown that columnar-lined esophagus can evolve to cancer and can contain oncogenic driver mutations in genes such as TP53. We therefore propose that evolution of cardiac-type glands is the initial basis of progression within BE.

The presence of multiple gland phenotypes across the BE segment may yield important information on the risk of progression to dysplasia or cancer. In terms of physical size, BE changes very little, if at all, over time. This belies the rate of clonal evolution within the BE segment itself, in particular those patients who are at risk of developing cancer. Somatic genetic alterations and their diversity in particular are increased in BE before the onset of cancer. Controversy surrounds the evolution of genetic diversity, with some studies showing that this occurs only 2–4 years before the onset of cancer, whereas others indicate that BE from patients who progress always has increased genetic diversity. This applies to multiple cancer types. Here, phenotypic diversity is shown to be increased in the nondysplastic areas of BE surrounding dysplasia. We considered that analyzing biopsy specimens may underestimate SIs. Bootstrapping our sampling data, however, showed that a stable Shannon diversity index was achieved with the number of samples analyzed. Although our data support the hypothesis that increased diversity of metaplastic phenotype adjacent to dysplasia reflects overall lesion diversity (as supported by our extensive data sampling of nondysplastic biopsy specimens in Figure 1), we were not able to collect sufficient specimen material to represent the entire length of the Barrett lesion in those patients who had undergone EMR. Although our data cannot completely exclude the possibility that the presence of a dysplastic lesion drove the increased gland diversity in its neighboring mucosa, we consider this less likely because our data show that biopsy specimens taken before the onset of dysplasia also showed a diverse epithelial landscape, suggesting that phenotypic diversity arose before the onset of dysplasia. Indeed, data from the patients with neo-BE suggest that no phenotypic diversity is present in recently developed BE and that this is therefore acquired rather than inherent. Furthermore, in cases that progress to dysplasia, maximal genetic diversity has been shown to occur toward the gastroesophageal junction. Our samples taken in this same region also show phenotypic diversity regardless of segment length. Phenotypic diversity in BE and other conditionsin the progression to cancer is understudied, and when we consider that tissue diagnoses rely on phenotypic analysis, it is surprising that diversity is not investigated more often.

### Kyoto International Consensus Report on anatomy, pathophysiology and clinical significance of the gastro-oesophageal junction [^1176DuRh]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Although a number of reports have shown that the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) increases with the extent of Barrett's metaplastic mucosa, it is important to consider several factors that can confound the interpretation of endoscopic and histologic findings in BO. First, a relative large number of biopsy samples (minimum of eight) is required to demonstrate IM reliably, and community endoscopists often do not take so many biopsies in routine clinical practice. Indeed, one study documented poor reproducibility in the finding of IM between two endoscopic examinations performed only 6 weeks apart, even when a fairly large number of biopsy samples were taken (mean 13.6 for the first endoscopy and 11.4 for the second endoscopy) conducted in a short interval (6 weeks). Therefore, a substantial proportion of metaplastic oesophageal epithelium containing IM would be missed, and hence cannot be diagnosed as BO. Second, 'pseudogoblet cells' are mucinous, gastric foveolar-type columnar cells that have distended cytoplasmic vacuoles that give them a histologic appearance close to goblet cells. Biopsies containing pseudogoblet cells can easily be misinterpreted as IM, which has been surmised as a clonal event involving multiple cell lineages. Third, in biopsies of the GOJ region, it can be difficult to distinguish IM involving the stomach (an atrophic condition frequently caused by chronic H. pylori infection) from IM in the metaplastic oesophageal mucosa, since gastric and oesophageal IM can appear identical even when immunohistochemical staining or with gene expression analyses are employed. Moreover, IM at the GOJ can exhibit proliferative abnormalities similar to those found in the IM of long-segment BO, implying an increased risk for neoplastic changes. Fourth, a longitudinal follow-up study found that a substantial proportion of patients with IM on an initial endoscopy did not have positive IM in a follow-up procedure and, conversely, those without IM at the first endoscopy often had IM found in the follow-up. Finally, a number of emerging studies have shown that metaplastic columnar epithelium without IM can have genetic alterations that might predispose to cancer development. Indeed, several reports have contended that adenocarcinomas can develop in columnar epithelium without IM(see CQ 21 for more detailed explanation). Collectively, these problems raise a serious concern regarding the validity of the requirement for IM and the minimum length definition of 1 cm as diagnostic criteria for BO. Thus, in this consensus conference, the new definition of BO was created in which both length limitation and the presence of IM were lifted from the definition of BO.

### Unraveling the mystery of the gastroesophageal junction: a pathologist's perspective [^114kfLu7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), which is defined as the point where the distal esophagus joins the proximal stomach (cardia), is a short anatomic area that is commonly exposed to the injurious effects of GERD and/or Helicobacter pylori infection. These disorders often lead to inflammation and intestinal metaplasia (IM) of this anatomic region. The true gastric cardia is an extremely short segment (< 0.4 mm) of mucosa that is typically composed of pure mucous glands, or mixed mucous/oxyntic glands that are histologically indistinguishable from metaplastic mucinous columnar epithelium of the distal esophagus. In patients with GERD, whether physiologic or pathologic, the length of cardia-type epithelium increases and extends proximally above the level of the anatomic GEJ into the distal esophagus. Columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus represents a squamous to columnar metaplastic reaction that develops from an esophageal stem cell and may pass through an intermediate phase characterized by the presence of a type of epithelium that possesses a mixture of squamous and columnar features, termed multilayered epithelium. In contrast, IM of the gastric cardia represents a columnar to columnar cell metaplastic reaction that develops from a gastric stem cell located in the deep foveolar compartment of the gastric mucosa. Intestinal metaplasia, particularly the incomplete type, is widely believed to represent the precursor lesion upon which dysplasia and cancer arises. The frequency of IM is probably greater in metaplastic columnar epithelium in the esophagus secondary to GERD, than in cases of true gastric carditis secondary to H. pylori, and may be a reason why there is a higher risk of carcinoma in the former compared to the latter. A variety of clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and histochemical methods can be used to distinguish GERD-induced columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus from H. pylori-induced inflammation of true gastric cardia, and these are outlined in this review, but further controlled studies are needed to critically evaluate these techniques. Further prospective trials are needed to adequately evaluate the different etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms and, most importantly, the risk of malignancy in these two conditions.

### Endoscopic mucosal tissue sampling [^113F9Rqs]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Esophagus — gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) mucosal biopsy states there is no established biopsy protocol in the absence of recognized Barrett's metaplasia or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and biopsy of endoscopically normal mucosa in GERD, when other diagnoses are not suspected, is not recommended. In patients with GERD symptoms, normal-appearing distal esophageal mucosa may show minimal change esophagitis defined as papillary elongation, basal cell hyperplasia, and dilation of intercellular space.

There were 277 patients with a complete set of biopsies from the gastric antrum and corpus, and, if endoscopically detected, from IP. The prevalence of IP in this subgroup was n = 43 (15.5%) by endoscopy, and n = 36 (12.9%) confirmed by histopathology. In gastric biopsies, Helicobacter pylori bacteria were detected in n = 45 (16%). Five of these were found with an IP, but only one had Helicobacter pylori detected also in his IP (Fig. 4). Overall, mild chronic inflammation of IP was present in 37, moderate in 4 cases (Figs. 4, 5 and 6). Active inflammatory infiltration of IP was always mild and occurred in 8 patients, including the one with Helicobacter pylori. The presence of chronic or active inflammation of IP was correlated neither with the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach nor with any of the gastroesophageal reflux parameters mentioned below.

### Ki67 expression in different epithelial types in columnar lined oesophagus indicates varying levels of expanded and aberrant proliferative patterns [^117UDGgb]. Histopathology (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate proliferative patterns in metaplastic columnar epithelia of the oesophagus, classified as oxynto-cardiac (n = 43), cardiac (n = 45) intestinal without dysplasia (n = 41), dysplastic intestinal epithelium (n = 25), and adenocarcinoma (n = 15) by Ki67 immunohistochemistry.

Methods and Results

Abnormal patterns of Ki67 immunoreactivity were classified into (i) expanded proliferation, characterized by increased levels of Ki67 expression in the deep and mid third of the foveolar pit; and (ii) aberrant proliferation, characterized by positive staining in the surface epithelium and superficial third of the foveolar pit. A significant step-wise increase in the frequency of expanded proliferation was seen in oxynto-cardiac, cardiac, intestinal and dysplastic intestinal epithelium indicative of increasing levels of damage. Aberrant proliferation was absent in oxynto-cardiac mucosa, present at a low and similar level in cardiac, intestinal and low-grade dysplastic epithelia and at a significantly increased frequency in high-grade dysplasia.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that oxynto-cardiac mucosa occurs in a low damage environment and intestinal metaplasia in a high damage environment along the length of the columnar lined oesophageal segment. Aberrant proliferative patterns with Ki67 staining are not useful in differentiating reactive epithelia from low-grade dysplasia, but may prove useful in the diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia.

### The role of vonoprazan in patients with erosive esophagitis [^1128JGQn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastric histologic changes have been documented with vonoprazan. Hypergastrinemia is considered as one of the risk factors of gastric neuroendocrine tumors; therefore, cautions should be brought during the long-term treatment with vonoprazan although currently no relevant effects on gastric neuroendocrine cells were reported. A greater hyperplasia of parietal cells and G cells was found with vonoprazan than with lansoprazole, as observed in the abovementioned 4-year study. Small white protrusions called 'stardust' gastric mucosa, which was represented histologically by a mucus pool within a dilated duct surrounded by flattened glandular epithelium, appeared more frequently in the stomachs of patients receiving vonoprazan than in those not (4.9% versus 0.2%, p < 0.001). Vonoprazan-associated gastric mucosa redness, represented histologically by inflammatory cell infiltration, parietal cell protrusions and oxyntic gland dilatation, was reported in four cases treated with vonoprazan and disappeared after drug discontinuation. White globe appearance, which is a novel endoscopic marker useful in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer, was observed in the noncancerous stomach of a 68-year-old woman after 1-year administration of vonoprazan and then markedly reduced after changing to esomeprazole treatment. The first case of foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma was recently reported in a man with EE after 156-week maintenance therapy of vonoprazan 10 mg daily. Although the clinical relevance of these alteration remains unclear, a careful regular check of possible gastric histologic changes is necessary, especially during long-term administration.

### Guidelines on eosinophilic esophagitis: evidence-based statements and recommendations for diagnosis and management in children and adults [^114K2piD]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EAACI/ESPGHAN/EUREOS/UEG 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that additional histological features besides peak eosinophil count may include eosinophil microabscesses, basal zone hyperplasia, dilated intercellular spaces, eosinophil surface layering, papillary elongation, and lamina propria fibrosis.

### Vonoprazan as a long-term maintenance treatment for erosive esophagitis: VISION, a 5-year, randomized, open-label study [^116KHb1e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Acid secretion inhibitors are associated with hypergastrinemia, which can lead to gastric mucosal changes. Potassium-competitive acid blockers, such as vonoprazan, are more potent than proton pump inhibitors, but long-term safety data are lacking.

Methods

In this phase IV, randomized trial, patients with erosive esophagitis (EE) received induction therapy (once daily vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg; ≤ 8 weeks). Those with healed EE received maintenance therapy (once daily vonoprazan 10 mg or lansoprazole 15 mg) for 260 weeks (2:1). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with malignant epithelial cell alterations, parietal cell hyperplasia, foveolar hyperplasia, enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia, and G-cell hyperplasia.

Results

Overall, 202/208 patients (vonoprazan, n = 139; lansoprazole, n = 69) achieved healed EE and received maintenance therapy. No malignant alterations or gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) were observed; there was 1 adenoma in each group. At week 260, significantly more patients taking vonoprazan vs lansoprazole had parietal cell hyperplasia (97.1% vs 86.5%) and foveolar hyperplasia (14.7% vs 1.9%); proportions of patients with ECL cell hyperplasia (4.9% vs 7.7%) and G-cell hyperplasia (85.3% vs 76.9%) were similar. Median serum gastrin levels were higher with vonoprazan treatment vs lansoprazole (625 pg/mL vs 200 pg/mL). Incidences of adverse events were comparable for both treatments.

Conclusions

The exploratory VISION study assessed the safety profile of vonoprazan and lansoprazole over 5 years in Japanese patients with healed EE. Although gastrin concentration, parietal cell hyperplasia, and foveolar hyperplasia were higher in the vonoprazan group, there was no increased risk of malignant epithelial cell alterations and gastric NETs.

### Chemical gastropathy: a distinct histopathologic entity in children [^113GfrEP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chemical gastropathy, also known as chemical or reactive gastritis, is a well-described histopathologic entity in adults. It is characterized by presence of foveolar hyperplasia, vascular congestion, lamina propria edema, and prominent smooth muscle fibers in the absence of inflammatory cells in the gastric antral mucosa. There are no data in children on this condition.

Methods

All children showing features of chemical gastropathy in antral biopsy specimens were identified from pathology database from 1997 to 2000. Antral biopsy specimens were reviewed to assess the diagnosis of chemical gastropathy using standard diagnostic criteria. Charts of the children diagnosed with chemical gastropathy were reviewed for clinical course, endoscopic findings, and risk factors.

Results

Twenty-one children (12 male, 9 female) with chemical gastropathy were identified. Common presenting symptoms were epigastric pain and vomiting. Eleven children were taking multiple medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Endoscopy revealed esophagitis in 12, antral erythema in 7, and thick bile in the stomach in 7 children. Antral histology revealed foveolar hyperplasia in 19, congestion in 20, lamina propria edema and smooth muscle fibers in 16, and absence of inflammation in 19 patients. Acid suppression was the treatment in all patients. Mean follow-up duration was 11 months in 17 children. Symptoms resolved completely in 11 and partially in 6 patients.

Conclusions

As in adults, chemical gastropathy occurs in children. The factors associated with chemical gastropathy in this survey were gastroesophageal reflux disease and intake of multiple medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Randomised clinical trial: 3-year interim analysis results of the VISION trial to evaluate the long-term safety of vonoprazan as maintenance treatment in patients with erosive oesophagitis [^117TeM5M]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study participants

At the start of the healing phase, eligible patients were aged ≥ 20 years, H. pylori -negative, with endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis (Los Angeles Classification Grades A to D). Key exclusion criteria for the healing phase included: previous treatment with PPIs (including vonoprazan) within 4 weeks before the start of the healing phase, a history of H. pylori eradication, clinically apparent hepatic impairment, renal impairment or renal failure, history of PPI hypersensitivity or allergy, and presence of a malignant tumour.

Patients were eligible to enter the maintenance phase if they had endoscopically confirmed erosive oesophagitis healing (defined as Grade 0 according to severity classification of erosive oesophagitis, i.e. no mucous membrane disorder) on completion of the healing phase (week 4 or 8). Patients were excluded from the maintenance phase if they received a PPI other than vonoprazan or lansoprazole during the healing phase.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was histopathological evaluation of the gastric mucosa, specifically, the presence or absence of neoplastic/dysplastic alteration of epithelial cells, parietal cell protrusion/hyperplasia, foveolar hyperplasia, enterochromaffin-like-cell hyperplasia (endocrine cell micronest; ECM), and G-cell hyperplasia.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were endoscopic erosive oesophagitis healing rate at the end of the healing phase and erosive oesophagitis recurrence rate (recurrence was defined as LA Classification Grades A to D during the maintenance phase). Secondary safety endpoints were incidence of adverse events (AEs), endoscopic findings (presence or absence of fundic gland polyp, hyperplastic polyp, cobblestone mucosa, multiple white flat elevated lesions, and black spots), histological evaluation of gastritis according to the Sydney classification (inflammation [mononuclear infiltration], activity [neutrophilic infiltration], atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, H. pylori and incidence of gastric polyp).

Additional endpoints included serum gastrin level, pepsinogen I and II levels, pepsinogen I/II ratio, and serum chromogranin A level.

### Is there a set of histologic changes that are invariably reflux associated? [^117Kottt]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many histologic changes have been described in the esophageal squamous mucosa in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including dilated intercellular spaces, balloon cells, intrapapillary vessel dilation, elongated papillae, basal cell hyperplasia, acanthosis, intraepithelial eosinophils, Langerhans cells, and p53 protein overexpression. To define a set of histologic changes that are invariably reflux associated, we examined the histologic changes in esophageal specimens from normal controls, patients with GERD, patients without GERD but with a suspicion of other pathology, and patients with esophageal carcinoma. We also examined biopsy specimens from sites with differing endoscopic features, including cloudy white and reddened mucosa. A definitive set of reflux-associated histologic changes could not be defined from the small number of biopsy specimens examined in the present study. Histologic changes indicative of GERD are likely to be found somewhere in the esophagus in all patients with GERD, but these changes are nonspecific. A set of histologic changes that are invariably reflux associated may exist, but these changes are nonspecific. To develop a set of characteristic reflux-associated features, endoscopists may perform targeted biopsies from several sites with various endoscopic features and at different stages of disease.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^115NAEHa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

### Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: updated consensus guidelines for clinical management and directions for future research [^115xSiDr]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Background changes in the gastric mucosa of prophylactic gastrectomy specimens encompass mild chronic gastritis, sometimes displaying the features of lymphocytic gastritis. Occasionally, an inflammatory granulomatous reaction is observed at the periphery of some collapsing glands. Foveolar hyperplasia and tufting of surface epithelium, focally with globoid change, is also a frequent finding and, in some areas, vacuolisation of surface epithelium is very striking(figure 4).

Figure 4
(A) Foveolar hyperplasia (between arrows); in comparison to normal epithelium (below) cells are globoid (rounded with abundant cytoplasm). (B) Vacuolisation of the cytoplasm of superficial and foveolar cells. (C) Granulomatous reaction at the periphery of a disrupted gland.

Additionally, erosions and cysts may be found in non-neoplastic mucosa. In most prophylactic gastrectomies reported so far, intestinal metaplasia and H pylori infection are absent (families from North America and Europe). The exceptions are two cases from New Zealand in which H pylori infection was identified before surgery (several months or years) and a gastrectomy performed in a Portuguese patient (unpublished). An unsolved issue is the distribution of early lesions of HDGC in the stomach, as discussed above. Therefore it is essential that the location of biopsies and the positive regions within gastrectomy specimens are specifically reported. Additionally, a critical question that remains unanswered is how long early lesions of HDGC can remain indolent until there is emergence of clinical disease that may be rapidly progressive and lethal. Continuing collection of data is essential to help answer these questions — for example, in the rare individuals who opt for endoscopic surveillance until such time as invasive carcinoma is documented, as discussed above.

### The current spectrum of gastric polyps: a 1-year national study of over 120, 000 patients [^1173MSJR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To use a large pathology database (Caris Diagnostics) to analyze the frequency and associations of gastric polyps in a nationwide US population.

Methods

A total of 121,564 esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures from private practices in 36 states in the Caris Diagnostics database from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 were searched for the endoscopic designations of polyp, nodule, and mass, and for the pathological diagnoses that commonly present as gastric polyps. Pertinent demographic data, clinical indications for EGD, and information regarding Helicobacter pylori infection, reactive gastropathy, chronic inactive gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia were also obtained.

Results

A total of 78,909 of the 121,564 patients who underwent EGD had gastric biopsies. The prevalence of gastric polyps in the EGD population was 6.35%; 77% were fundic gland polyps, 17% hyperplastic polyps/polypoid foveolar hyperplasia, 0.69% adenomas, and 0.1% inflammatory fibroid polyps. Malignant neoplasms were slightly > 2%. None of the benign gastric polyps had a significant positive association with concurrent H. pylori infection; intestinal metaplasia was detected in the background of 52.2% of carcinoids, 29.6% of adenomas, 20.1% of xanthomas, and 13% of adenocarcinomas and hyperplastic polyps. Adenomas were rarely associated with synchronous adenocarcinomas.

Conclusions

The relative prevalence of fundic gland polyps in this population was much higher than that reported earlier, most likely because of the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. H. pylori- and atrophy-associated polyps, including adenomas, were less common than in earlier series.

### Intestinal metaplasia around the gastroesophageal junction is frequently associated with antral reactive gastropathy: implications for carcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction [^111RTcHd]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasing evidence suggests that bile reflux (BR) plays a major role in mucosal injury, leading to adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and distal esophagus. However, gastric BR is difficult to diagnose and investigate. Reactive gastropathy (RG), in the absence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other known causes, likely represents bile-mediated injury to the gastric mucosa. The goal of this study is to explore the association between antral RG and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) mucosal inflammation and intestinal metaplasia (IM). The pathology database was searched for patients who had gastric biopsies with a diagnosis of antral RG and concurrent gastric cardia/GEJ/distal esophagus biopsies from 2013 to 2015. Age- and sex-matched patients with normal gastric antral biopsies served as controls. Biopsies from the GEJ region were evaluated for histological changes, including inflammation, antral and pancreatic metaplasia, RG, the type of gastric glands, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) changes, and IM. Detailed clinical history and medication use (including PPIs and NSAIDs) were recorded. IM in the GEJ region was more frequent in patients with antral RG than in controls (33.0% vs. 5.2%, 95% confidence interval [18.3–37.3%]). In addition, inflammation, other mucosal changes around the GEJ (RG and foveolar hyperplasia), antral IM, and PPI-associated mucosal changes were also more frequently seen in patients with antral RG. Our results show that antral RG is associated with mucosal injury and IM around GEJ, suggesting a role of BR. Further studies are needed to study duodenogastric-esophageal BR and its role in development of proximal gastric and distal esophageal adenocarcinoma.

### Foveolar cell hyperplasia at the pyloric canal: an unusual cause of gastric outlet obstruction in 3 young children [^115eATuY]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Foveolar cell hyperplasia (FCH) in the pylorus is rare in children. Between January 1993 and December 2008, 3 children with pyloric canal FCH presented with gastric outlet obstruction and/or anemia and underwent operation because a clear diagnosis could not be established with conservative management. The median age of the children was 18 months. The onset of FCH at the pyloric canal is problematic, and its diagnosis is difficult to make in pediatric patients. Exploratory laparotomy is a reasonable method of establishing the diagnosis and managing the condition.

### Association of incidental positron emission tomography uptake in the esophagus to gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113X6jgn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Los Angeles (LA) classification is the most accurate means of assessing esophageal injury from caustic gastric acid with focused and greater concentrations in areas of erosive disease. 1 However, data from animal models and patients have proposed that an initial diffuse inflammatory pathway contributes to injury in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) mediated by interleukin (IL) 8, IL1β, 2,3 and hypoxia-inducible factors. 4,5 These observations demonstrate a lymphocyte predominant inflammatory process over course of 1–2 weeks associated with basal zone hyperplasia and dilation of intercellular spaces. 6 In cultured human esophageal epithelial cells and patients, it is further suggested that acid causes this chronic inflammatory reaction.

### Laparoscopic fundoplication using the excluded stomach as a novel management option for refractory bile reflux following one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) [^111YDLSJ]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Out of 850 OAGB patients, 17 (2%) developed refractory bile reflux. This observation is consistent with previously published data. This paper reports the 12 patients who underwent ESF and whose follow-up data are available.

We have OAGB follow-up data for up to seven years. In the present study, all but one patient developed reflux symptoms within the first 12 months after OAGB. The one exceptional patient started reflux symptoms 42 months following OAGB. There is no published literature investigating the time of onset of bile reflux after OAGB. However, Zarshenas et al. reported that the incidence of reflux following OAGB in 45 patients was highest during the first year. Authors believe that a similar observation in 850 patients substantiates the notion that the onset of bile reflux after OAGB is far more common within the first year.

We observed bile in the esophagus in one patient and the gastric pouch in eight patients. The presence of bile in the gastric pouch is expected after OAGB. Authors believe that bile in the esophagus during gastroscopy can be due to suction applied at the time and has limited diagnostic value. Dixon et al. have reported the histological changes associated with bile reflux gastritis in 1986. The Sydney scoring system has described a bile reflux index (BRI) to grade the resulting gastric mucosal changes. Nevertheless, histologic findings including foveolar hyperplasia or intestinal metaplasia in the stomach and esophagitis are not specific to bile irritation. To date, no histological marker specific for bile reflux has been reported. Principal studies reporting bile reflux following OAGB have diagnosed bile reflux based on clinical symptoms, and we adopted a similar approach. Ten of our patients reported yellow/green bitter reflux indicating bile. Furthermore, lack of symptomatic control by PPIs makes acid reflux an unlikely cause, favouring a diagnosis of bile reflux in this cohort. Ten out of 12 patients showed no significant erosive esophagitis despite symptoms, making it unlikely they had predominant acid reflux.

Endoscopy

Fifty-six participants (56/58; 97%) underwent UGIE, with findings summarised in Table 2. De novo gastritis or erosion/ulceration was observed macroscopically in nine participants and histologically in six participants. Sometimes, macroscopic gastritis was not supported by microscopic findings and vice versa. Six participants (OAGB, 2; SG, 1; RYGB, 3) had macroscopic gastritis in the absence of microscopic findings, whereas three (OAGB, 1; SG, 2) participants had converse findings. De novo microscopic esophagitis was identified in eleven participants (OAGB, 5; SG, 4; RYGB, 2); however, this was only macroscopically evident in 2 participants (SG, 1; RYGB, 1). One participant, post-SG, had de novo intestinal metaplasia on distal esophageal biopsies; however, the absence of macroscopic changes suggests a sampling error. Early histological features of gastritis (foveolar hyperplasia) were observed in one OAGB patient and esophagitis (basal cell hyperplasia) in nine participants (OAGB, 5; SG, 3; RYGB, 1).

Table 2
Results from upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and histopathological assessment

✱ p -value calculated using Fisher's exact test, significant values (p -value < 0.05) in bold

Overall, de novo macro- or microscopic gastroesophagitis was seen in eleven participants post-OAGB (58%), eight post-SG (57%) and five post-RYGB (22%). Conversely, resolution of macroscopic esophagitis was observed in all patients post-OAGB with no de novo development of macroscopic findings. There was no statistical association between de novo gastroesophagitis and positive scintigraphy or worsened reflux symptoms.

Gastric Fluid Analysis

Twenty-eight participants had pre-operative gastric fluid analysis for bilirubin (OAGB, 11; SG, 4; RYGB, 13), and 35 had post-operative analysis (OAGB, 14; SG, 7; RYGB, 14). No pre-operative samples measured elevated bilirubin (reference range 2–24 μmol/L). Post-operatively, elevated bilirubin levels were measured for three participants (157–498 μmol/L), all post-OAGB. No significant association was observed between elevated gastric fluid bilirubin and worsened symptoms, gastroesophagitis or positive scintigraphy.

### Foveolar hyperplasia secondary to cow's milk protein hypersensitivity presenting with clinical features of pyloric stenosis [^113Jq4TC]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Pyloric stenosis is one of several causes of infantile nonbilious vomiting. A 7-week-old boy presenting with symptoms suggestive of this was found to have a prepyloric lobular mass causing near-complete gastric outlet obstruction. The histology showed localized hypertrophic gastropathy with hyperplasia and tortuosity of foveolar cells reminiscent of Menetrier changes. Postsurgical excision, the child continued vomiting until removal of bovine and soy proteins from his diet. The clinical presentation, pathology, and response to restrictive diet suggested cow's milk protein allergy as key. The literature describing infantile focal foveolar hyperplasia and Menetrier disease is reviewed, stressing the rarity of allergy as cause.

### BMP feed-forward loop promotes terminal differentiation in gastric glands and is interrupted by H. pylori-driven inflammation [^113XdERV]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

It should be noted that our findings have some limitations. We identify stromal responses to infection. It will be important to explore in the future whether these changes are due to relative shifts in cellular abundance between the different stroma cell subtypes, infiltration of new cells or whether inflammatory cytokines can directly reprogram cells from BMP-expressing to BMP inhibitor-expressing cells. Moreover, our study focuses on a murine model and does not reveal whether the molecular changes observed here are also responsible for the progression of gastric epithelial pathology towards gastric cancer in humans. Thus, further investigations of the regulation and complex interplay of epithelial stem cells and their niches in the context of human H. pylori -driven pathology such as foveolar hyperplasia, metaplasia as well as a progression towards cancer will be important.

### The prevalence of gastric heterotopia of the proximal esophagus is underestimated, but preneoplasia is rare-correlation with Barrett's esophagus [^1112FbGK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Islands of gastric mucosa in the proximal esophagus are commonly designated as inlet patches (IP). They are considered to be heterotopic in nature in that they represent remnants of the columnar lining of the fetal esophagus. Discussed sequelae of clinical significance are laryngitis, esophagitis, esophageal web, stricture, ulcer, perforation, fistula or adenocarcinoma. Severe sequelae are rare, reported only in individual case reports. More than fifty cases of adenocarcinoma arising from an IP have been reported between 1950 and 2016 (literature reviews, recent case reports). Some experts recommend to take biopsies from IP in order to detect neoplastic or preneoplastic alterations, or advise follow-up examinations. Before such recommendations can be generalized, more data on the prevalence of preneoplastic alterations in IP are needed.

Data on the very prevalence of IP diverge a lot. Prospective studies have yielded higher prevalences, ranging from 1 to 14%, than studies with retrospective design, 0.18 to 1.6%.

Preneoplastic conditions or lesions of IP are not yet defined. IP may contain any type of mucosa of the normal stomach, i.e. antrum, corpus or cardia mucosa, but also intestinal metaplasia. In the stomach, Helicobacter pylori infection, mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia (Correa cascade) increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. In the lower esophagus, Barrett's esophagus is an established preneoplasia. But there are differing definitions of Barrett's esophagus regarding the type of columnar metaplasia. The risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma is lower with pure gastric metaplasia than with intestinal metaplasia. Among others, American and German guidelines require the presence of intestinal metaplasia to define Barrett's esophagus. Retrospective publications have indicated that there is an association between the presence of IP and that of Barrett's esophagus or even adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus.

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of IP in a prospective endoscopic study, to characterize the type of columnar epithelium within these IP, in particular with respect to preneoplastic conditions, and to investigate the association between IP and Barrett's esophagus.

### Kyoto International Consensus Report on anatomy, pathophysiology and clinical significance of the gastro-oesophageal junction [^111B5RUt]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Considering the remarkable advancement of imaging technology combined with AI, this will facilitate identification of dysplastic changes or early cancers arising from the GOJZ which can be managed with minimally invasive endoscopic therapy. It is important for all the endoscopists to describe the exact location of the neoplasms in relation to GOJ, presence or absence of BO, and aetiological factors such as GORD, gastric mucosal atrophy, and H. pylori as described above.

Although major issues have been resolved by this interdisciplinary expert consensus, the concepts adopted, and their usefulness, await further validation in the real world. In other words, we recognised a huge area of interesting research themes regarding the issues surrounding the GOJZ are wide open to us. Thus, we do hope this consensus document will play a role in promoting our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the GOJZ, thorough which better prevention and management on the diseases in the GOJZ can be offered.

Hyperplastic polyps

Hyperplastic polyps constitute 18–70% of all gastric polyps, are usually single or few in number and are more frequently observed in the antrum or adjacent to ulcers, stomas and gastrectomy sites. They appear as smooth, red buttered with whitish exudates (fibrin) and are dome-shaped (figure 7). They are usually small (0.5–1.5 cm), but may be larger and present as lobulated and pedunculated masses covered with superficial erosions. They are typically associated with H. pylori gastritis (25%), GA and GIM. Regression generally occurs after eradication of H. pylori (up to 70%).

Gastric hyperplastic polyps can reveal dysplasia (1.9–19%) and malignant transformation (0.6–2.1%), especially when > 1 cm and in the postgastrectomy stomach. A dysplastic hyperplastic polyp is associated with an increased risk of synchronous neoplastic lesions in the surrounding mucosa of approximately 6% of cases.

Small, white and flat plaques in the fundus have the appearance of hyperplastic polyps with a foveolar pit pattern, but are areas of focal foveolar hyperplasia or more specifically, hyperplasia of the foveolar epithelium. These have been described as multiple white flat lesions (MWFLs) and appear to be more prevalent in those taking PPIs. Histologically, the biopsy specimens from the MWFLs included fundic gland parietal cell protrusions and oxyntic gland dilatations. There was no evidence of intestinal metaplasia.

Management of hyperplastic polyps

Diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps and the absence of dysplasia should be confirmed by histology. The remainder of the stomach should be carefully evaluated for synchronous neoplasia, degree and extent of GA and H. pylori. H. pylori eradication should be considered in all cases before endoscopic resection as many polyps will regress, and a repeat endoscopy carried out 3–6 months after eradication. Polyps of > 1 cm, pedunculated polyp morphology or symptomatic polyps (obstruction, bleeding) should be completely resected. Even when H. pylori is present, those polyps > 3 cm should always be resected as the risk of dysplasia and cancer is high. Endoscopic surveillance is recommended to monitor the risk of further gastric neoplasia where there is evidence of dysplasia, GA or GIM. The endoscopic surveillance interval should be determined by the stage of CAG.

### Validation study of the esohisto consensus guidelines for the recognition of microscopic esophagitis (histoGERD trial) [^112w3FGQ]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), histology is generally believed to be a tool of limited diagnostic value. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of microscopic esophageal lesions as defined by the Esohisto consensus guidelines, which have proven high interobserver agreement in previous studies. In the prospective Central European multicenter histoGERD trial, we recruited 1071 individuals (576 females and 495 males; median age, 53 years; range, 15–93 years) undergoing gastroscopy for nonselected reasons. Biopsy material was systematically sampled from above and below the gastroesophageal junction. Overall, histologic diagnosis of mild and severe esophagitis was made in 423 (39.5%) and 296 (27.6%) individuals, respectively, whereas the squamous mucosa of 352 individuals (32.9%) was normal upon histology or showed only insignificant findings. Proliferative changes of the squamous epithelium, in particular basal cell layer hyperplasia, papillary elongation, and intercellular space dilation, were more common than inflammatory cell infiltration. The presence of microscopic esophagitis was associated with male sex (P = 0.009), patients' symptoms (P = 0.003), history of proton pump inhibitor intake (P < .001), and the endoscopic diagnosis of esophagitis (P < .001). Notably, among the 450 patients with no endoscopic signs of esophagitis (Los Angeles Category N), 41.8% and 17.1% were identified with mild and severe (microscopic) esophagitis, respectively, indicating higher sensitivity of histologic diagnosis. In conclusion, our data illustrate the value of histology in the workup of patients with reflux disease. We suggest that biopsies should routinely be obtained when patients undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for evaluation of GERD and may particularly be beneficial in patients with nonerosive reflux disease.

In contrast, in H. pylori -positive subjects, atrophic changes most frequently progress from the incisura to the proximal corpus mucosa, but also spreads from the GOJ mucosa to a more distal part in some cases. In a recent study that examined parietal and chief cell density in biopsy specimens, the incisura and the GOJ were the two sites where a highest rate of reduction of both parietal cells and chief cells was observed in patients with H. pylori infection resulting in the longer length of mucosa without parietal cells distal to the GOJ. This atrophic loss of parietal and chief cells distal to the SCJ mucosa can be accounted for as the consequence of extensive progression of atrophy from the distal gastric mucosa in the majority but may be due to the isolated atrophic change in the oxyntocardiac or fundic mucosa independent from the atrophic changes in the distal stomach. In a study with surgically resected specimens due to squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, isolated IM below the SCJ was noted in 21% of them, whereas IM were continuous from the distal stomach in the majority (42%). About half of the isolated IM at the SCJ would be oesophageal mucosal origin as indicated by the presence of submucosal oesophageal glands. Occurrence of atrophy and IM at the GOJ independent from those of the distal stomach in H. pylori -positive patients was reported in a Western population as well. Another recent report investigating a large number of biopsies taken at the GOJ in the US population also demonstrated that IM in three subset of patients, one with columnar metaplasia in the distal oesophagus (BO), second with distal gastric IM and the rest without BO or distal gastric IM (isolated IM at the GOJ).

It has been well-established that hiatus hernia is a prominent risk factor for BO (according to the traditional definition requiring the presence of SIM) irrespective of the length. Although more prospective studies showing the cardiac-type mucosa proximally extends with hiatus hernia are required, it would be reasonable to assume that this condition facilitates the proximal extension of the cardiac-type mucosa.

### The prevalence of gastric heterotopia of the proximal esophagus is underestimated, but preneoplasia is rare-correlation with Barrett's esophagus [^115iiAdF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The prevalence of IPs is often underestimated because IP may be overlooked or neglected. Regular biopsies for histopathology from any IP cannot be recommended because preneoplasia within IP is rare. Careful endoscopic inspection of IP, however, seems to be worthwhile in order to detect early malignancy and to differentiate IP from squamous cell neoplasia. The relation of IP with Barrett's esophagus, though clinically of minor relevance, may stimulate research on the common pathogenesis of IP and Barrett's esophagus.

### Pathology of eosinophilic esophagitis: what the clinician needs to know [^114GEqnb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE) is a clinical pathologic syndrome characterized by influx of numerous eosinophils into the esophageal epithelium. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the spectrum, as well as the characteristic location and distribution, of morphologic changes in EOE to maximize the diagnostic yield in mucosal biopsy specimens. The major pathologic features of EOE include eosinophilic microabscesses, surface layering of eosinophils often associated with surface sloughing of necrotic squamous cells, and peak eosinophil counts usually greater than 15 per high power field (hpf) within the squamous epithelium. Minor features, which are frequent but less specific, include marked basal cell hyperplasia, lengthening of lamina propria papillae, intercellular edema, and lamina propria fibrosis with chronic inflammation. The number, distribution, and location of intraepithelial eosinophils in EOE vary greatly between previously published studies. Thus, utilization of a diagnostic cutoff point for intraepithelial eosinophils in EOE, particularly in the absence of other major features of EOE, is currently considered unwise. In fact, some patients may show combined features of both gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and EOE, which complicates the histologic analysis of these patients. In contrast to GERD, EOE typically involves longer lengths of the esophagus, affects the proximal equally, or even more, than the distal esophagus, and the pathologic findings are often patchy in distribution. As a result, it is highly recommended that clinicians obtain biopsies from patients suspected of have EOE only after treatment with high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy, and that biopsies be obtained from both the proximal and distal esophagus in both normal and abnormal appearing areas.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^117UsbH3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) — diagnosis key concepts emphasize history, testing context, and histology. The table states "We advise eliciting a careful history of symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, including dietary avoidance and modification behaviors", noting "These behaviors can mask the severity of symptoms". It adds "Providers should consider assessing for features that may increase risk of EoE including multiple atopic disease and family history". For diagnostic accuracy, "We advise performing endoscopy on no treatment (e.g., no dietary restriction and no PPI) when EoE is suspected to maximize diagnostic sensitivity", because "Diet and medications, including intranasal or inhaled steroids for rhinitis, sinusitis, or asthma, may partially or completely treat EoE and lead to a falsely negative examination". Histologic context is highlighted: "Providers should consider obtaining information on other EoE histologic features in addition to the eosinophil count", since "Features such as basal zone hyperplasia, dilated intercellular spaces, and lamina propria fibrosis can indicate ongoing disease activity even in the absence of prominent eosinophilia". Baseline severity assessment is also mentioned: "Providers could consider assessing baseline EoE disease severity with the I-SEE".

### Long-term evaluation of biliary reflux after experimental one-anastomosis gastric bypass in rats [^11328zTc]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy remains regarding biliary reflux after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The aim of this "pilot" study was to analyze biliary reflux and its potential long-term consequences on esogastric mucosae in OAGB-operated rats.

Methods

Diet-induced obese rats were subjected to OAGB (n = 10) or sham (n = 4) surgery and followed up for 16 weeks. Evolution of weight and glucose tolerance was analyzed. Bile acid concentration measurement, histological and qRT-PCR analysis were performed in the esogastric segments.

Results

Weight loss and glucose tolerance were improved after OAGB. Mean bile acid concentration was 4.2 times higher in the esogastric segments of OAGB rats (compared to sham). A foveolar hyperplasia of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis and an eosinophilic polynuclear cell infiltration were observed in OAGB rats. An esophageal hyper-papillomatosis was observed in both groups (OAGB = 50%, sham = 50%). qRT-PCR analysis showed no differences between OAGB and sham mRNA levels of Barrett's esophagus or esogastric carcinogenic-specific genes. No intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or cancer were observed after a 16-week follow-up.

Conclusions

After a 16-week follow-up, this pilot study confirmed the good reproducibility of our OAGB rat model. OAGB rats had not developed any pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Further experimental studies with longer term follow-up are required.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^115FD2ov]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

6 ESOPHAGEAL EPITHELIAL CELLS

The normal human esophageal epithelium consists of non‐keratinized. The esophageal epithelium consists of the several layers including the stratum germinativum (basal layer) and stratum spinosum (suprabasal/prickle cell layer) and the stratum corneum (superficial/surface layer). The basal layer consists of proliferative cells and is not more than 3 cell layers thick or more than 15% of the total epithelial thickness. The suprabasal layer consists of transitional basal cells and the superficial layer consists of the simple and stratified squamous epithelial cells. In EoE, the esophageal epithelium and sub‐epithelium undergo extensive remodelling manifested as BZH, DIS, fibrosis, angiogenesis and smooth muscle hyperplasia. This epithelial and subepithelial remodelling is thought to contribute to endoscopic (esophageal rings and stricture formation) and clinical (dysphagia and food impaction) manifestations typical of EoE.

Histopathology of the gastric mucosa

No patient in either group showed neoplastic/dysplastic alteration of epithelial cells throughout the 156 weeks of treatment during the maintenance phase (Table 2). Hyperplasia of the parietal cells, foveolar cells, and G cells was more prominent among patients in the vonoprazan group than the lansoprazole group (Fig. 2; Table 2). After 156 weeks of maintenance treatment, parietal cell protrusion/hyperplasia was present in 102/109 (93.6%) vonoprazan-treated patients compared with 45/57 (78.9%) patients in the lansoprazole group. Inter-group differences for foveolar and G cell hyperplasia were marginally reduced at week 156, compared with weeks 48 and 108 (Table 2). There was no marked increase in the occurrence of parietal, foveolar, and G cell hyperplasia among patients in the vonoprazan group from week 48 to week 156. At week 156, one patient in the lansoprazole group developed atrophic ECM, while in the vonoprazan group one patient developed atrophic ECM and another developed hyperplastic ECM (Table 2; Fig. 3).

### Marked gastric foveolar hyperplasia associated with active cytomegalovirus infection [^1148MpLQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Transient protein-losing gastropathy with marked gastric rugal hypertrophy, a Menetrier's disease-like process, is an uncommon condition of unknown etiology. Most of these cases have been reported in pediatric patients; the clinical course is usually favorable. Cytomegalovirus infection has been implicated as a possible etiology in many of the reported cases. This type of Ménétrier's-like disease has not been well documented in adult patients. We describe here an elderly man who presented with severe protein-losing gastropathy and large polypoid nodules in the stomach. Gastric mucosal biopsies revealed marked gastric foveolar hyperplasia with morphological evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an aberrant topographic distribution of staining for transforming growth factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta receptor II, as described in other cases of Ménétrier's disease in the literature. This transient Ménétrier's-like disease associated with CMV infection should be considered in the differential of both pediatric and adult patients with GI protein loss.

Esophageal mucosal abnormalities, when accurately recognized, can provide clues to underlying pathology. In this article, we discuss strategies to enhance the detection and assessment of benign esophageal diseases during upper endoscopy by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). We provide a summary of skills required to perform high-quality EGD procedures from a technical standpoint, as well as a comprehensive description of the endoscopic appearance of the esophagus in health and in benign, organic diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), lymphocytic esophagitis and EoE variants, erosive reflux disease, medication-induced esophageal injuries, infectious esophagitis, and other acute and chronic esophageal injuries. Endoscopic classification systems are also described.

### Persistent basal cell hyperplasia is associated with clinical and endoscopic findings in patients with histologically inactive eosinophilic esophagitis [^114x8wVT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although eosinophil count is the standard used to monitor disease activity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), there are often disparities between patient-reported symptoms and eosinophil counts. We examined the prevalence of epithelial alterations, namely basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and spongiosis, among patients with inactive EoE (eosinophil counts below 15 following therapy) and aimed to determine whether maintenance of these changes in epithelial morphology are associated with persistent clinical findings.

Methods

Esophageal biopsies of 243 patients (mean age, 16.9 years) undergoing routine endoscopy at the University of Pennsylvania were evaluated for epithelial BCH and spongiosis. Univariable analysis was used to calculate the association between epithelial changes and symptoms as well as endoscopic findings and peak eosinophil count. We validated our findings using data from a cohort of patients at the University of North Carolina.

Results

The discovery and validation cohorts each included patients with inactive EoE, based on histologic factors, but ongoing BCH and spongiosis. Ongoing BCH, but not spongiosis, in patients with inactive EoE was associated with symptoms (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03–4.42; p = 0.041) and endoscopic findings (odds ratio, 7.10; 95% CI, 3.12–16.18; P < .001).

Conclusions

In patients with EoE, the presence of BCH might indicate ongoing disease activity, independent of eosinophil count. This might account for the persistent symptoms in patients who are considered to be in remission based on histologic factors.

GP gastric polyps

Histopathologic diagnosis of polyps was obtained for 127 polyps. The histological study showed hyperplastic polyps in 71 of the polyps (55.9%), followed by fundic gland polyps (n = 23, 18.1%) (Table 3). The "other" category included pancreatic heterotopias, lipoma and polypoid foveolar hyperplasia.

Histological analysis of the 127 GP

GP gastric polyps

H. pylori infection identification was carried out with the hematoxylin eosin staining in 64 patients (patients with gastric mucosa abnormalities). H. pylori infection was detected in 45 patients (62.3%). H. pylori was positive in 30 of the 49 (61.2%) of patients with hperplastic polyps.

The factors independently associated with hyperplastic polyps were the presence of anemia, being a single polyp, and sized ≥ 5 mm. The associated variable for fundic gland polyps, was only size < 5 mm (Tables 4, 5, 6). Our data do not support a relationship between PPI and fundic gland polyps.

### Revisiting Montreal: new insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^1125pDhU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Mucosal barrier function

Microscopic esophagitis, as the name implies, refers to the presence of esophageal lesions that are only visible upon microscopic (rather than macroscopic, i.e. endoscopy) investigation. The presence of microscopic esophagitis may be a marker of impaired mucosal integrity due to chronic exposure of the esophageal mucosa to noxious reflux components, and thus also a marker of symptoms that are related to reflux. Studies have reported the ability to distinguish between patients with GERD (with heartburn) and those without, and between patients with NERD and those with functional heartburn, using global histology scoring systems that combine the evaluation of a number of microscopic esophageal lesions (necrosis/erosion, neutrophil/ eosinophil intraepithelial infiltration, basal cell hyperplasia, elongation of papillae, dilated intercellular spaces (DIS)). The main implication of these findings is that microscopic lesions may be a marker for impaired mucosal barrier function, which increases the exposure of peripheral esophageal receptors to reflux. In support of this pathophysiological mechanism, addition of a mucosal protection agent (a hyaluronic acid-chondroitin sulphate-based bioadhesive formulation) to PPI treatment was recently shown to improve symptoms and health-related quality of life to a significantly greater extent than PPI alone in patients with NERD. The idea that variation in the degree of exposure of peripheral receptors to refluxate contributes to symptom perception is further supported by the recent observation that nociceptive sensory nerves are closer to the surface in the proximal and distal esophagus of patients with NERD than in controls or patients with reflux esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus. An earlier study by the same group found these nerve fibers were closer to the surface at the proximal esophagus than at the distal esophagus, consistent with the association of more proximal (vs distal) reflux with typical GERD symptoms.

### ACG clinical guidelines: clinical use of esophageal physiologic testing [^11397rnd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux symptoms — diagnosis with ambulatory testing rather than laryngoscopy: Laryngoscopic findings of erythema, edema, and/or postcricoid hyperplasia have low specificity for GERD and are common in healthy volunteers, and in small prospective cohorts of patients with laryngeal symptoms and laryngoscopic signs of LPR, pH impedance testing off PPI therapy confirmed GERD in less than half of patients. We recommend ambulatory reflux monitoring, specifically pH impedance monitoring performed off acid suppression, over laryngoscopy for a diagnosis of extraesophageal reflux (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Bile reflux is a common finding in the gastric pouch after one anastomosis gastric bypass [^116EgvAX]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our current study is the first prospective study on bile reflux after OAGB using both endoscopies and scintigraphic evaluations. Our study shows that 31.6% of patients had bile reflux in the gastric pouch in BRS, and one of these patients even had bile reflux activity in the esophagus. In our previous pilot study, we found bile reflux in BRS in 55.6% of patients, but no bile reflux in the esophagus. In the current study, we found new abnormal findings in postoperative UGE of 39.5% of patients. Most of these UGE findings were not evident macroscopically. Histologic findings of foveolar inflammation of the anastomosis and gastric pouch as well as gastric metaplasia and esophagitis are not specific findings of bile reflux, but may suggest effect of bile exposure in the gastric pouch and esophagus. These findings may also be at least in part due to gastro-esophageal reflux. It is possible that these findings will develop into macroscopic lesions after several years, and therefore a routine endoscopic follow-up is mandatory in all prospective trials. Keleidari et al. compared bile reflux frequencies after OAGB and RYGB. They used a Sydney system for classifying histological findings of UGE and self-reported reflux symptoms. They found bile reflux symptoms and a positive bile reflux index in 7.8% and UGE findings suggestive of bile reflux in 4.8% of OAGB patients. These findings were not statistically different compared to the RYGB group, and they concluded that bile reflux is as often encountered after OAGB and RYGB. However, the Sydney system is not intended for postoperative assessment, and it should include biopsies of the antrum, which cannot be obtained after bariatric bypass surgery. Also, the findings of Keleidari et al. are not supported by the findings of the YOMEGA trial, where bile was found in the gastric pouch of 16% of patients after OAGB and none after RYGB.

Best practice advice — expert centers and recurrent disease approach: BET should be performed by experts in high-volume centers that perform a minimum of 10 new cases annually, and the approach to recurrent disease is similar to that of the initial therapy; visible recurrent lesions require endoscopic resection, whereas flat areas of columnar mucosa in the tubular esophagus can be treated with mucosal ablation.

### Microscopic esophageal mucosal injury in nonerosive reflux disease [^116W5u4T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the current knowledge about the recognition of histologic esophageal mucosal changes in patients with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease and analyzes the technical factors relevant to their interpretation. Studies investigating histologic changes in individuals with nonerosive reflux disease were identified by systematic Medline/PubMed searches from January 1966 to October 2005. Dilation of intercellular spaces was the most consistently reported histologic change in the esophageal mucosa of patients with nonerosive reflux disease, being observed in 41%-100% of patients and 0%-30% of controls. The mean intercellular space width was at least 2 times greater in patients than in controls, irrespective of esophageal acid exposure. Basal cell hyperplasia was observed in 9%-90% of patients compared with 10%-55% of controls. Papillary elongation was observed in 0%-85% of patients and 5%-20% of controls. Both of these features were more prevalent in reflux disease patients with abnormal esophageal acid exposure. All histologic changes responded to acid-suppressive therapy. Inflammatory cell infiltration was seldom observed or had a similar prevalence in patients and controls. Disparities in reported frequencies of change among studies were most likely caused by methodologic factors, most importantly the use of different methods for identifying patients and controls, for histologic sampling, and for biopsy scoring. The reviewed studies suggest that at least two thirds of patients with nonerosive reflux disease have histologic evidence of esophageal injury. Additional work is needed to assess the potential of these histologic changes for the diagnosis and assessment of reflux disease.

ACG Barrett's esophagus guideline — biopsy protocol when BE is suspected: We suggest at least 8 endoscopic biopsies be obtained in screening examinations with endoscopic findings consistent with possible BE, with the Seattle protocol followed for segments of longer than 4 cm (quality of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: conditional). The summary of evidence notes that the distribution of goblet cells within a segment of BE may be patchy and that sampling error may lead to a false-negative examination for intestinal metaplasia (IM), especially in those with short segments of columnar-lined esophagus.

### The prevalence of gastric heterotopia of the proximal esophagus is underestimated, but preneoplasia is rare-correlation with Barrett's esophagus [^116dYHye]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The previously reported prevalence of gastric heterotopia in the cervical esophagus, also termed inlet patch (IP), varies substantially, ranging from 0.18 to 14%. Regarding cases with adenocarcinoma within IP, some experts recommend to routinely obtain biopsies from IP for histopathology. Another concern is the reported relation to Barrett's esophagus. The objectives of the study were to prospectively determine the prevalence of IP and of preneoplasia within IP, and to investigate the association between IP and Barrett's esophagus.

Methods

372 consecutive patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were carefully searched for the presence of IP. Biopsies for histopathology were targeted to the IP, columnar metaplasia of the lower esophagus, gastric corpus and antrum. Different definitions of Barrett's esophagus were tested for an association with IP.

Results

At least one IP was endoscopically identified in 53 patients (14.5%). Histopathology, performed in 46 patients, confirmed columnar epithelium in 87% of cases, which essentially presented corpus and/or cardia-type mucosa. Intestinal metaplasia was detected in two cases, but no neoplasia. A previously reported association of IP with Barrett's esophagus was weak, statistically significant only when short segments of cardia-type mucosa of the lower esophagus were included in the definition of Barrett's esophagus.

Conclusions

The prevalence of IP seems to be underestimated, but preneoplasia within IP is rare, which does not support the recommendation to regularly obtain biopsies for histopathology. Biopsies should be targeted to any irregularities within the heterotopic mucosa. The correlation of IP with Barrett's esophagus hints to a partly common pathogenesis.

Barrett's esophagus (BE) diagnosis recommendations — We suggest that a diagnosis of BE require the finding of intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus. We suggest that columnar mucosa of at least 1 cm in length be necessary for a diagnosis of BE. Patients with a normal-appearing Z line should not undergo routine endoscopic biopsies, and in the absence of any visible lesions, patients with a Z line demonstrating < 1 cm of proximal displacement from the top of the gastric folds should not undergo routine endoscopic biopsies. We suggest at least 8 endoscopic biopsies be obtained in screening examinations with endoscopic findings consistent with possible BE, with the Seattle protocol followed for segments of longer than 4 cm. We recommend that dysplasia of any grade detected on biopsies of BE be confirmed by a second pathologist with expertise in GI pathology.

### Squamous neoplasia in the esophagus [^1162Mu23]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Squamous lesions of the esophagus encompass a spectrum of disorders ranging from reactive changes and benign papilloma to squamous dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, which may pose diagnostic challenges especially in superficial biopsies.

Objective —

To provide a review on the typical features of squamous neoplasia in the esophagus, with an emphasis on the key diagnostic features as well as differential diagnosis from mimicking lesions.

Data Sources —

Data sources include published peer-reviewed literature and personal experiences of the authors.

Conclusions —

Accurate diagnosis of squamous neoplasia requires adherence to established diagnostic criteria, attention to subtle histologic features, and correlation with clinical and imaging findings. In difficult cases, multiple biopsies may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.

### Opening the black box: defining true-negative outcomes in esophageal cancer screening-a population-based study [^114j6ZUB]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study design

For this study, we enrolled the participants in the screening arm of the ESECC trial who underwent the baseline LCE and were pathologically diagnosed with no dysplasia (including normal, acanthosis, esophagitis, and basal cell hyperplasia) or had no visible LULs as the screened cohort, which were further divided into the ND-LULs and normal-stained groups.

Participants were assigned to the ND-LULs group if they were biopsied for LULs in the esophagus by endoscopists, and their highest pathologic diagnosis was non-dysplasia at baseline. The normal-stained group was defined as participants without any visible LULs in the esophagus during baseline endoscopic examination.

Two control cohorts were adopted to assess the baseline cancer hazard in these screened subjects (Fig. 1). One cohort comprised individuals in the unscreened control arm of the ESECC trial (the RCT control), and the other was an individually matched control cohort using the New Rural Co-operative Medical Care Scheme (NCMS) in Hua County, a medical insurance program covering 99% of local rural residents. Among approximately 1.18 million individuals registered in the NCMS in Hua County in 2012, we first excluded participants who had undergone endoscopic examination in prior research screening cohorts for EC (n = 29,486). For each individual in the screened cohort, candidate controls were first identified from the NCMS roster and matched by birth year, sex, and village. An identical enrollment date to that of the screened individual was assigned to these controls. After excluding those diagnosed with any cancers or who died before enrollment, we randomly sampled five controls without replacement to form the final population control group.

Covariates assessment

The potential risk factors for ESCC, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), family history of ESCC, smoking, eating speed, and ingestion of leftover food, were collected for all participants in the ND-LULs, normal-stained, and RCT control groups by an interviewer-administered electronic questionnaire at baseline.

The sociodemographic information of the participants in population control groups was extracted from the NCMS roster, including birth year, age, sex, and village.

### The ringed esophagus: histological features of GERD [^11699tVX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The "ringed" or "corrugated" esophagus is a cause of chronic dysphagia and recurrent food impactions in young men. It was previously believed to be a congenital condition, but recent case series have documented histological esophagitis in these patients. We have treated 19 patients with a ringed esophagus and are impressed that this represents an acquired condition with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as its etiology. Our goals are to present the largest case series to date of ringed esophagus, discuss the evidence for GERD, and suggest a strategy for its diagnosis and management.

Methods

The charts of 19 patients with a ringed esophagus were reviewed. A single pathologist interpreted all available esophageal biopsy specimens and graded them for the presence of GERD-related abnormalities. Phone interviews were conducted to assess response to therapy and confirm historical features obtained from medical records.

Results

The typical patient is a young man (median age 35, M:F 17:2) with long-standing dysphagia and multiple food impactions. Endoscopy revealed multiple concentric rings that persisted despite air insufflation and caused significant stenosis. Of the 11 patients with available histology, all had basal cell hyperplasia, papillomatosis, and an increased number of intraepithelial eosinophils. Other clinical features of GERD such as heartburn, endoscopic esophagitis, and hiatal hernia were often absent. Response to dilation and acid suppression was good.

Conclusions

The uniform presence of histological esophagitis with intraepithelial eosinophils, basal cell hyperplasia, and papillary lengthening strongly implicates GERD in the pathogenesis of the adult ringed esophagus. In addition to a series of gradual esophageal dilations, we suggest using a proton pump inhibitor to provide acid suppression.

### Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction: a pathologic perspective [^115wtKcW]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Barrett's esophagus is defined clinically by the presence of endoscopically evident columnar mucosa in the distal esophagus with histopathologic confirmation of the presence of intestinal-type epithelium. The etiology of Barrett's esophagus is understood poorly, but chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease is considered a major contributing factor. Barrett's esophagus is associated with the development of adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. It is believed that the development of a Barrett-type mucosa with intestinal goblet-type cells is due to an altered process of differentiation of pluripotent epithelial stem cells in response to the local injury and repair process. The potential identification and isolation of markers for screening purposes and possibly prognostic information are areas of considerable clinical and scientific interest.

### Elevated levels of chemokines in esophageal mucosa of patients with reflux esophagitis [^113KRSgP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Chemokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory conditions. However, there is little information on their profile in reflux esophagitis (RE). We sought to study esophageal mucosa levels of chemokines in RE.

Methods

A total of 32 outpatients with RE and 13 normal controls were studied. Endoscopic severity of RE was classified according to the Los Angeles grading system. Paired biopsy specimens were taken from the esophagus 3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction; one biopsy was snap frozen for measurement of mucosal levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES), and IL-1 beta by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, while the other was formalin-fixed for histopathological evaluation.

Results

IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES levels were significantly higher in esophageal mucosa of RE patients than those of the controls. IL-8 levels correlated significantly with the endoscopic severity of RE. Basal zone hyperplasia and papillary elongation, histopathological hallmarks of RE, were both associated with higher levels of IL-8 and MCP-1. The presence of intraepithelial neutrophils and eosinophils, which also indicate RE, was associated with high levels of IL-8 and RANTES, respectively. There were no significant differences in IL-1 beta levels between the RE and control groups, but IL-1 beta levels correlated significantly with the IL-8 production. Again, the IL-8 levels were significantly decreased after lansoprazole treatment.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that chemokines produced locally in the esophageal mucosa may be involved in the development and progression of RE.

### Impact of hiatal hernia on histological pattern of non-erosive reflux disease [^11437eDR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The clinical spectrum of GERD is diverse. The disease follows a rather benign course in most patients. Indeed, it is estimated that NERD accounts for up to 70% of patients with GERD. The pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development of GERD include delayed gastric emptying, frequent and transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, impaired esophageal clearance of regurgitated gastric acid, and HH+.

HH has recently re-emerged as an important factor in GERD. It may diminish lower esophageal sphincter pressure, promote acid reflux and compromise emptying of the refluxate from the distal esophagus, prolonging acid contact with the esophageal mucosa, a mechanism that could explain the association of HH with more severe reflux. Thus, although HH has been established as the strongest predictor of the presence and severity of esophagitis in GERD patients with esophagitis, there are no published data on the role of HH in symptomatic patients without endoscopic esophagitis.

Our prospective study suggests that HH+, even in patients with an esophageal mucosa that appears normal endoscopically (NERD), indicates the existence of histological effects.

Our population was characterized by similar clinical presentation, and HH was correlated not only with the presence of erosions (Figure 1) but also with the severity of the endoscopy findings (Figure 2). These results further support HH as a dominant predictive factor for erosive esophagitis, which has already been confirmed in previous studies.

In order to further investigate the role of HH in NERD patients, we studied the role of HH+ on the histological parameters of esophagitis. In our material, basal zone hyperplasia and loss of glycogen content was detected in all HH+ ERD patients and HH+ NERD patients (Figure 3). In contrast, no NERD patient without HH (HH-) exhibited similar histological abnormalities (Figure 4). These findings probably indicate that the development of NERD in HH+ patients is more closely related to the pathophysiology of ERD, and perhaps different from the mechanisms responsible for NERD in HH- patients.

Little is known about the relationship between HH and the histological variables in non-erosive esophagitis. Our finding that basal zone hyperplasia and loss of glycogen content are more frequently prevalent in HH+ than in HH- among NERD patients as well as the fact that basal zone hyperplasia, loss of glycogen content and infiltration with T-lymphocytes are more frequent in ERD than in NERD suggests the that HH contributes directly to the development of both GERD and NERD, perhaps through decreased acid clearance.

### Severity of basal cell hyperplasia differs in reflux versus eosinophilic esophagitis [^117ExzJV]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Basal cell hyperplasia of the esophageal epithelium is a frequent finding in children with histological evidence of esophagitis. The aim of this study was to compare the severity of basal cell hyperplasia in gastroesophageal reflux vs eosinophilic esophagitis.

Methods

A cohort of pediatric patients who underwent same-day endoscopy with esophageal biopsy and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring was divided into groups based on endoscopic and pH monitoring findings. Basal cell hyperplasia was defined as normal (≤ 25% of esophageal epithelial height), mild (26%-50%), moderate (51%-75%) or severe (> 75%). The severity of basal cell hyperplasia in patients with abnormal pH monitoring studies, both with and without endoscopic abnormalities of the esophagus, was compared with the severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.

Results

Twenty-seven children with abnormal pH monitoring were identified. Of these 27 children, 11 had endoscopic findings consistent with reflux esophagitis. Thirty patients with eosinophilic esophagitis were identified. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis had significantly increased severity (P < 0.001) of basal cell hyperplasia (87% severe, 3% moderate, 3% mild, 7%, normal) than patients with abnormal esophageal pH monitoring alone (11% severe, 4% moderate, 15% mild, 70% normal) or in combination with endoscopic abnormalities (18% severe, 9% moderate, 18% mild, 55% normal).

Conclusions

Basal cell hyperplasia is more severe in children with eosinophilic esophagitis than in those with reflux esophagitis. The finding of basal cell hyperplasia is a powerful clue into the underlying etiology of pediatric esophagitis and, along with epithelial eosinophil count, can be used as information to guide therapy.

### The prevalence of gastric heterotopia of the proximal esophagus is underestimated, but preneoplasia is rare-correlation with Barrett's esophagus [^1175j7Br]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of IP in relation to the limited number of published cases with adenocarcinoma originating from IPs challenges the recommendation given by some experts to obtain biopsies for histopathology from any IP. Furthermore, taking biopsies in the proximal esophagus often provokes retching or coughing which makes it an uncomfortable or even risky approach. In our series, the low proportion of cases with intestinal metaplasia and the lack of any neoplasia within IP do not support such a recommendation. However, any irregularity of the mucosal surface of an IP identified on endoscopic examination should prompt taking targeted biopsies.

An high association of IP with Barrett's esophagus was reported in previous publications, but not confirmed by other studies. We tested four different definitions of Barrett's esophagus for an association with IP. The reason is that in different guidelines there are conflicting definitions with respect to the histopathological verification of Barrett's esophagus. Some guidelines consider the presence of intestinal metaplasia as mandatory, whereas others require only columnar epithelium. Cardia-type mucosa in the lower esophagus has consistently been shown to be an acquired type of mucosa, and is likely to be a precursor of intestinal metaplasia and of adenocarcinoma as well. Therefore, we took into account also cases with endoscopically detected columnar lining in the lower esophagus ("CLE") that exhibited only cardia-type mucosa on histological evaluation, but no intestinal metaplasia. Only for this category of CLE, there was a significant association with IP.

One limitation of the study is that patients from a tertiary referral center were examined rather than a sample from the general population. Certainly, such patients are not representative of the general population, but currently there are no data to give consistent evidence that IPs might be significantly correlated with any other pathology, except for the relation with Barrett's esophagus.

Another limitation is the delay between the study and its publication. Advanced endoscopic modalities like high density resolution, near focus and virtual chromoendoscopy were not yet applicable, but might ameliorate the detection rate of IP. However, Vesper et al. found a high prevalence of IP (13.3%), which was comparable and not significantly different among standard definition videoendoscopy (12.7%), high definition endoscopy (14.4%), and narrow-band imaging (14.2%).

### Gastric histopathologic findings are similar in portal hypertension patients with and without endoscopic portal hypertensive gastropathy [^112QSiK2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is a diagnosis made based on endoscopic findings in the appropriate clinical setting. Biopsy may be taken during endoscopy for correlation, but the pathologist may encounter a myriad of nonspecific histologic findings. We undertook this study to evaluate contexts where a histologic diagnosis of PHG might be rendered on biopsy.

Methods

Two cohorts were established: stomach biopsy specimens from patients with cirrhosis or undergoing varices screening (n = 188) and stomach biopsy specimens with findings interpreted as PHG in the pathology report (n = 29).

Results

In the first cohort, cases with endoscopic varices more frequently displayed foveolar hyperplasia and acute inflammation, with no other histologic differences between cases with and without endoscopic PHG, clinical varices, and clinical cirrhosis. Cases from the second cohort showed no histologic differences when stratified for endoscopic PHG, endoscopic varices, and clinical cirrhosis. Our second cohort displayed the majority of charted histologic findings more frequently than the first. Our results indicate that neither an endoscopic appearance of PHG nor particular clinical diagnoses associated with PHG translate into specific histologic findings.

Conclusions

Although the histologic findings charted displayed increased frequency in pathology reports with an interpretation of PHG, histology should not be used reliably in the diagnosis of PHG.

### Heterotopic gastric mucosa of the esophagus: literature-review and proposal of a clinicopathologic classification [^115s7pKt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The prevalence of heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) in the cervical esophagus is frequently underestimated. Tiny microscopic foci have to be distinguished from a macroscopically visible patch, also called "inlet patch". Symptoms as well as morphologic changes associated with HGM are regarded as a result of the damaging effect of acid, produced by parietal cells in the mostly fundic type of HGM. We herein review the literature and propose a new clinicopathologic classification of esophageal HGM: Most of the carriers of esophageal HGM are asymptomatic (HGM I). Some individuals with HGM in the esophagus complain of dysphagia, odynophagia, or "extraesophageal manifestations" (hoarseness and coughing), without further morphologic findings (HGM II). Still fewer patients are symptomatic due to morphologic changes, i.e., esophageal strictures, webs, or esophagotracheal fistula (HGM III). Malignant transformation via dysplasia (intraepithelial neoplasia, HGM IV) to cervical esophageal adenocarcinoma (HGM V) is exceedingly rare (only 24 reported cases). In contrast to Barrett's esophagus, HGM should not be regarded as a precancerous lesion. Symptoms are more likely to occur in patients with inlet patch, whereas malignant transformation and adenocarcinogenesis can also occur in microscopic HGM foci. Asymptomatic HGM requires neither specific therapy nor endoscopic surveillance. Only in symptomatic cases treatment, i.e., dilatation for (benign) strictures or acid suppression for reflux symptoms, can be recommended. Patients with low-grade dysplasia in HGM might be candidates for surveillance strategies, whereas in cases of high-grade dysplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma oncological treatment strategies must be employed.

### Diagnosis of esophagogastric tumors [^112eh3BU]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that certain histological criteria may serve to indicate a good prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma. These include absence of subepithelial extension of the carcinoma cells, stage no higher than m2, and no neoplastic involvement near the resection margin. As endoscopic mucosal resection is becoming an accepted treatment option in this type of tumor, prognostic parameters of this type are of particular interest. By contrast, when metastases are detected in the celiac lymph nodes, it implies that the tumor is unresectable and that palliative treatment is required. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration has been found to be the most cost-effective option in this setting. Although autofluorescence endoscopy is being tested as a new technique for endoscopic diagnosis, its value is at present unclear. However, such developments may lead to improved diagnosis in the future, particularly in relation to the initial stages of carcinoma. For the moment, EUS is still the most widely accepted method for early diagnosis and staging. Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma appears to be commonly associated with head and neck cancer, but the cost-effectiveness of surveillance is a matter of controversy. With regard to Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma, p53 staining in areas of low-grade dysplasia appears to be helpful for predicting progression to high-grade dysplasia. The prevalence of short-segment Barrett's esophagus increases with age, but the length of the segment does not increase with time; the length probably depends on individual conditions, not merely on elapsed time. Helicobacter pylori infection appears to be associated with intestinal metaplasia at the esophagogastric junction. However, the most recent data appear to suggest that this scenario (usually termed "carditis") may be different from intestinal metaplasia in the lower esophagus, related to acid reflux. A follow-up program might be able to detect Barrett's esophagus adenocarcinoma at earlier stages, but only a minority of Barrett's esophagus patients are likely to be detected before neoplasia has developed. Gastric cancer appears to develop in individuals with H. pylori infection, but not in uninfected persons. In addition, those with severe gastric atrophy, corpus-predominant gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia may be at greater risk for gastric cancer. This again raises the question of H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic individuals with infection, and surveillance of patients with severe intestinal metaplasia. The most recent data appear to support the notion that healing of MALT lymphoma depends not only on H. pylori eradication and on the stage of the tumor, but also on individual factors (possibly immunology-related).

### Activating GNAS and KRAS mutations in gastric foveolar metaplasia, gastric heterotopia, and adenocarcinoma of the duodenum [^112uiPgb]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Results

The average ages of the patients with GFM, GH, and adenocarcinoma were 60 (range, 42–81 years), 57 (range, 25–84 years), and 64 years (range, 32–85 years), respectively. The presence of PAS-positive apical mucin was confirmed in all the GFM and GH lesions (Figure 1C and E). Evidence of active inflammation was observed in 14 GFM lesions (21%) and 1 GH lesion (1%) (Figure 1D and E). Twenty-one GFM lesions (32%) and eight GH lesions (10%) exhibited foveolar hyperplasia (Figure 1A and F).

Sequencing analyses identified activating GNAS mutations in 27 GFM lesions (41%), 23 GH lesions (28%), and 5 adenocarcinomas (17% Table 2, Figure 2A). Activating KRAS mutations were found in 17 GFM lesions (26%), 2 GH lesions (2%), and 11 adenocarcinomas (37%). An activating BRAF mutation was found only in one GFM lesion (2%). None of the normal duodenal mucosa specimens showed any genetic alterations. Taken together, 36 GFM lesions (55%), 23 GH lesions (28%), and 15 adenocarcinomas (50%) harboured at least one of these genetic alterations (Table 3). Multiple independent lesions of GFM or GH were analysed in 10 patients. Among them, the mutational statuses of the lesions were discordant in six patients, confirming the multifocality of these lesions (Table 4).

### Regulation of metaplasia and dysplasia in the stomach by the stromal microenvironment [^115X3gDp]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Progression of metaplasia to dysplasia

Metaplasia is a response to injury and a process by which normal mature cells of one tissue lineage are replaced by cells resembling a dissimilar and differentiated cell type observed in other tissues. The metaplastic response represents the most extensive example of lineage adaptation to acute and chronic injury in the stomach. Importantly, the stomach is frequently exposed to harsh insults, and metaplasia serves to protect damaged tissue in part via mucin production. In response to damage to the stomach, two different types of metaplastic lineages repopulate the gastric mucosa: pyloric metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia.

Pyloric metaplasia represents the initial response to the loss of acid-secreting parietal cells through the reprogramming of digestive enzyme-secreting cells into mucus-secreting cells at the base of the gastric corpus glands (Fig. 1). The reprogramming of lineages at the base of pyloric metaplasia glands is characteristic of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), which was first identified in 1999 following investigations in which mice and humans infected with Helicobacter felis (H. felis) or H. pylori, respectively, that showed atypical expression of a mucinous spasmolytic polypeptide (trefoil factor 2; TFF2) at the base of damaged glands. Common markers of SPEM cell lineages in humans and mice include CD44v9, aquaporin 5 (AQP5), and gastric intrinsic factor (GIF)/Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (GSII) co-positivity. Additionally, pyloric metaplasia exhibits an expansion of foveolar cells at the top of the gland, which is termed foveolar hyperplasia. Thus, pyloric metaplasia contains both foveolar hyperplasia toward the top of the gland and SPEM cell lineages at the bottom (Fig. 1).

### Activating GNAS and KRAS mutations in gastric foveolar metaplasia, gastric heterotopia, and adenocarcinoma of the duodenum [^112VhXAf]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gastric foveolar metaplasia in the duodenum is generally regarded as a reactive process caused by inflammatory conditions. However, we identified recurrent GNAS and/or KRAS mutations in a significant proportion of GFM lesions, implying a potential role of these genetic alterations in the development of these lesions. All the mutations, including a rare BRAF K601E mutation, are known to be activating mutations and have been previously reported in various types of tumours. Furthermore, both GNAS and KRAS mutations were more prevalent among GFM lesions associated with foveolar hyperplasia, suggesting that these genetic alterations induce the proliferation of metaplastic epithelium. Conversely, genetic alterations were rare among GFM lesions histologically associated with active inflammation. This observation indicates that these mutations do not have a major role in the development of inflammation-related GFM and is supportive of a reactive nature of these lesions. Overall, we interpreted these findings to suggest that GFM consists of a heterogeneous group of lesion that are related to at least two different conditions: genetic alterations and inflammation.

Gastric heterotopia is generally thought to be congenital in nature. However, unexpectedly, the present study identified GNAS and/or KRAS mutations in 28% of the GH lesions. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that these genetic alterations initiate the transdifferentiation of intestinal epithelium into well-organised oxyntic glands. Of note, these mutations were more frequently found in GH with foveolar hyperplasia. Therefore, these mutations might have occurred in the preexisting GH and led to foveolar hyperplasia. Thus, we think that the identification of GNAS and KRAS mutations does not necessarily exclude a congenital origin of GH. On the other hand, a microdissection-based analysis identified common GNAS mutations in both foveolar epithelium and oxyntic glands in three GH lesions. This suggests that GNAS mutations occurred in stem cells that can differentiate into both of the two epithelial components, but do not cause detectable morphological changes in oxyntic glands.

### Islands of squamous epithelium and their surrounding mucosa in columnar-lined esophagus: a pathognomonic feature of Barrett's esophagus? [^111YkWZZ]. Human Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

We examined 23 patients with columnar-lined esophagus (2 with long segment and 21 with short segment) endoscopically. After staining with Lugol's iodine solution, squamous islands were identified in the columnar mucosa in 18 (78%) of the 23 patients. When biopsy specimens were obtained from these islands, esophageal glands proper or their ducts were seen in 12 (67%) of the 18 cases. Because the identification of esophageal glands proper is a definite indicator that a piece of biopsy tissue is of esophageal origin, a diagnosis of columnar-lined esophagus could be made purely on the basis of the histological findings in these biopsy specimens of squamous islands. This was the case in 12 (52%) of the 23 patients examined in this study. Staining with Lugol's iodine solution, with subsequent biopsy of stained squamous islands, may assist in the diagnosis of short-segment columnar-lined esophagus. We also conclude, on the basis of our study, that columnar metaplasia of the esophagus cannot develop by direct outgrowth of epithelium from the ducts of esophageal glands proper. In addition, intestinal metaplasia was not always observed in the columnar mucosa around the duct orifices. From a practical point of view, biopsy specimens from columnar-lined mucosa of the esophagus do not always show intestinal metaplasia (specialized intestinal metaplasia).

### Histologic changes in the esophagus in patients with GERD… [^111xAriL]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Biopsies also showed widening of intercellular spaces, and basal cell and papillary hyperplasia developed without surface erosions. 2 This concept, that reflux esophagitis develops as an acid-peptic chemical injury, has been largely unchallenged. The esophageal histologic abnormalities thought to be typical of GERD have been attributed to refluxed gastric acid–related chemical injury to esophageal epithelial cells starting at the luminal surface. The acid-induced death of surface cells is assumed to stimulate hyperplasia of basal progenitor cells, make papillae appear elongated, and attract granulocytes. 3–6. Histologically, this acute GERD was a T lymphocyte–predominant form of inflammation, with minimal involvement by neutrophils and eosinophils. Furthermore, esophageal basal cell and papillary hyperplasia developed in areas without surface erosions.

If the traditional notion were true, that acute GERD is caused by refluxed acid directly inflicting lethal, chemical injury to surface epithelial cells, then basal cell and papillary hyperplasia would have been expected only in areas with surface erosions, and the infiltrating inflammatory cells would have been granulocytes primarily.
6. Biopsies of noneroded esophageal epithelium after PPI interruption revealed infiltration by T lymphocytes with basal cell hyperplasia and papillary elongation, consistent with the proposal that acute GERD is primarily a cytokine-mediated process. 7 Further studies are needed to establish that cytokines are indeed the cause of the histologic changes observed, but our findings suggest that those changes do not appear to be caused by acid-induced death of surface cells.

Dilation of esophageal intercellular spaces is a characteristic GERD feature, and intercellular space dilation was observed as reflux esophagitis progressed in study patients. It has been proposed that this dilation results from an acid-induced increase in epithelial permeability that enables chloride anion and water in the esophageal lumen to enter and expand the intercellular space. 33 The CLE observation that GERD is associated with an increase in blood-borne fluorescein in intercellular spaces raises the possibility that reflux-induced esophageal inflammation might increase esophageal vascular permeability. If so, then leakage of fluid from inflammation-damaged esophageal blood vessels also might contribute to dilation of intercellular spaces in GERD.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma… [^116KbrTw]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Barrett esophagus can be defined as the replacement of the squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus with columnar-appearing epithelium on upper endoscopic examination, with histologic findings of specialized intestinal metaplasia. Traditionally, BE has been defined as columnar-appearing epithelium extending at least 3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. However, it has become clear that shorter segments of columnar-appearing epithelium may contain specialized intestinal metaplasia, and thus have malignant potential. No standardized definitions have been established. Generally, long-segment and short-segment BE are defined, respectively, as the presence of a specialized intestinal metaplasia 3 cm or greater, or less than 3 cm — but the latter definition of short-segment BE may be problematic. The most important predictor of cancer risk in patients with BE is the presence and degree of dysplasia.

Biopsy specimens are graded as negative, indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia. 28 The progression from BE to adenocarcinoma is thought to occur in a stepwise progression from metaplasia to dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. However, the time for progression of LGD to HGD and of HGD to adenocarcinoma has not been well characterized. One study found that diffuse HGD, defined as dysplastic changes in more than 1 biopsy specimen or involving 5 crypts or more, was associated with a 3. 7-fold increase in the risk of adenocarcinoma compared with focal HGD, defined as dysplasia limited to a single biopsy specimen or. More patients had advanced-stage EAC in the nonsurveillance group than in the surveillance group, which, presumably, resulted in a decreased mortality rate in the latter group. Therefore, the decision to undergo screening endoscopy for chronic GERD symptoms should be individualized.

Once BE has been identified, surveillance endoscopy is recommended with a frequency that is dependent on the presence and degree of dysplasia. A biopsy negative for dysplasia can be followed with surveillance every 3 years, and LGD can be followed up with annual endoscopy. Patients with HGD, particularly multifocal and nodular dysplasia, should be referred for esophagectomy. Patients with focal HGD, particularly those who are not surgical candidates, can be followed up with intensive surveillance every 3 months.
