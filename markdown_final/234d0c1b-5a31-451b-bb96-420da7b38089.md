## Question

dual antiplatelet therapy for carotid artery stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to use dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in carotid artery stenosis, including symptomatic versus asymptomatic disease, perioperative management around carotid endarterectomy (CEA) versus carotid artery stenting (CAS), duration, agent selection, and bleeding risk mitigation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification by symptom status and stenosis severity. Then, I should verify the evidence base for DAPT in acute non-disabling stroke or high-risk TIA and reconcile guideline differences on duration. Next, I will examine perioperative antiplatelet strategies for CEA and CAS, followed by long-term maintenance therapy. After that, I need to consider special populations such as those with CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, intracranial stenosis, and combined carotid–coronary disease. Finally, I should confirm bleeding risk assessment, drug–drug interactions, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification because treatment hinges on whether the carotid stenosis is symptomatic or asymptomatic and on the degree of stenosis. Symptomatic disease generally confers a higher early recurrence risk and often warrants more aggressive early secondary prevention, whereas asymptomatic disease is managed primarily for cardiovascular risk reduction rather than stroke prevention per se, with revascularization reserved for selected high-risk anatomies or patients after shared decision-making [^1157zA9R] [^1178aiLa] [^115ACeou].

> I will now examine the role of DAPT in acute non-disabling stroke or high-risk TIA, where the strongest evidence exists. Trials such as CHANCE and POINT support early DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel for about 21 days to reduce early recurrent ischemic events, with the benefit concentrated in the first month and bleeding risk rising with longer durations, which is reflected in contemporary guidelines recommending 21 days followed by monotherapy and allowing consideration of up to 90 days in selected cases with careful bleeding risk assessment [^112ZKd8U] [^1157zA9R] [^116kpnps] [^113MyQpS] [^114yCNcp].

> Wait, let me verify the apparent discrepancy on duration. The ESC 2024 guidance suggests considering DAPT up to 90 days in minor stroke with internal carotid stenosis, whereas ESVS 2023 recommends 21 days of aspirin plus clopidogrel followed by clopidogrel monotherapy; these positions are reconcilable by noting that the 90-day extension is a consideration for selected patients with high-risk features and acceptable bleeding risk, not a blanket mandate, and that the core recommendation remains short-course DAPT with early transition to monotherapy [^116kpnps] [^113spx5V] [^1157zA9R].

> Hold on, I should verify the perioperative strategy for CEA because bleeding risk materially changes the calculus. Multiple meta-analyses and large registries show that DAPT around CEA increases neck hematoma and reoperation for bleeding without a consistent reduction in perioperative stroke, so aspirin monotherapy is preferred; if DAPT is already in place for cardiac indications, it should generally be stopped preoperatively when feasible, and if perioperative DAPT is considered in recently symptomatic patients, it should be short and carefully selected, balancing microembolic risk against hemorrhagic complications [^117V79Gs] [^114cDnR4] [^115ioUzF] [^113rC7xv].

> Next, I should review perioperative management for CAS, where DAPT is mandatory to mitigate stent thrombosis and distal embolization. Guidelines recommend aspirin plus clopidogrel initiated before the procedure and continued for at least 1 month, with some societies advising at least 4 weeks and then transition to monotherapy; observational data suggest that extending DAPT beyond 30 days may reduce ischemic events but increases extracranial bleeding, so duration should be individualized beyond the mandatory first month [^114L4YH9] [^114nS8gb] [^111XtdSC].

> Let me consider long-term maintenance therapy after revascularization and in medically managed patients. After CEA or CAS, long-term single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended; for symptomatic patients managed medically without revascularization, clopidogrel monotherapy is reasonable after the initial DAPT phase, while asymptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis may be considered for low-dose aspirin if bleeding risk is low, primarily for cardiovascular event prevention rather than stroke reduction per se [^113yZPRm] [^1138ES6i] [^113spx5V] [^111ncATc].

> I need to check special populations and agent selection nuances. For patients with CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, genotype-guided DAPT with aspirin plus ticagrelor modestly reduces recurrent stroke versus aspirin plus clopidogrel in non-sCAS populations, but this advantage has not been demonstrated in symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, so extrapolation is uncertain; in CAS, clopidogrel resistance is not rare and platelet function testing with substitution to ticagrelor can be considered in high-risk scenarios, acknowledging limited prospective outcome data [^114MobAn] [^114sGwsv] [^115VMSXC] [^112q1Nqy].

> But wait, what if the patient has concomitant intracranial atherosclerotic disease, which often coexists with extracranial carotid stenosis. In severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis (70–99%), extending DAPT to 90 days is reasonable based on observational and guideline syntheses, whereas for lesser degrees of intracranial stenosis the standard 21–30 day approach applies; I should confirm that this extension pertains to intracranial disease and not automatically to extracranial carotid stenosis without such features [^115HotE9] [^111tXgc3].

> I should double-check bleeding risk mitigation because it directly influences DAPT duration and agent choice. Before initiating DAPT, I need to ensure there is no intracranial hemorrhage on imaging, assess gastrointestinal bleeding risk with consideration of gastroprotection using a PPI that minimally interferes with clopidogrel (for example, pantoprazole), and individualize duration in older adults or those with prior bleeding, recognizing that prolonged DAPT increases extracranial hemorrhage without clear ischemic benefit in many carotid contexts [^111GQNVy] [^111cWVjU] [^111XtdSC].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. For symptomatic carotid stenosis not undergoing immediate revascularization, start aspirin plus clopidogrel within 24 hours for 21 days, then continue clopidogrel monotherapy, with consideration of extending DAPT to 90 days only in carefully selected high-risk patients with acceptable bleeding risk; for CAS, use aspirin plus clopidogrel for at least 1 month and then transition to monotherapy; for CEA, prefer aspirin monotherapy perioperatively and avoid routine DAPT; for asymptomatic stenosis, use aspirin monotherapy if indicated for cardiovascular prevention and avoid routine DAPT unless another indication exists [^116kpnps] [^113MyQpS] [^114L4YH9] [^115ioUzF] [^111ncATc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about DAPT in all large-artery atherosclerosis. Post hoc analyses from POINT and CHANCE-2 suggest that the incremental benefit of adding clopidogrel or using ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel may be attenuated in patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis compared with other etiologies, reinforcing that DAPT is not a panacea and that timely revascularization, when indicated, remains a cornerstone for risk reduction in appropriate candidates [^111C5AjH] [^114MobAn] [^1157zA9R].

> Finally, I should confirm that optimal medical therapy extends beyond antiplatelets. High-intensity statin therapy, strict blood pressure control, diabetes and lifestyle management, and timely evaluation for revascularization in symptomatic patients with appropriate stenosis severity are essential and should proceed in parallel with antithrombotic decisions to meaningfully reduce recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events [^1157zA9R] [^112XqW8r].

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is indicated in carotid artery stenosis for **short-term use after minor ischemic stroke or TIA** [^113MyQpS] to reduce early recurrence, typically for 21–90 days depending on bleeding risk and guideline choice [^116kpnps] [^114yCNcp]. DAPT is also required for at least 1 month after carotid artery stenting [^114L4YH9] to prevent thromboembolism, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy [^114nS8gb]. DAPT is **not recommended for asymptomatic carotid stenosis** or long-term use due to increased bleeding risk without added benefit [^111ncATc] [^114yALMR]. For carotid endarterectomy, single antiplatelet therapy is preferred; DAPT is only considered selectively if revascularization is delayed or bleeding risk is low [^115ioUzF] [^116Jm483].

---

## Indications for DAPT in carotid artery stenosis

### Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis

- **Minor ischemic stroke or TIA**: DAPT (aspirin 75–100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg) is recommended for 21–90 days after minor stroke or high-risk TIA to reduce early recurrence, balancing bleeding risk [^113MyQpS] [^116kpnps] [^114yCNcp].

- **Carotid artery stenting (CAS)**: DAPT (aspirin + clopidogrel) is required for at least 1 month post-stenting to prevent thromboembolism, then continue single antiplatelet therapy long term [^114L4YH9] [^114nS8gb].

---

### Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis

For asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, **no routine DAPT** is recommended; single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) is used for cardiovascular risk reduction, not stroke prevention [^111ncATc] [^115ACeou].

---

## Duration of DAPT

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of dapt** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Minor ischemic stroke or TIA | 21–90 days | Reduce early recurrence; balance bleeding risk [^115HotE9] |
| Carotid artery stenting | ≥ 1 month | Prevent thromboembolism; then single antiplatelet therapy [^114L4YH9] [^114nS8gb] |
| Carotid endarterectomy | Not recommended routinely; selective use only | Increased bleeding risk; single antiplatelet therapy preferred [^115ioUzF] [^117V79Gs] |

---

## Risks and benefits of DAPT

### Benefits

Benefits include **early recurrence reduction** — DAPT lowers early ischemic events after minor stroke or TIA [^113MyQpS] — and **peri-procedural stroke prevention** — DAPT reduces thromboembolic complications after CAS [^114L4YH9].

---

### Risks

Risks include **increased bleeding**, with higher rates of major bleeding, especially after CEA or prolonged use, and **no long-term benefit**, as DAPT does not improve outcomes beyond 90 days and increases bleeding [^114yALMR].

---

## Comparison with single antiplatelet therapy

Single antiplatelet therapy is appropriate for **asymptomatic stenosis** and for long-term management after the initial DAPT period in symptomatic patients [^111ncATc] [^114yCNcp]. DAPT is superior to single therapy only in the **early phase after minor stroke/TIA** or in the **peri-procedural period after CAS** [^113spx5V] [^114cDnR4].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ESC 2024**: DAPT for 21–90 days after minor stroke/TIA; ≥ 1 month after CAS; single antiplatelet therapy long term [^113MyQpS] [^114L4YH9] [^113yZPRm].

- **ESVS 2023**: Short-term DAPT after minor stroke/TIA; single antiplatelet therapy preferred after CEA; DAPT required after CAS for ≥ 1 month [^113spx5V] [^115ioUzF] [^114nS8gb].

- **AHA/ASA 2021**: DAPT for early secondary prevention after minor stroke/TIA; single antiplatelet therapy long term [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess and mitigate; use PPIs when indicated [^111cWVjU].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor DAPT duration to age, comorbidities, and stroke severity [^notfound].

- **Alternative agents**: Ticagrelor or cilostazol may be considered in clopidogrel resistance or intolerance [^114MobAn].

---

Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated for **short-term use after minor ischemic stroke or TIA** and for at least 1 month after carotid stenting, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy. It is not recommended for asymptomatic carotid stenosis or long-term use due to bleeding risk.

### Optimal periprocedural antithrombotic treatment in carotid interventions: an international, multispecialty, expert review and position statement [^1168HUi1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) treatment of patients undergoing extracranial carotid artery interventions is a subject of debate. The aim of this multidisciplinary document was to critically review the recommendations of current guidelines, taking into consideration the results of recently published studies.

Methods

The various antithrombotic strategies reported were evaluated for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients undergoing extracranial carotid artery interventions (endarterectomy, transfemoral carotid artery stenting [CAS] or transcarotid artery revascularization [TCAR]). Based on a critical review, a series of recommendations were formulated by an international expert panel.

Results

For asymptomatic patients, we recommend low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) with the primary goal to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular event rates rather than to reduce the risk of stroke. For symptomatic patients, we recommend dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) initiated within 24 h of the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent events. We suggest that following transfemoral CAS or TCAR, patients continue DAPT for 1 month after which a single antiplatelet agent is used. High level of evidence to support anticoagulant treatment for patients with carotid artery disease is lacking.

Conclusions

The antithrombotic treatment offered to carotid patients should be individualized, taking into account the presence of symptoms, the type of intervention and the goal of the treatment. The duration and type of DAPT (ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel) should be evaluated in future trials.

### Carotid stenosis and recurrent ischemic stroke: a post-hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^111C5AjH]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Randomized trials demonstrated the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. We sought to determine whether the presence of carotid stenosis was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and whether the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin was associated with more benefit in patients with versus without carotid stenosis.

Methods

This is a post-hoc analysis of the POINT trial (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) that randomized patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack within 12 hours from last known normal to receive either clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The primary predictor was the presence of ≥ 50% stenosis in either cervical internal carotid artery. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke. We built Cox regression models to determine the association between carotid stenosis and ischemic stroke and whether the effect of clopidogrel was modified by ≥ 50% carotid stenosis.

Results

Among 4881 patients enrolled POINT, 3941 patients met the inclusion criteria. In adjusted models, ≥ 50% carotid stenosis was associated with ischemic stroke risk (hazard ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 1.68–3.57], P < 0.001). The effect of clopidogrel (versus placebo) on ischemic stroke risk was not significantly different in patients with < 50% carotid stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50–0.93], P = 0.014) versus those with ≥ 50% carotid stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.45–1.72], P = 0.703), P value for interaction = 0.573.

Conclusions

The presence of carotid stenosis was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke during follow-up. The effect of added clopidogrel was not significantly different in patients with versus without carotid stenosis. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03354429.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^114MobAn]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) is a significant cause of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor ischaemic stroke (MIS). Patients with sCAS face an increased risk of early stroke recurrence, ranging from 2.7% within the first day of symptom onset to 18.8% within 90 days. Over the past decade, there has been a substantial decline in new stroke events for patients with TIA/MIS due to the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin. Randomised controlled trials have shown that genotype-guided aspirin-ticagrelor is superior to aspirin-clopidogrel in reducing stroke recurrence in patients with high-risk TIA or MIS who are carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF).

A post hoc analysis from the POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischaemic Stroke) trial indicated that the risk of ischaemic stroke events was increased in patients with sCAS. Meanwhile, the effect of aspirin-clopidogrel was not significantly different in patients with and without arterial stenosis. However, another exploratory study of THALES (The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial showed dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor was more effective in symptomatic large artery atherosclerosis. However, both analyses were restricted to comparing the addition of ticagrelor or clopidogrel to aspirin against aspirin monotherapy. Recently, the Roundtable of Academia and Industry for Stroke Prevention Conference emphasised the significant uncertainties in the existing evidence base regarding the rational intervention of sCAS. The CHANCE-2 (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events-II) trial indicated that aspirin-ticagrelor was modestly more effective than aspirin-clopidogrel in reducing the occurrence of new strokes among MIS/TIA patients who are carriers of CYP2C19 LOF alleles. However, it remains unclear whether genotype-guided treatment with aspirin-ticagrelor offers additional benefits for high-risk patients with sCAS. In this post-hoc study of the CHANCE-2 trial, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of two dual antiplatelet therapies — aspirin-ticagrelor vs aspirin-clopidogrel — in patients with and without sCAS.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^114sGwsv]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our analysis, the presence of sCAS was connected to an elevated risk of recurrent stroke in patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles, consistent with multiple previous studies, which have shown that noncardioembolic stroke patients with the ipsilateral atherosclerotic disease face a significantly elevated absolute risk compared with other subtypes of stroke. Our analysis emphasise the increased risk of stroke recurrence in patients with sCAS, despite receiving aspirin-ticagrelor. This underscores the importance of early screening for sCAS in patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles and implementing additional secondary prevention strategies. According to current evidence, patients with sCAS should receive intensive medical management. This includes implementing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for the initial 3 months following an ischaemic event. The 2021 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend intensive medical therapy for reducing stroke risk in TIA or stroke patients with carotid artery stenosis. This comprehensive approach includes antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering treatment and management of hypertension to reduce the risk of subsequent strokes effectively. In patients with sCAS who have anatomical or medical conditions that elevate surgical risks — such as radiation-induced stenosis or restenosis following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) — carotid artery stenting is a reasonable alternative to minimise the rate of periprocedural complications. Previous studies have also demonstrated the benefits of surgery in specific subgroups of sCAS. Both published in 1991, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy trialand the European Carotid Surgery Trial, demonstrated the advantages of surgery in specific subgroups of symptomatic patients. However, limited data has compared CEA with optimal medical therapy for those with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Furthermore, CEA has also been evaluated compare to carotid artery stenting (CAS).

Regarding medical management for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating low-dose aspirin (75–325 mg daily) in patients with > 50% asymptomatic CAS mainly for the prevention of late myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in carotid interventions [^114cDnR4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The importance of antiplatelet therapy for the management and prevention of ischaemic stroke cannot be overstated. Despite the established guidelines, there is no clear consensus on how to manage antiplatelet therapy during and after carotid interventions.

Objective

The objective was to undertake a systematic literature review and perform a meta-analysis to assess the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and stenting (CAS).

Data Sources

Electronic information sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL) and bibliographic reference lists were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting comparative outcomes of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy in CEA and CAS.

Methods

Primary outcomes were mortality and stroke within 30 days of intervention. Secondary outcomes were transient ischaemic attack (TIA), major bleeding, groin or neck haematoma, and myocardial infarction (MI). Dichotomous outcome measures were reported using the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Combined overall treatment effects were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects models.

Results

Three RCTs and seven observational studies were identified reporting a total of 36,881 CEAs and 150 CAS procedures. In CEA, there were no differences in stroke/TIA/death between single and dual antiplatelet therapy, but there was a significant risk of major bleeding (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00–0.01; p = .0003) and neck haematoma with dual therapy (RD, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01–0.06; p = .001). In addition, the rate of MI was higher in the dual therapy group than the single therapy group (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00–0.01; p = .003). In CAS, there was no difference in major bleeding or haematoma formation, but a significant difference in TIA in favour of dual therapy was identified (RD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.05; p = .003).

Conclusions

Dual antiplatelet therapy demonstrates advantages over single therapy only in CAS, as indicated by a reduced risk of TIA. Dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications in patients undergoing CEA.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^114ecHsb]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several clinical researches have investigated the impact of ICA on the prognosis of cerebrovascular events. As reported in a subgroup study of the CHANCE-2 trial, ticagrelor therapy reduced the stroke recurrence rate in patients with ICA. A randomised controlled trial included patients with acute large-vessel ischaemic stroke and found that the ticagrelor group had better clinical outcomes compared with the clopidogrel group. As indicated in this post-hoc study, intensive antiplatelet therapy with aspirin-ticagrelor did not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with sCAS. While intracranial and extracranial artery stenoses are frequently observed in patients with ischaemic strokes, they represent distinct phenotypes of systemic atherosclerosis and may require different treatment approaches. The finding from this study could be partly explained by the profile of patients who received aspirin-ticagrelor or aspirin-clopidogrel. The absolute rate of patients with ICA and sICA was higher in the aspirin-ticagrelor group than the aspirin-clopidogrel group. It is essential to note that the smaller sample size of sCAS results in a higher margin of error or a lower confidence level. This trend may be attributed in part to statistical factors. However, a subgroup analysis of the CSPS.com trial found that adding cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel did not have superiority in preventing vascular events, including recurrent stroke in patients with extracranial arterial stenosis. The potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed lack of treatment-by-sCAS interaction might be attributed to the ceiling effect in antiplatelet therapy for patients with sCAS. As no additional benefits were found with intensive antiplatelet therapies, carotid revascularisation may produce promising outcomes in this subgroup of patients. In addition to revascularisation procedures when necessary, promising therapeutic approaches, including anti-inflammatory drugs, novel lipid-lowering agents and direct oral anticoagulants, need further investigation.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) is associated with increased all-cause mortality after carotid revascularization for asymptomatic carotid disease [^1119aDcz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the established guidelines, there is not a clear consensus about how to manage antiplatelet therapy after carotid surgery. It is a common practice in vascular surgery to use the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in the treatment of such patients. In this work, we analyzed the impact on long-term survival of antiplatelet therapy in patients treated for carotid stenosis at a single institution over a 10-year period.

Methods

Outcomes of 471 patients who underwent carotid intervention (1999–2008) were analyzed. Discharge prescription summaries were retrieved, and patients were divided into two groups according to their antiplatelet regimen: aspirin-only group and aspirin plus clopidogrel group. Only patients with a minimum of 30 days of confirmed antiplatelet therapy were included. All-cause mortality during follow-up represented the primary outcome, whereas stroke and bleeding at 30 days and during follow-up represented secondary end points. When local records were sparse, the Social Security Death Index was queried to confirm mortality. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9 codes), was reviewed for treatment related to a bleeding condition.

Results

When divided by indication, there was an increased mortality rate in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease receiving dual antiplatelet therapy as compared with aspirin alone (47% vs 40%; p = 0.05). Patients with symptomatic carotid disease had a nonsignificant decrease in all-cause mortality if they received dual antiplatelet therapy (38% vs 39%; p = 0.53). In a subgroup analysis, there was a significant increase in the rate of all-cause mortality among patients older than 75 years receiving dual antiplatelet therapy for asymptomatic carotid disease (82% vs 56%; p = 0.001), whereas there was a nonsignificant decrease in mortality in patients older than 75 years receiving dual antiplatelet therapy for symptomatic carotid disease (47% vs 63%; p = 0.50). There was no difference in secondary outcomes (stroke and bleeding) regardless of the indication or the antiplatelet therapy.

Conclusions

In this retrospective, single-institution study, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) in patients intervened for asymptomatic carotid disease was related to increased all-cause mortality, whereas it did not significantly influence the outcome in patients with symptomatic carotid disease.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^115kqZ8J]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this post-hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial, patients with sCAS exhibited a significantly higher risk of new stroke than those without sCAS among individuals with CYP2C19 LOF alleles. Genotype-guided dual antiplatelet therapy involving aspirin and ticagrelor may offer advantages in preventing recurrent strokes in patients without sCAS; however, it may not be effective for those with sCAS, despite the absence of a treatment-by-sCAS subtype interaction.

Establish the foundation for care at the first poststroke visit — Carotid imaging, when indicated, is usually deferred until after discharge; approximately 10% of ischemic stroke events are related to carotid stenosis, and prolonged (eg, ≥ 30 days) rhythm monitoring will detect occult atrial fibrillation in ≈9% of patients. Because some cause-specific treatments are time sensitive, carotid revascularization, if indicated, should be performed within 2 weeks for most patients, and primary care clinicians should examine whether any part of the evaluation of cause was deferred to the outpatient setting. Dual antiplatelet therapy is initiated in the hospital and can reduce early recurrence by 25% but should be discontinued for many patients after 21 to 30 days to reduce bleeding risk; based on nonrandomized evidence, patients with stroke related to 70% to 99% intracranial stenosis may benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy extended up to 90 days, and patients are eligible for dual antiplatelet therapy if they have had a minor acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack within the prior 12 to 24 hours and are not candidates for thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, endarterectomy, or anticoagulation.

Regarding perioperative care for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to perioperative antiplatelet therapy, carotid endarterectomy, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating aspirin (300–325 mg daily for 14 days, followed by 75–162 mg daily) where antiplatelet monotherapy is preferred to combination therapy in recently symptomatic patients with a 50–99% CAS undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

### ESVS guidelines. invasive treatment for carotid stenosis: indications, techniques [^111wXwJ9]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The European Society for Vascular Surgery brought together a group of experts in the field of carotid artery disease to produce updated guidelines for the invasive treatment of carotid disease. The recommendations were rated according to the level of evidence. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended in symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death rate is < 6% [A], preferably within 2 weeks of the patient's last symptoms [A]. CEA is also recommended in asymptomatic men < 75 years old with 70–99% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death risk is < 3% [A]. The benefit from CEA in asymptomatic women is significantly less than in men [A]. CEA should therefore be considered only in younger, fit women [A]. Carotid patch angioplasty is preferable to primary closure [A]. Aspirin at a dose of 75–325 mg daily and statins should be given before, during and following CEA. [A] Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be performed only in high-risk for CEA patients, in high-volume centres with documented low peri-operative stroke and death rates or inside a randomized controlled trial [C]. CAS should be performed under dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel [A]. Carotid protection devices are probably of benefit [C].

### Analysis of prescriptions for dual antiplatelet therapy after acute ischemic stroke [^11727L14]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Some clinicians may avoid prescribing DAPT to patients with minor stroke in the presence of an allergy to aspirin or clopidogrel, a known bleeding diathesis or history of bleeding, a large territory infarction despite a low NIHSS score, a high risk of bleeding, a risk of fall, or CYP2C19 polymorphism. The use of DAPT in patients with nonminor stroke may be pursued in the setting of carotid artery stenting, recent percutaneous coronary intervention, aortic arch atherosclerosis, intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis, or even patient preferences. Despite a lack of evidence, these extenuating circumstances may represent the normal variations inherent in medical practice rather than nonadherence to guidelines. Furthermore, certain practitioners may choose to intensify antithrombotic therapy from aspirin to DAPT for patients who experience breakthrough strokes while receiving aspirin therapy. Although the safety and efficacy of changing from a single antiplatelet agent to DAPT have not been established, the present study controlled for previous stroke and previous medication receipt before hospital admission. Notably, our study findings were essentially unchanged in the sensitivity analysis excluding patients with coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, or large artery atherosclerosis. Even if DAPT was prescribed specifically for patients with large artery atherosclerosis, DAPT is only recommended for very specific patients who have had a recent stroke associated with severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis (ie, 70%-99% stenosis; class 2a, level of evidence B-NR).

### Editor's choice-peri-operative outcomes of carotid endarterectomy are not improved on dual antiplatelet therapy vs. aspirin monotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V79Gs]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the peri-operative outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs. aspirin monotherapy was carried out, to determine optimal peri-operative management with these antiplatelet agents.

Data Sources

The Web of Science, Pubmed, and Embase databases were searched from inception to July 2021. The corresponding authors of excluded articles were contacted to obtain additional data for possible inclusion.

Review Methods

The main outcomes included ischaemic complications (stroke, transient ischaemic attack [TIA], and transcranial Doppler [TCD] measured micro-emboli), haemorrhagic complications (haemorrhagic stroke, neck haematoma, and re-operation for bleeding), and composite outcomes. Pooled estimates using odds ratios (ORs) were combined using a random or fixed effects model based on the results of the chi square test and calculation of I 2.

Results

In total, 47 411 patients were included in 11 studies, with 14 345 (30.2%) receiving DAPT and 33 066 (69.7%) receiving aspirin only. There was no significant difference in the rates of peri-operative stroke (OR 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.05) and TIA (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52–1.17) despite a significant reduction in TCD measured micro-emboli (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10–0.35) in the DAPT compared with the aspirin monotherapy group. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant difference in ischaemic stroke risk between patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. DAPT was associated with an increased risk of neck haematoma (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.87–4.18) and re-operation for bleeding (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.77–2.23) vs. aspirin. Haemorrhagic stroke was an under reported outcome in the literature.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis found that CEA while on DAPT increased the risk of haemorrhagic complications, with similar rates of ischaemic complications, vs. aspirin monotherapy. This suggests that the risks of performing CEA on DAPT outweigh the benefits, even in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. The overall quality of studies was low, and improved reporting of CEA outcomes in the literature is necessary.

### Dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy for acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZKd8U]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute minor ischaemic stroke (IS) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are very common and often lead to disabling events during the first few weeks. Antiplatelet therapy can significantly reduce the risk of vascular events among high-risk patients. Current guidelines strongly recommend early administration of aspirin in patients with acute IS. However, the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy have not been fully understood.

Over the past few decades, some large randomised controlled trials (RCT) have shown that dual antiplatelet therapy is more effective in reducing the risk of cerebral embolisation, including the CARESS trial (Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli in Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis) and CLAIR trial (Clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone for reducing embolisation in patients with acute symptomatic cerebral or carotid artery stenosis). The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events) further demonstrated that early dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days among 5170 Chinese patients with non-cardioembolic IS or TIA was efficacious and safe.

A previous meta-analysis including 9012 patients from CHANCE and 13 other RCTs up to November 2012 showed that early dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy within 3 days of symptom onset was more effective in reducing stroke recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80; p < 0.001) and the composite outcome of stroke, TIA, acute coronary syndrome and all death (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.81; p < 0.001), without significantly increasing the risk of major bleeding (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.59, p = 0.37). The 2018 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin among patients with minor IS or TIA for early secondary stroke prevention (Class of recommendation: II A). However, considering that the generalisability of the intervention in non-Asian populations remains unclear, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy was only modestly recommended.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1165yhN3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Perioperative medical therapy for carotid artery stenting (CAS) — Antihypertensive, β-blocker, and lipid-lowering therapy should be initiated in patients undergoing CAS according to the same recommendations for CEA. Patients should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) or ticlopidine (250 mg) before CAS. No randomized trial has yet compared CAS performed with dual-antiplatelet therapy vs aspirin alone, but the published periprocedural stroke, MI, and death rates in recent clinical trials have been achieved with this combination therapy.

### Different perioperative antiplatelet therapies for patients treated with carotid endarterectomy in routine practice [^116dv2j1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

There is currently no clear consensus regarding the optimal perioperative antiplatelet therapy regimen for carotid surgery. Therefore, associations between different antiplatelet therapies and the risk of stroke or death and perioperative complications after carotid endarterectomy on a national level in Germany were analyzed.

Methods

Overall, 117,973 elective carotid endarterectomies for asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid artery stenosis between 2010 and 2014 were included. Data were extracted from the statutory nationwide quality assurance database. The primary outcome was any in-hospital stroke or death until discharge from the hospital. Secondary outcomes were any major stroke or death, death alone, stroke, myocardial infarction, local bleeding, and any local complications (cranial nerve palsy, severe bleeding, acute occlusion). Descriptive statistics and multilevel multivariable regression analyses were applied. Single-agent therapy with aspirin was used as reference.

Results

Patients were predominantly male (68%), with a mean age of 71 years. Carotid stenosis was symptomatic in 40%. Of all patients, 82.8% were treated perioperatively by monotherapy with aspirin alone, 2.7% received other platelet inhibitors, and 4.8% of the patients were operated on under dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome occurred in 1.8% of all patients. Multilevel multivariable regression analysis revealed that the combined stroke and death rate of patients with no perioperative antiplatelet therapy was significantly higher (risk ratio [RR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.42) compared with the group of patients receiving monotherapy. The same was true for the major stroke and death rate (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48). In contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a lower risk of death alone (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.88) but with a significantly higher rate of secondary bleeding requiring reoperation (RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.88–2.50).

Conclusions

This study shows that the risk of stroke or death was significantly higher in patients without any perioperative antiplatelet therapy. In contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy vs aspirin monotherapy was associated with a lower risk only of perioperative death but with a higher risk of neck bleeding until discharge. Perioperative antiplatelet therapy was significantly associated with a decreased in-hospital stroke and death risk. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of single vs dual antiplatelet therapy.

Regarding medical management for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating clopidogrel (75 mg daily) in patients with > 50% asymptomatic CAS intolerant or allergic to aspirin. Consider initiating dipyridamole monotherapy (200 mg BID) in patients intolerant or allergic to both aspirin and clopidogrel.

### Optimal antiplatelet therapy in moderate to severe asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis: a comprehensive review of the literature [^112XBheX]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Carotid stenosis patients are at risk of vascular events despite antiplatelet therapy. Data on prescribed antiplatelet regimens have not been comprehensively collated from trials to guide optimal therapy in this population.

Methods

This review was conducted in line with the current Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Medline, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 1988 to 2018 were searched using the search terms "carotid stenosis", "asymptomatic", "symptomatic", "antiplatelet", and "anti-platelet" to identify randomised trials in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic extracranial moderate-severe carotid stenosis on any form of antiplatelet therapy in which vascular events and pre specified composite outcome events were reported.

Results

Twenty-five studies were judged eligible for inclusion. Data from one randomised controlled trial showed no significant difference in benefit with aspirin versus placebo in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but it is still reasonable to recommend aspirin (81–325 mg daily) for prevention of vascular events in these patients. Low to medium dose aspirin (81–325 mg daily) is superior to higher doses (> 650 mg daily) at preventing recurrent vascular events in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Data from endovascular treatment (EVT) trials support peri-procedural treatment of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with 81–325 mg of aspirin daily. The use of peri-procedural aspirin-clopidogrel in patients undergoing EVT is based on one pilot trial, but appears safe. Short-term aspirin-dipyridamole or aspirin-clopidogrel treatments are equally effective at reducing micro-embolic signals on transcranial Doppler ultrasound in patients with ≥ 50% symptomatic carotid stenosis. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine aspirin-clopidogrel combination therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent clinical ischaemic events in patients with symptomatic moderate-severe carotid stenosis.

Conclusions

This comprehensive review outlines an evidence based approach to antiplatelet therapy in carotid stenosis patients. Future trials should randomise such patients to receive different antiplatelet regimens to assess their efficacy and safety and to optimise peri-procedural and long-term preventive treatment in this patient cohort.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with increased risk of bleeding and decreased risk of stroke following carotid endarterectomy [^112DNA2T]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite many patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) being on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for cardiac or neurologic indications, the impact of such therapy on perioperative outcomes remains unclear. We aim to compare rates of postoperative bleeding, stroke and major adverse events (stroke, death or MI) among patients on Aspirin alone (ASAA) versus DAPT (Clopidogrel and Aspirin).

Methods

Patients undergoing CEA for carotid artery stenosis between 2010 and 2021 in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) were included. We excluded patients undergoing concomitant or re-do operations or patients with missing antiplatelet information. Propensity score matching was performed between the 2 groups ASAA and DAPT based on age, sex, race, presenting symptoms, major comorbidities [hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD)], degree of ipsilateral stenosis, presence of contralateral occlusion, as well as preoperative medications. Intergroup differences between the treatment groups and differences in perioperative outcomes were tested with the McNemar's test for categorical variables and paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for continuous variables where appropriate. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were estimated as the ratio of the probability of the outcome event in the patients treated within each treatment group.

Results

A total of 125,469 patients were included [ASAA n = 82,920 (66%) and DAPT n = 42,549 (34%)]. Patients on DAPT were more likely to be symptomatic, had higher rates of CAD, prior percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, and higher rates of diabetes. After propensity score matching, the DAPT group had an increased rate of bleeding complications (RR: 1.6: 1.4–1.8, P < 0.001) as compared with those on ASAA despite being more likely to receive both drains and protamine. In addition, patients on DAPT had a slight decrease in the risk of in-hospital stroke as compared with patients on ASAA (RR: 0.80: 0.7–0.9, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

This large multi-institutional study demonstrates a modest decrease in the risk of in-hospital stroke for patients on DAPT undergoing CEA as compared with those on ASAA. This small benefit is at the expense of a significant increase in the risk of perioperative bleeding events incurred by those on DAPT at the time of CEA. This analysis suggests avoiding DAPT when possible, during CEA.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^111fYuGE]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is a post-hoc study of the CHANCE-2 trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin-ticagrelor compared with aspirin-clopidogrel stratified by the status of sCAS. We found that sCAS was associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrent stroke. Aspirin-ticagrelor was superior to aspirin-clopidogrel in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke within 90 days in patients without sCAS, but this superiority was not observed in those with sCAS. However, there was no significant difference in the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin-ticagrelor or aspirin-clopidogrel between patients with and without sCAS. Furthermore, the risk of severe or moderate bleeding events was similar in both treatment groups in patients with or without sCAS.

The proportion of patients with sCAS in the CHANCE-2 trial (3.3%) was lower than that in the UK-TIA trial (6%) but higher than that in the POINT trial (1.7%). However, it should be noted that carotid imaging in the UK-TIA trial was only performed in patients suspected with large-artery disease. The difference between our study and the POINT trial may be attributed to racial differences or CYP2C19 metabolizser status, but further studies are needed to clarify this issue. Another study focusing on recent TIA or ischaemic stroke in the internal carotid artery territory reported a higher prevalence of sCAS stenosis (12.5%), possibly due to their inclusion of patients with anterior circulation infarction. In general, there needs to be more consistent data on the prevalence of sCAS, and more clinical research is required to address this gap.

### STENOSIS: long-term single versus dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischaemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease-a randomised trial [^114udiA5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) has a higher risk of recurrent ischaemic events as compared with other stroke subtypes. Antiplatelet treatment using clopidogrel-aspirin dual therapy in symptomatic patients with ICAD has shown a lower rate of recurrent stroke as compared with aspirin monotherapy. However, the evidence for duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in symptomatic ICAD patients is scarce.

### The effects of clopidogrel duration on carotid artery in-stent restenosis [^113YXosF]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data supporting a specific duration for dual antiplatelet therapy in carotid artery stenting (CAS), and most clinical evidence is derived from studies involving coronary interventions. As a result, the appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after CAS is yet to be determined. We aimed to elucidate whether the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy played a role in the rate of carotid in-stent restenosis.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent CAS at our institution over a 20-year period (1996–2016) was performed (n = 279). Patients who did not complete their follow-up duplex studies or were not discharged on clopidogrel were excluded from the study. Patients were separated into short-term (< 6 weeks, n = 159) and long-term (> 6 weeks, n = 112) clopidogrel users based on duration of therapy. We defined clinically significant in-stent restenosis as > 50% restenosis (peak systolic velocity = 224 cm/s) in symptomatic patients and > 80% restenosis (peak systolic velocity = 325 cm/s) in asymptomatic patients status-post prior CAS based on published velocity criteria. Rates of in-stent restenosis at 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year intervals were analyzed between the 2 groups using chi-squared analysis.

Results

Demographic information was largely similar between the 2 groups; however, short-term clopidogrel users were more likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation (9.43% vs. 1.68%, P = 0.008) and were less likely to have a history of coronary artery bypass graft (16.35% vs. 29.41%, P = 0.009), diabetes (33.34% vs. 49.58%, P = 0.006), and coronary artery disease (50.31% vs. 63.03%, P = 0.035). All patients were on long-term aspirin therapy. There was no significant difference between overall rates of in-stent restenosis between the short-term and long-term clopidogrel users (5.03% vs. 9.24%, P = 0.168) within 5 years of the index procedure. Similar results were observed when these groups were evaluated at 1-year (5.61% vs. 3%, P = 0.321), 2-year (2.02% vs. 6.59%, P = 0.072), and 5-year (2.24% vs. 3.57%, P = 0.635) follow-up.

Conclusions

No statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of in-stent restenosis after CAS between short-term and long-term clopidogrel therapy. Patients in whom there is no other indication for longer duration clopidogrel therapy may be considered for shorter duration course of dual antiplatelet therapy following CAS.

### Risk of disease progression in patients with moderate asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: implications of tobacco use and dual antiplatelet therapy [^116dU7W5]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Because of improved medical therapy in contemporary practice, some have advocated that, most if not, all patients with asymptomatic carotid disease should be managed medically without intervention. Disease progression in this patient population is not well established, and data describing risk factors for disease progression in patients with moderate asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ASCAS) are lacking. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for disease progression in this patient population.

Methods

All patients presenting to a tertiary center between January 2005 and May 2012 with moderate (50–69%) ASCAS as determined by carotid artery duplex were included. Outcomes including disease progression to severe stenosis (≥ 70%), incidence of symptoms, need for operative intervention, and all-cause mortality were recorded. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify risk factors for disease progression.

Results

A total of 282 carotid arteries in 258 patients with moderate ASCAS were identified from 1555 carotid duplex scans over the 7.5-year study period (mean age: 70.6 ± 0.55 years, 52% male). Mean follow-up time was 2.6 ± 0.10 years. Overall, disease progression to severe stenosis occurred in 25.2% (n = 71) and followed a linear trend. The incidence of symptoms including ipsilateral stroke (2.13%, n = 6) and transient ischemic attack (0.71%; n = 2) was low. Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 15.3% (n = 43) of patients, all with severe disease. Carotid stenting was performed in 3.90% (n = 11) patients. Risk of progression was higher in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–3.15; P = 0.02) and smokers (HR 1.85, 95% CI 0.96–3.55; P = 0.05). Age, gender (women), hypertension, statin use, and aspirin use were not significant predictors of progression to severe stenosis. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality in patients who progressed compared with those who did not (HR 3.39, 95% CI 0.91–12.6; P = 0.07).

Conclusions

In our study, one-quarter of patients with moderate ASCAS progressed to severe disease, although the majority remained asymptomatic. Smoking and dual antiplatelet therapy are independent risk factors for disease progression. Patients with identifiable risk factors may warrant more careful follow-up.

Regarding perioperative care for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to perioperative antiplatelet therapy, carotid artery stenting, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate combination antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (75–325 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) in recently symptomatic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. Start clopidogrel (75 mg daily) at least 3 days before stenting or as a single 300 mg loading dose in urgent cases. Continue aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks after stenting and then continue antiplatelet monotherapy (preferably clopidogrel 75 mg daily) indefinitely.

### Antiplatelet therapy in carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy in the asymptomatic carotid surgery trial-2 [^111LYvhU]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Strokes are infrequent but potentially serious complications following carotid intervention, but antiplatelet therapy can reduce these risks. There are currently no specific guidelines on dose or duration of peri-procedural antiplatelet treatment for patients undergoing carotid intervention. Within the ongoing Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial-2 (ACST-2), this study aimed at assessing the current use of antiplatelet therapy before, during, and after CEA and CAS in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Methods

Questionnaires were sent to ACST-2 collaborators seeking information about the use of antiplatelet therapy during the pre-, peri-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing carotid intervention at 77 participating sites and also whether sites tested for antiplatelet therapy resistance.

Results

The response rate was 68/77 (88%). For CAS, 82% of sites used dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) pre-operatively and 86% post-operatively with a mean post-procedural duration of 3 months (range 1–12), while 9% continued DAPT life-long. For CEA only 31% used DAPT pre-operatively, 24% post-operatively with a mean post-procedural duration of 3 months (range 1–5), while 10% continued DAPT life-long. For those prescribing post-procedural mono antiplatelet (MAPT) therapy (76%), aspirin was more commonly prescribed (59%) than clopidogrel (6%) and 11% of centres did not show a preference for either aspirin or clopidogrel. Eleven centres (16%) tested for antiplatelet therapy resistance.

Conclusion

There appears to be broad agreement on the use of antiplatelet therapy in ACST-2 patients undergoing carotid artery stenting and surgery. Although evidence to help guide the duration of peri-procedural antiplatelet therapy is limited, long-term treatment with DAPT appears similar between both treatment arms.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^115MtmdY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — Medical management of carotid atherosclerosis emphasizes risk-factor modification and antithrombotic therapy with specified perioperative regimens. In patients with carotid artery stenosis, treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation are recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular risk and risk of stroke, with targets defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). Aggressive treatment of hypertension in the setting of acute stroke is not recommended; after this period, treatment is associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke and target parameters are not well defined (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C). Tight glucose control in diabetes has not been shown to reduce stroke risk or decrease complication rates after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is not recommended for these purposes (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence A). Anticoagulation is not recommended for transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke unless there is evidence of a cardioembolic source (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). In asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce overall cardiovascular morbidity but has not been shown effective for primary prevention of stroke (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). For secondary stroke prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all effective, but clopidogrel plus aspirin is not more effective than either drug alone (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative medical management for carotid revascularization should include blood pressure control (< 140/80 mm Hg), β-blockade (heart rate, 60–80 beats/min), and statin therapy (LDL < 100 mg/dL) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Perioperative antithrombotic therapy for CEA should include aspirin (81–325 mg) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A), while use of clopidogrel perioperatively should be decided case-by-case (GRADE 2 Level of Evidence B). For carotid artery stenting (CAS), perioperative antithrombotic management should include dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel; dual therapy should be initiated at least 3 days before CAS and continued for 1 month, and aspirin should be continued indefinitely (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in patients with TIA or minor stroke with or without symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a post hoc analysis of the CHANCE-2 trial [^117Wd65a]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) is an essential cause of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. We aimed to evaluate whether the superiority of aspirin-ticagrelor over aspirin-clopidogrel varies between patients with sCAS or not.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of the High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events-II (CHANCE-2) trial, all of which were CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles carriers. The primary exposures of interest were the treatment group and sCAS status. The primary efficacy endpoint was the new stroke assessed within 90 days.

Results

A total of 5920 (92.3%) from 6412 were analysed, including 197 (3.3%) with sCAS and 5723 (96.7%) without sCAS. Stroke recurrence occurred in 13 (12.15%) and 11 (12.22%) patients with sCAS who received aspirin-ticagrelor and aspirin-clopidogrel, respectively (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.36; p = 0.930). Among patients without sCAS, there were 158 cases (5.52%) of new strokes in the aspirin-ticagrelor group and 222 cases (7.76%) in the aspirin-clopidogrel group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.86; p = 0.0006). The treatment-by-sCAS subtype was not significant (p = 0.405).

Conclusions

Genotype-guided dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin-ticagrelor may be beneficial for preventing recurrent strokes in patients without sCAS; however, it appears less effective in those with sCAS. No significant interaction was found between the treatment and sCAS subtypes.

### Outcome of tailored antiplatelet therapy in carotid stenting: a retrospective comparative study [^112q1Nqy]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Carotid stenting requires dual antiplatelet therapy to effectively prevent thromboembolic complications. However, resistance to clopidogrel, a key component of this therapy, may lead to persistent risk of these complications. The aim of this study was to determine, if the implementation of routine platelet function testing and adjusting therapy was associated with lower incidence of thromboembolic complications and death.

Methods

All consecutive patients treated with carotid artery stenting in a single institution over 8 years were enlisted in a retrospective study. Platelet function testing was performed, and efficient antiplatelet therapy was set before the procedure. Incidence of procedure-related stroke or death within periprocedural period (0–30 days) was assessed. The results were evaluated in relation to the findings of six prominent randomized control trials.

Results

A total of 241 patients were treated for carotid stenosis, seven patients undergo CAS on both sides over time. There was 138 symptomatic (55,6%) and 110 asymptomatic stenoses (44,4%). Five thromboembolic complications (2,01%) occurred, four of them (1,61%) was procedure-related. Two patients died because of procedure-related stroke (0,82%). Incidence of procedure-related stroke or death was significant lower compared to the results of CREST study (2,01% vs. 4,81%, P = 0,0243) in the entire cohorts, and to the results of ICSS study in the symptomatic cohorts (2,86% vs. 7,37%, P = 0,0243), respectively.

Conclusions

Tailored antiplatelet therapy in carotid stenting is safe and seems to be related with lower incidence of procedure-related death or stroke rate. Larger prospective studies to assess whether platelet function testing-guided antiplatelet therapy is superior to standard dual antiplatelet should be considered.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after carotid artery stenting: trends and outcomes in a large national database [^111XtdSC]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

While dual antiplatelet therapy (dAPT) is standard of care following carotid artery stenting (CAS), the optimal dAPT regimen and duration has not been established.

Methods

We canvassed a large national database (IBM MarketScan) to identify patients receiving carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or CAS for treatment of ischemic stroke or carotid artery stenosis from 2007 to 2016. We performed univariable and multivariable regression methods to evaluate the impact of covariates on post-CAS stroke-free survival, including post-discharge antiplatelet therapy.

Results

A total of 79084 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke or carotid stenosis received CEA (71 178; 90.0%) or CAS (7906; 10.0%). After adjusting for covariates, < 180 days prescribed post-CAS P2Y12-inhibition was associated with increased risk for stroke (< 90 prescribed days HR = 1.421, 95%CI 1.038 to 1.946; 90–179 prescribed days HR = 1.484, 95%CI 1.045 to 2.106). The incidence of hemorrhagic complications was higher during the period of prescribed P2Y12-inhibition (1.16% per person-month vs 0.49% per person-month after discontinuation, P < 0.001). The rate of extracranial hemorrhage was nearly six-fold higher while on dAPT (6.50% per patient-month vs 1.16% per patient-month, P < 0.001), and there was a trend towards higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage that did not reach statistical significance (5.09% per patient-month vs 3.69% per patient-month, P = 0.0556). Later hemorrhagic events beyond 30 days post-CAS were significantly more likely to be extracranial (P = 0.028).

Conclusions

Increased duration of post-CAS dAPT is associated with lower rates of readmissions for stroke, and with increased risk of hemorrhagic complications, particularly extracranial hemorrhage. The potential benefit of prolonging dAPT with regard to ischemic complications must be balanced with the corresponding increased risk of predominantly extracranial hemorrhagic complications.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1157zA9R]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is indicated following carotid artery stenting (CAS) and single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) following carotid endarterectomy (CEA), but it remains unknown how providers adhere to these guidelines in real-world clinical practice. Using the Vascular Quality Initiative New England data, we found that of 12,257 patients, 82% patients were discharged on DAPT following CAS and 66% were discharged on SAPT following CEA. While a high percentage of patients undergoing CAS appropriately receive DAPT, the use of SAPT following CEA exists with more variability and lower adherence rates.

Section 8: intervention on aetiology and pathogenesis

This chapter classifies ischaemic stroke by causes. It mainly enumerates atherosclerosis of large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolic stroke, cerebral small vessel disease and other special causes. It is suggested that corresponding disease management and intervention measures should be taken for ischaemic stroke with different causes. Taking corresponding disease management and intervention measures for ischaemic stroke with different causes is helpful to improve the prognosis.

Large artery atherosclerotic stroke

Antithrombotic therapy

Recommendations

For patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis, antiplatelet therapy should be started as soon as possible and used for long term. The alternative antiplatelet drugs are aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol (class I, level of evidence A).
For minor patients with stroke with high-risk intracranial artery stenosis (70%–99%), it is recommended to take single antiplatelet therapy after 90 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). And dual antiplatelet therapy combined with stent therapy in 90 days is not recommended (class III, level of evidence B).
For patients with stroke with intracranial arterial stenosis, aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended to reduce the risk of early stroke recurrence caused by thromboembolism. One week later, the risk is reassessed for the purpose of determining whether to continue the combined treatment. The duration of dual antiplatelet therapy can last for 3 months after the onset of the disease. Routine anticoagulant therapy is not recommended for secondary prevention (class I, level of evidence A).

Surgical intervention: combined with intracranial and extracranial macrovascular stenosis and haemodynamic mechanism.

Recommendations

When clinical indicators or brain imaging demonstrate that the core of small infarction and at-risk area (penumbra) are caused by insufficient blood flow due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery, or acute neurological impairment after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with suspected acute thrombosis at the site of operation, the effectiveness of emergency CEA has not been confirmed (class II, level of evidence B).
The effectiveness of emergency CEA has not been proven in patients with unstable neurological status (such as progressive stroke) (class II, level of evidence B).

### Antithrombotic therapy in peripheral artery disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115MHUSk]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on antithrombotic drug therapies for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as for the relief of lower-extremity symptoms and critical ischemia in persons with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

The most important of our 20 recommendations are as follows. In patients aged ≥ 50 years with asymptomatic PAD or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, we suggest aspirin (75–100 mg/d) over no therapy (Grade 2B) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. For secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with symptomatic PAD (including patients before and after peripheral arterial bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), we recommend long-term aspirin (75–100 mg/d) or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of warfarin plus aspirin in patients with symptomatic PAD (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing peripheral artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting, we suggest single rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 2C). For patients with refractory claudication despite exercise therapy and smoking cessation, we suggest addition of cilostazol (100 mg bid) to aspirin (75–100 mg/d) or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 2C). In patients with critical limb ischemia and rest pain unable to undergo revascularization, we suggest the use of prostanoids (Grade 2C). In patients with acute limb ischemia due to acute thrombosis or embolism, we recommend surgery over peripheral arterial thrombolysis (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in most patients with asymptomatic PAD, symptomatic PAD, and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional therapies for relief of limb symptoms should be considered only after exercise therapy, smoking cessation, and evaluation for peripheral artery revascularization.

### Is the future of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis management promising? [^115uV8VF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to standardise assessment and management of sICAS. The treatment of sICAS nowadays primarily focuses on secondary prevention to reduce stroke recurrence. Therapeutic methods include antiplatelet therapy, interventional therapy and control of risk factors. Two milestone trials, the Warfarin Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID)Trial and the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS)Trial aim to provide an updated strategy for clinical practice.

The WASID Trial, with a double-blind, multicentre, randomised control clinical trial design, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of warfarin over aspirin among patients with 50%–99% degree of ICAS. Aspirin proved to be equally efficient and safer. This led to the investigation of a dual-antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in patients with sICAS. The Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin versus Aspirin Alone for Reducing Embolization in Patients with Acute Symptomatic Cerebral or Carotid Artery StenosisTrial indicated that in patients in the sICAS group, dual-antiplatelet therapy reduced microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) (31% vs 54%, relative risk reduction 42.4%, 95% CI 4.6% to 65.2%, p = 0.025) at day 2 of enrolment, which may further reduce the recurrence of artery-origin embolic stroke in these patients. The Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular EventsTrial published in 2013 first verified the benefit of dual-antiplatelet therapy for minor strokes and high-risk transient ischaemic attacks. It showed that combined use of clopidogrel and aspirin started within 24 hours and continued to 21 days was superior to aspirin monotherapy in reducing the risk of stroke in the first 90 days. In the ICAS subgroup analysis, it was found that dual-antiplatelet therapy had a tendency to reduce stroke recurrence over monoantiplatelet therapy at 90 days, but was not statistically significant due to the limited number of participants enrolled.

### European Stroke Organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^111GQNVy]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Considerations before starting DAPT

Brain imaging should always be performed prior to initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy.

Dual antiplatelet therapy should be started as soon as possible, within the first twenty-four hours after symptom onset.

The definition of minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS of 3 or less) was consistent in the trials of clopidogrel plus aspirin whilst high-risk TIA was defined as an ABCD2 score of 4 or more, or by other high-risk features. In the only study of ticagrelor plus aspirin, people with moderate and minor ischaemic stroke were included (NIHSS of 5 or less) and high risk TIA was defined as either an ABCD2 score of 6 or more (provided motor or speech symptoms were present), or by being accompanied by evidence of symptomatic carotid or intracranial atherosclerotic disease. However, less than 10% of patients were included in the trial due to a TIA. This should be considered when deciding on a dual antiplatelet therapy regimen after minor stroke and TIA.

People with high grade carotid stenosis and planned revascularisation were excluded from POINT, CHANCE and THALES. In addition, people with a clear indication for anticoagulation (such as fibrillation, mechanical heart valve) or recognised increased risk of bleeding were excluded. DAPT should not routinely be used in people with an indication for anticoagulation.

### Best evidence for medical therapy for carotid artery stenosis [^11575Cjz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke and represents a key target in stroke prevention. Randomized trials have shown the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in secondary stroke prevention. Carotid stenting presents a less invasive alternative to surgical intervention. Advances in medical management, if compliance can be ensured, are leading to improvement in outcomes when implemented as sole therapy in the treatment of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. This includes lifestyle modification, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet and statin therapy. Over the last 20 years, the annual rate of ipsilateral stroke associated with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has decreased from 2% to 4% to less than 1%. This is largely due to improvements in medical therapy. However, despite numerous trials and years of clinical research, the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease remains controversial. This article presents and summarizes the evidence supporting best medical treatment for carotid artery stenosis.

### Carotid artery stenting is safe and effective for symptomatic patients with acute coronary syndrome [^112xcTAm]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis recently treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are always classified as at high risk for surgery, given that they are required uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy. In this regard, carotid artery stenting (CAS) may represent a valid alternative.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to overview CAS outcomes in symptomatic patients with and without ACS.

Methods

One hundred fifty-one consecutive symptomatic patients who underwent CAS between 2010 and 2017 in a single institution were included in this study, of which 66 (43.7%) were identified as having ACS. All patients were followed-up with carotid duplex ultrasound scan and a neurological assessment of symptoms status at 30-day postprocedure and at 3, 6, and 12months, with annual follow-up after that for 3years.

Results

Among symptomatic ACS patients, common risks factors were active smoking, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertension. In the short-term follow-up, no significant differences were observed among rates of death, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and restenosis, between patients with and without ACS. Mean clinical follow-up was 28.2 (12.3) months. In the long-term follow-up, higher rates of death and MI were recorded in patients with ACS (death: 11.4% vs. 5.4%, p = .04; MI: 11.4% vs. 3.6%, p = .02), owing to the complexity of these patients.

Conclusions

This single-center study suggested that CAS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, who recently underwent PTCA for ACS, requiring uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Update in the treatment of extracranial atherosclerotic disease for stroke prevention [^116tkdr3]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical management

Patients with ECAD can benefit from OMT consisting of antiplatelet agents, stains, and risk factor control.

(1) Antiplatelet agents: although the benefit of single antiplatelet agent for stroke prevention in asymptomatic carotid stenosis has not been confirmed by RCTs, current guidelines recommend lifelong low-dose aspirin as part of OMT to reduce the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events. Dual antiplatelet therapy has been recommended during the periprocedural period and for at least 1 month after CAS.

(2) Statins: statins have been routinely used in RCTs and clinical settings. A meta-analysis of 26 studies reported efficacy of statin with a dose-dependent protective effect, which was consistent with findings from 2 RCTs done afterwards.

(3) Risk factor control: hypertension is an important risk factor for ECAD, and the goal of blood pressure (BP) in non-diabetic patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is recommended below 140/90 mm Hg. Patients with concomitant diabetes are at particularly increased risk of cerebrovascular events, for whom a diastolic BP ≤ 85 mm Hg has been recommended by the latest ESC guidelines.

Previous studies have shown up to 26% risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke over 2 years in patients with symptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis despite OMT. It is therefore pivotal to consider more effective intervention.

### Outcome of tailored antiplatelet therapy in carotid stenting: a retrospective comparative study [^112xjwGb]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is responsible for approximately 20% of ischemic strokes. The first carotid endarterectomy was performed by DeBakey in 1953. Endovascular methods for the treatment of carotid stenosis have been available since the early 1980s. Firstly in the form of angioplasty for non-atherosclerotic ICA lesions. Treatment of atherosclerotic ICA stenosis has been used since the early 1990s.

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is currently a proven method of treatment for carotid stenosis. CAS is a safe alternative to surgical endarterectomy with comparable long-term results. The introduction of new technologies and the better selection of appropriate patients helps to reduce the incidence of periprocedural complications. However, periprocedural risks associated with CAS persist. Among the most serious complications of CAS is stroke. Most strokes are ischemic, hemorrhagic strokes are less commonly reported. Other complications include transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction (IM), hypotension, bradycardia, and bleeding from the vascular access.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) significantly reduces the incidence of periprocedural thromboembolic complications. DAPT consists of acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA) a cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor and a second drug referred as a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor. The most common combination is ASA and clopidogrel. Multiple studies in recent years have reported the incidence of clopidogrel resistance in cohorts of patients undergoing neuroendovascular procedures, as well as a higher incidence of thromboembolic complications in these patients. The incidence of clopidogrel resistance varies from 21 to 55% according to the literature. Several studies show ticagrelor as a drug with lower resistance rates (up to 10%) that better inhibits platelet function in vitro, including clopidogrel-resistant patients. They also describe the use of ticagrelor as a safe alternative with similar efficacy in preventing thromboembolic events. The incidence of ASA resistance ranges from 5 to 56%. The interindividual variability in response to antiplatelet drugs is most often due to genetic receptor polymorphisms, interactions with other drugs, and comorbidities. Significant reduction of clopidogrel effect is caused by e.g. proton pump inhibitors, in the case of ticagrelor by concomitantly administered corticosteroids. Finally, patient compliance plays an important role.

2.3 Outcomes

The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of new stroke events (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death due to vascular causes at 90 days. The primary safety outcome was a moderate‐to‐severe bleeding at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke (i.e. ischemic stroke or TIA), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, other intracranial hemorrhage (i.e. subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, or other), symptomatic and asymptomatic hemorrhagic infarction defined according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification, myocardial infarction, vascular death, non‐vascular death, any hospitalization, disability measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), cause of DAPT discontinuation (i.e. adverse events, lack of compliance, other), severe bleeding, moderate bleeding, and mild bleeding — defined according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial. Secondary composite outcomes were any bleeding (i.e. any of severe, moderate, or mild bleeding) and any death (i.e. any of death due to vascular or non‐vascular causes).

We reported the outcomes in patients with LAA and with non‐LAA. Within these two main groups, we reported the rates of primary effectiveness outcome and any bleeding in pre‐specified subgroups based on demographics and disease characteristics that could potentially impact treatment effectiveness and safety. These subgroups included age > or ≤ 65 years, body mass index (BMI) < or ≥ 30, ischemic strokes with NIHSS score ≤ 3 or > 3, < or ≥ 2 MRI acute lesions when an MRI scan was performed, TIA with ABCD 2 score ≤ or > 4, prior antiplatelet therapy, revascularization procedure, DAPT loading dose, time to DAPT start ≤ or > 24 h, DAPT duration ≤ or > 21 days, early DAPT discontinuation. Lastly, within patients with LAA, we reported the outcomes in those with ipsilateral extracranial carotid stenosis < 50% and ≥ 70%.

### Choosing the appropriate intervention for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease in the era of multiple therapies: integration of risk profile and technical data [^115pBtjB]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

With rapid evolution of endovascular techniques, carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Several investigations have been performed that examine the roles of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting and some trials have sought to compare the two treatment modalities. There have also been advances in the understanding of optimal medical management of carotid artery stenosis. The obvious question that arises is what is the most appropriate treatment option for patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis? The answer is not straightforward and requires an understanding of differential outcomes in select subgroups. A review of the major studies, including some of the most recent trials, will help to elucidate the optimal therapy.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^111M53WG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Carotid stenosis with planned coronary artery bypass — perioperative strategies and outcomes include the following: stroke/death rates for combined CEA/CABG compared to staged CEA were 5.6% vs 17%, and the stroke rate with "unprotected" CABG was 7.4% versus 2.8% with combined CEA/CABG. In a randomized trial of 185 patients with unilateral severe (> 80%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis, "protected" CABG (15 CEA first, 79 combined CEA and CABG) had no strokes compared with 7 strokes (3 early, 4 later) in "unprotected" CABG with delayed CEA within 3 months (91 patients). When coronary intervention can be performed percutaneously, this should precede carotid intervention; if a sequential strategy is planned, CABG may need to be deferred for 2 to 4 weeks because of the need for dual-antiplatelet therapy after carotid artery stenting (CAS). A meta-analysis reported a stroke/death rate of 9.1% with CAS and CABG that was not significantly different than results with CEA and CABG, and one must conclude that data are insufficient to support a clear recommendation for treating patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis who need CABG.

### Will carotid angioplasty become the preferred alternative to staged or synchronous carotid endarterectomy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery? [^112uNVsy]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In the absence of randomized trials, the optimal management of patients who present with concomitant carotid and coronary artery disease remains an enduring controversy, with much of the debate revolving around whether staged or synchronous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) will reduce peri-operative morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Although encouraging results have been reported using either strategy, there remains no consensus as to which is preferable. More recently, however, carotid artery angioplasty with stenting (CAS) has emerged as a potential alternative to CEA. In 'high-risk for CEA' patients, CAS has shown comparable short and long-term outcome rates to CEA. Accordingly, CAS followed by cardiac surgery could offer a less invasive (and safer) therapeutic option in cardiac patients. This paper reviews the evidence to date supporting the use of CAS+CABG, while highlighting potential situations where such a strategy might be harmful. In particular, it will focus on how the need for dual antiplatelet therapy after CAS can be balanced with avoiding unnecessary bleeding complications after cardiac surgery.

Carotid endarterectomy — antiplatelet therapy evidence: A Cochrane systematic review identified six RCTs comparing antiplatelet therapy to no antiplatelet therapy in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy (with ≥ 3 months of follow-up). Four trials tested aspirin (dose range, 50–1,300 mg), one tested aspirin (990 mg) plus dipyridamole (225 mg), and one tested indobufen (400 mg). Timing of initiation ranged from 12 h prior to carotid endarterectomy to up to 3 months after, and treatment and follow-up ranged from 6 to 54 months. Antiplatelet drugs were associated with fewer strokes (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34–0.98), with an estimated absolute effect of 34 fewer per 1,000 patients treated (2 fewer to 54 fewer). In the Aspirin and Carotid Endarterectomy trial, 2,849 patients were randomly assigned to aspirin 81, 325, 650, or 1,300 mg, started before surgery and continued for 3 months; low-dose groups (81 and 325 mg) had lower combined stroke, MI, and death at 30 days (5.4% vs 7.0%, P = .07) and 3 months (6.2% vs 8.4%, P = .03). No RCTs measured important outcomes comparing clopidogrel vs aspirin or clopidogrel plus aspirin vs single antiplatelet therapy in this setting.

### Trends in dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients noneligible for POINT / CHANCE trial treatment [^1128n9LQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

This study's results in the Korean nationwide stroke registry contrast in several ways with related findings from the US Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)‐Stroke nationwide stroke registry. The GWTG‐Stroke investigation analyzed only data from 2019 to 2020 so it was not able to evaluate trends over time in DAPT‐AC use. Notably, in the comparable 2019 to 2020 time period, the rate of DAPT‐AC use in nonminor ischemic stroke patients was substantially higher in the Korean than in the US registry, 66% to 72% versus 44%. Moreover, the DAPT‐AC use rate in Korea in nonminor stroke patients was also substantially higher than the use rate in the United States in minor ischemic stroke patients (47%). These findings may reflect that the CHANCE trial, conducted in Asian patients, had a greater impact upon clinicians in Korea, while US physicians awaited the results of the later POINT trial in a Western population and an increase in DAPT‐AC was only just beginning in the 2019 to 2020 timeframe.

The high rate of DAPT‐AC use in patients ineligible for recent trials likely reflects several factors. In the specific conditions of carotid artery stenting or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, moderately strong indirect evidence supports DAPT‐AC though randomized trials within these populations are lacking. This likely explains the lower rate of DAPT‐AC use in nonstenosis compared with any stenosis patients during the first years of the study period. Also, in the setting of breakthrough strokes despite aspirin monotherapy, indirect evidence supports intensifying antithrombotic therapy from aspirin to DAPT‐AC. These circumstances reflect decision‐making by clinicians based on physiologic reasoning and available data when definitive randomized trial evidence is lacking. These considerations likely also explain the higher DAPT‐AC use rate among patients with higher baseline risk for recurrent stroke, in whom clinicians may perceive more intensive preventive therapy is needed.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112SVWEo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Carotid atherosclerosis — antithrombotic treatment: No adequately powered studies have been performed in asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis to confirm a benefit with antithrombotic treatment in reducing incident stroke. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended daily aspirin as cardiovascular prophylaxis in patients with anticipated cardiac morbidity of > 3% for men aged > 45 years and in women aged > 55 years, and the AHA Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke agrees with this recommendation; there is no evidence to suggest that antiplatelet agents other than aspirin have improved benefit in asymptomatic patients. For non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) associated with carotid atherosclerosis, antiplatelet agents are recommended, with aspirin (50–325 mg), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel described as acceptable options for initial therapy, while a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended; aspirin is widely used, with as many as 30 million Americans on long-term regimens.

### STENOSIS: long-term single versus dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischaemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease-a randomised trial [^113AFrHP]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The aetiology of ischaemic stroke (IS) is usually classified on the basis of the Trial of Org 10 172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification into large artery atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardioembolic, other determined cause or undetermined aetiology. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the common causes of IS worldwide and is associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet for secondary prevention of IS. However, when used alone in symptomatic patients with ICAD, patients have been reported to develop recurrent stroke at an annual rate of 4%–19%. In the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial, the dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) arm showed a lower rate of stroke at 90 days in patients treated with dual antiplatelets for 21 days. The rate of moderate to severe haemorrhage, and haemorrhagic stroke was 0.3% in both groups. In the CHANCE substudy on 481 patients with stenosis due to ICAD, there was a trend for more favourable outcomes (recurrent strokes at 90 days) in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group than in the aspirin monotherapy group (11.3% vs 13.6%). The Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischaemic Stroke trial also suggested an uncertainty of benefit in treating with DAPT for 3 months, although with an increased bleeding rate.

Findings of Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Therapy for Intracranial Arterial Stenosis trial favour the use of aggressive medical management (aspirin 325 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 90 days) over percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting using Wingspan in high-risk ICAD.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend addition of clopidogrel to aspirin for 90 days among patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) caused by 70%–99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery (class IIb; level of evidence B).

The optimal duration of DAPT therapy still remains a topic of debate. The current study aims to study the safety and efficacy of long-term DAPT (12 months) compared with 3 months in patients with IS due to ICAD.

### Editor's choice-risk of bleeding complications with different peri-operative antithrombotic regimens during carotid endarterectomy: a national registry analysis [^114khuRd]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Antithrombotic therapy is one of the cornerstones of the prevention of (recurrent) ocular or cerebral ischaemic events in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Randomised controlled trials on antithrombotic therapy for patients with minor ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have recommended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the three weeks following the index event. However, these trials excluded patients undergoing carotid revascularisation. To date, the optimal antithrombotic therapy during the peri-operative period of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains unclear.

Methods

Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing primary CEA from the Dutch Audit for Carotid Interventions registry between June 2013 and December 2020 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was defined as post-operative cervical bleeding needing re-intervention or intracranial haemorrhage during the first 30 days following CEA. The secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke or TIA or all cause mortality during the first 30 days following CEA. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions analyses were applied, with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as the reference value.

Results

A total of 12 317 patients were included. In the peri-operative phase, 31.0% of patients were treated with ASA, 32.4% with clopidogrel, 11.1% with ASA plus clopidogrel, 10.4% with ASA plus dipyridamole, 10.3% with vitamin K antagonist, and 4.8% with direct acting oral anticoagulants therapy. After multiple logistic regression analysis, no association was seen with the primary outcome in ASA plus clopidogrel (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; confidence interval [CI] 0.58–1.13; p = .23), and ASA plus dipyridamole (OR 0.69; CI 0.47–1.00; p = .059). Both the DAPT therapies were not associated with the secondary outcome.

Conclusion

The effectiveness and safety of DAPT did not differ from single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in patients undergoing CEA and further evaluation is needed in prospective studies. Considering additional data from the literature and guideline recommendations, DAPT should be started immediately after stroke until 30 days after CEA followed by SAPT, due to a possible reduction in the risk of recurrence.

Patient population

All consecutive patients with a diagnosis of recent IS or TIA, within 3 months from onset will be screened for eligibility. Following a standard evaluation, patients with symptomatic ICAD on CT angiogram or contrast MR angiogram or Digital Substraction angiography (DSA), including intracranial ICA (internal carotid artery), M1 MCA (middle cerebral artery), M2 MCA, A1 ACA (anterior cerebral artery), PCA (posterior cerebral artery) P1, intracranial VA (vertebral artery) and basilar artery will be screened for eligibility. The ICAD will be judged using the Warfarin Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease criteriausing the formula: [1 — (D stenosis/D normal)] ×100 = % stenosis. In this calculation, the normal segment is ideally measured at a site proximal to the stenotic lesion.

Design and Patients

Details regarding thetrial rationale, design, and methods have been described elsewhere. The protocol for thetrial was approved by the ethics committee at each participating site, and all patients provided written, informed consent before randomization. In that multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial, patients at 292 sites in Japan underwent assignment following randomization from December 2013 through March 2017. The steering committee extended the period of enrollment for 1 year to increase the number of anticipated patients. Any event related to the primary and secondary outcomes was reviewed by the event review committee, which was blinded to the patients' antiplatelet medications.

The trial's eligible patients were subjects between 20 and 85 years old who had experienced a noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, as identified on magnetic resonance imaging, between 8 and 180 days before the start of the protocol treatment. These patients were administered either aspirin or clopidogrel alone as antiplatelet therapy after providing informed consent. The choice of whether to use aspirin or clopidogrel before randomization depended on the physician in charge. The patients were also required to meet one or more of the following 3 criteria indicating a high risk of stroke recurrence: (1) ≥ 50% stenosis of a major intracranial artery (to the level of A2, M2, or P2); (2) ≥ 50% stenosis of an extracranial artery (common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, vertebral artery, brachiocephalic artery, or subclavian artery); and (3) 2 or more of the following risk factors: age ≥ 65 years, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease, history of ischemic stroke other than the qualifying stroke for the trial, history of ischemic heart disease, and current smoking.

### Identification of patient characteristics that may improve procedure selection for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^111Gs9Nm]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are the predominant procedures used for treating carotid artery stenosis. Therapy indications, diagnostic measures, and treatment types need to be established under international guideline recommendations. In general, CEA is the standard therapy, whereas CAS may be considered an alternative in selected patients, especially symptomatic patients at high surgical risk. Regarding the choice of procedure (CEA or CAS), the decision should be based on patient-specific clinical and morphological variables, as well as the patient's personal preferences (level of evidence/grading of recommendation: expert consensus, German–Austrian guideline). The following characteristics and morphological variables are associated with higher risk when performing CAS (making CEA more beneficial): older age (greater than 70 years), a short time interval between the index event and treatment, difficult access for CAS, and morphological characteristics of long stenosis, heavy calcification, vessel elongation, and plaque ulceration (expert consensus based on Naylor et al.and Aboyans et al.). In contrast, the following characteristics are associated with higher risk when performing CEA: restenosis, post-radiation stenosis, skull base near stenosis, tandem stenosis, and contralateral paresis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (expert consensus). However, all grades of the latter recommendations are expert consensus only, as higher-level evidence, for example direct head-to-head randomized studies, which justifies a higher grade of recommendation, remains unavailable. Regarding transfemoral CAS, a risk-calculating tool for the 30-day risk of stroke or death was developed based on a secondary data analysis of the Vascular Quality Initiative database. This analysis directly associated the following factors with a higher risk in patients treated with CAS: age, race, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, symptomatic status, and contralateral occlusion. In contrast, dual antiplatelet therapy and statin use were related to lower risk after CAS. Notably, these risk prediction models conducted the analysis either within a CEA or within a CAS cohort, but not simultaneously in both.

The aim of this study was to identify factors that modify the effect between treatment types and outcomes, which can be used to refine the selection process of treatment type.

### Antiplatelet therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular events in patients with extracranial carotid artery disease [^115i8wgu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries around the world. In the United States, there are an estimated 700,000 cases of stroke annually (of which over 85% are ischemic), costing an estimated $56.8 billion in associated treatment. Large vessel internal carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Population-based studies have shown that the prevalence of carotid stenosis is approximately 0.5% in the sixth decade of life and increases to approximately 10% in the ninth decade. The majority of patients are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis with ≤ 75% lumen loss carries a stroke risk of 1.3% annually, whereas the combined risk of myocardial ischemia and vascular death is as high as 10%. With diameter stenosis > 75%, the combined stroke and transient ischemic attack risk increases to approximately 11% annually, with 75% of events ipsilateral to the affected artery. Other studies have also shown that the risk of stroke increases proportionately to the severity of stenosis. The risk is higher for those patients who are symptomatic. In this review, we will discuss antiplatelet agents to prevent cerebrovascular events in the context of extracranial carotid artery disease. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss antiplatelet treatment for other etiologies of stroke.

### Clopidogrel resistance and ticagrelor replacement in dual antiplatelet therapy for carotid artery stenting [^115VMSXC]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Resistance to the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel in patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy for carotid stenting may increase the risk of periprocedural neurological events. The purpose of the study was to describe the phenomenon of clopidogrel resistance in a series of patients undergoing carotid stenting.

Methods

Data of patients who consecutively underwent carotid stenting from November 2016 to December 2020 for a significant stenosis and who underwent a dual antiplatelet therapy using acetyl-salicylic acid and clopidogrel were prospectively collected. Patients who were already taking a different thienopyridine were excluded. The effectiveness of antiplatelet drugs was assessed by the impedance aggregometry test. Primary endpoint was to evaluate the incidence of clopidogrel resistance and the effectiveness of ticagrelor as alternative therapy. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Two-hundred patients (80 females, 40%) underwent stenting for carotid stenosis (94% asymptomatic). The phenomenon of clopidogrel resistance was observed in 38 patients (19%), in whom clopidogrel was replaced by ticagrelor (90 mg/bis in die) with 100% effectiveness at aggregometry test. Platelet counts was associated to clopidogrel resistance (P = 0.001). There was no stent thrombosis at 30 days, neither major hemorrhagic events; a total of 12/200 major adverse cardiovascular events occurred (6%), including 1 in the group of patients who took ticagrelor and 11 in group of patients under clopidogrel (2.6% versus 6.7%, P = 0.55).

Conclusions

Clopidogrel was ineffective in 19% of patients undergoing carotid stenting. Platelet count seemed to affect this phenomenon. In these patients, clopidogrel was effectively replaced by ticagrelor.

### STENOSIS: long-term single versus dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischaemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease-a randomised trial [^115syw5G]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The estimated prevalence of symptomatic intracranial stenosis ranges from 20% to 53% with higher risk in Asian, African and Hispanic communities. The concept of best medical management includes risk factor management, DAPT or antiplatelet monotherapy, statin therapy and antihypertensive therapy.

Efficacy of DAPT using aspirin and clopidogrel entails blocking two different pathways of thrombosis. Inadequate response to DAPT is not rare in these complex pathways, owing to differences in genotype, external factors and detection methods. Use of combination aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended for secondary prevention of stroke beyond 90 days due to potentially increased risk of major haemorrhage as seen in the MATCHand CHARISMAtrials. Data for ICAD specifically are limited and derived from data of patients in the SAMPRISS trialor subgroup analysis of CHANCE trial. However, studies have not been specifically designed to answer this question in the long term.

One of the major strengths of this trial is the double-blind, placebo controlled design. It is pragmatic and will randomise patients at 3 months, as it is common practice to give 3 months of DAPT to patients of ICAD based on the results of the SAMPRISS trial. All imaging will be uploaded into a web based server in DICOM imaging format. The sites will also be permitted to send across the images to the coordinating centre for any clarity related to patient eligibility, thus ensuring uniformity, and minimising protocol violations. In addition, the trial will also include ICAD ranging from 51% to 70%, about which the evidence is relatively scarce.

Summary and conclusions

ICAD causes about 5%–10% of strokes in white people, 15%–29% of TIAs or strokes in black people and up to 30%–50% of strokes in Asian people. The current study will help in strengthening evidence for the duration of DAPT in this population. If a longer duration of DAPT yields better outcomes in this study, it will lead to a change in clinical practice.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — supportive evidence and adjunctive medical therapy: A combined analysis of the original carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials found robust benefit for CEA in severe (70%–99%) ICA stenosis with a 16.0% absolute benefit over 5 years. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).

### Carotid artery stenting in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a possible primary therapy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^113DZ2QD]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the results of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in symptomatic patients (stroke/transient ischemic attack) after recent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

Between January 2009 and July 2011, 28 consecutive patients (18 women; mean age 66 years, range 42–82) underwent protected CAS for symptomatic carotid stenosis following recent PTCA that included bare or drug-eluting stents requiring uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy. Primary technical success, neurological complications, major adverse cardiovascular events, and death were evaluated at 30 days and over midterm follow-up.

Results

Technical success was 96%; 1 patient suffered a nonfatal major stroke (3.5% 30-day stroke rate) during the procedure. During a median 21.6-month follow-up, 4 (14%) patients died of myocardial infarction (all diabetic smokers with ejection fractions < 40%), but there were no new neurological events. Estimated survival was 89.3% at 2 years. Further coronary interventions were performed in 2 diabetic patients with a body mass index > 34 kg/m(2).

Conclusion

This preliminary experience demonstrated that CAS is a reasonable, safe, and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis who were recently treated with coronary stents requiring uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid artery stenting, asymptomatic patients, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing carotid artery stenting in addition to optimal medical treatment in high-surgical-risk patients with a CAS of 60–99%, in the presence of high-risk features.

Neurologically asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 60% — carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic lesions: Controlled randomized trials have compared CEA with best medical therapy and the results of ACAS and ACST favored CEA. ACAS demonstrated the superiority of CEA over antiplatelet therapy alone for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of ≥ 60%, and this trial recommended CEA for these patients (aged < 80 years) as long as the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for the individual surgeon was not > 3%. In updated ACST I results, the patients in the CEA arm (aged < 75 years) experienced significantly lower perioperative and 10-year stroke rates (13.3% vs 17.9%). The question of whether modern medical therapy (including statins) is equivalent or superior to CEA or CAS has not yet been addressed by well-designed, appropriately funded, prospective, multicenter, and randomized trials.

A: Appropriate antithrombotic therapy

The 'A' criterion ('Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy') in the post-stroke patient refers to the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs), either as a non-vitamin K antagonist OAC (also called a direct OAC or DOAC) or well-managed vitamin K antagonist (VKA, e.g. warfarin) with a time in therapeutic range ≥ 70% when AF is present or a VKA, if a prosthetic mechanical heart valve is present. Where there is associated atherosclerotic vascular disease and no AF or mechanical valve present, the appropriate use of antiplatelet therapy is needed. A balance is needed between preventing recurrent ischaemic or thrombotic events and major bleeding, which is even more challenging if both AF and vascular disease, whether coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery disease, are present. In such patients (ie. AF with stable vascular disease), anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice as thromboprphylaxis, although many physicians would still prescribe combination therapy, despite the paucity of evidence from large randomized trials. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, for example, the pooled prevalence of carotid stenosis in AF patients was 12.4% (95% CI 8.7 to 16.0), ranging from 4.4 to 24.3%. In AF patients with coronary artery disease, appropriate antithrombotic therapy management varies according the clinical scenario.

When the AF patient has 'stable vascular disease', the patient should be managed with OAC monotherapy. In the AFIRE trial, combination therapy with OAC plus antiplatelets was associated with worse thromboembolic and bleeding outcomes in AF patients with stable coronary disease. In AF patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a balance between AF-related stroke prevention which requires OAC and reducing cardiac ischaemia in an ACS presentation which requires antiplatelet therapy needs to be reached; to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis after a percutaneous coronary intervention and the risk of bleeding by the combination of OAC with antiplatelet therapy. In patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis and AF, carotid endarterectomy is commonly considered, or, in those less suitable for surgery, carotid artery stenting may be chosennotwithstanding the need for a short course of combined antithrombotic therapy after stenting. While more data are needed to inform optimal antithrombotic management in this setting, a recent nationwide observational evidence suggested that OAC therapy alone could be a default treatment for most of these patients, combined with a short period single antiplatelet therapy in those at high risk of a recurrent vascular event.

### Carotid artery endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic non-stenotic carotid artery disease [^112fAqLS]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intriguingly, Goyal et al have recently suggested working definitions of SyNC, given that a diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke likely precludes patients from undergoing targeted stroke preventative therapy. In other words, if patients were to meet certain criteria for subtypes of SyNC (definite, likely or probable SyNC based on the presence of various factors), then a targeted approach may be pursued for secondary prevention. Although SyNC represents a plausible aetiology of ipsilateral stroke, confirmatory studies are needed to confirm SyNC as a definite stroke aetiology before any targeted therapy can be evaluated. Whether or not CEA would be a efficacious modality for secondary prevention in such cases requires further evaluation.

Our work indicates that CEA is a safe and well-tolerated intervention in patients with SyNC in the absence of another plausible stroke source. Although it may be that CEA prevents future ischaemic events in such patients, prospective clinical trials are largely needed. This work also suggests that a subpopulation of patients having embolic strokes of unknown aetiology with ipsilateral substenotic carotid disease could harbour thrombogenic lesions in non-stenosing complicated plaques. Therefore, dedicated carotid wall imaging capable to identify plaque disruption at the lumen/wall interface and not just luminal narrowing measurement may be a beneficial component in the workup of patients with embolic strokes of an unknown aetiology.

In addition to the relevance in stroke aetiology, growing clinical evidence has shown an increased risk of ipsilateral recurrent strokes refractory to medical treatment in a subset of patients with SyNC and vulnerable plaque features, in particular IPH. This pathological hallmark of plaque instability is important as current intensive medical management, especially in patients with recurrent strokes, includes dual antiplatelet therapy and in cases of embolic strokes of unknown source, which may paradoxically worsen plaque haemorrhage. In our cohort, 93.7% of patients were on aspirin and half of the patients were also on clopidogrel prior to the intervention, with 71.8% of patients having recurrent ipsilateral cerebrovascular events. Clinically, the management of symptomatic patients with mild carotid stenosis remains challenging. However, CEA may be a valid and an effective therapeutic option as supported by other single centre surgical series.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis — aspirin for primary prevention is suggested: For persons with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, we suggest aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). Remarks state that "Aspirin slightly reduces total mortality regardless of cardiovascular risk profile if taken over 10 years". They add, "In people at moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events, the reduction in MI is closely balanced with an increase in major bleeds", and "Whatever their risk status, people who are averse to taking medication over a prolonged time period for very small benefits will be disinclined to use aspirin for primary prophylaxis".

WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IPH?

Specific treatment directed at IPH remains poorly studied. In selected patients, particularly those with recurrent cryptogenic events after documentation of IPH, CEA, or less often carotid stenting can be considered even though the degree of carotid stenosis is not severe and by standard criteria would not merit CEA/carotid stenting,(Figure 4). Rates of recurrent strokes among such patients undergoing CEA are exceptionally low, particularly in patients with < 50% stenosis, suggesting that in appropriately selected patients this may be a feasible option. Still, this is not without risk: a meta‐analysis by Brinjikji et al noted that the rate of postoperative strokes after carotid stenting was higher in patients with IPH, likely because such unstable plaques were more likely to seed emboli. Our institution has begun treating some patients with nonstenotic carotid IPH with CEA or carotid stenting with anecdotal success. Nevertheless, this remains a contentious issue across institutions.

Medical treatment options range from dual antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulant, though the efficacy of these strategies may be limited. If intraluminal thrombus is already present, dual antiplatelet therapy may not be effective. The effects of statin therapy have been the focus of considerable analysis, including a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 361 patients that reported the effect of statins on changes in carotid plaque composition. In that study, the authors identified a significant decrease in lipid‐rich‐necrotic core volumes when assessed at > 12 months of treatment but no change when imaged at shorter durations of therapy. It is possible that by decreasing these pathologic substrates, the development of IPH may be retarded. Further studies are needed to identify novel minimally invasive plaque modification techniques that may help stabilize and eventually heal IPH.

### SCAI / SVM expert consensus statement on carotid stenting: training and credentialing for carotid stenting [^113D8E9w]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Medium credibility.

SCAI/SVM expert consensus — clinical elements of CAS training: Physicians must understand the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease, assess concordance of neurological symptoms with anatomic findings, and stratify stroke risk based on symptomatic status, stenosis severity, and other characteristics; they must also be able to characterize patients as high- or standard-surgical risk for CEA. In the outpatient setting, required competencies include prescribing medications to modify atherosclerotic risk and reduce stroke risk, prescribing appropriate antiplatelet therapy, ordering and interpreting noninvasive imaging, recommending invasive angiography when appropriate, and counseling patients and families about the relative risks of medical therapy, CAS and CEA. In the inpatient setting, physicians must direct care before, during, and after intervention, including obtaining a formal independent neurological assessment before and after the procedure, ensuring appropriate medical therapy including dual antiplatelet therapy, monitoring for neurological, hemodynamic, and cardiovascular complications, managing complications, and arranging follow-up care.
