## Question

What is the most effective treatment approach for Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective treatment approach for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify disease severity and identify systemic involvement. Then, I should verify and remove identifiable triggers. Next, I will consider first-line supportive measures and how to monitor response. After that, I will outline therapy for mild cutaneous disease, escalate for severe or systemic disease, and plan maintenance and relapse prevention. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios such as SLE-associated disease, ICI-induced vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and pediatrics, and I will conclude with an evidence-weighted synthesis of the most effective approach by severity tier.

> Let me first confirm the disease classification and severity anchors, because treatment hinges on whether LCV is skin-limited or systemic and on severity within the skin. Skin-limited disease presents with palpable purpura, petechiae, urticarial plaques, vesicles, or ulcers confined to the skin, whereas systemic involvement implies renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, or other organ involvement; these distinctions directly drive intensity of immunosuppression, so I need to check carefully for systemic signs and obtain targeted labs and urinalysis to screen for internal organ disease [^114PTuzA]. Severity in cutaneous-only disease is typically judged by extent, ulceration, necrosis, and functional impact; the ACR 2025 guidance for SLE-associated cutaneous vasculitis emphasizes avoiding overtreatment of minor cutaneous vasculitis while escalating for extensive or severe cutaneous disease, which aligns with general LCV practice [^11315TAB] [^113FMaBj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immunosuppression before identifying and removing triggers. I need to ensure a meticulous review of new medications, including antibiotics, allopurinol, propylthiouracil, and biologics, and actively stop suspected agents because drug-induced LCV is common and resolution often follows withdrawal; infections such as hepatitis B/C and HIV, and less commonly VZV, should be screened and treated as indicated [^116KUTea] [^1112KE3d] [^114VE2MU]. But wait, what if the patient is on a TNF-α inhibitor and vasculitis appears; I should confirm temporal linkage and, if causality is likely, discontinue the TNF inhibitor given robust signals for TNF-associated vasculitis in RA cohorts and case literature [^115Hdi25] [^112gEscW].

> Next, I should review foundational supportive care because many cases are self-limited and respond to conservative measures. Leg elevation, compression, avoidance of prolonged standing, NSAIDs for pain and inflammation, and antihistamines for pruritus are appropriate; I should double-check that I'm not implying antihistamines treat the vasculitic process itself, since they do not, even though they help symptoms [^114PTuzA] [^116D2sDb]. I need to ensure follow-up within 1–2 weeks to document trajectory and decide on escalation if there is no improvement or if lesions worsen, particularly with ulceration or systemic features.

> For mild, skin-limited LCV that persists despite supportive care, I will now examine first-line systemic options with favorable risk profiles. Conditional recommendations from the ACR support dapsone or colchicine as preferred additions over oral glucocorticoids in ongoing mild cutaneous vasculitis, which I should frame as a shared decision given low-to-moderate certainty evidence and the need to balance benefit and adverse effects; both agents are reasonable, with colchicine sometimes favored for arthralgia and dapsone useful when neutrophil-rich disease predominates, but I need to check G6PD before dapsone and monitor for hemolysis or methemoglobinemia [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB]. Wait, let me verify a common pitfall: some older reviews suggest hydroxychloroquine as first-line for mild cutaneous vasculitis, but the 2025 ACR SLE guideline prioritizes dapsone or colchicine over immunosuppressants for persistent mild cutaneous vasculitis, so I should not overstate hydroxychloroquine's role here even though it can be adjunctive in selected contexts such as lupus-associated disease or UV/HUVS [^113FMaBj] [^116D2sDb] [^116D2sDb].

> I should confirm expected timelines and response criteria so I don't prematurely escalate. Within 2–4 weeks of dapsone or colchicine, I expect reduction in new lesion formation, flattening of purpura, and symptom improvement; if there is inadequate response, I need to reassess adherence, reconsider the diagnosis, and then escalate to low-dose systemic glucocorticoids, typically prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with a planned taper once control is achieved, recognizing the infection and metabolic risks with prolonged use [^111KhoM5]. If glucocorticoids are required repeatedly or steroid toxicity emerges, I should add a steroid-sparing agent such as methotrexate or azathioprine, chosen based on comorbidities and monitoring logistics, and I must remember that many of these escalation steps are supported by conditional recommendations and observational data rather than high-certainty RCTs in isolated cutaneous LCV [^114PTuzA] [^113FMaBj].

> For severe cutaneous disease with ulceration, necrosis, or high disease burden, and for any systemic involvement, I need to ensure prompt, appropriately aggressive therapy. High-dose oral glucocorticoids, often 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent, are standard initial therapy, with pulse intravenous methylprednisolone considered for organ- or life-threatening presentations; I should double-check that pulse dosing is reserved for severe scenarios given infection risk, aligning with AAV guidance on high-dose glucocorticoids in severe disease [^117LkQjH] [^113uP6sY]. Indications for adding cyclophosphamide include rapidly progressive cutaneous necrosis, major organ involvement, or failure of glucocorticoids; rituximab is a reasonable alternative in ANCA-associated vasculitis or when cyclophosphamide is contraindicated, and in refractory cases plasmapheresis or IVIG can be considered, albeit based on limited evidence in cutaneous LCV outside specific contexts [^113bjonc] [^114PTuzA] [^116Wh21s].

> Let me consider maintenance and relapse prevention, because LCV can recur and glucocorticoid toxicity accumulates. Once remission is achieved, I should taper glucocorticoids slowly while continuing a steroid-sparing agent such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, chosen to match comorbidity and prior response; rituximab can be considered for relapsing disease or when other agents are ineffective or poorly tolerated, acknowledging that much of the robust evidence for rituximab derives from AAV rather than isolated cutaneous LCV [^112siDfH] [^113bjonc]. I need to ensure periodic reassessment for triggers, new medications, and intercurrent infections that can precipitate flares, and I should educate patients to seek early review if purpura recurs or systemic symptoms develop [^114PTuzA].

> Now, I will integrate special scenarios, starting with SLE-associated cutaneous vasculitis. The 2025 ACR SLE guideline conditionally recommends dapsone or colchicine over immunosuppressive therapies, including oral glucocorticoids, for mild ongoing cutaneous vasculitis despite topical and antimalarial therapy, emphasizing avoidance of overtreatment; if disease is extensive or severe, glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive therapy are appropriate, and hydroxychloroquine remains foundational background therapy for SLE even if it is not the preferred escalation for persistent mild vasculitis in this context [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB]. Wait, I should verify that I'm not contradicting myself about hydroxychloroquine; yes, it is first-line for SLE skin disease broadly, but for persistent mild LCV lesions the ACR panel favors dapsone or colchicine as the add-on, which resolves the apparent inconsistency [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB].

> For immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated vasculitis, I should confirm that systemic glucocorticoids are frequently required and that holding the ICI is common. Reports indicate that approximately two-thirds of small-vessel vasculitis cases receive systemic glucocorticoids at prednisone-equivalent doses around 1 mg/kg, with pulse steroids for severe disease, and that many patients ultimately discontinue the ICI; csDMARDs such as methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine can be steroid-sparing adjuncts in selected cases, but decisions should be coordinated with oncology [^113uP6sY].

> Urticarial vasculitis deserves a distinct pathway. I need to check complement levels and anti-C₁q antibodies because hypocomplementemic UV often behaves more systemically. For skin-limited UV, antihistamines, dapsone, colchicine, or hydroxychloroquine are reasonable, while more severe or hypocomplementemic disease may require systemic glucocorticoids with steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate, and biologics including rituximab, IL-1 blockade, or omalizumab have emerging evidence in refractory cases, with omalizumab supported by case series and long-term reports of efficacy and tolerability [^111P1295] [^116D2sDb] [^113ujAyz] [^114M31ed]. Hold on, I should verify that omalizumab is not first-line; correct, it is typically reserved for refractory UV after conventional options, consistent with low-to-moderate certainty evidence [^113ujAyz] [^114M31ed].

> In pediatrics, I should confirm that most childhood cutaneous vasculitis is self-limited and managed supportively, with NSAIDs and short glucocorticoid courses reserved for significant symptoms. Agents like colchicine or dapsone are used sparingly and guided by pediatric experience, and I need to ensure vigilance for IgA vasculitis with renal involvement, which changes management entirely toward renal-directed protocols [^1142YCbS] [^111JYjP7]. Let me reconsider whether azathioprine has a role in refractory pediatric cutaneous disease; yes, small case series suggest utility in steroid-dependent or relapsing non-renal IgA vasculitis, but this remains low-certainty and should be individualized [^116qEfca].

> Bringing this together, the most effective treatment approach is severity- and context-tailored: for mild, skin-limited LCV, dapsone or colchicine added to supportive care is preferred over early glucocorticoids. For severe cutaneous disease or any systemic involvement, prompt systemic glucocorticoids with early addition of cyclophosphamide or rituximab when indicated provides the best outcomes. Throughout, I need to ensure trigger removal, vigilant monitoring for adverse effects, and a plan for glucocorticoid taper with steroid-sparing maintenance to minimize toxicity and prevent relapse [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB] [^117LkQjH] [^113bjonc]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing conditional recommendations and shared decision-making given the limited high-certainty evidence in isolated cutaneous LCV, which it does [^113FMaBj] [^1124pnkg].

The most effective treatment for leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a **stepwise approach** [^114PTuzA] based on severity and organ involvement, with trigger removal and supportive care for all patients [^111gUeCp]. For mild, skin-limited disease, **colchicine or dapsone** are preferred over systemic glucocorticoids [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB]. For severe cutaneous or systemic disease, **systemic glucocorticoids** (prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) are first-line, with rituximab or cyclophosphamide for refractory or life-threatening cases [^116D2sDb] [^114PTuzA]. Plasmapheresis or IVIG are reserved for refractory disease or systemic involvement [^111gUeCp]. Management should be individualized, with close monitoring for adverse effects and relapse [^116iBoW4].

---

## General principles of management

- **Identify and remove triggers**: Discontinue offending drugs, treat infections, and address underlying systemic diseases [^114tuByT] [^111gUeCp].

- **Supportive care**: Leg elevation, compression stockings, and avoidance of prolonged standing or cold exposure [^114PTuzA].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of disease activity, organ involvement, and treatment response [^116iBoW4].

---

## Treatment based on disease severity and organ involvement

### Mild, skin-limited disease

First-line therapy is **colchicine or dapsone**, which are preferred over systemic glucocorticoids for persistent mild cutaneous LCV [^113FMaBj] [^11315TAB]. Alternative options include **hydroxychloroquine** or low-dose systemic glucocorticoids if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective [^113ujAyz] [^116D2sDb].

---

### Moderate to severe cutaneous disease or systemic involvement

- **Systemic glucocorticoids**: Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day is first-line for severe cutaneous or systemic LCV [^114PTuzA] [^116D2sDb].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide are added for steroid-sparing effect or refractory disease [^114PTuzA] [^116D2sDb].

- **Biologic therapy**: Rituximab is effective for refractory or relapsing LCV, particularly with systemic involvement [^116PxkPq] [^113ujAyz].

- **Plasmapheresis or IVIG**: Reserved for refractory disease or systemic involvement, such as renal or neurological involvement [^116Wh21s].

---

## Special considerations

- **Drug-induced LCV**: Immediate discontinuation of the offending drug is essential [^117M3Ht7].

- **Infection-associated LCV**: Treat the underlying infection promptly [^114tuByT].

- **Pediatric LCV**: Most cases are self-limited; supportive care and NSAIDs are first-line, with systemic glucocorticoids reserved for severe or persistent disease [^1142YCbS] [^111gUeCp].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **response, detect relapse, and manage adverse effects** [^116Ux7KT]. Long-term monitoring is critical to detect **relapse and chronic complications** [^116Ux7KT].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Refractory disease** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild, skin-limited | Colchicine or dapsone | Hydroxychloroquine or low-dose glucocorticoids | Systemic glucocorticoids |
| Moderate to severe | Systemic glucocorticoids | Immunosuppressive agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide) | Rituximab, plasmapheresis, IVIG |

---

The most effective treatment for LCV is a **stepwise approach** based on severity and organ involvement, with colchicine or dapsone for mild disease and systemic glucocorticoids with immunosuppressive agents for severe or systemic disease [^114PTuzA].

### Paraneoplastic vasculitis in patients with solid tumors: report of 15 cases [^111JNw5Q]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review all cases of concurrent vasculitis and solid tumors diagnosed at our Department over a 15-year period and explore evidence that would support the notion of vasculitis being a true paraneoplastic syndrome.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all patients diagnosed with vasculitis and solid tumors within 12 months of each other and prospectively followed until death or our report. We analyzed the main features and outcome of vasculitis in this setting. We also reviewed all cases published in the French-English literature.

Results

Fifteen patients (9 men and 6 women) in whom both vasculitis and solid tumor occurred within the same 12 months were identified. Mean age was 72.5 years (range 58–84). In 7 cases the diagnosis of vasculitis antedated that of cancer, in 6 both processes were synchronously diagnosed, and in 2 vasculitis appeared after cancer diagnosis. The most common vasculitis was cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 9). Other vasculitides included Henoch-Shönlein purpura (n = 2), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 1), and giant cell arteritis (n = 3). The commonest malignancies were carcinomas of urinary organs (40%), lung (26.7%), and gastrointestinal tract (26.7%). The median followup was 28.4 months (range 1–96). Thirteen of the 15 patients demonstrated concordance of disease activity and treatment response for both cancer and vasculitis. Vasculitis flared heralding tumor recurrence or progression in 7 (46.6%) cases.

Conclusion

In our patients, resolution of vasculitis following effective treatment of the putatively linked malignancy, and recurrence of vasculitis heralding tumor recurrence or progression, provide strong evidence for vasculitis being a true paraneoplastic syndrome. Chronic or persistent vasculitis with poor response to usually effective therapy, especially in elderly patients, should raise questions about underlying malignancy.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease mimicking cellulitis: a case report [^113whpWj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

LCV is rare cutaneous manifestation of CD sometimes initially misdiagnosed as cellulitis. Clinicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients with CD who present with constitutional symptoms and bilateral lower extremity rash. In approximately 30% of patients the rash can spread upwards to include abdomen, thorax and upper extremities and in more than 50% of reported cases it was associated with biologic therapy and not CD itself. In 50% of patients LCV occurred during CD exacerbation and 40% of patients had disease localized to the colon. Unlike other clinically diagnosable dermatologic manifestation of IBD, LCV requires a skin biopsy for diagnosis. In cases of suspected medication-induced LCV, appropriate management includes withdrawing the inciting medication. Systemic steroids show effectiveness for hastening recovery.

### Progress towards a core set of outcome measures in small-vessel vasculitis. report from OMERACT 9 [^112A5b4w]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a substantial increase in the number and quality of clinical trials of new therapies for vasculitis, including randomized, controlled, multicenter trials that have successfully incorporated measures of disease activity and toxicity. However, because current treatment regimens for severe disease effectively induce initial remission and reduce mortality, future trials will focus on any of several goals including: (a) treatment of mild-moderate disease; (b) prevention of chronic damage; (c) reduction in treatment toxicity; or (d) more subtle differences in remission induction or maintenance. Thus, new trials will require outcome measure instruments that are more precise and are better able to detect effective treatments for different disease states and measure chronic manifestations of disease. The OMERACT Vasculitis Working Group comprises international clinical investigators with expertise in vasculitis who, since 2002, have worked collaboratively to advance the refinement of outcome measures in vasculitis, create new measures to address domains of illness not covered by current research approaches, and harmonize outcome assessment in vasculitis. The focus of the OMERACT group to date has been on outcome measures in small-vessel vasculitis with an overall goal of creating a core set of outcome measures for vasculitis, each of which fulfills the OMERACT filter of truth, discrimination, feasibility, and identifying additional domains requiring further research. This process has been informed by several ongoing projects providing data on outcomes of disease activity, disease-related damage, multidimensional health-related quality of life, and patient-reported ratings of the burden of vasculitis.

### Vasculitis: kids are not just little people [^1142YCbS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cutaneous vasculitis, inflammatory destruction of blood vessels, can present with a wide range of clinical and pathologic findings across a number of heterogeneous conditions. Although some vasculitides are present in both children and adults, some important differences exist in clinical presentation, etiology, management, and prognosis in childhood vasculitis versus adult vasculitis. Cutaneous vasculitis is rare in children, and most childhood vasculitides, of which Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common, histologically are small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In children, infectious etiologies are more common than in adults. Childhood cutaneous vasculitis is most often self-limited with a good prognosis, and treatment is mainly supportive. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Update on vasculitis [^116XEJuq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a broad group of diseases identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. These unique entities have a broad spectrum of organ involvement and severity, which influences the approach to diagnosis and treatment. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents are used to manage most vasculitic diseases. Long-term outcome is influenced by chronic sequelae from organ damage, disease relapses, and medication side effects. Further research is needed to understand these diseases and discover more efficacious yet less toxic therapeutic options. This review will focus on vasculitic syndromes more likely to be presented to an allergist/immunologist in an outpatient setting.

### Cinacalcet-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis [^111s6RcT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

An 80-year-old woman on maintenance hemodialysis therapy developed severe hypercalcemia under vitamin D treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism. To avoid the toxic calcemic effects, cinacalcet was introduced and the dose of vitamin D was substantially decreased. Cinacalcet targets the calcium-sensing receptor and decreases parathyroid hormone levels without increasing calcium and phosphorus levels. Three days after starting cinacalcet therapy, the patient developed palpable purpura on both upper and lower extremities that resolved after discontinuation of cinacalcet and administration of steroids. Skin biopsy of the initial eruption showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, leukocytoclastic vasculitis probably was caused by cinacalcet introduction. Drug-induced vasculitis is a poorly defined disorder, and, in most cases, no pathogenetic mechanism can be described. An idiosyncratic reaction to the agent often is proposed. Cinacalcet should be considered a causative agent of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and although this is the result of only a clinical observation, further attention is required in the future because cinacalcet recently has been introduced in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on long-term hemodialysis therapy.

### Ulcerative colitis associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin [^112JqqxU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis may be associated with a number of skin lesions such as erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. We here describe an unusual case of a 33-year-old-caucasian male with ulcerative colitis and skin lesions diagnosed as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. An initial treatment with oral deflazacort led to little benefit, while treatment with oral mesalazine caused remission of the skin and intestinal manifestations in 2 weeks.

### Treatment of urticarial vasculitis: a systematic review [^111P1295]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a difficult-to-treat condition characterized by long-lasting urticarial rashes and histopathologic findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Treatment is dictated by the severity of skin and systemic involvement and the underlying systemic disease. This is a comprehensive systematic review of the efficacy of current UV treatment options. We searched for relevant studies in 7 databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In total, 261 eligible studies and 789 unique patients with UV were included in the systematic review. Most patients with UV are adult women with chronic (≥ 6 weeks) and systemic disease. UV is mostly idiopathic but can be associated with drugs, malignancy, autoimmunity, and infections. It usually resolves with their withdrawal or cure. Corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of skin symptoms in more than 80% of patients with UV. However, their long-term administration can lead to potentially serious adverse effects. The addition of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents often allows corticosteroid tapering and improves the efficacy of therapy. Biologicals, including omalizumab, as well as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, plasmapheresis, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, intravenous immunoglobulin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cyclosporine, can be effective for both skin and systemic symptoms in patients with UV. H₁-antihistamines, montelukast, danazol, H₂-antihistamines, pentoxifylline, doxepin, and tranexamic acid are not effective in most patients with UV. As of yet, no drugs have been approved for UV, and management recommendations are based mostly on case reports and retrospective studies. Prospective studies investigating the effects of treatment on the signs and symptoms of UV are needed.

### Biological therapies: new treatment options for ANCA-associated vasculitis? [^116SUs5D]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Biological therapies enable us to apply highly selective targeting components to modulate the immune response. Until now, a few controlled studies investigated the efficacy of TNF-alpha blocking agents in systemic vasculitis have been carried out, but, in general, they were falling short of expectations. However, there is conducive evidence that TNF-alpha blockers are advantageous in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, at least in selected disease stages. Likewise, although the efficacy of the monoclonal CD20 antibody rituximab in ANCA-associated vasculitis is obvious, the effect on predominantly granulomatous disease activity in Wegener's granulomatosis is less clear. In addition, interferon-alpha is used for induction treatment particularly in Churg-Strauss syndrome. Even though the effectiveness and safety of short-term administration was confirmed by case series, severe side effects after long-term treatment relativized the initial results. This review presents the recent data on the use of biologicals in vasculitis and appraises the knowledge in the clinical context.

### Update on the management of systemic vasculitis: what did we learn in 2009? [^113is3Gw]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

In the past two decades, the clinical investigation of systemic vasculitis has advanced from small case series and cohort studies to large multicentric randomised controlled clinical trials. The growing evidence gathered from all these trials led to the development of international consensus guidelines on the management of systemic vasculitides. The combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisone is still regarded the induction treatment of first choice for most types of generalised systemic vasculitis. However, treatment-associated adverse events of this regimen occur frequently and have a considerable negative effect on outcomes. Therefore, the major challenge in the treatment of systemic vasculitis is the search for treatments that are less toxic, but similarly effective compared to cyclophosphamide. In 2009, several studies have addressed these issues. It was shown that the cumulative dosage can be reduced by pulse versus oral administration without losing efficacy. Furthermore, new data indicate that targeted treatments such as rituximab might have the potential to replace cyclophosphamide in the future. In this article, the key studies in the field of vasculitis that might affect clinical management are reviewed and their potential relevance for patient care and future research is discussed.

### Vasculitis: current status and future directions [^113hCQSd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasculitides represent such a heterogeneous group of disorders that difficulties arise in their classification. Although biopsy examination of involved tissues remains essential, new serological markers have been developed. Therapeutic strategies have been refined, and B lymphocyte-targeted drugs may prove a satisfactory alternative.

### Cutaneous vasculitis: diagnosis and management [^114PTuzA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is histologically defined as inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of blood vessels. Vasculitis is classified as primary (idiopathic, eg, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis) or secondary, a manifestation of connective tissue diseases, infections, adverse drug eruptions, or a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Cutaneous vasculitis, manifested as urticaria, purpura, hemorrhagic vesicles, ulcers, nodules, livedo, infarcts, or digital gangrene, is a frequent and often significant component of many systemic vasculitic syndromes such as lupus or rheumatoid vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated primary vasculitic syndromes such as Churg-Strauss syndrome. In most instances, cutaneous vasculitis represents a self-limited, single-episode phenomenon, the treatment of which consists of general measures such as leg elevation, warming, avoidance of standing, cold temperatures and tight fitting clothing, and therapy with antihistamines, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More extensive therapy is indicated for symptomatic, recurrent, extensive, and persistent skin disease or coexistence of systemic disease. For mild recurrent or persistent disease, colchicine and dapsone are first-choice agents. Severe cutaneous and systemic disease requires more potent immunosuppression (prednisone plus azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil). In cases of refractory vasculitis, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin are viable considerations. The new biologic therapies that work via cytokine blockade or lymphocyte depletion such as tumor alpha inhibitor infliximab and the anti-B-cell antibody rituximab, respectively, are showing benefit in certain settings such as Wegener's granulomatosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, Behçet's disease, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.

### Leucocytoclastic vasculitis following influenza vaccination [^116NfUnt]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Influenza vaccinations are commonly administered and effectively prevent influenza. Most vaccine reactions are mild and self-limiting with few reported cases of vasculitis. We present a case of vasculitis post-vaccination unique for its dramatic visual presentation and rapid response to treatment with the aim to emphasise possible causation and timely treatment.

Case Presentation

This is a case of a 60-year-old man with chronic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with fever, arthralgias and rash characterised by extensive erythematous plaques on his limbs and trunk 5â€‰days after influenza vaccination. Skin biopsy revealed leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Rash and symptoms resolved 10 days after initiating treatment with oral prednisone.

Conclusions

Influenza vaccines can potentially precipitate cutaneous vasculitis, and timely treatment reduces morbidity in the elderly.

### Advances in the treatment of small vessel vasculitis [^117RUWdj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The systemic small vessel vasculitides encompass Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. The traditional approach to therapy, which incorporates cytotoxic drugs and glucocorticoids, is associated with a significant risk of relapse and treatment-related toxicity. The formation of multicenter collaborative groups has facilitated the execution of randomized controlled trials, and has led to the identification of several effective therapeutic options. This article reviews the existing data and refers to studies in progress that may answer some of the questions that remain regarding the treatment of the small vessel vasculitides.

### Diagnosis and management of cutaneous vasculitis in children [^111JYjP7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Cutaneous vasculitis in children is rare. Causes of cutaneous vasculitis are varied and are typically differentiated by the affected vessel size. A skin biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis but other causes for vasculitis, including systemic conditions, should be considered. This article discusses the childhood conditions commonly presenting with cutaneous vasculitis (leukocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa), biopsy recommendations and findings, and management and potential differential diagnoses, and includes a brief summary of other diseases that may include cutaneous symptoms as a constellation of other systemic findings.

Table 2
Randomised controlled trials of induction treatments in GPA and MPA

Supplementary studies from the 'General Management' section in the second SLR manuscript report dose-dependent increase of malignancy risk and early menopause under CYC treatment that need to be considered when choosing agents for induction treatment.

In summary, continuous oral and intravenous pulsed CYC combined with GC show similar efficacy in the induction of remission (LoE 1a). Continuous oral CYC is associated with a lower rate of relapse but a higher rate of leucopenia, a well-known risk factor for serious infections (LoE 1a). Reduced-dose CYC and GC for induction treatment in elderly patients reduces the rate of SAEs (LoE 2b) but that could come at the cost of lower efficacy in preventing relapses.

### Hypersensitivity vasculitis with leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to infliximab [^113fkNQS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Infliximab is an antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that is used in the treatment of Crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This medication neutralizes TNF-alpha by binding to TNF receptors and inhibiting further induction of proinflammatory cytokines. We describe a patient with Crohn disease who developed hypersensitivity vasculitis with biopsy-proven leukocytoclastic vasculitis 9 days after her initial dose of infliximab. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of infliximab-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis with leukocytoclastic vasculitis that occurred after the first dose of drug. It is important to note that hypersensitivity vasculitis can occur secondary to administration of this drug, even after the initial exposure.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^116D5fuA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a rare and difficult-to-treat, small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with recurrent long-lasting wheals. So far, no guidelines and treatment algorithms exist that could help clinicians with the management of UV. In this review, we describe evidence on systemic treatments used for UV and propose a clinical decision-making algorithm for UV management based on the Urticarial Vasculitis Activity Score assessed for 7 days (UVAS7). Patients with occasional UV-like urticarial lesions and patients with UV with skin-limited manifestations and/or mild arthralgia/malaise (total UVAS7 ≤ 7 of 70) can be initially treated using the step-wise algorithm for chronic urticaria including second-generation H1-antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine A. Patients with UV with more severe symptoms (UVAS7 > 7), especially those with hypocomplementemic UV, may require a multidisciplinary approach, particularly if underlying diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, or infection, are present. Immunomodulatory therapy is based on clinical signs and symptoms, and the drug availability and safety profile, and includes systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, anti-interleukin-1 agents, and other therapies. The level of evidence for all UV treatments is low. Prospective studies with current and novel drugs are needed and could provide further insights into UV pathogenesis and treatment.

### Treat-to-target in vasculitis: is this a sensible approach? [^111QtTHY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

It is possible to achieve substantial initial control of systemic vasculitis in the majority of patients. However, the 'target' has shifted considerably over the last 20–30 years from keeping patients alive to maintaining good quality disease control, avoiding the development of comorbidities - either as a result of disease or treatment, and also preventing relapses. This expansion of potential targets that can be achieved in systemic vasculitis has arisen because we have more effective therapies, but more importantly we have developed a framework within which targets can be created reproducibly. In other words we have much clearer definitions of what constitutes clinical disease activity, relapse, remission and morbidity. These targets are based on simple clinical evaluation, limited laboratory assessments of patients that can be undertaken by any secondary care facility. As a result of this they remain at a clinical level and may not address the most important targets, which are curing disease and that would be the aspiration to move towards. The first step towards that is to move from clinically-based targets towards mechanistic targets based primarily around the pathophysiological drivers of disease. That in turn may lead to identification of specific targets that can turn off disease. The systemic vasculitides are heterogeneous and although for ANCA-associated vasculitis in the short term treatments are similar, the development of clear understanding of mechanisms and new targets may bring with it the promise of much more focused therapies that will address only individual targets and therefore personalize therapy for each individual condition and patient.

### Outline of guidelines for the management of vasculitis and vascular disorders in Japan, 2016 revised edition [^1127SUWH]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The proposal by the 1994 International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitides (CHCC1994) and by the CHCC2012 markedly influenced the classification and way of considering cutaneous vasculitis. In the proposal by the CHCC1994, hypersensitivity angiitis was defined as an equivalent pathological condition to microscopic polyangiitis or cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis (CLA), and it was not adopted as a disease name. However, CLA which was positioned as a type of small-vessel vasculitis is only a pathological name. In the proposal by the CHCC2012, a new category of single-organ vasculitis included CLA and cutaneous arteritis. Vasculitis allergica cutis (Ruiter) corresponded to CLA and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa corresponded to cutaneous arteritis. The Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA) prepared guidelines for the management of vasculitis and vascular disorders in 2008 based on the proposal by the CHCC1994 and their original viewpoint of dermatology. The JDA subsequently revised the 2008 edition guidelines in 2016 following publication of the proposal of the CHCC2012 in Japanese. We presented the outline of the 2016 edition guidelines and propose a treatment algorithm for primary vasculitides based on the evaluation of the cutaneous symptoms for cases suspected as primary cutaneous vasculitides, which integrates the 2008 JDA guideline and CHCC2012 classification. This is the secondary English version of the original Japanese manuscript for the guideline for management of vasculitis and vascular disorders published in the Japanese Journal of Dermatology 127(3); 299–415, 2017.

### The clinical spectrum and therapeutic management of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis: data from a French nationwide study of fifty-seven patients [^116PxkPq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) is an uncommon vasculitis of unknown etiology that is rarely described in the literature. We undertook this study to analyze the clinical spectrum and the therapeutic management of patients with HUV.

Methods

We conducted a French nationwide retrospective study that included 57 patients with chronic urticaria, histologic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and hypocomplementemia. We assessed clinical and laboratory data and evaluated the patients' cutaneous and immunologic responses to therapy. We evaluated treatment efficacy by measuring the time to treatment failure.

Results

Urticarial lesions were typically more pruritic than painful and were associated with angioedema in 51% of patients, purpura in 35%, and livedo reticularis in 14%. Extracutaneous manifestations included constitutional symptoms (in 56% of patients) as well as musculoskeletal involvement (in 82%), ocular involvement (in 56%), pulmonary involvement (in 19%), gastrointestinal involvement (in 18%), and kidney involvement (in 14%). Patients with HUV typically presented with low C₁q levels and normal C₁ inhibitor levels, in association with anti-C₁q antibodies in 55% of patients. Hydroxychloroquine or colchicine seemed to be as effective as corticosteroids as first-line therapy. In patients with relapsing and/or refractory disease, rates of cutaneous and immunologic response to therapy seemed to be higher with conventional immunosuppressive agents, in particular, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide, while a rituximab-based regimen tended to have higher efficacy. Finally, a cutaneous response to therapy was strongly associated with an immunologic response to therapy.

Conclusion

HUV represents an uncommon systemic and relapsing vasculitis with various manifestations, mainly, musculoskeletal and ocular involvement associated with anti-C1q antibodies, which were found in approximately half of the patients. The best strategy for treating HUV has yet to be defined.

### Vasculitis [^112mKDUP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, which can be broadly grouped as secondary vasculitides, which occur in association with an underlying disease or trigger, or primary vasculitides, in which vasculitis is occurring for as-yet unknown causes. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a range of disease entities that are uniquely identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. Individual diseases predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, which influences their clinical manifestations and has been used in their classification. The vasculitides can also differ in their severity, extending from self-limited illnesses to those that can be life-threatening in the absence of prompt initiation of treatment. Immunosuppressive agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although such approaches can be effective, the patient's long-term course can be influenced by organ damage from their initial presentation, disease relapses, and medication toxicity. Recent investigations have focused on understanding disease pathophysiology and the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Refractory vasculitis [^113bzwFa]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Refractory vasculitis occurs in 4–5% of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis (AAV). Differences between therapies used for refractory disease are mostly reflected in the percentages of complete and partial remissions, but also in the number of serious side effects. Rituximab is considered the most safe second line therapy and should be advocated as a first alternative choice for cyclophosphamide in disease induction in refractory AAV.

### Cutaneous purpura of Sjögren syndrome successfully treated with hydroxychloroquine [^114jrbM2]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Although there are few reports that describe the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for skin disease in Sjögren syndrome, hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of autoimmune skin diseases such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Both cutaneous lupus erythematosus and Sjögren syndrome are characterized by increased type I interferons and hyperactivation of B cells. As hydroxychloroquine impacts generation of type I interferon responses through effects in the endolysosomeand through inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene activation, it is reasonable to assume that there would be an overlap in response to hydroxychloroquine between Sjögren syndrome and cutaneous lupus erythematosus hydroxychloroquine patients. In systemic lupus erythematosus, there is evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduces flares and inhibits development of skin lesions. Randomized, controlled trials in Sjögren syndrome have not found hydroxychloroquine to be beneficial for sicca symptoms, but skin outcomes were not assessed. Certainly, some manifestations of Sjögren syndrome, such as annular erythema, are reported to respond positively to hydroxychloroquine. For example, a patient with long-term primary Sjögren syndrome developed vasculitis after discontinuing hydroxychloroquine because of retinal toxicity; the authors believed the skin lesions to be caused by interruption of the drug. A few reports suggest that hydroxychloroquine may be effective in treating systemic lupus erythematosus–related vasculitis. Kibune et aldescribed a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who had purpura and recurrent cutaneous ulcers on the lower extremities diagnosed as leukocytoclastic and necrotizing vasculitis that responded favorably to hydroxychloroquine after developing toxicity to high-dose steroids. In Sjögren patients with various skin manifestations who are unresponsive or unable to tolerate high-dose steroids, hydroxychloroquine may be an effective option.

### Pan American league of associations for rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis [^112nD7RJ]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Considerable variability exists in the way health-care providers treat patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis in Latin America. The most frequently used treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis are cyclophosphamide and prolonged glucocorticoid tapers; however, randomised controlled trials conducted over the past 30 years have led to the development of several evidence-based treatment alternatives for these patients. Latin America faces socioeconomic challenges that affect access to care, and the use of certain costly medications with proven efficacy ANCA-associated vasculitis is often restricted. For these reasons, the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology developed the first ANCA-associated vasculitis treatment guidelines tailored for Latin America. A panel of local vasculitis experts generated clinically meaningful questions related to the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format. Following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology, a team of methodologists conducted a systematic literature review. The panel of vasculitis experts voted on each PICO question and made recommendations, which required at least 70% agreement among the voting members. 21 recommendations and two expert opinion statements for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis were developed, considering the current evidence and the socioeconomic characteristics of the region. These recommendations include guidance for the use of glucocorticoids, non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressants, and plasma exchange.

### Disease assessment in systemic vasculitis [^116iBoW4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides are complex multi-system disorders with many overlapping clinical features. Their outcome has been transformed by effective immunosuppression, preventing death in over 70% of cases. The quality of survival is affected by the disease course, which is characterized by a significant likelihood of relapse in 38%, chronic effects from the disease and its treatment, as well as emerging or worsening comorbidity, all of which contribute to the patient's clinical condition and outcome. Whilst imaging and laboratory testing including histology are important aspects of diagnosis, they are of limited value in assessing response to therapy or subsequent disease course. We have developed standardized validated clinical methods to quantify disease activity and damage; we are developing effective measures of patient experience to complement these procedures. This approach provides a rational basis for clinical management as well as being essential in the conduct of clinical trials and studies in vasculitis, by providing reproducible definitions of relapse, remission and response to therapy for patients with systemic vasculitis. Clinical assessment remains the current gold standard for evaluating disease progress, but requires regular training to ensure standardization. The development of biomarkers in future may produce a more accurate description of disease and identify potential targets for therapy as well as predictors of response to drugs.

### Characterization of non-IgA vasculitis: demographic, clinical, and treatment-related features in a retrospective analysis of 28 biopsy-confirmed cases from a German university hospital [^116cExfh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Inflammation of the blood vessels can occur in any organ but is particularly common in the skin. Cutaneous vasculitis is a heterogeneous group of diseases that can be divided into three groups based on skin involvement: a cutaneous manifestation of systemic vasculitis, a purely cutaneous variant of systemic vasculitis, and as cutaneous single‐organ vasculitis. Systemic vasculitis involves at least one other organ beyond the skin, whereas cutaneous single‐organ vasculitis remains confined to the skin and does not progress into a systemic vasculitis. Other classifications are based on the size of the affected vessels involved. Certain types of efflorescences and their patterns of distribution are distinctive in specific vasculitis conditions, providing diagnostic clues or serving as diagnostic criteria.

Immune complex vasculitis belongs to the small‐vessel vasculitis group, primarily affects the postcapillary venules, and presents clinically with palpable purpura, most frequently on the lower extremities. The group of immune complex vasculitides can be further classified into cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and hypocomplementemic vasculitis, as well as IgA and non‐IgA vasculitis. Non‐IgA vasculitis (also known as IgM/IgG vasculitis) was listed as a separate entity for the first time in the 2018 update of the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature of vasculitides and assigned to the group of 'single‐organ vasculitides'. Histopathologically, non‐IgA vasculitis presents as leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the small vessel, especially prominent in the postcapillary venules, while direct immunofluorescence (DIF) typically shows a deposition of IgM or complement factors, with IgG deposition being less frequent.

### Off-label use of biologics in urticarial vasculitis: a European retrospective cohort study [^113ujAyz]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is characterized by atypical urticarial lesions and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, sometimes with extracutaneous manifestations. First-line treatment is based on colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone or low-dose glucocorticoids. In refractory forms, the use of biologics has been anecdotally described as potentially effective. We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of biologics in patients with UV.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective European multicentre study including patients with hypocomplementemic or normocomplementemic UV who received at least one biologic, including anti-CD20, anti-IgE and/or IL1-targeted therapy, from 2008 to 2021. We analyzed clinical and biological characteristics as well as efficacy and safety of the biologics.

Results

Forty-one patients receiving 52 therapeutic sequences were analyzed, including rituximab in 23, IL1-targeted therapy in 16 and anti-IgE in 13 cases. UV was hypocomplementemic in 24 (59%) cases. Biologics were used in median in 5th line of treatment, in combination with glucocorticoids in 75%. After a median follow-up of 25 (IQR 12–43) months, the cutaneous response was complete in 40%, partial in 37% and inadequate in 23%. Glucocorticoid discontinuation was achieved in 34% of patients. Serious adverse events, mainly infectious, were observed in 7 (17%) patients.

Conclusion

Biologics are an effective and rather well-tolerated treatment option for UV that are refractory to conventional therapies.

### Novel therapeutic strategies for large vessel vasculitis [^115KHDg5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis are systemic vasculitides that cause inflammation of large arteries and their branches. Both have similar histology, but differ in their age of onset. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for the past 50 years but are limited by the potential toxicity that may occur in almost 60% of patients. This limitation has lead to the investigation of alternative agents for the treatment of these diseases.

### Acquired leukonychia with lichenoid papules [^114qhkUd]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for mild to moderate cutaneous disease?
A. Methotrexate
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Dapsone
D. Rituximab
E. Apremilast

Answers:
A. Methotrexate – Correct. In addition to sun protection, topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate titrated up to 25 mg orally weekly is considered a first line therapy for mild to moderate cutaneous DM. If myopathy is present, this should be combined with systemic corticosteroids.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. This antimalarial was previously considered a first line agent, but recent evidence has demonstrated that patients treated with this medication are likely to flare their cutaneous disease. Given the favorable safety profile, hydroxychloroquine should be considered as an adjuvant medication when the cutaneous disease is not controlled by other pharmacotherapies.
C. Dapsone – Incorrect. Dapsone has been used for cutaneous DM, but the clinical evidence to support this medication as a first-line agent is lacking and not well elucidated in the literature.
D. Rituximab – Incorrect. When systemic corticosteroids and a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent (ie methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil) have failed, rituximab should be a considered an appropriate second line therapy. Rituximab with systemic corticosteroids would be considered first line if the patient presented with evidence of vasculopathy, calcinosis, or was positive for the anti-MDA5 antibody.
E. Apremilast – Incorrect. While apremilast is an emerging treatment for DM and currently administered off-label, its therapeutic role in management of DM is not well defined as compared to other systemic therapies.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with immunoglobulin A lambda monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a case report and review of previously reported cases [^114RqsX2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is often associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposition on the vascular walls. IgA-associated leukocytoclastic vasculitis comprises various underlying diseases. Hematological disorders that can be minor triggers include multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Here, we present the case of a 78-year-old woman with leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance of the IgA lambda chain. Oral steroid administration initially showed remission of vasculitis; however, the condition recurred after four attempts of treatment withdrawal. We also reviewed previous reports of 14 cases of IgA-associated leukocytoclastic vasculitis, of which 11 were associated with multiple myeloma and three with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^116qEfca]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this case series, we describe 6 patients meeting the classification criteria for HSP, who developed prolonged and relapsing symptoms and were successfully treated with azathioprine. None of these patients had classic renal involvement. The duration of treatment with azathioprine ranged from 7 to 21 months without a relapse of disease after discontinuing treatment.

The course of HSP is usually benign and self-limited, with only 1/3 of patients having recurrent disease. Since the disease is usually self-limited, typically no treatment is warranted. In the absence of renal disease, the initial episode usually lasts approximately 1 month. Recurrence of disease occurs most commonly in patients with nephritis or more severe symptoms at presentation. Treatment with glucocorticoids offers quick symptomatic relief and shortens the severity and duration of gastrointestinal, joint, and cutaneous symptoms Steroids are often used successfully in patients with limited oral intake due to their abdominal symptoms, a painful rash, or difficulty ambulating. However, treatment with glucocorticoids is controversial, as they do not appear to alter or improve the final outcome, including renal disease. There are currently no established evidence-based recommendations for glucocorticoid use in HSP, although they are often used in clinical practice.

Management options for recalcitrant disease that is poorly responsive to steroids or is steroid-dependent have not been defined, and only a few case series of patients managed with other medications have been reported. Azathioprine has been used with corticosteroids or other agents in cases of HSP nephritis (Table 2). Results were encouraging as this combination seemed to improve the clinical course of the nephritis, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed. Only one case of hemorrhagic bullous cutaneous HSP successfully treated with azathioprine has been reported in the literature. In addition, azathioprine has been used in cases of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition that histologically resembles HSP. Expert opinion favors the use of colchicine or dapsone as first line treatment for cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Efficacy of those agents is questionable, as the recommendations are based on case reports, while a randomized controlled trial failed to show efficacy of colchicine. Azathioprine is recommended as second line treatment by most authors for the treatment of cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Characterization of non-IgA vasculitis: demographic, clinical, and treatment-related features in a retrospective analysis of 28 biopsy-confirmed cases from a German university hospital [^116GGFPq]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to diagnosing non‐IgA vasculitis, other immune complex vasculitis subtypes should be excluded. However, specific diagnostic criteria for non‐IgA vasculitis do not yet exist, thus complicating the diagnostic process, especially since histological differentiation from IgA vasculitis is not necessary in the absence of clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain, joint pain, abnormal urine examination, and presentation above the waistline.

In the past, non‐IgA vasculitis has not been included in the group of small‐vessel vasculitis, nor was it described as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Leukocytoclasia, however, is a description of the disintegration of neutrophil granulocyte nuclei that is typical of vasculitis. This histopathological feature is neither specific for non‐IgA vasculitis nor pathognomonic for vasculitis, and, therefore, equating the diagnosis of non‐IgA vasculitis with leukocytoclastic vasculitis is misleading. Due to the complex nomenclature and classification, limited data have been published under the terms non‐IgA vasculitis and IgG/IgM vasculitis. It is likely that these data were published prior to the 2018 CHCC classification as hypersensitivity vasculitis or leukocytoclastic vasculitis and therefore cannot be clearly distinguished from other subtypes. Previous categorization efforts by Loricera et al. described the group of cutaneous single‐organ vasculitis of small vessels after the publication of the revised nomenclature for vasculitis in 2012, but this classification is now also outdated.

Non‐IgA vasculitis is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 48 per 1 million, and, not surprisingly, published literature on non‐IgA vasculitis and IgM/IgG vasculitis is scarce. A retrospective characterization from Italy of 41 patients revealed a female patient majority as well as lesions predominantly localized to the lower leg. As most of the demographic and clinical features of non‐IgA vasculitis are unknown, this study aims to characterize non‐IgA vasculitis as a distinct entity according to the CHCC nomenclature of vasculitides in terms of demographic, clinical, and treatment‐related features based on biopsy‐confirmed patient cases treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf.

### Combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide for refractory entero-behcet's disease: a case report [^116ssDgy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Behcet's disease (BD) is a systemic inflammatory disease with the histopathological features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects nearly all organs and systems. When it involves the intestine, it is called entero-Behcet's disease (entero-BD).

Case presentation

Here we described a 23-year-old man with entero-BD refractory to conventional therapies who responded well to the combination therapy of infliximab, an anti-tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha antibody, and thalidomide. After combination treatment, the patient's symptoms improved greatly and his Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score decreased from 344 to 52 points, accompanied by a body weight increase from 53 kg to 64 kg. A follow-up endoscopy performed 10 weeks after the treatment showed significant improvement and the patient's multiple ulcers had healed well.

Conclusion

The combination therapy of infliximab and thalidomide appears to be clinically effective in a patient with refractory entero-BD. However, further studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of this combination therapy.

### One year in review 2020: vasculitis [^117Rswiq]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Systemic vasculitides are a group of diseases that could potentially affect any organ with heterogeneous clinical manifestations that usually depend on the size of the most involved vessels. These diseases could be associated with a relevant burden of mortality and morbidity if not early recognised and treated. Moreover, even if they are usually rare diseases, their incidence and prevalence seem to be increasing in the last decade, partially because of improved awareness and management of vasculitis from physicians. Like in the previous annual reviews of this series, in this paper we revised the most recent literature on pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment options in small- and large-vessel vasculitis.

### Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis induced by continuous erythropoietin receptor activator [^117YNJt3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLCV) is characterized by the inflammation of superficial small vessels of the skin that clinically presents as a palpable purpura. Type III hypersensitivity, wherein immune complexes play a significant role, is considered a key mechanism underlying CLCV pathophysiology. Numerous factors promote CLCV, although infection and drugs are etiologically dominant.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have been commonly used for anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are emerging concerns that these recombinant human proteins exhibit immunogenicity, which can induce autoantibodies that form immune complexes that impair drug effectiveness. Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) is a type of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent that contains polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is generally considered to decrease immunogenicity. Herein, we report a case of CLCV that occurred after CERA injection.

### Blocking von Willebrand factor for treatment of cutaneous inflammation [^111DLwyH]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a key player in hemostasis, is increasingly recognized as a proinflammatory protein. Here, we found a massive accumulation of VWF in skin biopsies of patients suffering from immune complex (IC)-mediated vasculitis (ICV). To clarify the impact of VWF on cutaneous inflammation, we induced experimental ICV either in mice treated with VWF-blocking antibodies or in VWF(-/-) mice. Interference with VWF led to a significant inhibition of the cutaneous inflammatory response. We confirmed the major findings in irritative contact dermatitis, a second model of cutaneous inflammation. In vivo imaging of cutaneous inflammation in the dorsal skinfold chamber revealed unaffected leukocyte rolling on anti-VWF treatment. However, we identified that reduced leukocyte recruitment is accompanied by reduced vascular permeability. Although VWF-mediated neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum was described to require the VWF receptor on platelets (glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα)), the VWF/GPIbα axis was dispensable for cutaneous inflammation. As assessed in tail bleeding assays, we could exclude interference of VWF blockade with hemostasis. Of particular importance, anti-VWF treatment was effective both in prophylactic and therapeutic administration. Thus, VWF represents a promising target for the treatment of cutaneous inflammation, e.g., leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^114PCg48]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

APPROACH

Rheumatology approach to hematologic diagnostic testing in patients with new or suspected vasculitis

When to consider hematologic malignancy

We consider hematologic malignancy as part of the broader differential diagnosis in all patients with new imaging or pathologic findings suggestive of vasculitis as a concurrent and potentially underlying diagnosis or a diagnostic mimic, especially when unusual clinical features are present (Table 1). Vasculitis can occur as a "hematoinflammatory" feature across a wide variety of hematologic malignancy and often co‐occurs with indolent and lower‐risk disease stages monitored in clinic with or without specific disease‐modifying treatment. For example, giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Beçhet disease can be associated with myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or CMML. Furthermore, leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) with chronic monoclonal antibody–producing lymphoid malignancies can be associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and/or Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Additionally, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and LCV can occur in both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, with an enrichment of PAN in hairy cell leukemia,(Supplemental Figure 1).

Table 1
Examples of hematologic malignancies that may mimic specific forms of vasculitis *

Patients with hematologic malignancy, especially myeloid neoplasia, can also have other significant inflammatory features. For example, 10% to 45% of individuals with MDS and CMML have concurrent inflammation, with common categories including vasculitis, neutrophilic dermatosis, inflammatory arthritis, and connective tissue disease; nonspecific inflammation, fever, chondritis, crystalline arthritis, inflammatory eye diseases, autoimmune cytopenia, and acquired bleeding diatheses, among others, have also been described. Suggesting bidirectional interactions and/or shared risk, antecedent autoimmune disease was likewise found more frequently in patients with MDS (odds ratio [OR] 1.5 and 2.1, respectively) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (OR 1.29 and 1.7, respectively) in two large case‐control studies using registry data from the United States and Sweden; systemic vasculitis had particularly high effect sizes (OR 6.23–23.8).

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease mimicking cellulitis: a case report [^114pjc9V]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Before attributing LCV as an EIM of IBD, it is important to exclude other etiologies that frequently accompany the disease, namely: medications, malignancy, connective tissue disorders, and infection. Given that steroids are the cornerstone of treatment for LCV, it is imperative that alternative causes of rash be thoroughly evaluated to avoid exacerbation of infection with steroid therapy.

Documented cases implicate both levofloxacin and ustekinumab in causing LCV. Levofloxacin as the cause of LCV in our case seemed unlikely given the presence of lesions prior to its administration. Ustekinumab was recently reported as a cause of vasculitis, adding it to the list of monoclonal antibodies implicated in LCV. We considered ustekinumab as an etiology in this case, yet it seemed less likely when our patient tolerated re-initiation and long-term continuation of this medication without worsening of her LCV. While there is a possibility that the LCV was in fact due to ustekinumab and that higher doses of budesonide lead to clinical resolution, tapering off of budesonide with concurrent re-introduction of ustekinumab did not lead to reappearance of LCV. Thus, we can rule out medication induced LCV. As ustekinumab is a relatively new medication in armamentarium used to treat CD, it remains to be seen at what extent it might influence development of LCV. The only case report to date where LVC developed due to ustekinumab occurred after 3 years of therapy, while intestinal disease was in remission, and re-challenge with ustekinumab resulted in rapid re-appearance of LCV.

In our case, the patient's recent and normal age-appropriate screening by mammogram, pap smear, and colonoscopy made malignancy an unlikely cause of LCV. Additionally, the extensive evaluation for other autoimmune disorders, connective tissue disease, and infection were unremarkable.

LCV responds well to steroid therapy and resolves quickly without scarring in most cases reported. Namakura and colleagues reported a case of spontaneous resolution; Bernardes reported 3 cases resolving without steroid therapy after withdrawal of adalimumab, and one case reported steroid-resistant LCV which resolved with colchicine. While the rash subsides within days in the majority of cases, longer time to resolution has been reported. The longest duration of rash reported was 9 months where infliximab was the inciting agent and no treatment or medication changes took place.

### Nomenclature and classification of vasculitis-update on the ACR / EULAR diagnosis and classification of vasculitis study (DCVAS) [^112WtPrV]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Classification of vasculitis remains unsatisfactory. This is largely because the pathogenetic mechanisms of this family of related disorders have not been fully understood. Existing classification criteria are useful but limited. This has become more apparent with the advent of more effective and more specific therapies. A rational basis for classification could significantly improve our approach to treatment. The development of diagnostic criteria in vasculitis is an even greater challenge but may ultimately provide more useful for the non-specialist clinician. International efforts are underway to provide more effective classification and diagnostic criteria.

### Clinical approach to cutaneous vasculitis [^111gUeCp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is an inflammatory process affecting the vessel wall and leading to its compromise or destruction and subsequent hemorrhagic and ischemic events. Vasculitis can be classified as a primary phenomenon (e.g. idiopathic cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis or Wegener granulomatosis) or as a secondary disorder (connective tissue disease [CTD], infection, or adverse drug eruption-associated vasculitis). Cutaneous vasculitis may present as a significant component of many systemic vasculitic syndromes such as rheumatoid vasculitis or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated primary vasculitic syndromes (Wegener granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis). Cutaneous vasculitis manifests most frequently as palpable purpura or infiltrated erythema indicating dermal superficial, small-vessel vasculitis, and less commonly as nodular erythema, livedo racemosa, deep ulcers, or digital gangrene implicating deep dermal or subcutaneous, muscular-vessel vasculitis. A biopsy extending to the subcutis taken from the most tender, reddish or purpuric lesional skin is the key to obtaining a significant diagnostic result and serial sections are often required for identifying the main vasculitic lesion. Coexistence of pan-dermal small-vessel vasculitis and subcutaneous muscular-vessel vasculitis usually indicates CTD, ANCA-associated vasculitis, Behçet disease, or malignancy-associated vasculitis. A concomitant biopsy for direct immunofluoresence evaluation contributes to accurate diagnosis by distinguishing IgA-associated vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) from IgG-/IgM-associated vasculitis, which has prognostic significance. Treatment for cutaneous vasculitis should include avoidance of triggers (excessive standing, infection, drugs) and exclusion of vasculitis-like syndromes (pseudovasculitis) such as thrombotic disorders (e.g. anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome). In most instances, cutaneous vasculitis represents a self-limited condition and will be relieved by leg elevation, avoidance of standing, and therapy with NSAIDs. For mild recurrent or persistent disease, colchicine and dapsone are first-choice agents. Severe cutaneous disease requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids or more potent immunosuppression (azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide). A combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is required therapy for systemic vasculitis, which is associated with a high risk of permanent organ damage or death. In cases of refractory vasculitis, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin are viable considerations. The new biologic therapies that act via cytokine blockade or lymphocyte depletion, such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor infliximab and the anti-B-cell antibody rituximab, respectively, are showing benefit in certain settings such as CTD and ANCA-associated vasculitis.

2.2.4 Vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers

Vasculitis, a group of diseases caused primarily by necrotizing vasculitis observed histopathologically, is often a direct cause of skin ulcers. It is described by the Chapel Hill classification issued in 1994 (commonly called "CHCC 1994"), which was revised in 2012 (commonly called "CHCC 2012", Table 2). In addition to the traditional three size‐based categories of large‐, medium‐, and small‐vessel vasculitis, the CHCC 2012 includes a total of seven categories by the addition of variable vessel vasculitis, single‐organ vasculitis, vasculitis associated with systemic disease, and vasculitis associated with probable etiology.

TABLE 2
Types of vasculitis in the Chapel Hill classification (2012) that commonly cause lesions such as skin ulcers.

Small‐vessel vasculitis includes a total of seven diseases: microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–related vasculitides; IgA vasculitis; cryoglobulinemic vasculitis; hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis; and anti‐glomerular basement membrane disease, in which immune complexes are involved. Medium‐vessel vasculitis includes polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease, while large‐vessel vasculitis includes giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Of these diseases, the three ANCA‐related vasculitides in small‐vessel vasculitis, IgA vasculitis, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis are closely related to skin ulcers as their possible causes. Also notable are polyarteritis nodosa at the medium‐vessel level and cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis and cutaneous arteritis (corresponding to cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa) among single‐organ vasculitides.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis: a rare manifestation of propylthiouracil allergy [^1118w15A]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a manifestation of propylthiouracil allergy.

Methods

We present the history, findings on physical examination, and results of laboratory evaluation in a 25-year-old woman. Associated reports from the literature are reviewed.

Results

The patient, with a history of Graves' disease, was referred for evaluation of a purpuric rash on the pinnas and buttocks bilaterally. Findings included exophthalmos and bilateral goiter with neck bruits. She was biochemically hyperthyroid. Biopsy of the skin lesions revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Propylthiouracil therapy was discontinued, and prednisone was prescribed. Treatment with radioactive iodine resulted in appreciably diminished skin lesions and reduction in the size of the thyroid gland, but thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels increased. Administration of a second, higher dose of radioactive iodine with concomitant lithium carbonate resulted in clinical and biochemical improvement. Six months after initial assessment, the rash had resolved, and the patient's free thyroxine value had normalized, although the thyrotropin level was still suppressed.

Conclusion

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis, although rarely seen as a manifestation of propylthiouracil allergy, has been reported in the medical literature and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with a vasculitic rash. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the offending medication and administration of a corticosteroid and, occasionally, cyclophosphamide or plasmapheresis.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis in transplant recipients: a case series of 7 patients [^116KUTea]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a small-vessel vasculitis that is usually limited to the skin but may cause systemic small-vessel disease. LCV commonly presents with petechiae or palpable purpuric papules or plaques that may coalesce, ulcerate, or form hemorrhagic bullae (Fig 1). The pathogenesis of LCV involves the formation of immune complexes that deposit within small vessels and induce damage. Medications are the most frequent cause of LCV, although infections, malignancies, and connective tissue disease are other reported causes. Commonly associated medications that induce LCV include penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, allopurinol, aminocaproic acid, azathioprine, methotrexate, and streptokinase. With medication-induced LCV, symptoms typically develop within 10 days of antigen exposure, owing to time required for developing antigen-antibody complexes. The presence of perivascular IgG or IgM deposition detected via direct immunofluorescence (DIF) suggests immune complex–induced LCV, which has a favorable prognosis. IgA deposition within the skin lesion biopsy suggests Henoch-Schonlein purpura/IgA vasculitis, which is more frequent and severe than non–IgA-associated LCV. Detection of vascular IgA deposition is suggestive of associated renal and gastrointestinal involvement by vasculitis.

Fig 1
LCV presenting with palpable purpura and petechiae on the lower extremity of patient 7.

There is limited literature regarding LCV in the transplant population, likely because of overall immunosuppression in these patients that may prevent this disease. In transplant recipients (TRs), sirolimus has been reported to cause LCV. To evaluate the causes and outcomes of LCV in TR, we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the clinical features of TRs in whom LCV developed, along with reviewing their management and outcomes.

Methods

Developing the recommendations

Systematic review of several medical literature databases was used to identify clinical trials relevant for the purposes of developing the recommendations. Standardised procedures were followed in line with guidance from EULAR with evidence from clinical trials graded from A (highest — from at least one randomised controlled trial) to D (lowest — expert opinion). This evidence informed the development of statements. Finally, voting took place with individuals giving a strength of recommendation to the individual statements. Each task force member had a single independent vote for each statement. Strengths of recommendation are in part constrained by the category of evidence used to inform each statement.

### Vasculitis [^115392S9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is histologically defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, either occurring secondarily to another process or as the pathologic foundation of a primary vasculitic disease. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a broad group of disease entities that are uniquely identified by the nature of their clinical, histopathologic, or therapeutic characteristics. Individual diseases often predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, the pattern of which influences their clinical manifestations and has been used in their classification. The vasculitides span a wide range of disease severity, extending from illnesses that rarely produce death to those almost universally fatal before the introduction of effective therapy. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although such approaches can be effective, long-term treatment may be complicated by chronic sequelae from organ damage, disease relapses, and medication side effects. Recent investigations have focused on understanding the pathophysiology of these diseases, which may lead to more efficacious and less toxic therapeutic options.

### Propylthiouracil [^1112KE3d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasculitis

Cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications and death have been reported in patients receiving propylthiouracil therapy. The cases of vasculitis include: glomerulonephritis, leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis, alveolar/pulmonary hemorrhage, cerebral angiitis, and ischemic colitis. Most cases were associated with anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-positive vasculitis. In some cases, vasculitis resolved/improved with drug discontinuation; however, more severe cases required treatment with additional measures including corticosteroids, immunosuppressant therapy, and plasmapheresis. If vasculitis is suspected, discontinue therapy and initiate appropriate intervention.

Hypothyroidism

Propylthiouracil can cause hypothyroidism necessitating routine monitoring of TSH and free T4 levels with adjustments in dosing to maintain a euthyroid state. Because the drug readily crosses placental membranes, propylthiouracil can cause fetal goiter and cretinism when administered to a pregnant woman (see Precautions, Pregnancy).

### Successful treatment of hydroxyurea-associated panniculitis and vasculitis with low-dose methotrexate [^1126Hh5v]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hydroxyurea therapy could evoke a wide range of adverse cutaneous reactions. Although poorly understood, long-term therapy causes cutaneous changes in up to 5% of patients. Most commonly reported manifestations include painful ulcers particularly in the malleolar area, dermatomyositislike eruption, hyperpigmentation, melanonychia, xerosis, alopecia, palmoplantar keratoderma, and facial and acral erythema. Patients are also at higher risk of both squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas.

Two cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been described associated with leg ulcers. Also a recent case report described coexisting leukocytoclastic vasculitis and acral keratosis in a patient during treatment of essential thrombocythemia with hydroxyurea. Only one case of noninfectious panniculitis has been reported in an 81-year-old woman after 8 years of hyrdroxyurea therapy for myeloproliferative disorders. In all cases, patients had to discontinue hydroxyurea use because of the severity of the cutaneous reaction.

The underlying mechanisms of hydroxyurea-induced cutaneous reactions are poorly understood. Hydroxyurea-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis, macrocytosis, and platelet dysregulations were thought to cause direct tissue damage including death of keratinocytes, microthrombus formation, and impaired tissue repair. Discontinuation of hydroxyurea was thought to be the only effective treatment for debilitating cutaneous reaction. Systemic corticosteroids could provide temporary relief but are not safe for long-term therapy. This finding could pose significant challenge to the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported of concomitant vasculitis and panniculitis associated with hydroxyurea. Both vasculitis and panniculitis are rare cutaneous reactions that are only reported separately in few patients. This is the first time we saw medium-sized vessel vasculitis and septal and lobular panniculitis in a patient related to hydroxyurea. More interestingly, the hydroxyurea-induced vasculitis and panniculitis in our patient has been successfully treated with very low-dose methotrexate (2.5–5 mg/wk) with no reported side effects. As a folic acid antagonist, methotrexate inhibits the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which causes an increase in adenosine, subsequently diminishing inflammatory cell activity. Here we show that low-dose methotrexate could be a safe and effective treatment for hydroxyurea-induced vasculitis and panniculitis.

### European League Against Rheumatism / European vasculitis study group recommendations for the management of vasculitis [^1114A24b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations in the management of primary systemic vasculitis.

Recent Findings

Important developments in the classification and treatment of systemic vasculitis have led the European League Against Rheumatism to publish recommendations in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of the small, medium and large-vessel vasculitides. These recommendations resulted from a combination of evidence from systematic analysis of selected studies and the experience of experts in vasculitis when data were not available.

Summary

The purpose of formulating clinical recommendations is to improve quality of care and guide the clinician inexperienced with vasculitis. Nevertheless, patients with vasculitis should be managed by a vasculitis expert whenever possible. As our understanding of this rare and complex group of diseases advances, novel therapeutic options are being developed.

### Cutaneous vasculitis as a side effect of olaparib [^113Fv3Rh]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ovarian cancer is a serious and recurrent condition often characterized by impaired deoxyribonucleic acid repair mechanisms. Olaparib, a polymerase adenosine diphosphate-ribose inhibitor, is particularly effective in targeting breast cancer gene 1/2-mutated cancers by disrupting deoxyribonucleic acid repair, which induces cancer cell death and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy. It is also recognized as a maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.

Although generally is well-tolerated as a standalone treatment with mild side effects like fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, combining olaparib with cytotoxic chemotherapy may heighten toxicity, necessitating dosage adjustments. There are several olaparib-induced skin disorders, including pruritus, alopecia, and erythematous rash.

Ovarian carcinoma belongs to the group of tumors considered high risk for developing venous thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis, with highly variable incidence rates (5% to 20%). In our case, once deep vein thrombosis was ruled out, a consultation was requested from the dermatology service, who diagnosed vasculitis, after a clinical evaluation, where it was evidenced (Fig 1) and a skin biopsy, which was evidenced (Fig 2).

Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis is typically characterized by palpable purpura resulting from leukocytoclastic inflammation of postcapillary venules. It may be idiopathic or triggered by drugs, infections, or systemic diseases. In our case, the patient presented with painful nodules on the pretibial surface of the right lower limb, resembling erythema nodosum. However, the biopsy result revealed mononuclear infiltration in small- and medium-sized vessels (Fig 2), confirming the diagnosis of vasculitis.

Managing vasculitis involves discontinuing the triggering drug, although many cases require immunosuppressive therapy. Our patient responded well to a reduced dose of olaparib and topical corticosteroids, avoiding the need for additional therapies. Permanent discontinuation of olaparib was not considered due to its significant efficacy in treating ovarian cancer.

The last two years have been marked by significant achievement in the identification of the basic mechanisms of systemic vasculitis and in the translation of these mechanisms into targeted therapies. More specifically, new insights into the environmental, cellular, and genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis have been provided. Consequently, several studies focused on the development of novel strategies to achieve and maintain clinical remission in small- and large-vessel vascultis, including relevant large multicentre trials, have been promoted. The highlights of these studies, their potential clinical implications and the unmet needs, which are still to be addressed, are summarised in this review.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and management [^115apVZv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes a variety of lupus erythematosus (LE)-specific skin lesions that are subdivided into three categories - chronic CLE (CCLE), subacute CLE (SCLE) and acute CLE (ACLE) - based on clinical morphology, average duration of skin lesions and routine histopathologic examination. This paper describes our personal experience in the management of CLE over the last 30 years, with details on preferential therapeutic options related to clinical, histologic and immunopathologic aspects of each clinical subset of the disease. Effective sunscreening and sun protection are considered the first rule in the management of CLE because of the high degree of photosensitivity of the disease. Antimalarial agents are crucial in the treatment of CLE and are the first-line systemic agents, particularly in discoid LE (DLE) and SCLE. Dapsone is the drug of choice for bullous systemic LE (BSLE) as well as for LE in small dermal vessels (e.g. leukocytoclastic vasculitis). Retinoids, known as second-line drugs for systemic therapy, are sometimes used to treat chronic forms of CLE and are particularly successful in treating hypertrophic LE. Systemic immunosuppressive agents are required to manage the underlying systemic LE disease activity in patients with ACLE. These drugs, especially azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine, together with corticosteroids, constitute third-line systemic therapy of CLE. In our experience, oral prednisone or parenteral 'pulsed' methylprednisolone are useful in exacerbations of disease activity. Thalidomide provides one of the most useful therapeutic alternatives for chronic refractory DLE, although its distribution is limited to a few countries because of the risk of teratogenicity and polyneuropathy. However, medical treatment with local corticosteroids remains the mainstay of CLE treatment, especially for DLE. Patient education regarding the disease is also important in the management of CLE, because it helps relieve undue anxiety and to recruit the patient as an active participant in the treatment regimen.

3.15 Possibility of future research

Vasculitis is rare, and it may be difficult to accumulate a sufficient number of patients at a single institution. The literature primarily consisted of descriptive studies. In the future, the efficacy of each drug should be examined in a multicenter cooperative study, establishing skin ulcers as a primary endpoint. Furthermore, the condition may differ among types of vasculitis, and which immunosuppressant is effective for skin ulcers associated with respective disease types must be investigated in the future. With recent marked advances in vasculitis treatment, the efficacy of biological preparations, such as anti–interleukin 6 receptor antibody, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and C5a receptor inhibitors has been clarified. In the future, the efficacy of these new drugs for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers should also be further examined.

CQ4: Are there any treatment methods effective for rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers?

3.16 Background/purpose

Rheumatoid vasculitis is a general term for RA‐related vasculitis. Clinically, heterogeneity is strong, and various blood vessels (small to large) are damaged. Vasculitis at various levels can be observed in the skin, ranging from leukocytoclastic vasculitis of dermal venules to necrotizing vasculitis of adipose tissue arterioles, often inducing skin ulcers. For the treatment of rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers, standard drugs for skin ulcers are ineffective, and vasculitis‐targeting treatment is necessary. However, many treatment options, such as steroids, immunosuppressants, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), TNF‐α inhibitors, rituximab, leukocytapheresis/granulocytapheresis (LCAP/GCAP), and JAK inhibitors, are listed as candidates. It is often difficult to determine which treatment method should be used in clinical practice. We aim to present the directivity of treatment by examining the effects of each treatment method on rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers using the EBM method.

3.17 Scientific basis

A literature search on drugs that are used for the treatment of rheumatoid vasculitis in Japan (steroids, cyclophosphamide + steroid pulse, azathioprine, DDS, TNF‐α inhibitors, rituximab, LCAP/GCAP, JAK inhibitors, methotrexate) was performed, and 15 articles verifying their usefulness for treating rheumatoid vasculitis–associated skin ulcers were adopted: two RCTs, one non‐RCT, six cohort studies, and six case series studies. Statistical examination was not performed in any study.

### Effectiveness of omalizumab in a case of urticarial vasculitis [^117K9kC1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a mainly leucocytoclastic vasculitis with urticarial plaques. Treating these patients is challenging as the available treatments have poor efficacy. Oral corticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment, but H1 antihistamines, dapsone, colchicine, antimalarials, ciclosporin and antileucotrienes have all been tried also. However, because of their adverse effects and/or lack of efficacy, new agents are still needed. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, shows efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria, and might also be a good treatment for angio-oedema and urticarial vasculitis. To our knowledge, there have been only seven relevant case reports published in the English literature. We add a new case of severe chronic recurrent urticarial vasculitis refractory to all of the drugs mentioned above. We started the patient on subcutaneous omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, which produced clinical improvement within the first month and total remission in the fifth month. The patient has remained stable for 23 months, and follow-up is ongoing.

Other cutaneous symptoms of APS reported to date include gangrene, subungual hemorrhage, pyoderma gangrenosum‐like rash, fulminant purpura, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, Degos disease–like rash, and macular atrophy. In addition, reticular purpura observed in the lower leg is not specific to APS but should be differentiated from livedo vasculopathy, polyarteritis nodosa, cutaneous arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, rheumatoid vasculitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, hypergammaglobulinemic purpura, protein C/S deficiency, erythema induratum of Bazin, and syphilis. If livedo reticularis is observed in addition to intractable skin ulcers, the differentiation from the above diseases is difficult based on the clinical profile alone, and the cause must be evaluated by blood tests and histological examinations. While examinations that could risk enlarging the ulcerated surface are typically avoided if there are painful ulcers, a skin biopsy is essential to clarify whether thrombosis or vasculitis is involved in the cause of skin ulcers, and for evaluating the depth and thickness of the affected blood vessels. Because this examination is invasive, it is preferable to collect reliable tissue samples from the epidermis to the adipose tissue in as few attempts as possible, avoiding unnecessary repetition.

A therapeutic algorithm based on the above principles is shown in Figure 6, and the details are described in Explanation 7. Anticoagulants are the mainstay treatment for APS. The concomitant use of circulation‐improving drugs is occasionally effective and worth attempting. Steroid administration may induce hypercoagulability but may also be useful for treating ulcers by suppressing secondary inflammation associated with skin ulcer formation. However, there is no consensus on the use of steroids, and the matter remains open to debate.

### ANCA-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^115Sw4E4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The updated EULAR recommendations for the management of AAV indicate significant progress in the field of AAV treatment. The direction towards a more effective treatment strategy with faster and higher rates of remission is of great importance in AAV management. Achieving remission promptly is vital for preventing disease progression, reducing organ damage and improving kidney outcomes. Advancements in understanding the underlying pathophysiology have led to the development of targeted therapies, such as B-cell depletion, complement inhibition, T-cell inhibition and anti-IL-5 inhibition, offering new opportunities for tailored treatments and improved disease management. The goal of eliminating relapses is also crucial in providing lasting disease control and preventing recurrent disease flares. The ultimate goal is to provide patients with AAV the best chance for sustained remission, kidney outcome, improved quality of life and reduced risk of relapses, while minimizing treatment-related side effects.

### Vasculitis syndromes: which maintenance therapy for ANCA vasculitis? [^112siDfH]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides are usually treated with a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide therapy to induce remission, commonly followed by maintenance treatment with a less-toxic immunosuppressant. Azathioprine and methotrexate are both options for maintenance therapy, but whether one of these immunosuppressants is superior to the other is unclear.

### Management of rheumatic complications of ICI therapy: a rheumatology viewpoint [^113uP6sY]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of vasculitis

The clinical spectrum of ∼30 cases reporting ICI-induced systemic vasculitis predominantly comprised leukocytoclastic vasculitis resembling granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Table 1). About two-thirds of the patients with small vessel vasculitis received systemic glucocorticoids, with an initial average dose of ∼60 mg of prednisone equivalent (initial dose often: 1 mg/kg). Around 15% of the patients, mostly the severe cases, received a glucocorticoid bolus. The reported response particularly regarding vasculitis lesions (e.g. skin, gastrointestinal tract) was good overall.

Whereas giant cell arteritis was reported in one randomized controlled trial without further information regarding the treatment, two cases were reported with a good response to 50–60 mg of prednisone. About 15% of patients received csDMARDs. Most frequently hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and combinations thereof were used for leukocytoclastic vasculitis and seemed to be effective and glucocorticoid-sparing. In a few cases with severe vasculitis, patients received rituximab 375 mg/m² or plasma exchange.

The proportion of patients, in which ICI therapy had to be stopped, was high overall (∼80%).

5.6.1 There are many reports on RA suggesting the onset/deterioration of rheumatoid vasculitis during therapy with‐α inhibitors. In patients in whom the causal relationship is strongly suspected,‐α inhibitors should be discontinued, and a switch to other drugs should be considered

A cohort studyon the relationship between the onset of rheumatoid vasculitis and TNF‐α inhibitors was conducted and showed that insufficient treatment for a primary disease may be involved in the onset/deterioration of rheumatoid vasculitis. In addition, there are patients in whom the use of TNF‐α inhibitors is suggested. In those with RA in whom the onset/deterioration of vasculitis is suspected, the presence or absence of TNF‐α inhibitor therapy should be investigated. If the involvement of this drug in the onset/deterioration is strongly suspected, the use of this agent should be discontinued, and a switch to other drugs should be considered.
With the recent widespread use of TNF‐α inhibitors, their usefulness for treating many autoimmune diseases, including RA, has been established. On the other hand, many reports on adverse reactions to these drugs have been accumulating. Primary adverse reactions include severe infectious disease, opportunistic infection such as tuberculosis, demyelinating disease, and lymphoproliferative disease. However, recently, patients who developed autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis, SLE, and interstitial lung disease, after the use of these drugs have been increasingly reported.
In 1999, Brion et al.reported the first patient who developed rheumatoid vasculitis after the use of a TNF‐α inhibitor. Since then, similar reports, have been successively presented, including a patient in whom the use of a TNF‐α inhibitor worsened their rheumatoid vasculitis, a patient who developed optic neuropathy, a patient who developed glomerulonephritis, and patients who developed ANCA‐associated vasculitis. Ramos‐Casals et al.investigated 226 patients with autoimmune diseases after the use of TNF‐α inhibitors (187 with RA, 17 with Crohn disease, seven with ankylosing spondylitis, six with psoriatic arthritis, five with juvenile RA, three with other conditions), and reported the onset of vasculitis in 113 patients (95 with RA). Histopathologically, leukocytoclastic vasculitis accounted for 63%, necrotic vasculitis for 17%, and lymphocytic vasculitis for 6% of cases. Findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are most commonly observed.
Concerning the incidence of vasculitis, Flendrie et al.performed a cohort study, and reported an incidence of 3.9%. The relationship between the use of TNF‐α inhibitors and onset of vasculitis remains to be clarified. However, their causal relationship is strongly suspected for the following reasons: (i) the timing of vasculitis onset is consistent with the start of treatment with TNF‐α inhibitors; (ii) exanthema at the site of injection initially occurred and enlarged to the whole body in some RA patients who developed vasculitis after etanercept use; (iii) vasculitis was relieved in ≥ 90% of patients after the discontinuation of TNF‐α inhibitors; (iv) the additional administration of TNF‐α inhibitors led to recurrent exanthema/recrudescence in 75% of patients; and (v) vasculitis occurs even in the presence of diseases of which the pathogeneses do not involve vasculitis, such as psoriasis.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis… [^117MTMuk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Patients with leukocytoclastic vasculitis have purpuric, palpable lesions, most commonly on the lower part of the legs. Systemic involvement, particularly of the kidneys, is found frequently. Characteristic pathological features include necrosis of small vessels within the dermis, infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes within and around the vessel walls, hemorrhage, and occasionally thrombosis. Immunofluorescence study frequently shows granular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement in vessel walls. Etiologic agents that have been implicated include infection, foreign proteins, chemicals, drugs, and a variety of diseases. The mechanism causing tissue damage is thought to be mediated by immune complexes, although specific antigens have only occasionally been unequivocally identified. Treatment includes bedrest, corticosteroids, and sometimes, cytotoxic agents. Sams WM, Thorne EG, Small P, Mass MF, McIntosh RM, Stanford RE.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116D2sDb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUVS) — patients with HUVS must present with urticaria, angioedema, or both for at least 6 months and hypocomplementemia, and urticaria is characterized by burning, pruritus, and longer duration (each hive can last 3 days) with possible hyperpigmentation on resolution. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis is seen on biopsy, and immunofluorescence can reveal deposits of immunoglobulins, complement, and/or fibrin mostly in the dermal–epidermal junction; if clinical suspicion is consistent with cutaneous vasculitis and the biopsy result is negative, a repeat biopsy would merit consideration, and biopsy for direct immunofluorescence is preferably performed in lesions within 24 hours because loss of staining has been seen starting in less than 48 hours. Laboratory evaluation should include C₁q, C₄, and C₃ measurement. Antihistamines can be used to manage pruritus but have no substantial effect on the vasculitic process; the dose of prednisone is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/d for at least 1 week and then tapered slowly, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and dapsone have been used in case reports for management of UV, pentoxifylline (1200 mg/d) can be beneficial to enhance the effect of dapsone, patients with hepatitis A, B, or C and HIV might benefit from the use of IFN-α used with or without ribavirin, and for refractory disease azathioprine with prednisone (with antecedent testing for thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency) can be used; other therapies, such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methotrexate, have been used for severe cases.

### Urticarial vasculitis [^111KhoM5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis is a clinico-pathologic entity typified by recurrent episodes of urticaria that have the histopathologic features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous features may include painful, burning or pruritic skin lesions, the persistence of individual lesions greater than 24 hours, palpable purpura, pronounced central clearing of lesions, and residual hyperpigmentation following resolution. However, because clinical characteristics of urticarial vasculitis may overlap with those of allergic urticaria, confirmation of the diagnosis requires a lesional skin biopsy. This condition is idiopathic in many patients but can also occur in the context of autoimmune disorders, infections, drug reactions, or as a paraneoplastic syndrome. In idiopathic urticarial vasculitis common laboratory findings are an elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and reduction of serum complement. An association between urticarial vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus has been hypothesized as some clinical manifestations of disease overlap and C1q autoantibodies may be present in both diseases. Normo-complementemic patients usually have minimal or no systemic involvement and often have a better prognosis. On-the-other-hand, hypocomplementemic patients have the propensity to have more severe multi-organ involvement. Response to treatment is variable and a wide variety of therapeutic agents may be efficacious. Initial recommendations for treatment of urticarial vasculitis manifest only as non-necrotizing skin lesions include antihistamines, dapsone, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine or indomethacin, but corticosteroids are often required. With necrotizing skin lesions or visceral involvement, corticosteroids are regularly indicated. Cases of severe corticosteroid resistant urticarial vasculitis or where corticosteroid morbidity is evident [table: see text] may require treatment with other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.

### A case of synchronous herpes zoster infection and leukocytoclastic vasculitis localized to the same dermatome [^114VE2MU]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a small-vessel vasculitis that presents with palpable purpura. The most common identified triggers of LCV are infection or exposure to a new medication. Herpes zoster (HZ) occurs as a result of the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV is able to infect endothelial cells directly, producing a spectrum of vasculitides, including that of large and medium vessels. We report a case of a patient with synchronous HZ infection and segmental small-vessel vasculitis.

### Targeted biologic approaches to the treatment of systemic vasculitis [^115Qmg9M]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The introduction of biological agents in the treatment of systemic vasculitis offers the promise of targeted therapy with greater efficacy and fewer side effects than conventional treatments. In this paper, we review the rationale for biological strategies in vasculitis and discuss the results of clinical studies to date. The biotherapies discussed include immune-cell-depleting agents, both B- and T-cell targeted; costimulatory blockade; and cytokine blockade. Although most of these agents remain unproven until ongoing randomized clinical trials are complete, their introduction heralds a new era of vasculitis treatment and has provided novel insights into disease pathogenesis.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis and dermal perivascular hemophagocytosis associated with adalimumab therapy for rheumatoid arthritis [^112gEscW]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2018). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors target TNF-α to effectively treat autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, many cases of cutaneous and systemic vasculitis related to TNF-α inhibitors have been reported in the literature. Here, the authors report the first case of a 61-year-old Japanese woman who developed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with cutaneous perivascular hemophagocytosis, which was related to elevated cytokines and immune complexes after initiating adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis without evidence of hemophagocytic syndrome and rarely encountered in the skin. The patient was successfully treated by discontinuing adalimumab and initiating corticosteroid therapy, which should be considered as the treatment of choice. We believe that our case confirms and adds to the evidence pertaining to the involvement of TNF-α in dermal perivascular hemophagocytosis, a histologic finding rarely observed in the skin.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a self-limiting disease with rare systemic complications in the majority of patients. This report describes a 10-year-old male with leukocytoclastic vasculitis caused by an insect bite who presented with central nervous system, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal involvement in addition to cutaneous findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination of cerebral hematoma material. Initially, his symptoms improved with a treatment protocol including steroid, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis, but the patient succumbed because of nosocomial sepsis.

### Colchicine: an ancient drug with novel applications [^115AFzvR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Colchicine is a treatment for gout that has been used for more than a millennium. It is the treatment of choice for familial Mediterranean fever and its associated complication, amyloidosis. The 2009 U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of colchicine as a new drug had research consequences. Recent investigations with large cohorts of patients with gout who have been taking colchicine for years have demonstrated novel applications within oncology, immunology, cardiology and dermatology. Some emerging dermatological uses include the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, leucocytoclastic vasculitis, aphthous stomatitis and others. In this work we relate the history and the new horizon of this ancient medicine.

### An approach to the diagnosis and management of systemic vasculitis [^116Ux7KT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The systemic vasculitides are a complex and often serious group of disorders which, while uncommon, require careful management in order to ensure optimal outcome. In most cases there is no known cause. Multi-system disease is likely to be fatal without judicious use of immunosuppression. A prompt diagnosis is necessary to preserve organ function. Comprehensive and repeated disease assessment is a necessary basis for planning therapy and modification of treatment protocols according to response. Therapies typically include glucocorticoids and, especially for small and medium vessel vasculitis, an effective immunosuppressive agent. Cyclophosphamide is currently the standard therapy for small vessel multi-system vasculitis, but other agents are now being evaluated in large randomized trials. Comorbidity is common in patients with vasculitis, including the cumulative effects of potentially toxic therapy. Long-term evaluation of patients is important in order to detect and manage relapses.

---

### Discontinuation of therapies in vasculitis [^114tuByT]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

For most patients with vasculitis, treatment will result in prevention of mortality and also lead to clinical remission. This increased survival is of course most welcome, but the burden of surviving an episode of acute vasculitis consists of the effects of the disease as well as the adverse events from treatment. Therefore, we have begun to explore the possibility of withdrawing treatment in order to avoid long-term medication toxicities. Whilst this will reduce short-term side effects, if withdrawal leads to subsequent uncontrolled flares of disease, the need for additional therapy may outweigh any benefit from a drug-free holiday. For very mild forms of vasculitis, such as isolated skin vasculitis, the best option may be to avoid treatment altogether. In those patients with vasculitis secondary to an identifiable agent such as drug toxicity or an infectious organism, discontinuing the offending drug or treating the infection will usually resolve or cure the vasculitis. In patients with localised vasculitis, surgical removal of the affected area can be curative. Other forms of vasculitis have a self-limited duration, after which there does not appear to be any clinical evidence of disease, such as is the case for the majority of patients with giant cell arteritis. By contrast, in many forms of vasculitis, especially those associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA), relapse occurs in at least half the patients. Where glucocorticoid therapy is used for any length of time, in doses of > 5 mg/day, side effects are almost universal. Adding a concomitant agent in the attempt to shorten the course and/or reduce the dose of glucocorticoid treatment may be effective, but can also result in toxicity from the alternative agent, and leaves the patient on immunosuppressive therapy. More toxic therapy, such as cyclophosphamide, usually is administered only for a limited time or cumulative amount, in order to achieve induction of remission or flare in severe disease. The advent of targeted biologic therapy offers the opportunity to provide more effective, less toxic and perhaps more long-lasting control of disease. Rituximab in small-vessel vasculitis can result in long-lasting control of disease, for 18 months or more, from a single course of treatment. Suppression of the interleukin-6 pathway may be effective in large-vessel vasculitis. Unfortunately, none of these therapies is capable of 'cure' for the majority of patients. Therefore, discontinuation of therapy remains unachievable for most patients with vasculitis, at least in the first few years of disease. Short courses of intensive, aggressive therapy are followed by the use of maintenance treatment. Long-term follow-up studies are required to determine the potential benefit of early, more effective control of vasculitis.

### Pediatric vasculitis: advances in treatment [^1137vYNx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This study will provide an overview of the recent advances in treatment of chronic systemic vasculitis in childhood.

Recent Findings

Advances in the treatment of chronic primary systemic vasculitis have significantly improved outcomes for patients in the last several decades. Conventional life-saving treatments like cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids have predominated as mainstay therapy for severe or extensive disease; however, evidence supporting the effectiveness of newer treatments such as rituximab and other biologic agents is increasing. Improved collaboration through international registries and multicentered initiatives has enabled increased research and generation of pediatric specific data. Such efforts are essential to the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines and validated assessment tools in the future.

Summary

Although most of our understanding about treatment of childhood vasculitis has been derived from adult data, pediatric data continue to accumulate. Evidence for newer treatments and alternative treatment strategies is continually evolving.

### Proliferative lupus nephritis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis during treatment with etanercept [^1169qRp3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine. Agents that neutralize TNF-alpha are effective in the treatment of disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), spondyloarthropathies, and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-alpha antagonist therapy has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, as well as the infrequent development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease. We describe the first case of biopsy-confirmed proliferative lupus nephritis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in a patient treated with etanercept for JRA.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab monotherapy in a patient with normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis [^114M31ed]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by leukocytoclasia, fibrin deposits, and extravasated erythrocytes affecting multiple organ systems. Current treatment modalities, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, are of limited efficacy and an expansive side effect profile. Omalizumab has been reported to be effective in urticarial vasculitis, but its long-term effectiveness and tolerability have not yet been evaluated. We report a case of long-standing normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis treated with omalizumab only, for almost 3 years. The patient reported a significant improvement in quality of life after the first few doses with a significant improvement in the urticaria control test. The treatment was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported after 3 years. Our patient was treated with 300 mg of omalizumab, as it was previously linked with a better improvement in quality of life. We were able to extend our patient&rsquo; s treatment intervals, suggesting that this is feasible in patients treated with omalizumab who achieve a complete response. We recommend that larger and long-term studies are conducted to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with urticarial vasculitis.

### A case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in a patient on dupilumab [^117M3Ht7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Dupilumab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients ≥ 6 m of age who are unresponsive to topical medications. The most common side effect of dupilumab in AD patients is dupilumab-associated ocular surface disease (DAOSD). Less commonly reported adverse events include headaches, nasopharyngitis, hypersensitivity reactions, arthralgias, and eosinophilia. Cutaneous adverse events of dupilumab include erythema nodosum, on-and-off neck and facial rash, pruritus and peeling of the skin, eczema, alopecia areata, and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Although other biologics including infliximab, adalimumab, secukinumab, rituximab, ustekinumab, and tocilizumab have been associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), cases of dupilumab-associated LCV have not yet been reported in the literature.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis, also known as cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, is the most common form of cutaneous vasculitis that involves deposition of immune complexes in blood vessels, largely in the postcapillary venule, and recruitment of neutrophils causing leukocytoclasia and destruction of the involved vasculature.LCV typically presents clinically as palpable purpura, but can also present with urticarial, vesicular, or targetoid lesions. Confirmatory diagnosis is via histopathology. Most cases of LCV are idiopathic but can also be associated with drugs, infections, collagen-vascular diseases, hematologic disorders, or malignancy. Patients with suspected LCV require a comprehensive work-up including CBC, CMP, hepatitis panel, complements, autoantibodies, and urinalysis to rule out systemic disease, which is seen in ∼50% of patients. Treatment of LCV is determined if it is skin-limited or systemic, but most idiopathic cases of cutaneous LCV resolve with rest, elevation, and NSAIDS with systemic corticosteroids reserved for refractory or complicated cases. If a drug is the cause for LCV, withdrawal of the drug is important.

### Plasmapheresis for refractory urticarial vasculitis in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116Wh21s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Urticarial vasculitis is a form of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis clinically characterized by persistent and often painful urticarial lesions. Numerous systemic diseases have been associated with urticarial vasculitis, including certain hematologic disorders. This distinctive form of cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis can be resistant to standard therapeutic modalities, necessitating more aggressive intervention.

Methods

We report a case of refractory urticarial vasculitis developing in association with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a 46-year-old man. We also reviewed the literature to identify other cases of urticarial vasculitis managed with this therapeutic modality.

Results

The disease progressively improved during 6 treatments with plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). In the additional cases identified in the literature, plasmapheresis was generally effective and well tolerated.

Conclusion

On the basis of these findings, we propose that plasmapheresis be considered a treatment option for refractory urticarial vasculitis.

### Surgical management and outcomes of levamisole-induced vasculitis in a burn center: a case series [^115xZVzs]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Levamisole is an anthelmintic drug initially used to treat parasitic worm infections in addition to various cancers and immunologic disease processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, lichen planus, and Crohn's disease due to its immunomodulatory properties. However, levamisole was withdrawn from the market in 1999 because of reported side effects, including agranulocytosis and skin vasculitis. In the veterinary world, it continues to be used as a deworming medication. Studies have also suggested that levamisole may lead to central nervous system complications, such as leukoencephalopathy. As of 2019, approximately 80% of the cocaine consumed in the United States was contaminated with levamisole to potentiate the stimulatory effects of cocaine and increase its bulk. Levamisole-induced vasculitis typically presents as a purpuric rash, which typically arises on the ears, cheeks, face, extremities, buttocks, and thighs. The rash may exhibit areas of necrosis and can progress to a full-thickness wound. Histology typically demonstrates thrombotic or leukocytoclastic vasculitis and sometimes vascular occlusion. Though the diagnosis is one of exclusion, the aforementioned cutaneous manifestations, a history of cocaine use, arthralgias, leukopenia, and positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers should raise suspicion for levamisole-induced vasculitis.

If levamisole-induced vasculitic wounds progress to full-thickness necrosis, surgical intervention may be required. To date, there is no widely-accepted standardized treatment algorithm for full-thickness, necrotic wounds due to this disease despite the continuous increase in cases and severer presentations in the recurrences, all the more increasing the necessity to evaluate treatment options to determine the most efficient approach. Though there are case series that have resulted in the development of guidelines and/or recommendations for surgical treatment of levamisole-induced vasculitis based on a minimal number of patient cases, such publications are scarce, and further examples are needed in order to provide a comprehensive algorithm. This study presents data on 4 patients with levamisole-induced vasculitis with a view to evaluating their surgical management and contributing to the scarce body of literature that discusses management of this condition when it reaches full-thickness necrosis.

Management of systemic vasculitis has been revolutionised over the last decade with the introduction of targeted biological agents. With an increase in both the prevalence and the recognition of vasculitis as well as the high cost of these agents, it is important to ensure their most optimal utilisation. The goals of vasculitis therapy include the induction and maintenance of remissions, preventing relapses, reducing the toxicity of therapy with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality as well as improving the quality of life of those afflicted. This review focuses on the recent advances in the diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of these conditions.

3.11 Background/purpose

Vasculitis refers to a disease in which the vascular structure is damaged through immune cell infiltration in the vascular wall, inducing ischemia‐related tissue/organ disorder. The pathogenesis of vasculitis remains to be clarified. Diagnosis/treatment methods have not been sufficiently established. In the Chapel Hill classificationpublished in 1994, the classification of vasculitis based on vascular thickness (large, medium, and small blood vessels) was proposed. In a revision in 2012, it was subdivided in consideration of the etiology and underlying disease. In addition, the Nomenclature of Cutaneous Vasculitis: Dermatological Addendum to the CHCC 2012was published in 2018, providing a detailed description of individual skin lesions associated with vasculitis. In the skin, the incidence of medium/small vessel vasculitis is high. Cutaneous vasculitis induces various dermal symptoms, but skin ulcers may occur.

For the treatment of vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers, it is the most important to control primary disease activity. However, there are cases in which it is difficult to evaluate which treatment is useful for treating skin ulcers, especially when physicians other than dermatologists are responsible for treatment. In this section, we establish the CQ "Are there any drugs effective for vasculitis‐associated skin ulcers?" and aim to present the directivity of treatment for vasculitis‐related skin ulcers based on the literature previously reported.

Histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence findings of the skin. A, Leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the small blood vessels in the dermis (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnifications: ×40); and B, Direct immunofluorescence: granular IgA deposits seen in the walls of the small blood vessels in the dermis.

After obtaining informed consent from the patient, we initiated tofacitinib therapy (10 mg/d). Seven days after treatment, palpable purpura was substantially improved. Two weeks after treatment, purpura disappeared (Fig 1, D to F). Then, the patient was tapped to 5-mg once daily doses of tofacitinib. At the time of writing this report, the patient was receiving tofacitinib therapy 5 mg once daily for 1 month and was in a state of remission with no adverse events.
