## Question

Semaglutide vs liraglutide in weight management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how semaglutide compares to liraglutide for weight management, including aspects such as efficacy, dosing, safety, real-world effectiveness, cost, and guideline positioning, with the goal of arriving at a practical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanisms that drive weight loss. Then, I should verify the head-to-head randomized trial data. Next, I will review pivotal trials for each agent to anchor absolute efficacy. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability, including gastrointestinal adverse effects and discontinuation. Then, I will examine real-world effectiveness and persistence. I should also consider cost-effectiveness and access. Finally, I will align with guideline recommendations and synthesize a bottom-line clinical recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and mechanism. Both semaglutide and liraglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists that reduce appetite and caloric intake via central mechanisms and slow gastric emptying, thereby increasing satiety and reducing energy intake; semaglutide has a longer half-life enabling once-weekly dosing, whereas liraglutide is dosed daily, which can influence adherence and tolerability in practice [^112pAsSq] [^1175oGQn] [^112QQ3gT].

> I will now examine the pivotal head-to-head evidence. The STEP 8 randomized trial in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes showed that once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg produced a mean weight loss of 15.8% versus 6.4% with once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg at 68 weeks, a 9.4 percentage-point difference favoring semaglutide. Categorical outcomes likewise favored semaglutide, with 70.9% achieving ≥ 10% weight loss on semaglutide versus 25.6% on liraglutide, and higher odds of ≥ 15% and ≥ 20% loss as well, all statistically significant [^114nTXgk] [^1136eMcY] [^117LfPRQ].

> Wait, let me verify the absolute efficacy anchors for each agent separately to ensure internal consistency. In STEP 1, semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly led to about 14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks versus 2.4% with placebo, with high proportions achieving ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% thresholds; STEP 2 in type 2 diabetes showed a smaller but still clinically meaningful placebo-subtracted loss of about 6.2% at 68 weeks, reflecting attenuated weight loss in diabetes populations [^117BU1yt] [^115SW1HE]. For liraglutide, the SCALE program demonstrated approximately 8% mean weight loss at 56 weeks versus 2.6% with placebo in non-diabetic obesity, with consistent benefits across trials but generally lower magnitude than semaglutide [^11769wEc] [^111yd7at].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking discontinuation and dose tolerability. Both agents have predominantly gastrointestinal adverse effects, but STEP 8 reported higher discontinuation with liraglutide (27.6%) versus semaglutide (13.5%), despite similar rates of overall gastrointestinal events; slow, stepwise titration mitigates GI intolerance, and both labels allow dose reduction to a previously tolerated level if adverse effects emerge [^114nTXgk] [^114kWjHi]. I should confirm that serious adverse events were uncommon and balanced in these programs, which aligns with class expectations and trial reports [^114nTXgk].

> Next, I should review real-world effectiveness and persistence, because trial efficacy often exceeds what is achieved in practice. Observational cohorts show lower average weight loss with both agents than in RCTs, largely due to lower adherence, suboptimal dosing, and early discontinuation; however, among patients with persistent coverage, outcomes approach trial results, with semaglutide consistently outperforming liraglutide in 1-year analyses and achieving higher odds of ≥ 10% weight loss when adherence is maintained [^113Cg9g1] [^116Z1poW] [^115CF5qv]. But wait, what if persistence is the bottleneck? Indeed, only about 40% maintain persistent coverage at 1 year in some cohorts, underscoring the need for access solutions and adherence support to translate trial benefits into practice [^113Cg9g1].

> I need to check cost-effectiveness to inform value judgments. A cost-needed-to-treat analysis estimated that achieving a 1% weight reduction costs approximately $3,256 with liraglutide versus $1,845 with semaglutide, indicating better pharmacoeconomic value for semaglutide despite higher list price, particularly when considering the magnitude of weight loss achieved [^111aCzzj]. Let me reconsider whether this holds across health systems; multiple country-specific analyses similarly suggest semaglutide is cost-effective versus lifestyle alone at commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds, though payer coverage and acquisition cost vary widely [^112o93Xj].

> I should confirm guideline positioning to ensure alignment with standards of care. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends semaglutide 2.4 mg with lifestyle interventions for adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidities, reflecting moderate certainty evidence and the robust STEP data; cardiology guidance also favors semaglutide over liraglutide when pharmacotherapy is indicated for weight reduction in chronic coronary disease populations, and endocrine guidance prioritizes GLP-1 RAs with greater weight loss efficacy, such as semaglutide, in type 2 diabetes with overweight or obesity [^117CRXpr] [^115gN2so] [^112ykCej]. Hold on, I should verify that these recommendations explicitly incorporate comparative efficacy; yes, both AGA and ACC statements reference semaglutide's superior weight loss relative to other agents, including liraglutide, in their recommendations [^115gN2so].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications pragmatically. Semaglutide achieves substantially greater weight loss than liraglutide in head-to-head trials, with better categorical response rates and lower discontinuation, and this advantage persists across diabetes and non-diabetes populations, albeit with smaller absolute losses in type 2 diabetes; once-weekly dosing likely improves adherence, and real-world data show that persistence is the key determinant of achieving trial-like outcomes [^114nTXgk] [^1152fu5J] [^113Cg9g1]. I should double-check that the safety profiles are comparable enough to use the same mitigation strategies; yes, both require slow titration, anticipatory guidance for GI effects, and dose reduction if intolerance occurs, with no major safety signal differences in these programs [^114kWjHi] [^114nTXgk].

> Bottom line, I recommend semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly as first-line pharmacotherapy for chronic weight management when a GLP-1 RA is chosen, given superior efficacy, favorable cost per unit weight loss, and guideline endorsement. Liraglutide 3.0 mg daily remains a reasonable alternative when semaglutide is contraindicated, unavailable, or not tolerated, with the understanding that expected weight loss will be modestly lower and daily injections may impact adherence. I need to ensure ongoing monitoring for efficacy and tolerability, reinforce lifestyle therapy, and address access and persistence barriers to sustain benefits over time [^114nTXgk] [^117CRXpr] [^114kWjHi] [^111aCzzj].

Semaglutide achieves **greater weight loss** than liraglutide in head-to-head trials [^114nTXgk], with mean reductions of 15.8% vs 6.4% at 68 weeks and higher odds of ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, and ≥ 20% weight loss [^1136eMcY]. Both have similar gastrointestinal adverse effects [^114nTXgk], but semaglutide has **lower discontinuation rates** and the convenience of once-weekly dosing [^1136eMcY]. Real-world data show semaglutide yields larger 1-year weight loss and better persistence than liraglutide [^113Cg9g1] [^116Z1poW]. Guidelines favor semaglutide for obesity management due to its superior efficacy and favorable risk–benefit profile [^117CRXpr] [^112TmKyn].

---

## Mechanism of action

Both agents are GLP-1 receptor agonists that **reduce appetite and caloric intake** and slow gastric emptying, promoting satiety and weight loss [^1175oGQn] [^113m1WQN]. Semaglutide has a longer half-life (~1 week) enabling once-weekly dosing, whereas liraglutide is dosed daily due to its shorter half-life (~13 hours) [^112pAsSq].

---

## Clinical trial efficacy

### Head-to-head comparison (STEP 8 trial)

- **Mean weight loss**: Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly achieved a mean weight loss of 15.8% vs 6.4% with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily at 68 weeks (difference −9.4 percentage points; 95% CI −12.0 to −6.8; P < .001) [^114nTXgk].

- **Categorical weight loss**: Semaglutide had significantly higher odds of achieving ≥ 10% (70.9% vs 25.6%), ≥ 15% (55.6% vs 12.0%), and ≥ 20% (38.5% vs 6.0%) weight loss than liraglutide [^1136eMcY].

- **Discontinuation**: Lower discontinuation with semaglutide (13.5% vs 27.6% with liraglutide) [^114nTXgk].

---

### Additional semaglutide trials

- **STEP 1**: 14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks vs 2.4% with placebo [^117BU1yt].

- **STEP 2 (T2D)**: 9.6% mean weight loss at 68 weeks vs 3.4% with placebo [^115SW1HE].

- **STEP 5 (2-year data)**: Sustained 15.2% mean weight loss at 104 weeks [^notfound].

---

### Liraglutide trials

In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial, liraglutide 3.0 mg produced a **mean weight loss of 8.0% at 56 weeks** vs 2.6% with placebo [^11769wEc]. In the SCALE Diabetes trial, it achieved a **mean weight loss of 6.0% at 56 weeks** vs 2.0% with placebo [^11769wEc].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal adverse effects**: Both have similar rates of GI side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting); semaglutide 84.1% vs liraglutide 82.7% in STEP 8 [^114nTXgk].

- **Serious adverse events**: Similar low rates; no significant difference in STEP 8 [^notfound].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Low risk for both; higher when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^113m1WQN].

---

## Real-world effectiveness

Real-world data show semaglutide produces **greater 1-year weight loss** than liraglutide (−5.1% vs −2.2%) and higher odds of ≥ 10% weight loss (adjusted OR 2.19) [^116Z1poW]. Persistence is better with semaglutide, supporting its once-weekly regimen [^notfound].

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

Adherence is likely better with semaglutide due to **once-weekly dosing** and fewer injections, whereas liraglutide requires daily injections [^114nTXgk]. Satisfaction is higher with semaglutide because of greater weight loss and fewer injections [^notfound].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Cost per 1% weight loss is lower for semaglutide ($1,845) than liraglutide ($3,256), indicating **better pharmacoeconomic value** despite higher upfront cost [^111aCzzj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommend semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly with lifestyle intervention for obesity due to superior efficacy and favorable risk–benefit profile [^117CRXpr]. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) also recommends semaglutide over liraglutide for weight management in chronic coronary disease [^115gN2so].

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^111yd7at]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

3 MANAGEMENT OF OBESITY

Older pharmacological options for chronic weight management, such as orlistat, phentermine‐topiramate and naltrexone‐bupropion, typically show moderate efficacy (~3%‐9% mean weight loss over that achieved with lifestyle intervention alone). Liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily administered subcutaneously was the first GLP‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) to be approved for weight management, after demonstrating weight losses of 4%‐6% over those achieved with lifestyle intervention alone in clinical trials of 20‐56 weeks' duration. In these trials, 46%‐76% of participants lost ≥ 5% and 23%‐37% lost ≥ 10% of their baseline body weight.,

Semaglutide is a GLP‐1 analogue shown to reduce energy intake, reduce hunger and increase feelings of satiety and fullness. This effect has been shown to arise via GLP‐1 receptor activation in the central nervous system, with further indirect modulation of neuronal activity involved in appetite regulation and food intake and preference. The STEP programme was designed to comprehensively explore the efficacy of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity, with each trial addressing a specific research question. For the six completed trials discussed in this review, these are: STEP 1 (large pivotal study), weight loss; STEP 2, weight loss in type 2 diabetes; STEP 3, weight loss in combination with intensive behavioural therapy; STEP 4, effect of continuing versus withdrawing semaglutide on weight‐loss maintenance; STEP 5, weight maintenance over 2 years; and STEP 8, head‐to‐head comparison of semaglutide and liraglutide. In addition to these STEP trials, a regional phase IIIa trial, STEP 6, assessed the effect of semaglutide versus placebo for weight management in 401 adults from east Asia (Japan and South Korea) with obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes.

### Liraglutide versus semaglutide for weight reduction-a cost needed to treat analysis [^111aCzzj]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Higher doses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists liraglutide and, more recently, semaglutide have demonstrated a significant reduction in body weight. However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear.

Methods

The cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using semaglutide or liraglutide was calculated. The body weight reductions were extracted from the published STEP 1 trial and the SCALE trial results, respectively. A scenario analysis was performed to mitigate the primary differences between the two studies' populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022.

Results

Liraglutide in STEP 1 resulted in a weight loss of 5.4% (95% CI: 5%-5.8%). Semaglutide in SCALE resulted in a weight loss of 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%). The total cost of therapy with liraglutide during the trial was estimated at $17,585 compared with $22,878 with semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with liraglutide is estimated at $3256 (95% CI: $3032-$3517) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide.

Conclusions

Semaglutide provides significantly better value for money than liraglutide for weight reduction.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg QW

The STEP 1 clinical trial has investigated the benefits of once-weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people who are obese or overweight. In a double-blind trial of 1961 nondiabetic obese (≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweight patients (≥ 27 kg/m²) with coexisting weight-related complications, semaglutide 2.4 mg along with lifestyle modifications led to a 14.9% reduction in body weight as compared with a 2.4% reduction with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of − 12.4 percentage points at 68 weeks. The mean reduction in body weight from baseline to week 68 was − 15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared to − 2.6 kg in the placebo group. 86.4, 69.1, and 50.5% of the patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more, respectively, at the end of 68 weeks. Not only that, patients receiving semaglutide also reported significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors and physical functioning as compared to the placebo arm. Transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events; these were of mild-to-moderate severity that subsided over time. The STEP 2 trial compared semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and semaglutide 1 mg for weight management in a double-blind, double-dummy design in overweight and obese T2DM patients. At the end of 68 weeks, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week demonstrated a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in body weight compared with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of 6.2 percentage points (95% CI − 7.3 to − 5.2; p < 0.0001). A higher number of patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo achieved a weight loss of 5% or more (OR − 4.88, 95% CI 3.58–6.64). Furthermore, semaglutide 2.4 mg has been investigated versus placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and a low-calorie diet for weight management in 611 overweight and obese patients in the STEP 3 trial. Higher proportions of the patients in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more at the end of 68 weeks: 86.6, 75.3, and 55.8%, respectively.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^112pAsSq]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide pharmacology

Semaglutide is a long‐acting GLP‐1 analogue that mimics the effects of native GLP‐1, which promotes WL by reducing energy intake, increasing satiety and satiation, and reducing hunger, as well as enhancing glycemic control (17). Many GLP‐1s have been approved for the treatment of T2D, but only liraglutide 3.0 mg daily has been approved for WM. Semaglutide is approved for treatment of diabetes at the dosage of ≤ 1.0 mg once weekly subcutaneously or in oral tablet form at a dosage of up to 14 mg (2, 17, 18, 19, 20).

Current phase 3 trials are investigating semaglutide as a new GLP‐1 analogue for the treatment of obesity because greater WL was observed with semaglutide than liraglutide (21). In the phase 2 trial of semaglutide in adults with obesity, a 0.4‐mg dose daily was well tolerated, and patients experienced a mean WL at week 52 from baseline of −13.8% compared with −7.8% for liraglutide 3.0 mg and −2.3% for placebo (21).

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity program

The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial development program is evaluating semaglutide 2.4 mg, administered subcutaneously once weekly, for WM in people with obesity or overweight. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the effect, safety, and tolerability profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg on WL, to enable further clinical development, and to support regulatory approval of semaglutide for WM. The trial design, objectives, end points, and baseline characteristics of five of the STEP trials are presented in this article.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on medical weight management for optimization of cardiovascular health: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114kWjHi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and tolerability of weekly NuSh agents — semaglutide and tirzepatide are dosed once weekly, and all agents require dose titration to minimize largely gastrointestinal adverse effects; slow titration mitigates intolerance, and for patients with adverse effects, decreasing the dose to a previously tolerated dose is recommended. In clinical trials, 4.3% to 7.1% of participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Among published clinical trials, the longest duration of treatment with a NuSh (liraglutide) was 3.8 years, and observational data across 5 years suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective; given that obesity is a chronic disease, weight regain after discontinuation of therapy is expected. Access and affordability challenges can lead to missed doses; should a patient miss doses due to lack of access, strategies exist to guide therapeutic interchanges, and if ≥ 3 missed dosages of once-weekly semaglutide or tirzepatide occur, a dose reduction may be considered.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^113Cg9g1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort of patients with obesity who initiated treatment with injectable semaglutide or liraglutide, patients lost an average of 3.7% body weight at 1 year. Weight loss varied significantly by the medication, indication, dosage, and persistence of medication coverage. In the multivariable analysis, patients who received semaglutide (vs liraglutide), had a high dosage of the medication (vs low), had obesity (vs T2D) as treatment indication, had persistent medication coverage or 90 to 275 medication coverage days within the first year (vs < 90 medication coverage days), had higher baseline BMI, and were female (vs male) had significantly higher odds of achieving 10% or greater weight reduction at 1 year.

Recently, injectable forms of semaglutide have been more commonly prescribed, in part related to their ability to demonstrate clinically meaningful weight outcomes. As a result of its superiority, the demand for the medication has skyrocketed, leading to notable drug shortages. Patients have high expectations to achieve substantial weight reductions with GLP-1 RA medications. Our clinical findings suggest that this was not the case for most patients in our cohort; however, those who persisted with the medication coverage experienced weight losses comparable with those shown in corresponding clinical trials. Unfortunately, only 4 in 10 patients in this cohort had persistent medication coverage at 1 year, which underlines the current challenges with treating T2D and obesity with these highly effective medications. High out-of-pocket costs, insurance coverage–related issues, medication supply shortages, adverse effects, and weight reduction not meeting the patient's expectations could be the reasons for this, warranting future studies on determinants of nonpersistent coverage with these medications. However, 61.0% of the patients who received semaglutide for obesity and with persistent coverage at 1 year achieved 10% or greater weight loss, which is only slightly less than the proportion in the STEP 1 study, where 69.1% of participants achieved at least 10% weight reduction at 68 weeks.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

### Semaglutide 2. 4 mg once a week in adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes (STEP 2): a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^115SW1HE]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the GLP-1 analogue once a week subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus semaglutide 1.0 mg (the dose approved for diabetes treatment) and placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, superiority study enrolled adults with a body-mass index of at least 27 kg/m² and glycated haemoglobin 7–10% (53–86 mmol/mol) who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 180 days before screening. Patients were recruited from 149 outpatient clinics in 12 countries across Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and glycated haemoglobin, to subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2.4 mg, or semaglutide 1.0 mg, or visually matching placebo, once a week for 68 weeks, plus a lifestyle intervention. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and achievement of weight reduction of at least 5% at 68 weeks for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo, assessed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03552757 and is closed to new participants.

Findings

From June 4 to Nov 14, 2018, 1595 patients were screened, of whom 1210 were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 404), semaglutide 1.0 mg (n = 403), or placebo (n = 403) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated change in mean bodyweight from baseline to week 68 was -9.6% (SE 0.4) with semaglutide 2.4 mg vs -3.4% (0.4) with placebo. Estimated treatment difference for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo was -6.2 percentage points (95% CI -7.3 to -5.2; p < 0.0001). At week 68, more patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg than on placebo achieved weight reductions of at least 5% (267 [68.8%] of 388 vs 107 [28.5%] of 376; odds ratio 4.88, 95% CI 3.58 to 6.64; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide 2.4 mg (in 353 [87.6%] of 403 patients) and 1.0 mg (329 [81.8%] of 402) than with placebo (309 [76.9%] of 402). Gastrointestinal adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 256 (63.5%) of 403 patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg, 231 (57.5%) of 402 with semaglutide 1.0 mg, and 138 (34.3%) of 402 with placebo.

Interpretation

In adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week achieved a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in bodyweight compared with placebo.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11222hio]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — weight management pharmacotherapy indications and preferred agents: Pharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, and in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects are preferred and include GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA class; some agents (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management. Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment, while others are approved for long-term treatment. If these medications do not achieve weight goals or are not tolerated or are contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be considered.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7.2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m² or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg, 2.4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2.4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7.2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73.7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113.0 (24.1) kg, and mean BMI was 39.9 (7.1) kg/m². The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg (-18.7% [SE 0.4] vs -15.6% [0.7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3.1% [95% CI -4.7 to -1.6]; p < 0.0001) and with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (-18.7% [0.4] vs -3.9% [0.6]; -14.8% [-16.2 to -13.4]; p < 0.0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7.2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12.1 [95% CI 8.3 to 17.6]; p < 0.0001), 10% or greater (14.5 [9.6 to 21.9]; p < 0.0001), 15% or greater (20.3 [11.2 to 36.8]; p < 0.0001), 20% or greater (27.3 [10.9 to 68.0]; p < 0.0001), and 25% or greater (127.4 [36.8 to 441.4]; p < 0.0001); and more likely than those in the 2.4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]; p = 0.0006) and 25% or greater (2.4 [1.6 to 3.5]; p < 0.0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11.7 cm [95% CI -13.0 to -10.4]; p < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7.2 mg (711 [70.8%] of 1004) versus 2.4 mg (123 [61.2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42.8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22.9%], 12 [6.0%], and one [0.5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6.8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7.2 mg, 22 (10.9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 11 (5.5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7.2 mg was superior to placebo and 2.4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Interventions for weight management in children and adolescents: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^112fGNzZ]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Body mass index (BMI) of the 95th or greater percentile for age and sex is common among young people, and its prevalence has increased in recent decades.

Objective

To examine the benefits and harms of weight management interventions initiated in health care settings among children and adolescents with high BMI.

Data Sources

MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycINFO via Ovid, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials through January 12, 2023; ongoing surveillance through January 26, 2024.

Study Selection

English-language studies of weight management interventions (behavioral and pharmacologic, including liraglutide, semaglutide, orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate) among children aged 2 to 18 years with high BMI (eg, ≥ 85th or ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex) conducted in or recruited from health care settings.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked for accuracy. Outcomes with sufficient evidence for meta-analysis were pooled using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

BMI and other weight-related outcomes, cardiometabolic measures, quality of life, physical activity, dietary pattern scores, and harms.

Results

Fifty-eight randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included (N = 10 143). Behavioral interventions were associated with small reductions in BMI and other weight outcomes after 6 to 12 months (28 RCTs [n = 4494]; mean difference in change between groups, -0.7 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.3]). Larger effects were seen in interventions with higher contact hours and that offered physical activity sessions. Reporting was sparse for outcomes other than BMI, with few significant findings. Semaglutide and phentermine/topiramate had the largest effects on BMI (eg, 1 RCT [n = 201] for semaglutide; mean difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -7.3 to -4.6]). The very few studies that evaluated outcomes after medication discontinuation showed immediate weight regain. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common with liraglutide, semaglutide, and orlistat. Serious adverse effects were rare, but no studies had follow-up longer than 17 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the short term, weight management interventions led to lower BMI in children and adolescents, with no evidence of serious harm. Evidence is lacking about how weight management interventions affect BMI beyond 1 year and after medication discontinuation and about longer-term effects on other outcomes.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and agonists administered for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112sb821]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative effectiveness of 7 glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agents on weight loss (WL) in obesity remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) utilizing the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central and clinical trial registries, from inception to March 2, 2021. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥ 12 weeks' duration. The data appraisal and extraction were performed by two investigators independently, using the published reports. The main outcomes and statistical methods were weight loss over placebo (WLOP) and adverse events (AEs) among GLP-1 agents using random-effects NMA (frequentist approach); relative ranking using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) method and certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE).

Findings

64 RCTs (from 2004 to 2021) included 27018 patients (median of age, 55.1 years old; 57.4% women; baseline weight 94.8kg and BMI 33.0kg/m²; trial duration 26 weeks). Direct meta-analysis showed significant WLOP with: -1.44kg (95% CI, -2.14 to -0.74) with dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg; -1.82kg (-2.42 to -1.23) with exenatide immediate release (IR); -2.20kg (-4.31 to -0.08) with exenatide extended release (ER); -3.20kg (-6.53 to 0.15) with efpeglenatide; -2.72kg (-3.35 to -2.09) with liraglutide ≤ 1.8mg; -4.49kg (-5.26 to -3.72) with liraglutide > 1.8mg; -0.62kg (-1.22 to -0.02) with lixisenatide; -4.33kg (-5.71 to -3.00) with semaglutide SQ < 2.4mg; -9.88kg (-13.17 to -6.59) with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg; -2.73kg (-4.81 to -0.65) with semaglutide oral; and -1.71kg (-2.64 to -0.78) with taspoglutide. Highest WLOP were with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg and < 2.4mg, and liraglutide > 1.8mg (SUCRAs 100, 86.1, 82.8 respectively). Highest SUCRAs for discontinuation due to AEs were with taspoglutide and liraglutide > 1.8mg. Risk of bias was high or unclear for random sequence generation (29.7%), allocation concealment (26.6%), and incomplete outcome data (26.6%). Heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) in WL and AEs reflected magnitude, not direction of effect.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116JEHaY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the management of obesity in persons living with kidney diseases [^11441H9T]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — incretin mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs] and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] RAs) for weight management in kidney disease — notes regulatory status and kidney outcome data: As of August 16, 2024, three GLP-1 RAs are approved for weight loss (liraglutide, tirzepatide, semaglutide), and weight loss in this class often exceeds 5% of baseline body weight. In patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25–75), semaglutide reduced the risk of major kidney disease outcomes by approximately 25%. In adults without preexisting cardiovascular disease and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m², semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly administration reduced a five-component kidney composite end point by 22%. A randomized trial with liraglutide (1.8 mg subcutaneous daily) demonstrated a 22% lower occurrence of a composite kidney outcome versus placebo, primarily driven by reduced new persistent microalbuminuria.

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^117VggbV]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Although MBS remains the most effective treatment for severe obesity, we must acknowledge that obesity is a chronic and complex disease, MBS is not curative, and adjuvant therapy may be needed. Optimal weight loss, weight maintenance, and remission of obesity-related comorbidities are best facilitated by a combination of lifestyle interventions, AOMs, and MBS procedures, both primary and revisional. AOM regimens should be individualized by patient factors such as incretin therapies in a person with T2DM. Although there are promising results for a phenotype-guided obesity treatment approach, these precision medicine strategies are not yet practical for general use.

Prospective studies are needed to identify the best time to initiate AOMs and what medications are most effective for post-MBS weight optimization. These data could inform evidence-based guidelines to manage post-MBS weight recurrence, promote weight maintenance, and induce remission in obesity-related comorbidities. Higher quality data will hopefully increase prescription rates and insurance coverage for AOMs. Obesity is not widely treated as a chronic disease, as < 2% of eligible people receive AOMs, and the mean AOM prescription duration is only 81 days, which is inadequate to see maximum treatment response. Health care providers and the scientific community must normalize the treatment of obesity as a chronic disease and decrease the clinical inertia for recommending AOMs, regardless of MBS status. Additionally, patients should be educated prior to surgery that post-MBS weight recurrence is common and effective treatments are available.

### Subcutaneous semaglutide (NN9535) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^113m1WQN]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is critical for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to maintain optimal glycemia while avoiding hypoglycemia, control body weight, and reduce cardiovascular risk. The GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release (low risk of hypoglycemia), inhibit glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying and suppress appetite (weight loss). The new members of the class are available as once daily or weekly injections. Additionally, some members of the class have demonstrated reduced cardiovascular risk. Areas covered: This manuscript describes semaglutide - a new investigational long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist. The key trials from the clinical development process are reviewed and important end-points highlighted. Expert opinion: Once-weekly semaglutide has shown superiority in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin and body weight in comparison with placebo and active comparators when used as monotherapy or in combination treatment. In addition, semaglutide improved markers of β-cell function and have shown cardiovascular risk reduction similar to once daily liraglutide. Although, overall semaglutide safety was comparable to other GLP-1 receptor agonists (low risk of hypoglycemia and high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects), increase in retinopathy complications requires further investigation.

### GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond [^111FEVGZ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^1136eMcY]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n = 126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n = 127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115aKutV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as key agents for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized controlled trials. While still limited, real-world studies on GLP-1RA use in populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review discusses contemporary real-world evidence demonstrating the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently approved GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. Real-world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP-1RAs (20%-50%) within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP-1RA users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression and self-harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real-world associations of GLP-1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 areas of particular importance for further research on GLP-1RA within the real-world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping GLP-1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost-effectiveness for hard clinical outcomes in real-world settings, including not only cardio-reno-metabolic outcomes but also obesity-induced diseases like neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Recent advancements in weight-loss medications have sparked a lot of interest. The so-called GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1RAs) have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, leading to significant weight loss in patients participating in clinical trials. GLP-1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications are used and their effectiveness and safety in real-world settings. In real-life practice, GLP-1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly as in trials. Real-world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with GLP-1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong real-world evidence that GLP-1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. Despite these challenges, when GLP-1RAs are used effectively and consistently, they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage and prevent weight-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still scarce in real-world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve dosing. It also calls for studies on the long-term effects of these therapies on various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP-1RAs are a valuable tool for weight management, their real-world use requires careful consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of people that need them.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^116hFDqT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8 is the first direct comparison of semaglutide with another weight‐management medication in a randomized trial. Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated better efficacy than liraglutide as well as offering more convenient once‐weekly rather than once‐daily injections. Although direct comparisons with other treatments cannot be made because of methodological differences between trials, overall the weight loss with other approved medications appears to be more modest than that seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials.,

The STEP trials showed both short‐ and longer‐term improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight or obesity. Earlier data from PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 suggested a CV benefit of semaglutide at lower doses in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for semaglutide in the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. The ongoing SELECT trial (NCT03574597) will report on CV outcomes with semaglutide 2.4 mg in a population without diabetes who are at high CV risk.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class and was similar to that seen in other trials of subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In clinical practice, the extensive experience with this molecule at the 1.0 mg dose in type 2 diabetes and with the GLP‐1RA class overall should ensure a certain degree of confidence in the safety profile. This includes the rate of severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia, which in STEP 2 was reported in similar proportions of subjects receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg (5.7% and 5.5%, respectively).

The encouraging data from validated patient‐reported outcomes (Short Form‐36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version in STEP 1‐4 and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life‐Lite Clinical Trials Version questionnaire in STEP 1 and 2) point towards the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg being directly perceived by study participants.

### Real-world effectiveness analysis of switching from liraglutide or dulaglutide to semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the retrospective REALISE-DM study [^116WxPts]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to inherent differences between GLP-1 RA therapies, clinicians and patients may prefer to use one agent over another. In clinical practice, one may also consider switching to a different GLP-1 RA if the current agent is unable to achieve the expected glycemic control or weight loss, or if the patient is unable to tolerate a GLP-1 RA due to side effects. There are no studies to date that have investigated the effectiveness and safety of semaglutide OW in patients already receiving GLP-1 RA therapy. A previous model-based study predicted that switching to semaglutide OW from liraglutide, dulaglutide, or exenatide would result in further reductions in HbA1c and weight. Previous randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of adding insulin to patients already on a GLP-1 RA regimen and whose T2DM was considered uncontrolled.

Here, we present results of the first study designed to investigate the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide OW in patients previously treated with liraglutide or dulaglutide in a real-world clinical setting. This study aimed to provide guidance to clinicians on the effectiveness and safety of switching to semaglutide OW in patients previously treated with liraglutide or dulaglutide, with a focus on trying to reduce GSEs and improve adherence.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116Z1poW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Limited data are available on long-term weight loss achieved with semaglutide or liraglutide for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity in clinical practice.

Objective

To document weight loss achieved with injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide and identify factors associated with weight reduction of 10% or greater at 1 year.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from a large, integrated health system in Ohio and Florida. Participants included adults with a body mass index (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0 who initiated treatment with semaglutide or liraglutide between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2022. Follow-up was completed July 28, 2023.

Exposure

Injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide approved for T2D or obesity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percentage weight change and categorical weight reduction of 10% or greater at 1 year.

Results

A total of 3389 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.4[12.2] years; 1835 [54.7%] female) were identified. Of these, 1341 patients received semaglutide for T2D; 1444, liraglutide for T2D; 227, liraglutide for obesity; and 377, semaglutide for obesity. Mean (SD) percentage weight change at 1 year was -5.1%(7.8%) with semaglutide vs -2.2%(6.4%) with liraglutide (P < .001); -3.2%(6.8%) for T2D as a treatment indication vs -5.9%(9.0%) for obesity (P < .001); and -5.5%(7.5%) with persistent medication coverage (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days) at 1 year vs -2.8%(7.0%) with 90 to 275 medication coverage days and -1.8%(6.7%) with fewer than 90 medication coverage days (P < .001). In the multivariable model, semaglutide vs liraglutide (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19 [95% CI, 1.77–2.72]), obesity as a treatment indication vs T2D (AOR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.83–3.30]), persistent medication coverage vs 90 medication coverage days (AOR, 3.36 [95% CI, 2.52–4.54]) or 90 to 275 medication coverage days within the first year (AOR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.10–2.06]), high dosage of the medication vs low (AOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.11–2.25]), and female sex (AOR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.27–1.94]) were associated with achieving a 10% or greater weight reduction at year 1.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this retrospective cohort study of 3389 patients with obesity, weight reduction at 1 year was associated with the medication's active agent, its dosage, treatment indication, persistent medication coverage, and patient sex. Future research should focus on identifying the reasons for discontinuation of medication use and interventions aimed at improving long-term persistent coverage.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^111JHjqb]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, in this analysis, there was no evidence of a temporal association between the incidence of GI AEs and weight loss at EOT. The prevalence of GI AEs with GLP-1RA treatment was previously found to peak within the initial 12 weeks of treatment and decline thereafter. However, subjects in all treatment arms experienced weight loss between baseline and week 12, and from baseline to EOT (SUSTAIN 3, week 56; SUSTAIN 7, week 40; SUSTAIN 10, week 30).

Excess weight is an important contributing factor in the complex etiology of T2D, and BW control is an important factor in the individualized management of T2D.GLP-1RAs are established and effective therapies for T2D and can be prescribed at all stages of T2D. In addition to managing glucose levels, GLP-1RAs also reduce BW, and this potential for weight loss has been reflected by the GLP-1RA liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily) gaining approval as a treatment for obesity. Because GI AEs including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea are the most common type of AE with GLP-1RAs, it is important to establish whether the weight loss difference between treatment is mediated through the occurrence of GI AEs.

### Semaglutide in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: benefits above and beyond weight loss [^114TpTWZ]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are a group of medications that have been successfully implemented in weight management and used effectively for lowering glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment with GLP-1RAs is associated with significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events. Due to their potential cardiometabolic benefits, GLP-1RAs are widely investigated in the management of HFpEF. A recent preclinical study compared the effects of the GLP-1RA liraglutide and SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on various parameters in a mouse model of obesity-related HFpEF. Interestingly, the study showed that liraglutide has more pronounced beneficial effects on body weight, cardiac function, and structural parameters in this preclinical HFpEF model compared with dapagliflozin.

In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Withaar et alreported the remarkable cardiometabolic benefits of another GLP-1RA, namely semaglutide, in the same preclinical model of obesity-related HFpEF. The authors also investigated the important question "Are the cardiometabolic benefits of semaglutide in HFpEF simply caused by weight loss?" They compared the effects of semaglutide and pair feeding (PF)–induced weight loss on HFpEF to dissect the direct effects of semaglutide on HFpEF from the indirect effects caused by weight loss. Semaglutide treatment led to sustained weight loss in HFpEF mice, primarily because of a reduction in fat mass, which was similarly observed in the PF group. However, the authors uncovered the distinct advantages of semaglutide over PF in other parameters of cardiometabolic health in this HFpEF model. Hearts of semaglutide-treated HFpEF mice showed improved cardiac function (reduced diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis) compared with the PF group. Moreover, semaglutide exhibited a broader protection against extracardiac HFpEF pathologies by reducing lung congestion, improving glycemic control and enhancing exercise capacity, all of which are crucial aspects in managing HFpEF. Proteomic and single-nuclear transcriptomic analyses of the left ventricular showed that semaglutide treatment, but not PF-induced weight loss, enhanced cardiac cytoskeleton organization and improved endothelial function. Interestingly, the authors showed that the GLP-1 receptor is mainly present in endothelial cells rather than cardiomyocytes. This observation suggests that the beneficial effects of semaglutide on cardiac function and structure may primarily result from improved endothelial function and their interactions with other cells within the myocardium. At the systemic levels, the authors showed that semaglutide-treated mice, but not the PF mice, have improved plasma oxidative stress regulation and inflammatory state in visceral adipose tissue. Together, these findings strongly indicate that semaglutide promotes cardiometabolic benefits in HFpEF beyond the indirect effects of weight loss and support the therapeutic potential of semaglutide in HFpEF.

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

### Semaglutide for adults living with obesity [^115Yqhr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Obesity is a complex chronic condition linked to various comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, with a significant global burden. Semaglutide, a widely used glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), can aid in weight loss by reducing appetite. However, its efficacy remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of semaglutide on adults living with obesity.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and two trials registries. The latest search date was 17 December 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared semaglutide with placebo, structured lifestyle modification programmes, other anti-obesity medications or other GLP-1RAs in adults living with obesity, with a minimum of six months' follow-up.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were weight, adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), quality of life, and mortality. Important outcomes were waist circumference, heart failure, diabetes-related outcomes, blood pressure-related outcomes, liver disease-related outcomes, obstructive sleep apnoea, and lipid metabolism-related outcomes.

Risk Of Bias

We used the original version of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs (RoB 1).

Synthesis Methods

We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. The main comparison of interest in the review is semaglutide versus placebo.

Included Studies

We included 18 RCTs (27,949 participants), with a mean age ranging from 41.0 to 69.5 years, and an average BMI between 31.9 kg/m 2 and 40.3 kg/m 2. Seventeen RCTs reported that the drug manufacturer had a major role in their design, conduct, analysis, or writing. Seventeen RCTs compared semaglutide versus placebo, at medium- (16 RCTs) or long-term (2 RCTs) follow-up. Other comparators were liraglutide (2 RCTs) and tirzepatide (1 RCT).

Synthesis Of Results

Semaglutide versus placebo (medium term: 6 months to 17 months) At medium-term follow-up, semaglutide reduces percentage body weight (mean difference (MD) -10.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.24 to -9.21; 15 studies, 8651 participants; high-certainty evidence) and increases the proportion of people achieving 5% weight loss (risk ratio (RR) 2.68, 95% CI 2.30 to 3.12; 12 studies, 7458 participants; high-certainty evidence). Semaglutide may increase non-serious adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22; 13 studies, 8443 participants; low-certainty evidence), likely results in little to no absolute difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.21; 15 studies, 9054 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and has very uncertain effects on serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 15 studies, 9054 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Semaglutide likely results in little to no difference in quality of life (SF-36 physical functioning score: MD 2.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.28; 9 studies, 6083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Semaglutide may result in little to no absolute difference in MACE (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90; 9 studies, 7647 participants; low-certainty evidence) and mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.98; 14 studies, 8953 participants; low-certainty evidence). For most outcomes, the main reasons for downgrading certainty of evidence were related to imprecision and inconsistency. Semaglutide versus placebo (long term: 26 months) At long-term follow-up, semaglutide likely reduces percentage body weight (MD -11.11, 95% CI -16.47 to -5.75; I² = 94%; 2 studies, 15,124 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and likely increases the proportion of people achieving 5% weight loss (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.84; 2 studies, 17,876 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Its effects on non-serious adverse events are very uncertain (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.34; 1 study, 305 participants; very low-certainty evidence), with likely little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95; 2 studies, 17,908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a likely increase in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.20; 2 studies, 17,908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Semaglutide likely results in little to no clinically significant differences in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L: MD 0.02, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence), MACE (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.90; moderate-certainty evidence), and mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; moderate-certainty evidence). For most outcomes, the main reasons for downgrading certainty of evidence were related to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Semaglutide results in a clinically relevant weight loss at medium-term follow-up compared to placebo, which is likely to be sustained in the long term, while taking the drug. While semaglutide increases the risk of adverse events leading to withdrawal, it appears to be of limited clinical relevance in absolute terms at medium-term, and clinically relevant at long-term follow-up. The effects of semaglutide on quality of life, MACE, and mortality are likely limited or uncertain. Most studies were funded by the drug's manufacturer, raising important concerns about conflicts of interest. We identified 46 ongoing studies that may strengthen future evidence syntheses. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of semaglutide in the management of obesity.

### Real-world effectiveness analysis of switching from liraglutide or dulaglutide to semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the retrospective REALISE-DM study [^117B5uaX]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injectable semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that was previously shown to be superior to liraglutide and dulaglutide in head-to-head comparisons in GLP-1 RA-naïve individuals. It is hypothesized that semaglutide will cause further reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients previously treated with liraglutide or dulaglutide. The REALISE-DM study provides the first real-world evidence of the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide in patients switching from another GLP-1 RA.

Methods

This retrospective real-world effectiveness analysis included T2DM adults who were on a stable dose of liraglutide or dulaglutide prior to switching to semaglutide. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were the changes in weight and body mass index (BMI), the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects (GSEs), and discontinuations. Linear mixed models were used to estimate changes in HbA1c, weight, and BMI, and logistic regression was employed to analyze GSEs and discontinuations.

Results

Six months after the 164 patients in this study had switched to semaglutide, their mean HbA1c had decreased by 0.65% (7.1 mmol/mol) (95% prediction interval [PI]: 0.48, 0.81% [5.2, 8.9 mmol/mol]) from a baseline of 7.9% (interquartile range [IQR]: 7.3, 8.8) (62.8 mmol/mol [IQR: 56.3, 72.7]), while their weight and BMI had reduced by 1.69 kg (95% PI: 1.01, 2.37) and 0.59 kg/m 2 (95% PI: 0.34, 0.84), respectively. Nineteen patients (11.6%) developed GSEs after switching.

Conclusions

This study supports switching T2DM patients on liraglutide or dulaglutide to injectable semaglutide to achieve further reductions in HbA1c and weight. Although a small number of GSEs occurred, semaglutide was well tolerated by the majority of the patients.

Anti-obesity medications targeting NuSH — liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide — are noted as the most effective among FDA-approved obesity medications and have robust long-term efficacy and safety data up to 4 years for managing obesity in those with and without cardiovascular disease. While all currently available medications were initially approved by the FDA to treat T2DM, they are also approved for obesity. These agents share a similar side effect profile of primarily gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation) that can be mitigated with dose reductions or behavioral modifications such as hydration. On maximal doses, average weight loss is 8.0% with liraglutide, 14.9% with semaglutide, and 20.9% with tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with… [^115QJghc]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 18 386 propensity-score matched patients initiating tirzepatide or semaglutide labeled for type 2 diabetes, discontinuation was common; most achieved weight loss of 5% or greater within 1 year of treatment. Meaning Although most adults with overweight or obesity experienced 5% or greater weight loss with treatment, the benefit was greater with tirzepatide. The mean baseline weight was 110 kg. Follow-up was ended by discontinuation for 5140 patients receiving tirzepatide and 4823 receiving semaglutide. Conclusions and Relevance In this population of adults with overweight or obesity, use of tirzepatide was associated with significantly greater weight loss than semaglutide. Future study is needed to understand differences in other important outcomes.

In this large clinical analysis of US adults with overweight or obesity who initiated tirzepatide or semaglutide treatment, those receiving tirzepatide were more likely to achieve 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss and experienced larger reductions in body weight at 3, 6, and 12 months. Among similarly designed placebo-controlled trials, treatment with semaglutide at 2. 4 mg per week resulted in 73% and 92% of individuals with and without T2D achieving 5% or greater body weight by 68 weeks, respectively. 6, 7 While data.

In this large, propensity-matched, cohort study, individuals with overweight or obesity treated with tirzepatide were significantly more likely to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss and larger reductions in body weight compared with those treated with semaglutide. Consistent treatment effect estimates were observed in subgroups with and without T2D. Future work is needed to compare the effect of tirzepatide and semaglutide on other key end points. 42, 43.

### Differential efficacy of weight loss interventions in patients with versus without diabetes [^1154Vj1e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Differential Efficacy of Weight Loss Interventions Among Patients with Diabetes

Ketogenic diets strongly reduce dietary carbohydrates, and hence are expected to be of benefit in patients with diabetes. While carefully executed trials in people without diabetes have found weight reductions of up to 12 kg over 6 months, a dedicated meta-analysis of a ketogenic diet in diabetes found a mean adjusted weight difference of − 5.63 kg compared to other diets. As mentioned previously, intermittent fasting diets induce on average a weight loss of merely 1.89 kg among patients with diabetes. By comparison, a meta-analysis encompassing 27 trials of intermittent fasting diets in overweight and obese individuals estimated a mean efficacy of − 4.97 kg, more than twice what has been found in patients with diabetes. Of note, intermittent fasting can be a trigger of acute complications in patients with T1DM, or with T2DM and a high insulin requirement.

GLP-1 agonists are perhaps the pharmacological group for which most evidence exists about their comparative efficacy in patients with or without diabetes. In fact, a dedicated RCT assessed the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide at anti-obesity doses, specifically in patients with diabetes (SCALE Diabetes and SCALE Obesity and prediabetes). Participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (obesity dose) arm achieved a mean − 6.4 kg body weight change after 56 weeks. By contrast, in the pivotal study of liraglutide 3.0 mg in obesity without diabetes, the weight loss at week 56 was 8.4 kg. In summary, the pooled weight-loss efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d in RCTs differs markedly in the presence of diabetes. Subcutaneous semaglutide at the anti-obesity dose of 2.4 mg/week has demonstrated reductions in body weight of 15.8% with continued use over 68 weeks in patients without diabetes. Meanwhile, in the STEP 2 trial of semaglutide at the same dose in patients with excess body weight and T2DM, the weight loss was 9.6%, or 9.6 kg (baseline body weight in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm was 99.9 kg), almost half of what was observed in the absence of T2DM.

Introduction

Burden of obesity

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, progressive disease (1) with a multifactorial origin, including genetic, metabolic, behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental factors (2, 3). The clinical complications of obesity include cardiovascular diseases (CVD; e.g. ischemic heart disease, heart failure), metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes [T2D]), mechanical dysfunction (musculoskeletal disorders [e.g. osteoarthritis]), sleep apnea, and malignancy (4, 5, 6, 7). Around 13% to 19.5% of adults globally have obesity, and the prevalence of obesity is predicted to continue to rise (5, 8). There is a recognition that much of the pathophysiology of obesity involves abnormal satiety and feeding signaling within the brain (9). The hypothalamus, mesolimbic system, and executive functioning are all implicated in the physiology of obesity (9). Thus, there is a necessity for developing more effective novel treatment approaches that address these central nervous system processes (2, 9, 10).

Treatment of obesity

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of weight management (WM) (11), but alone they are generally associated with moderate weight loss (WL) that is gradually regained (9, 12, 13). Maintaining WL is inherently difficult because of counter‐regulatory neuroendocrine pathways that promote weight regain by influencing hunger and satiety, which are a component of appetite, and potentially by decreasing energy expenditure (14, 15). Antiobesity medications (AOMs) may provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle interventions, which typically have a limited effect on WL, to help people achieve and maintain healthy behaviors that are consistent with sustaining WL.

The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have approved AOMs that have been shown to achieve clinically significant WL when used as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions (2, 16). However, most approved AOMs have moderate efficacy, quantified as a < 10% reduction in mean WL over that achieved with lifestyle intervention alone, with significant limitations related to adverse effects, cost, or restrictions on use (2). There is a need for additional AOMs that can induce and sustain greater clinically meaningful WL and that have a convenient form of administration that improves associated complications, such as T2D and CVD. One potential new AOM is the glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) analogue semaglutide, which has been developed with these characteristic features in mind (11, 17).

### Advances in GLP-1 treatment: focus on oral semaglutide [^112WeKX6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is currently a large arsenal of antidiabetic drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, this is a serious chronic disease that affects millions of adults worldwide and is responsible for severe complications, comorbidities, and low quality of life when uncontrolled due mainly to delays in initiating treatment or inadequate therapy. This review article aims to clarify the therapeutic role of the oral formulation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide in treating typical T2D patients. The discussion focused on metabolic, glycemic, and weight alteration effects and the safety of the therapy with this drug.

Main Text

Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) promotes strategic changes in the pathophysiological pathway of T2D and improves the secretion of glucagon and insulin, which results in a reduction in blood glucose levels and the promotion of weight loss. Until recently, the only route for semaglutide administration was parenteral. However, an oral formulation of GLP-1 RA was recently developed and approved by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) program results. A sequence of 10 clinical studies compared oral semaglutide with placebo or active standard-of-care medications (empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or liraglutide 1.8 mg) in different T2D populations.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide effectively reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight in a broad spectrum of patients with T2D and shows cardiovascular safety. Oral semaglutide broadens therapy options and facilitates the adoption of earlier GLP-1 RA treatment once T2D patients present low rates of treatment discontinuation. The main adverse events reported were related to the gastrointestinal tract, common to GLP-1 RA class drugs.

### The influence of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, on dietary patterns and nutrient intakes in patients with obesity and prediabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^1145oHd9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity and prediabetes are serious public health concerns in the United States, affecting 40.3% and 38.0% of U.S. adults, respectively. These conditions significantly increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, two leading causes of death in the United States. Fortunately, both obesity and prediabetes, along with their associated comorbidities, can be reversed through effective weight management strategies. Recent advances in weight management practices have been made, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of several anti‐obesity medications (AOMs) for chronic weight management, including Saxenda (liraglutide), Wegovy (semaglutide)and Zepbound (tirzepatide). AOMs support weight loss through a variety of mechanisms, including a reduction in hunger, appetite and 'food noise' (i.e. constant food‐related thoughts), and an increase in satiety — all of which promote reduced energy intake. As a result, these medications are highly effective for weight management, reducing body weight by ≥ 15% over 1 year. Beyond weight loss, these medications have been shown to reduce the risk of obesity‐related comorbidities, demonstrating a 94% risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, a 39% risk reduction in obesity‐related cancersand a 20% risk reduction in major cardiovascular events compared to a placebo. While these medications are valuable in addressing the physiological aspects of obesity, they are still intended to be used in combination with diet and physical activity interventions to optimize outcomes.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in chronic weight management in Portugal [^112o93Xj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Semaglutide 2.4 mg was estimated to be cost-effective compared with D&E alone, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and at least one obesity-related complication from the perspective of the Portuguese NHS.

Efficacy and safety data from STEP 1 and STEP 5 trials used in the cost effectiveness analyses provide robust evidence regarding the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in reducing weight, managing blood pressure, controlling lipid levels, and improving glycemic control when compared to relying solely on diet and exercise. The utility data used in these analyses, which inform baseline values and consider age, gender, and BMI, were derived from reported data from STEP 1, and converted to utility weights using country-specific preferences. As a result, the QALY outcomes obtained can be generalized to the broader Portuguese population.

Other studies have estimated the cost effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Sandhu et al. estimated semaglutide 2.4 mg to be cost-effective against D&E alone with an ICER of £14,827/QALY gained over a lifetime horizon, from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Olivieri et al. assessed the cost-effectiveness of weight-management pharmacotherapies approved by Canada Health, from a societal perspective, and have concluded semaglutide 2.4 mg to be the most cost-effective treatment– considering a WTP threshold of CAD 50,000 per QALY– when compared with D&E or orlistat alone, and to dominate other pharmacotherapies, such as NB-32 or liraglutide 3.0 mg. Kim et al. estimated semaglutide 2.4 mg to be cost-effective against other anti-obesity medication (liraglutide 3 mg, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion), D&E and no treatment, over a lifetime horizon, from a societal perspective, with ICERs varying between $27,113 (vs. no treatment) to $144,296 (vs. phentermine-topiramate), and the ICER for D&E being $22,138.

### Efficacy and safety of once weekly semaglutide 2. 4 mg for weight management in a predominantly east Asian population with overweight or obesity (STEP 7): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^113nfsKg]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Data on the benefits of the once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management in people from east Asia are insufficient. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of once weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for weight management in a predominantly east Asian adult population.

Methods

This randomised phase 3a, double-blind multicentre controlled trial (STEP 7) recruited participants from 23 hospitals and trial centres in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, and South Korea. Adults with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive a subcutaneous injection of either semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo once a week for 44 weeks, plus a diet and physical activity intervention. Randomisation was done in blocks of six with an interactive web response system and was stratified by diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Participants, investigators, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment allocation until after database lock. Primary endpoints were percentage change in mean bodyweight and proportion of participants having reached a weight reduction of at least 5% of bodyweight from baseline to week 44. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04251156, and is now complete.

Findings

From Dec 8, 2020, to Aug 23, 2022, 448 participants were screened, of whom 375 were randomly assigned to either the semaglutide 2.4 mg group (n = 249) or the placebo group (n = 126). Estimated mean percentage change in bodyweight from baseline to week 44 was -12.1% (SE 0.5) with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.6% (0.7) with placebo (estimated treatment difference -8.5 percentage points [95% CI -10.2 to -6.8]; p < 0.0001). At week 44, the proportion of participants who lost 5% or more of their bodyweight was higher in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group than in the placebo group (203/238 [85%] vs 36/116 [31%]); odds ratio 13.1 (95% CI 7.4–23.1; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were reported by 231 (93%) of 249 participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg group and 108 (86%) of 126 participants in the placebo group, the most common of which were gastrointestinal disorders (168/249, 67% vs 45/126, 36%).

Interpretation

The results of this study support the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management in people of east Asian ethnicity with overweight or obesity and with or without type 2 diabetes.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^114Kxq6X]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is an epidemic and a public health threat. Medical weight management remains one of the options for the treatment of excess weight and recent advances have revolutionized how we treat, and more importantly how we will be treating obesity in the near future. Metreleptin and Setmelanotide are currently indicated for rare obesity syndromes, and 5 other medications (orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide) are approved for non-syndromic obesity. Tirzepatide is about to be approved, and other drugs, with exciting novel mechanisms of action primarily based on incretins, are currently being investigated in different phases of clinical trials. The majority of these compounds act centrally, to reduce appetite and increase satiety, and secondarily, in the gastrointestinal tract to slow gastric emptying. All anti-obesity medications improve weight and metabolic parameters, with variable potency and effects depending on the specific drug. The currently available data do not support a reduction in hard cardiovascular outcomes, but it is almost certain that such data are forthcoming in the very near future. The choice of the anti-obesity medication needs to take into consideration the patient's clinical and biochemical profile, co-morbidities, and drug contra-indications, as well as expected degree of weight loss and improvements in cardio-renal and metabolic risk. It also remains to be seen whether precision medicine may offer personalized solutions to individuals with obesity, and whether it may represent the future of medical weight management along with the development of novel, very potent, anti-obesity medications currently in the pipeline.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^1152fu5J]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight/obesity is well established, with more than 90% of people with T2D being overweight. Individuals with T2D and overweight/obesity are at increased risk of developing T2D complications compared with people who are not overweight/obese. Body weight (BW) reductions of ≥ 5% improve glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.BW control is an important component of an individualized, multifactorial approach to T2D management, as recommended in current treatment guidelines.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended as second-line therapy (add-on to metformin) where minimizing weight gain, promoting weight loss or when hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk reduction are considerations. All available GLP-1RAs (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide) have demonstrated weight loss in people with T2D. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark) is a GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D as once-weekly (OW) subcutaneousand once-daily oral formulations. The efficacy and safety of OW semaglutide have been established in the global phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trial program, encompassing subjects from across the continuum of T2D care. In addition to significantly greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), semaglutide demonstrated superior reductions in BW versus all comparators across all SUSTAIN trials.

The SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials compared semaglutide with the GLP-1RAs OW exenatide extended release (exenatide ER), OW dulaglutide and once-daily liraglutide, respectively. In these trials, mean BW loss was significantly greater with semaglutide versus comparators at end of treatment (EOT: weeks 56, 40 and 30 for SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10, respectively): SUSTAIN 3: –5.6 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs exenatide ER 2.0 mg; SUSTAIN 7: –4.6 kg vs –2.3 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg and –6.5 kg vs –3.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg; SUSTAIN 10: –5.8 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; all p < 0.0001.

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs in individuals who discontinue liraglutide and who switch from liraglutide to once-weekly injectable semaglutide [^111N8r5S]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2022, more than 37 million Americans were living with diabetes, placing a large financial burden on the US healthcare system due to the direct costs of disease management, with additional indirect costs arising from reduced productivity. As a result of the rising prevalence of diabetes, the estimated total costs of diabetes management are projected to reach $622 billion by 2030. Comprehensive diabetes management strategies, including the use of effective glucose-lowering therapies to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, are imperative to ease the burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on the US healthcare system.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are recommended by clinical guidelines for people with T2D who have not achieved their glycemic target, and they are preferred over insulin where possible. Diabetes treatment guidelines advocate consideration of GLP-1 RAs as second-line therapy for people with T2D uncontrolled on metformin, and as first-line therapy in patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, studies have suggested that (depending on the drug prescribed) up to 48% of patients will have discontinued their initial GLP-1 RA, generally an old generation such as liraglutide, after the first year of treatment, with injection frequency appearing to be a key factor in this. All currently available GLP-1 RAs, with the exception of orally administered semaglutide, are injected subcutaneously with dosing schedules ranging from twice-daily to once-weekly (OW). Victoza (liraglutide, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; hereafter referred to simply as liraglutide) is used for treatment of T2D and is administered once-daily, while Ozempic (semaglutide, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; hereafter referred to as semaglutide), also used for treatment of T2D, is administered by OW subcutaneous injection. Evidence from randomized clinical trials and real-world evidence studies demonstrated the superior benefits in glycemic and weight control comparing semaglutide with liraglutide. Within the SUSTAIN 10 trial, treatment with OW semaglutide 1.0 mg was superior to liraglutide 1.2 mg in glycemic control (− 0.69% treatment difference in HbA1c) and in weight loss (− 3.83 kg treatment difference). Besides these, semaglutide has also shown benefits in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) outcomes, which have not been established in other GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide.

Improving Cardiometabolic Health by Obesity Pharmacotherapies

For a person with obesity, it is very difficult to achieve and maintain a normal body weight with behavior interventions. Bariatric surgery is not always suitable, indicated, or wanted by the patients. Therefore, it seems to be more realistic to convert cardiometabolically unhealthy obesity into MHO. Significant health improvements can already be achieved by a moderate 3–10% weight loss. If a clinically meaningful weight loss cannot be reached by a combination of energy deficit nutrition, increased physical activity, and behavior support, the next step of escalation would be adding pharmacotherapies for weight management. Currently, there are 5 medications approved for chronic weight management in the U.S. 3 of which have been approved in the European Union (Table 2). These pharmacotherapies cause weight loss through different modes of action, with varying efficacy (Table 2) and specific side-effects, which both the prescriber and the patient should be aware of. A more detailed description of specific weight management medications would be beyond the scope of this short review and can be found elsewhere. In general, obesity pharmacotherapies should be used to reinforce patients to change eating behaviors and support nonpharmacological treatment strategies, but they may also contribute tothe improvement of several aspects of cardiometabolic health (Table 2). In addition to weight loss, the majority of obesity pharmacotherapies have been shown to improve at least some parameters defining metabolic health (Table 2). For example, orlistat treatment over 4 years and liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment over 3 years have been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. Importantly, there is still an unmet need to develop more efficacious and safe pharmcotherapies against obesity. During the last ~10 years, a generation of molecules with agonism at the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor have emerged as promising tools in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. With liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide there are GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are either already approved (liraglutide) or in clinical development (semaglutide), for weight management in obesity that demonstrated a cardiovascular benefit for patients with type 2 diabetes in the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) and Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN6) trials. In a recent weight-loss intervention, doses of more than 0.2 mg of semaglutide demonstrated significantly superior weight-loss compared to liraglutide.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^113GwpK6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Real‐world evidence supports the effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss, but the observed weight reduction in therapy initiators overall tends to be lower than in randomised controlled trials, likely due to lower adherence, persistence and the use of reduced doses in clinical practice. Semaglutide and tirzepatide starters appear to achieve the greatest weight loss, with emerging data suggesting that real‐world outcomes may approach those seen in trials among highly adherent patients. Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances, frequently lead to discontinuation, but otherwise, real‐world data provide little evidence for severe adverse effects. Adverse events in the obesity population and, in particular, long‐term safety outcomes remain insufficiently studied. Future research should focus on comparative effectiveness, long‐term clinical impacts, treatment discontinuation effects and cost‐effectiveness to optimise the real‐world application of these therapies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for refining clinical guidelines, ensuring equitable access and guiding future pharmacological strategies for obesity management.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^117Uf9Da]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Behavioral intervention incorporating modifications in diet and physical activity remains the foundation of treatment for overweight and obesity. However, because behavioral intervention is often not associated with clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss, pharmacotherapy is recommended as an additional tool for long-term weight management in people with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg m –2, or at least 27 kg m –2 in those with weight-related comorbidities.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (oral semaglutide and subcutaneous semaglutide) and for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (subcutaneous semaglutide only) –. At a dose of 2.4 mg once-weekly, subcutaneous semaglutide was approved in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada for weight management in adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg m –2 with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m⁻²) –, based on results from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) clinical trial program. In the STEP 1 and 3 trials in participants without type 2 diabetes, average placebo-subtracted weight losses of 12.4% and 10.3%, respectively, were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 (refs.).

Previous studies in the STEP trial program have been limited to treatment durations of up to 68 weeks –. The 2-year STEP 5 study reported herein was conducted to evaluate the long-term effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo, as an adjunct to behavioral intervention, on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m –2), or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg m⁻²) and at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes (Extended Data Fig. 1). This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial represents the longest study of the use of semaglutide for weight management to date. Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 104 and achievement of weight loss of at least 5% of baseline weight at week 104.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^114W5CRM]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Study Variables

The primary outcome measures in this study were (1) percentage of weight change at 1 year following initiation of injectable semaglutide or liraglutide treatment and (2) categorical weight loss of 10% or greater at 1 year, given that sustained weight loss of 10% or more in patients with obesity has a major beneficial impact on obesity-related comorbidities. Baseline BMI was calculated using the weight data captured on the index date or, if not available, within 6 months before the index date. Body weight at 1 year was determined by the first weight measurement captured between 12 and 18 months. If no weight measurement was available after 12 months, the last weight measurement less than 3 months before the 1-year follow-up time was carried forward; otherwise, the 1-year weight measurement was considered missing. We also captured available weight data from baseline through 18 months (in 1-month increments) to compare the weight trajectories by GLP-1 RA agent. The end of the follow-up period for outcome ascertainment was July 28, 2023.

### Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for weight loss among adults without diabetes: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113Us47E]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual or triple co-agonists for weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists for the treatment of obesity among adults without diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 4 October 2024.

Study Selection

Placebo-controlled RCTs in otherwise healthy participants with overweight or obesity.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was change in relative or absolute body weight from baseline to maximum on-treatment follow-up. Safety outcomes included death, serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events (AEs), and gastrointestinal AEs.

Data Synthesis

A total of 26 RCTs comprising 15491 participants (72% female; mean body mass index, 30 to 41 kg/m²; mean age, 34 to 57 years) and 12 agents (3 commercially available agents [liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide] and 9 premarket agents for long-term weight management) were included. Treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks (median, 43 weeks). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide (15 mg once weekly) resulted in weight loss of up to 17.8% (95% CI, 16.3% to 19.3%) after 72 weeks of therapy; semaglutide (2.4 mg once weekly), up to 13.9% (CI, 11.0% to 16.7%) after 68 weeks; and liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily), up to 5.8% (CI, 3.6% to 8.0%) after 26 weeks. Retatrutide (12 mg once weekly) produced greater weight loss of up to 22.1% (CI, 19.3% to 24.9%) after 48 weeks; other novel single and combination GLP-1 agents were also efficacious to varying degrees. Although AEs were frequent (GLP-1 RA vs. placebo: 80% to 97% vs. 63% to 100%), the majority were gastrointestinal-related (47% to 84% vs. 13% to 63%, respectively), most commonly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. AEs requiring treatment discontinuation (0% to 26% vs. 0% to 9%, respectively) and SAEs (0% to 10% vs. 0% to 12%, respectively) were rare.

Limitations

No head-to-head RCTs were available. Heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists are efficacious for weight loss, with reported safety concerns predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, when used among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^112X91Hj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended for glycaemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Oral semaglutide, the first oral GLP-1RA, has recently been approved for clinical use, based on the results of the randomized, Phase 3a Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) clinical trials. The PIONEER programme tested oral semaglutide in patients with T2D of duration ranging from 3.5 to 15years, from monotherapy through to insulin add-on, in global populations and two trials dedicated to Japanese patients. Outcomes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and body weight reduction, plus other relevant efficacy and safety endpoints) were tested against both placebo and active standard-of-care medications. A separate trial evaluated the cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk. Over periods of treatment up to 78weeks, oral semaglutide 7 and 14mg once daily reduced HbA1c and body weight across the spectrum of T2D, and improved other diabetes-related endpoints, such as fasting plasma glucose. Oral semaglutide provided significantly better efficacy than placebo and commonly used glucose-lowering medications from the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) classes, as well as the subcutaneous GLP-1RAs liraglutide and dulaglutide. Oral semaglutide was well tolerated in line with the known safety profile of GLP-1RAs, with transient gastrointestinal events being the most common side effects reported. Cardiovascular safety was demonstrated for oral semaglutide in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk. The results of the PIONEER programme suggest that oral semaglutide is efficacious and well tolerated for glycaemic control of T2D. The availability of oral semaglutide may help to broaden treatment choice and facilitate adoption of earlier GLP-1RA treatment in the paradigm of T2D management.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115CF5qv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, many real‐world studies suggested smaller weight loss (in kg or %) than what has been observed in the RCTs (i.e. up to 6% with liraglutide, 14% with semaglutide and 18% with tirzepatide vs. placebo). Estimated weight loss was highly variable between studies; however, even within the same GLP‐1RA, this was related to differences in user characteristics such as the proportion with T2D and previous use or not of GLP‐1RA at baseline, differences in dosages of the drug, comprehensiveness of the weight management programme, follow‐up time and weight measure used (e.g. self‐reported or other measurements of body weight). The percentage weight reduction over typically 6–12 months of follow‐up thus ranged from 2.2% to 18.5% for liraglutide,4.4% to 19.5% for semaglutide, and 4.8% to 21.2% for tirzepatide. Importantly, the weight‐loss effectiveness of GLP‐1RA was similar to what has been observed in trials when focusing on the subgroup of adherent patients who consistently took their prescribed GLP‐1RA, for example, at 12 months follow‐up, whereas studies reporting results in an 'as‐started' approach found considerably lower effectiveness. Semaglutide and tirzepatide initiators appeared to achieve the greatest weight loss in real life, and weight loss effects were weaker for patients with T2D than for obese people without diabetes, which was also observed in trials. Only two studies of tirzepatide for T2D were identified, and they reported lower weight loss results than in the trials. Both studies included many individuals switching to tirzepatide from other GLP‐1RAs, that is, individuals generally not included in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT‐1 trials, with those switching from semaglutide seemingly experiencing further weight loss on tirzepatide treatment.

4 EFFECTS OF GLP‐1RA FOR WEIGHT LOSS

4.1 Clinical guidelines for‐therapies

Guidelines for the clinical management of people with obesity have generally lagged behind the rapid development of newer pharmacological therapies. Existing guidelines have been reviewed recently by others, for example, Cornier, Yuristaand Gaskin. While newer cardiology guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in 2019and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2021cover weight loss in cardiovascular disease prevention, and the 2020 Canadian clinical practice guideline on obesity in adultsoffers good advice on assessment, prevention and treatment of obesity, these guidelines do not cover the most effective weight loss drugs currently in use, that is, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The newer American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelinesoffer some guidance on the use of liraglutide and semaglutide.

4.2 Clinical effectiveness of‐for weight loss in real‐world populations

Most studies evaluating the real‐world effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss are observational studies of the 'before‐after' type, that is, comparing post‐treatment initiation body weight with pre‐treatment weight in people who all are exposed to the drug of interest. In total, we reviewed 24 studies,(Table 1), most of which were published recently, that is, in 2024.,

### The effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on energy intake, appetite, control of eating, and gastric emptying in adults with obesity [^1175oGQn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a growing global health crisis placing substantial burden on healthcare systems, with excess weight contributing to a range of detrimental effects, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and mortality. 1, 2 Despite the importance of weight loss in improving health outcomes for patients with overweight/obesity, 1, 2 relatively few pharmacotherapies are approved for weight management. 3

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) were initially developed for improvement of glycaemic control in T2D. 4 Following the observation of weight reductions in T2D, 4 GLP‐1RAs were studied in patients with overweight or obesity, 5, 6 and a single agent (liraglutide 3 mg) is currently approved for weight management. 7, 8 While liraglutide provided clinically relevant reductions in body weight of 5.4% relative to placebo in a pivotal study in overweight/obese patients, 6 there remains an unmet need for those patients for whom weight loss ≥ 10% is recommended. 1, 2 Furthermore, other available antiobesity agents fail to achieve ≥ 10% weight loss and some are associated with safety concerns, 3, 9 highlighting the need for effective, well‐tolerated treatments.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114UrjaB]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of 3389 patients with obesity treated with injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide in a regular clinical setting, achieving sustained weight reduction of 10% or more was associated with the GLP-1 RA agent, treatment indication, medication dosage, sex, and persistence with medication coverage. Future research should focus on identifying the reasons for discontinuation of medication use and interventions aimed at improving long-term persistent coverage.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^112e2hLh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8was a head‐to‐head comparison in which participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo, or once‐daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or matching placebo for 68 weeks.

All trials followed the same dose‐escalation regimen. Participants treated with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg were initiated on a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and the dose was escalated every 4 weeks to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg, until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached at week 16. If participants were unable to tolerate the 2.4 mg dose because of adverse events (AEs), lower maintenance doses were permitted if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely. It was recommended that participants made at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose. Diet and physical activity (lifestyle intervention) were recorded daily in a diary or by use of a smartphone application or other tools, reviewed during counselling sessions.

4.1 Estimands used to assess treatment efficacy

In line with regulatory guidance, the STEP trials were designed to report results using two estimands. The treatment policy (primary) estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication, while the secondary trial product estimand modelled treatment effects in all randomly assigned participants, assuming they had remained on treatment for the duration of the trials, and without initiation of rescue medication. The data reported in this review are based on the primary treatment policy estimand, since the statistical analyses were performed using this approach. Results using the two estimands were largely consistent.

### Cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in chronic weight management in Portugal [^112QLZyx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide (Wegovy®) 2.4 mg injection is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), that promotes weight loss via slowing down gastric emptying and thereby reducing hunger and increasing satiety. Approximately 5,000 patients enrolled in five phase 3 trials– the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program. In STEP 1 trial, patients who received semaglutide 2.4 mg had clinically significant weight loss (at least a 5% reduction in weight from baseline level) compared with placebo (weight reduction: 14.9% vs. 2.4% at week 68; P < 0.001), and superior weight loss at 68 weeks when compared with placebo in STEP 2 trial for weight management in patients with overweight or obesity and T2D.

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with D&E compared to D&E alone for the treatment of adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) with one or more weight-related comorbidities, from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS).

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^112KEcdy]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective treatment for obesity; however, because of the complexity and chronicity of obesity, postoperative weight recurrence is common, and adjuvant therapy may be needed. An estimated 1.85 million people completed MBS in the US from 2011 to 2020, which places a growing number of people at risk for weight recurrence. Post-MBS weight recurrence can exacerbate obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which contribute to individual and public health burdens. Integrated post-MBS plans that leverage the primary procedure, lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapies, and any necessary revisional procedures for long-term weight management maximize the potential for long-term remission of obesity and related comorbidities.

Although the evolution of pharmacotherapy provides clinicians with more effective options to treat obesity, inconsistent insurance coverage severely limits access to antiobesity medications (AOMs) in the US. Minority and disadvantaged populations, who are at greatest risk for obesity, face the greatest hurdles to accessing effective obesity treatments.

Treating obesity and post-MBS weight recurrence effectively requires clinicians to be resourceful. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) for treating obesity: liraglutide 3.0 mg daily (approved December 2014) and semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (approved June 2021). Studies have demonstrated the superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly over liraglutide 3.0 mg daily for weight loss in people with obesity; however, no studies, to our knowledge, have examined the use of semaglutide for weight recurrence after MBS. Because of challenges with insurance coverage and medication availability, health care providers may prescribe incretin medications at alternative "off-label" doses, for example, semaglutide at a dose less than 2.4 mg weekly, which is approved for treating obesity.

Key Points

Question

Is treatment with semaglutide associated with weight loss outcomes similar to those seen in results of randomized clinical trials?

Findings

In this cohort study of 175 patients with overweight or obesity, the total body weight loss percentages achieved were 5.9% at 3 months and 10.9% at 6 months.

Meaning

Semaglutide treatment in a regular clinical setting was associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials, which suggests its applicability for treating patients with overweight or obesity.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^112LFnv7]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) weight recurrence.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 207 adults with post-MBS weight recurrence treated with semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly (n = 115) or liraglutide 3.0 mg daily (n = 92) at an academic center from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2021, was conducted. The primary end point was percentage body weight change at 12 months of treatment with regimens containing semaglutide or liraglutide.

Results

The mean sample age was 55.2years; mean BMI was 40.4 kg/m 2; 89.9% were female; and 50% completed sleeve gastrectomy, 29% completed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 21% completed adjustable gastric banding. Least-squares mean weight change at 12 months was -12.92% versus -8.77% in the semaglutide and liraglutide groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The adjusted odds ratios were 2.34 (95% CI: 1.28–4.29) for ≥ 10% weight loss and 2.55 (95% CI: 1.22–5.36) for ≥ 15% weight loss over 12 months in the semaglutide group versus liraglutide group, respectively. Weight-loss efficacy of semaglutide (vs. liraglutide) did not differ by subgroups explored, including age, sex, and MBS procedure.

Conclusions

These results show that treatment regimens including semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly lead to superior weight loss compared with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily for treating post-MBS weight recurrence, regardless of procedure type or the magnitude of weight recurrence.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1154aeeq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Assessing efficacy and safety of weight management pharmacotherapy — upon initiating medications for obesity, assess their effectiveness and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months and at least quarterly thereafter; those who achieve sufficient early weight loss upon starting a chronic weight management medication (typically defined as > 5% weight loss after 3 months of use) should continue the medication long-term, whereas when early weight loss results are modest (typically < 5% weight loss after 3 months of use), the benefits of ongoing treatment need to be examined in the context of the glycemic response, alternative options, tolerance, and burden. Ongoing monitoring of the achievement and maintenance of weight management goals is recommended, and sudden discontinuation of semaglutide and tirzepatide results in regain of one-half to two-thirds of the weight loss within 1 year. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the best long-term approach (continuing on the lowest effective dose, using intermittent therapy, or stopping medication followed by close weight monitoring), and for those not reaching or maintaining goals, avoid treatment inertia by reevaluating therapies and intensifying with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, structured lifestyle programs).

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111.5 kg, and BMI 39.3 kg/m². Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2.3% for the placebo group versus -6.0% (0.05 mg), -8.6% (0.1 mg), -11.6% (0.2 mg), -11.2% (0.3 mg), and -13.8% (0.4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0.0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0.0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0.2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13.8% to -11.2% vs -7.8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0.1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0.0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Semaglutide induces weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline BMI or gastrointestinal adverse events in the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials [^116kW2QW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The SUSTAIN 1 to 5 clinical trials previously demonstrated the superiority of semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg once‐weekly over placebo and active comparators in inducing weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 The post hoc analysis presented here further establishes the consistency of semaglutide‐induced weight loss, which was significantly greater than placebo (both as monotherapy and as an add‐on to basal insulin), sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine, across all BMI subgroups. This is mirrored by similar analyses carried out on trials with other GLP‐1RAs. In trials with liraglutide (global population), exenatide and dulaglutide (Asian populations), weight loss over comparator remained significant across BMI subgroups. 25, 26, 27 In the DURATION 6 trial, subjects treated with exenatide ER and liraglutide consistently experienced weight loss regardless of whether their baseline BMI was < 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m 2. 27 An analysis of 6 trials in the AWARD clinical programme comparing dulaglutide with a range of comparators found that weight loss did not vary with baseline BMI. 28

The magnitude of weight loss achieved with both semaglutide doses (0.5 mg, 3.5 to 4.3 kg; 1.0 mg, 4.5 to 6.4 kg) is numerically higher than that reported previously in the clinical trials of other long‐acting GLP‐1RAs (−0.4 to +2.5 kg). 29, 30, 31, 32 Although comparisons of results between trials should be made with caution, a number of head‐to‐head trials between GLP‐1RAs have been completed that can place the results from the SUSTAIN programme in further perspective. In direct comparisons of GLP1‐RAs, weight loss was significantly greater with liraglutide 1.8 mg than exenatide ER, albiglutide, dulaglutide and lixisenatide, and similar to that of exenatide twice‐daily. 11, 12 While a phase 3 trial comparing semaglutide and liraglutide is not currently available, phase 2 results suggest that semaglutide treatment may be expected to show equivalent or greater weight loss. 33

### Estimating and reporting treatment effects in clinical trials for weight management: using estimands to interpret effects of intercurrent events and missing data [^1128CNW9]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

In line with the EMA and FDA regulatory guidelines, ongoing and newly initiated weight management trials will be required to report results using estimands. The SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity-Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes) phase 3b trials investigating efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle advice for weight management have recently been published with two estimands. Similarly, clinical trial programs for weight management drugs in development, such as the semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity) trial program are planned to report results utilizing estimands.

In this review, we discuss how intercurrent events can affect the estimation and interpretation/quantification of a treatment effect in weight management trials; how approaches for handling missing data have evolved over the last decade; and implications for interpreting clinical data from weight management RCTs. We examine these issues using the SCALE phase 3a clinical trial program as an example and address how the use of estimands may help provide greater transparency in clinical trial reporting.

### Efficacy of 12 months therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide on weight regain after bariatric surgery: a real-world retrospective observational study [^115uRfPb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 40 patients with postbariatric weight regain included in this retrospective observational study that continued GLP1-RAs for 12 months almost entirely lost the previously regained weight (99.3 [61.0, 135.4]%), with greater weight reduction observed among patients treated with semaglutide than in those treated with liraglutide. Although the retrospective nature of the study does not allow us to draw firm conclusions, considering the number of patients who were initiated on GLP1-RAs during the observed time window, our data suggest that this superb response may be expected in at least 45% of treated patients (40/87). In line with previous findings, adverse events were relatively rare and all were mild and transient.

The weight loss of 11.2% observed in the current study in 40 patients, 22.5% of whom had T2D, is in line with previous studies in postbariatric patients with weight regain given GLP1-RA therapy for 12 months. In Gazda et al. a weight loss of 8.9% was obtained with all available GLP1-RA-based therapies without further specification in 33 patients, of whom an unknown proportion had T2D. Lautenbach et al. reported weight loss of 14.7% with semaglutide in 29 patients without T2D, and Murvelashvili et al. reported weight loss of 8.8% with liraglutide and 12.9% with semaglutide in a total of 207 patients, 7.7% of whom had T2D. The proportion of patients with T2D is relevant, since weight loss following GLP1-RA therapy is usually greater in patients without T2D. Since in our study, patients with T2D were more likely to receive semaglutide, this might have underestimated the magnitude of the superior weight loss effect observed as compared to liraglutide. Furthermore, the observed superior effect of semaglutide over liraglutide is in line with a recent meta-analysis based on randomized clinical studies and is further supported by the results of Murvelashvili et al. That semaglutide was used off-label at a lower dose approved for diabetes management implies that the observed beneficial effects in terms of weight reduction are likely underestimating the expected effect of the higher 2.4 mg dose that is currently available for weight maintenance.

Liraglutide 3 mg

Liraglutide 3 mg once-daily injection is approved as an AOM. The double-blind 56-week SCALE trial of 3,731 people without T2DM showed that liraglutide 3 mg induced a superior weight reduction of − 8% as compared to − 2.6% with placebo in 56 weeks. While the weight loss benefits of liraglutide have been shown to be maintained for 2 years, patients are also able to tolerate the therapy, with only mild- to moderate-intensity adverse drug reactions (ADRs) relating to the GIT encountered. A total of five randomized, placebo‐controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide for weight management. Liraglutide 3 mg as an adjunct to diet and physical activity consistently resulted in a 4–6 kg weight loss, with higher proportions of patients achieving weight losses of at least 5 and 10% compared with placebo. The comparative data suggest that greater weight loss is achieved with liraglutide compared to orlistat or lorcaserin, but slightly lower weight loss than achieved with phentermine/topiramate.

Oral Semaglutide 50 mg

Oral semaglutide at a high dose of 50 mg will be examined in a phase 3a trial in the year 2021. With approximately 1000 obese or overweight subjects with comorbidities included in a 68-week-long study, this trial is designed to compare oral semaglutide and placebo in terms of efficacy and safety.

Danuglipron

Apart from its use in the management of T2DM, danuglipron has also been tested in obese and high-BMI patients for its weight loss benefits.

GLP-1 Co-formulations for the Treatment of Obesity

To achieve better weight-loss efficacy and mitigation of ADRs, combination therapies are now accepted in the management of obesity. GLP1RAs can be combined with other compounds to target multiple signalling pathways involved in energy balance regulation.

### A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis comparing once-weekly semaglutide with other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving basal insulin [^1117Xpze]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Once-weekly semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is currently available as 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg dose for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, no head-to-head trial investigating once-weekly semaglutide as an add-on to basal insulin vs other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) is available. The aim of this study was to conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide vs other GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on basal insulin.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed to identify all trials of GLP-1 RAs as an add-on to basal insulin in patients with T2D. Data at 24 ± 4 weeks were extracted for efficacy and safety outcomes (feasible for analysis in an NMA), including the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), body weight, and systolic blood pressure, and the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Data were synthesized using a NMA and a Bayesian framework.

Results

In total, eight studies were included across the base-case analyses. The results demonstrate that once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA 1c (-0.88% to -1.39% vs comparators) and weight (-1.49 to -4.69 kg vs comparators) and similar odds of experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea vs all GLP-1 RA comparators. Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg was also equally effective at reducing systolic blood pressure compared with liraglutide 1.8 mg. Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg significantly reduced HbA 1c vs the majority of other GLP-1 RAs, except liraglutide 1.8 mg QD. The odds of experiencing nausea were significantly lower with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg compared with all GLP-1 RA comparators.

Conclusion

Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg as an add-on to basal insulin is likely to be the most efficacious GLP-1 RA for reducing HbA 1c and weight from baseline after 6 months of treatment. The efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide is not associated with a significant increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects vs other GLP-1 RAs.

### A model-based simulation of glycaemic control and body weight when switching from semaglutide to 3.0-and 4.5-mg doses of once-weekly dulaglutide [^1138JLwT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) are a class of antihyperglycaemic medication that stimulate the secretion of insulin in a glucose‐dependent manner and are approved for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Some medications within the class have also been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, GLP‐1 RAs can stimulate weight reduction in patients, mainly because of the effect of slower gastric emptying and increased satiety. Multiple GLP‐1 RAs are available on the market with different dosages and dosing schedules. Several GLP‐1 RAs are administered subcutaneously with a weekly dosing schedule, such as exenatide extended release, dulaglutide, and semaglutide.

Switching between GLP‐1 RAs may be considered if a patient with T2D is not achieving the expected glycaemic target or weight reduction, or for reduction of the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and high cardiovascular risk, to improve adherence, or to reduce the incidence or severity of adverse events.,

Dulaglutide is a once‐weekly (QW) GLP‐1 RA with originally approved doses of 0.75 and 1.5 mg and, subsequently, additional approved doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg, for the treatment of T2D. Several head‐to‐head studies have compared GLP‐1 RA treatment effects; however, there are a lack of data regarding the impact of switching from one GLP‐1 RA to another upon HbA1c target and body weight expectations. A retrospective analysis of 164 patients in the REALISE‐DM study showed that switching from liraglutide or dulaglutide to semaglutide QW reduced HbA1c by 0.65% and body weight by 1.69 kg, on average, after 6 months. Real‐world evidence suggests that dulaglutide increases adherence postswitch compared with liraglutide, exenatide, or semaglutide. An evaluation of glycaemic control and weight effects using a modelling approach concluded that switching from liraglutide, dulaglutide, or exenatide to semaglutide QW could induce further HbA1c and body weight reductions.

In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

Head to head comparison between FDA approved anti-obesity medications effect on weight

A network meta-analysis of RCTs on FDA approved AOM, until 2016, showed that compared to placebo, at 1 year, phentermine/topiramate was associated with the highest total body weight loss of 8.8 (7.4–10.2) kg, while liraglutide and NB had a similar total body weight loss, 5.3 (4.5–6.1) kg for liraglutide and 5.0 (4.0–5.9) kg for NB. The lowest total body weight loss was reported with orlistat of 2.6 (2.2–3.0) kg. On the other hand, liraglutide and NB were associated with the highest risk of discontinuation secondary to adverse events.

Two RCTs compared Liraglutide to Orlistat and Semaglutide, respectively.

A 20-week RCT, followed by a 1-year extension, compared increasing doses of daily Liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg) to placebo or open label Orlistat (120 mg TID). After 1 year, all Liraglutide and placebo groups were switched to Liraglutide 2.4 or 3 mg. At 1 year, total body weight loss was higher with liraglutide compared to placebo and Orlistat, with a difference in the achieved weight of 5.8 (3.7–8.0) kg and 3.8 (1.6–6.0) kg, respectively, favoring liraglutide; at 2 years, total body weight loss remained significantly higher in liraglutide groups (5.3 kg) compared to the orlistat group (2.3 kg) (p < 0.001).

The STEP 8 trial compared semaglutide (2.4 mg weekly) to Liraglutide (3 mg daily) with matching daily and weekly placebo in patients with obesity, mean BMI 37.5 (6.8) kg/m 2. Total body weight loss was higher in Semaglutide compared to Liraglutide, with a mean difference in total body weight loss of 9.4 (6.8–12.0) % at 68 weeks. The adverse events were reported in more than 90% of participants of all groups, and they were mostly related to GI symptoms. Treatment discontinuation secondary to adverse events was higher with Liraglutide (12.6%), compared to Semaglutide and placebo (3.5%).

### Incretin analogs for weight management in adults without diabetes [^1161jCRw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This is a narrative review of incretin analogs and their effect on weight management in adult without diabetes.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials were identified by English language. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched from inception through June 2023 to identify all pertinent trials reporting outcomes on efficacy and safety search using the terms: tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, and obesity.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Selected studies were included if the study population was composed of adults without diabetes being treated by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 agonists for weight management, and weight loss was assessed as a primary outcome.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies involving 3 pharmacotherapies (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) were identified. Efficacy data supporting the use of these agents for weight management were promising when compared to placebo and/or other behavioral therapies. Percent weight loss ranged from 5.7% to 11.8%, 14.9% to 17.4%, and 15% to 20.9% for liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, respectively. Safety data were relatively similar across all trials and identified gastrointestinal adverse effects as most common.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists are preferred for overweight or obese patients by the American Gastroenterological Association. Future guidelines may address tirzepatides' place in therapy as new evidence comes forth. Providers should consider patient-specific factors such as cost, adverse effects, drug interactions, and comorbidities when prescribing these agents and provide education regarding the need for concurrent diet and exercise modifications.

Conclusions

All incretin analogs in this review are superior to placebo when used for weight management in adults without diabetes.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the 3 trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2. Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in participants who took semaglutide than placebo (RR 1:47, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.68); however, the majority of these events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, semaglutide is efficacious for sustained weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.

In summary, in our analysis among adults with obesity or overweight, semaglutide (SQ and oral) and liraglutide were the most efficacious GLP-1 agents to induce weight loss over at least 12 weeks of treatment. This analysis, as well as future studies replicating these findings, may inform clinical practice as well as guidelines and policies with regards to pharmacological treatment of obesity.

### Oral semaglutide 50 mg taken once per day in adults with overweight or obesity (OASIS 1): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^114My6Bv]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the oral glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, semaglutide 50 mg, taken once per day versus placebo for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adults without type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, superiority trial enrolled adults with a BMI of at least 30 kg/m 2, or at least 27 kg/m 2 with bodyweight-related complications and comorbidities, without type 2 diabetes. The trial was done at 50 outpatient clinics in nine countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) via an interactive web-response system to oral semaglutide escalated to 50 mg, or visually matching placebo, once per day for 68 weeks, plus lifestyle intervention. Group assignment was masked for participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes. Coprimary endpoints were the percentage change in bodyweight and whether participants reached a bodyweight reduction of at least 5% at week 68 for oral semaglutide 50 mg versus placebo, assessed regardless of treatment discontinuation or use of other bodyweight-lowering therapies (an intention-to-treat analysis). Safety was assessed in participants who received at least one dose of trial drug. This trial, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05035095), is now complete.

Findings

From Sept 13 to Nov 22, 2021, 709 participants were screened, of whom 667 were randomly assigned to oral semaglutide 50 mg (n = 334) or placebo (n = 333). The estimated mean bodyweight change from baseline to week 68 was -15.1% (SE 0.5) with oral semaglutide 50 mg versus -2.4% (0.5) with placebo (estimated treatment difference -12.7 percentage points, 95% CI -14.2 to -11.3; p < 0.0001). More participants reached bodyweight reductions of at least 5% (269 [85%] of 317 vs 76 [26%] of 295; odds ratio [OR] 12.6, 95% CI 8.5 to 18.7; p < 0.0001), 10% (220 [69%] vs 35 [12%]; OR 14.7, 9.6 to 22.6), 15% (170 [54%] vs 17 [6%]; OR 17.9, 10.4 to 30.7), and 20% (107 [34%] vs 8 [3%]; OR 18.5, 8.8 to 38.9) at week 68 with oral semaglutide 50 mg versus placebo. Adverse events were more frequent with oral semaglutide 50 mg (307 [92%] of 334) than with placebo (285 [86%] of 333). Gastrointestinal adverse events (mostly mild to moderate) were reported in 268 (80%) participants with oral semaglutide 50 mg and 154 (46%) with placebo.

Interpretation

In adults with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide 50 mg once per day led to a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in bodyweight compared with placebo.

Discussion

While early total body weight loss of at least 5% labels patients as responders to AOM, a higher response should be targeted; 5–10% total body weight loss is associated with a reduction in the risk of various metabolic, skeletal, and anatomical complications of obesity, and a total body weight loss > 15% may be needed to result in improvement of CV outcomes, as observed in studies assessing effects of weight loss in response to lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of the currently available weight loss monotherapies is still modest, with the exception of GLP-1 RA, and in particular semaglutide, which in combination with behavioral modification therapy, may achieve more than 15% weight loss. The combination of more than one molecule may be needed to achieve a larger total body weight loss; for instance, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist, led to ∼23% weight loss with the highest dose. New drugs seem thus have a much higher potency and are expected to change the medical weight management landscape in the not-so-distant future. Trials on AOM showed improvement in various metabolic parameters, some of which were of a small magnitude with a limited clinical implication. Furthermore, whether this effect has been driven solely by total body weight loss, rather than a direct effect of the drug per se, and whether it differs between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals with obesity, has been poorly investigated. While some available data showed improvement in liver steatosis with GLP1-RA, there is no evidence of reduction in liver fibrosis with any AOM, a parameter that requires longer term studies to show benefit. To-date, data on the effect of AOM on CV outcomes are still lacking. However, indirect evidence from trials in patients with DM is promising. The LEADER trial compared liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) to placebo in patients with DM on a composite CV outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct and non-fatal stroke). After a median follow up of 3.8 years, there was a 13% relative risk reduction in the composite CV outcomes and 22% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death, in liraglutide group, compared to placebo. In a similar study design in patients with DM, semaglutide showed a 26% relative risk reduction the composite CV outcome, compared to placebo, while there was no difference in CV death. Interestingly, new findings suggest a potential neuroprotective effect of GLP-1 agonist, with a reduction of the risk of dementia and age-related cognitive decline, associated with diabetes and obesity; such a promising effect needs to be demonstrated in large prospective studies, extending over several years to decades.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1128h29W]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. This paper reviews data on the mechanism of action, weight-loss and cardiometabolic efficacy, and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for obesity. Semaglutide has demonstrated the largest weight loss of any obesity medication to date with reductions of approximately 15% of initial weight at 68 weeks, accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular risks factors and physical functioning. The approval of this medication provides patients with greater options for weight management.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^117EALb9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have emerged as key agents for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized controlled trials. While still limited, real‐world studies on GLP‐1RA use in populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review discusses contemporary real‐world evidence demonstrating the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently approved GLP‐1RA‐based weight‐loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. Real‐world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP‐1RAs (20%–50%) within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP‐1RA users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression and self‐harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real‐world associations of GLP‐1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 areas of particular importance for further research on GLP‐1RA within the real‐world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping GLP‐1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost‐effectiveness for hard clinical outcomes in real‐world settings, including not only cardio‐reno‐metabolic outcomes but also obesity‐induced diseases like neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections.

Plain Language Summary

Recent advancements in weight‐loss medications have sparked a lot of interest. The so‐called GLP‐1 receptor agonist medications (GLP‐1RAs) have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, leading to significant weight loss in patients participating in clinical trials. GLP‐1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications are used and their effectiveness and safety in real‐world settings. In real‐life practice, GLP‐1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly as in trials. Real‐world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with GLP‐1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong real‐world evidence that GLP‐1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. Despite these challenges, when GLP‐1RAs are used effectively and consistently, they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage and prevent weight‐related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still scarce in real‐world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve dosing. It also calls for studies on the long‐term effects of these therapies on various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP‐1RAs are a valuable tool for weight management, their real‐world use requires careful consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of people that need them.

### Pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: available therapies [^114g4EtJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Choices for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have multiplied as our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic defects has evolved. Treatment should target multiple defects in T2DM and follow a patient-centered approach that considers factors beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular risk reduction. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology and the American Diabetes Association recommend an initial approach consisting of lifestyle changes and monotherapy, preferably with metformin. Therapy choices are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, particularly effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost. Balancing management of hyperglycemia with the risk of hypoglycemia and consideration of the effects of pharmacotherapy on weight figure prominently in US-based T2DM recommendations, whereas less emphasis has been placed on the ability of specific medications to affect cardiovascular outcomes. This is likely because, until recently, specific glucose-lowering agents have not been shown to affect cardiorenal outcomes. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, and the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes 6 (SUSTAIN-6) recently showed a reduction in overall cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin, liraglutide, and semaglutide treatment, respectively. Moreover, empagliflozin has become the first glucose-lowering agent indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. Results from cardiovascular outcomes trials have prompted an update to the 2017 American Diabetes Association standards of care, which now recommend consideration of empagliflozin or liraglutide for patients with suboptimally controlled long-standing T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality when added to standard care.

The STEP 8 trial, including 338 patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, is one of the few head-to-head studies in the field of obesity research, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg/week with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and placebo combined with counseling, a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and 150 min/week physical exercise for 68 weeks. Patients treated with semaglutide showed a 15.8% body-weight reduction versus 6.4% for the liraglutide group and 1.9% for the placebo group, with an estimated treatment difference of -9.4% between semaglutide and liraglutide (95% CI −12.0, −6.8; p < 0.001). 38.5% of patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥ 20%, versus 6.0% with liraglutide (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that semaglutide is clinically effective for weight loss at 3 and 6 months for people with overweight or obesity. Although our study lacked the stringent and closely controlled nature of RCTs, we report similar weight loss results within the same time period as in RCTs. Studies with greater sample sizes and longer periods of follow-up are further needed to support the effectiveness of semaglutide.

### An indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg [^111E8AQb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study indirectly compared the effect of two GLP‐1 RAs (semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg) on reducing HbA1c and body weight from baseline in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin therapy.

The primary analysis showed that semaglutide 1.0 mg was significantly more effective than dulaglutide 3.0 mg and comparable with dulaglutide 4.5 mg in reducing HbA1c from baseline. Semaglutide 1.0 mg was also significantly more effective at reducing body weight versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg. No significant difference was shown in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c less than 7.0% for any comparison. All sensitivity analyses supported the findings of the primary analysis.

This is the first comparison of semaglutide 1.0 mg with dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin. With multiple products in the GLP‐1 RA class now available, information regarding their comparative effectiveness has become clinically relevant. Higher HbA1c levels are associated with a greater risk of complications from T2D, with only 26.4% of patients with T2D achieving the target HbA1c of less than 6.5%. Approximately 90% of people with T2D are overweight or have obesity. Diabetes and obesity together increase the risk of a range of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and risk of mortality. Weight loss in patients with T2D has been shown to reduce HbA1c levels and improve cardiovascular risk factors. Weight loss is therefore an important consideration in the treatment of T2D. Hence, there is a need for treatment strategies for reducing body weight, in addition to improving glycaemic control, in patients with T2D. The significantly greater reductions in body weight shown with semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg in this indirect comparison may therefore be a factor to consider for clinicians determining the most appropriate GLP‐1 RA for individual patients. A higher dose of semaglutide (2.0 mg) for the treatment of T2D is currently being investigated in SUSTAIN FORTE.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^117CRXpr]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA guideline recommendation — semaglutide use with lifestyle interventions. In adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications, the AGA suggests using semaglutide 2.4 mg with lifestyle interventions, compared with lifestyle interventions alone. (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^116b8ZdE]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is that these real-world data reflect weight-loss outcomes achieved under circumstances of everyday clinical care in a population seeking treatment for post-MBS weight recurrence. In addition, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to report on the effectiveness of semaglutide for treating post-MBS weight recurrence. It also compares weight loss between the obesity-treatment dose of liraglutide (3.0 mg daily) and the lower diabetes-treatment dose semaglutide (1 mg weekly) in this population. Our analysis of treatments reflects the real-world restrictions in availability and use of medications for weight management. Our data set includes representation across the three most performed MBS procedures with a meaningful duration of follow-up.

Limitations include the retrospective collection of data, which does not allow for assessment of medication adherence, titration schedule, side effects, and reasons for discontinuation. Many patients were treated with other AOMs, and we are unable to assess the efficacy of individual agent-specific doses. However, there were no significant differences in non-GLP-1RA AOMs between groups. Our definition of weight loss at 12 months includes the maximum weight loss at any time (3, 6, 9, or 12 mo) from baseline, which could lead to an overestimation of long-term weight loss by not accounting for weight recurrence on AOM therapy. Although our Supporting Information tables show that there were no differences between the semaglutide and liraglutide groups in the number of non-GLP-1RA AOMs used (Supporting Information Table S1) or specific non-GLP-1RA AOMs used (Supporting Information Table S2), we cannot report on whether these AOMs were used concomitantly or sequentially. Although the patient cohort was diverse in race/ethnicity, which is a strength of this study, these results may not be generalizable because patients received care in a specialized obesity medicine clinic and had insurance coverage or financial means sufficient to access GLP-1RA therapies. In spite of these limitations, this study provides promising evidence for the combination of MBS and AOM therapies for managing obesity as a chronic disease.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^116bhpcm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Because greater weight loss was observed in early head-to-head trials of semaglutide compared with liraglutide, the STEP program involved several RCTs (n = 4988) developed to assess the efficacy and safety for weight management of higher dose semaglutide (2.4 mg/weekly). Results of the 68-week-duration STEP 1 to STEP 4 trials have been recently reported (STEP 1: weight management [WM]; STEP 2: WM in T2D; STEP 3: intensive behavioral therapy; STEP 4: sustained WM; STEP-5 is an ongoing 102-week treatment trial). As anticipated, weight loss was greater than in the SCALE trials. The most impressive is perhaps STEP 4, in which patients with overweight/obesity without T2D, all initially treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly for 20 weeks, were randomized to receive either continued semaglutide or placebo for another 48 weeks. The mean weight loss of volunteers that continued on semaglutide was 7.9% in contrast to a weight regain of 6.9% on placebo. Pooling the STEP 1 to 4 studies together, semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly led to a mean weight loss ranging from -7.9% to -16% (-7.1 to -16.8 kg), whereas with placebo it ranged from +6.9% to -5.7% (+6.1 to -6.2 kg). These results led to the approval on June 4, 2021 of semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly (as Wegovy) for the treatment of obesity. Such results clearly make semaglutide a strong candidate for the use in patients with NAFLD.
