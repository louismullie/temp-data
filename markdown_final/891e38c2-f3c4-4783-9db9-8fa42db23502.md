## Question

GPA vasculitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define GPA and its classification among ANCA-associated vasculitides. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and who gets the disease. Next, I will review the immunopathogenesis, especially PR3-ANCA. After that, I should catalog organ system manifestations, being careful not to overgeneralize. Then, I need to outline a diagnostic approach, including ANCA testing, biopsy, and imaging, and check where seronegative disease fits. Finally, I will examine induction and maintenance therapy, monitoring, pediatric considerations, and special scenarios like ANCA-negative GPA and overlap syndromes, ensuring I reconcile any guideline nuances and correct any inconsistencies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and nomenclature. GPA is an ANCA-associated small- to medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis characterized by granulomatous inflammation, classically involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys, with frequent PR3-ANCA positivity and a pauci-immune pattern on histology; I should confirm that while PR3-ANCA is typical, seronegative cases occur and can be diagnostically challenging, which I will revisit shortly [^112zkv2i] [^111RzJLq].

> Next, I should review epidemiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I initially recalled an incidence around 1 per 100,000 per year in adults. Wait, I should double-check the figures. European data estimate 20–25 per million per year for all AAV, with prevalence around 24–157 per million for GPA specifically, and the peak age of onset is 45–65 years, though disease occurs at any age including children. There is a slight female predominance, and the incidence is far lower in pediatrics, around 0.1 per 100,000 per year, which aligns with large cohorts and contemporary population studies [^115Wb6NA] [^1163J6R9] [^115Cb3Wc].

> I will now examine the immunopathogenesis. Let me think about the PR3–ANCA axis: PR3 is a neutrophil serine protease, and antibodies to PR3 drive neutrophil activation, migration, and endothelial injury in a pauci-immune pattern; this mechanistic link helps explain the clinical predilection for the respiratory tract and kidneys, though I should confirm that tissue eosinophilia would push me toward EGPA rather than GPA, which it does in the 2022 ACR/EULAR classification schema that penalizes eosinophilia in GPA scoring [^116hVt5F].

> Now, I should review clinical manifestations by organ system, being careful to avoid anchoring bias. Classic ENT features include bloody nasal discharge, crusting, congestion, and cartilaginous involvement; otitis media and hearing loss are common, and saddle-nose deformity may occur with chronicity; I should also remember ocular disease, including scleritis, uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and orbital disease, which can be the initial or only presentation in a subset; pulmonary features range from cough and dyspnea to nodular disease and cavitary lesions and can progress to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; renal disease often manifests as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with hematuria and proteinuria; skin involvement includes palpable purpura and occasionally PG-like ulcers; neurologic disease spans peripheral neuropathy and cranial neuropathies, and rare CNS vasculitis can present via dural spread or intracranial vasculitis; cardiac, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal features also occur and should be actively screened when symptoms arise [^113gTB8f] [^1163J6R9] [^115Wb6NA] [^113YGAvo] [^111NwbZu] [^116Z7Srv] [^111Ck89i] [^114F8bGt].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure high-quality PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA testing with antigen-specific assays in anyone with compatible features. c-ANCA/PR3 is more typical of GPA, whereas p-ANCA/MPO predominates in MPA, though patterns can overlap. However, wait, I should verify the role of ANCA in diagnosis — about 10–20% of GPA cases are ANCA-negative, so a negative test does not exclude disease. Biopsy remains the gold standard to confirm vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation when feasible, and I should not delay life-saving immunosuppression while awaiting biopsy in rapidly progressive disease. Chest imaging can show nodules, masses, or cavitation suggestive of GPA. And I should remember the 2022 ACR/EULAR classification uses a points-based system with positive weight for PR3-ANCA, granuloma on biopsy, and upper airway and pulmonary imaging features, while eosinophilia counts against GPA, helping distinguish it from EGPA [^111vG1Pn] [^113DQEAj] [^1177Xp4i] [^116hVt5F] [^111UxmNa].

> Let me consider the initial management by severity, and I should confirm the preferred agents. For organ- or life-threatening disease, I need immediate high-dose glucocorticoids combined with rituximab or cyclophosphamide; rituximab is increasingly favored, especially in relapsing disease or when fertility preservation is a concern; for non-severe disease, methotrexate combined with glucocorticoids is a reasonable alternative, and avacopan can be considered as a steroid-sparing adjunct in appropriate patients; hold on, I should verify steroid strategy — recent guidance supports reduced-dose glucocorticoid regimens for severe disease to lower infection risk while maintaining efficacy; I must not forget that early control is time-critical, so delays in immunosuppression while awaiting biopsy should be avoided in deteriorating patients [^112yfCpN] [^116tUvsp] [^111AMMLY] [^117GUxL9] [^111apmdb] [^1177Xp4i].

> I should now examine maintenance therapy and relapse prevention. Rituximab maintenance, either fixed-interval or tailored to ANCA and B-cell repopulation, reduces relapse compared with azathioprine in severe disease, though late relapses still occur after rituximab cessation; azathioprine or methotrexate are acceptable alternatives when rituximab is unavailable or contraindicated; let me double-check the role of TMP-SMX — routine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis is standard with cyclophosphamide, but I should avoid adding TMP-SMX to other regimens for remission maintenance in GPA; structured clinical assessments, not serial ANCA titers alone, should guide treatment changes in follow-up [^1154H5yQ] [^117T1Ybb] [^114hfQbn] [^117CgDjZ] [^111eqnmf].

> Special populations deserve explicit consideration. In pediatrics, I should confirm classification with Ankara 2008 or the 2022 ACR/EULAR criteria, recognizing both perform reasonably well; children often present with ENT, constitutional, and musculoskeletal symptoms, and renal involvement is common when biopsied; in suspected organ- or life-threatening disease, do not delay treatment for biopsy; severe pulmonary hemorrhage may require ECMO as bridge therapy in addition to immunosuppression and plasmapheresis; I should also remember that some children manifest PG-like ulcers that mimic classic PG and require vasculitis-directed therapy rather than wound-only approaches [^111f9EpU] [^115xcmMD] [^116kF3Af] [^112mVPhD] [^115bD6Uu] [^115bA8sD].

> But wait, what if ANCA is negative or the phenotype is atypical. I should reconsider mimics and ensure tissue diagnosis when feasible, because ANCA-negative GPA does occur and may be underrecognized. Histology showing granulomatous vasculitis can clinch the diagnosis when serology is silent. Likewise, isolated organ presentations such as orbital disease, occlusive retinal vasculitis, pancreatitis, or even dural-based disease warrant vasculitis evaluation when routine explanations fail. And overlap syndromes with EGPA, while rare, are documented and require careful integration of eosinophil counts, ANCA specificity, and histology to guide therapy and prognosis [^111RzJLq] [^113c5oKL] [^113gTB8f] [^115umzJk] [^112sAtFs] [^111Ck89i] [^111RFVgQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal care and safety. Multidisciplinary management at or linked to experienced centers improves outcomes. Patients should undergo regular clinical and laboratory monitoring for years to detect relapse and treatment toxicity. Infection risk, especially with rituximab in older adults, remains substantial and requires vigilance. Shared decision-making should weigh relapse risk against cumulative immunosuppression exposure, and where appropriate, consider extended maintenance or preemptive rituximab strategies in high-risk phenotypes such as PR3-ANCA positivity [^113LCMj7] [^114CF7Um] [^116GS7Yc] [^115omALP] [^112n6jak].

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a **necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis** of small to medium vessels [^1163J6R9], with a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys, and is strongly associated with PR3-ANCA [^112zkv2i]. It presents with sinonasal disease, cough, hemoptysis, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [^112zkv2i]; diagnosis requires clinical features, ANCA testing [^111vG1Pn], imaging, and biopsy [^113DQEAj], and **early immunosuppression is critical** to prevent organ damage [^1177Xp4i]. Induction therapy is with **rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids** [^112yfCpN]; maintenance with rituximab or azathioprine is recommended [^1154H5yQ], and avacopan can reduce glucocorticoid exposure [^111apmdb]. Relapse is common, so long-term monitoring is essential [^114hfQbn].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Incidence and prevalence**: GPA affects 20–25 per million per year in Europe, with a prevalence of 24–157 per million [^1163J6R9] [^112zkv2i].
- **Demographics**: Peak onset is 45–65 years; slight female predominance [^1163J6R9].
- **Genetics**: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR variants increase risk; PR3-ANCA positivity is more common in northern Europeans [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

GPA is a **multisystem disease** with organ-specific features:

| **Organ system** | **Common manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Upper respiratory tract | - Sinonasal disease <br/> - Saddle-nose deformity <br/> - Otitis media <br/> - Hearing loss [^116hVt5F] |
| Lower respiratory tract | - Cough <br/> - Hemoptysis <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Nodules <br/> - Cavitation <br/> - Alveolar hemorrhage [^111UxmNa] |
| Renal | - Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Renal failure [^112H9Ezb] |
| Ocular | - Conjunctivitis <br/> - Scleritis <br/> - Retinal vasculitis <br/> - Vision loss [^113gTB8f] |
| Neurological | - Peripheral neuropathy <br/> - Cranial neuropathies <br/> - CNS vasculitis [^111Ck89i] |
| Cutaneous | - Palpable purpura <br/> - Ulcers <br/> - Papules [^115bA8sD] |
| Constitutional | - Fever <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Fatigue [^notfound] |

---

## Pathogenesis

Immune dysregulation involves **ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation** [^115Wb6NA] and endothelial injury, with granulomatous inflammation causing tissue destruction and fibrosis [^112zkv2i].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

- **ANCA testing**: PR3-ANCA (c-ANCA) is most specific; MPO-ANCA (p-ANCA) may occur [^116hVt5F].
- **Imaging**: Chest CT shows nodules, cavitation, or alveolar hemorrhage; head/neck CT shows sinonasal disease [^111UxmNa] [^116hVt5F].
- **Biopsy**: Granulomatous inflammation with necrotizing vasculitis confirms diagnosis [^113gTB8f].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential** includes microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, infections (TB, fungal), malignancy (lymphoma), and other vasculitides (PAN, GCA) [^114HGihC].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Induction therapy

- **Severe disease**: Rituximab or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids [^112yfCpN]; rituximab preferred in relapsing disease or when cyclophosphamide is contraindicated [^1134iBwb] [^116Hco5j].
- **Non-severe disease**: Methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil with glucocorticoids [^117GUxL9] [^116iJrzu].
- **Glucocorticoid-sparing**: Avacopan can replace part of glucocorticoid regimens [^111apmdb].

---

### Maintenance therapy

Maintenance options include **rituximab** — preferred for relapsing disease or when cyclophosphamide was used — or **azathioprine or methotrexate** as alternatives [^1154H5yQ] [^117T1Ybb]. Duration is typically 18–24 months after remission, individualized to relapse risk [^114hfQbn].

---

## Prognosis and relapse

Mortality is 2–4% annually, with **relapse in 13.7–44% at 18–36 months** [^114hfQbn]; PR3-ANCA positivity, prior relapse, and incomplete remission increase risk [^116BaKxq].

---

## Complications and comorbidities

Complications include **infections** (respiratory, opportunistic), cardiovascular disease, malignancy (especially lymphoma), and chronic kidney disease [^111VxuDz] [^112XKZse].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

Current research includes **complement inhibition** with avacopan to reduce glucocorticoid exposure [^111apmdb], and B-cell targeted strategies such as obinutuzumab and CAR-T trials. Biomarker-guided therapy aims to personalize treatment and reduce toxicity [^112n6jak].

---

GPA is a severe, relapsing vasculitis requiring **early diagnosis and aggressive immunosuppression**; modern therapy with rituximab and avacopan improves outcomes, but long-term monitoring remains essential [^112yfCpN] [^111apmdb].

Introduction

Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAVs) are potentially life-threatening and commonly relapsing diseases in which necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affects small-to-medium vessels. Among AAVs, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, with frequent necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and with ANCA-targeting proteinase 3 (PR3) in most patients with active disease. Remission induction treatment of new-onset organ-threatening or life-threatening AAV usually combines glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

The diagnosis of GPA as opposed to microscopic polyangiitis is associated with a lower probability of achieving complete remission — defined as no evidence of clinical disease activity while not receiving glucocorticoid treatment — and a higher risk of relapse. Similarly, PR3-ANCA positivity as opposed to myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positivity is independently associated with a higher risk of relapse.

Results of randomized clinical trials, showed rituximab's noninferiority to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in severe AAVs, with neither treatment having a specific advantage for GPA in adjusted analyses. However, post hoc analysis of the trial datashowed that rituximab-treated patients with PR3-AAV achieved complete remission at 6 months more frequently than cyclophosphamide-treated patients. Trial limitations included the enrollment of patients with GPA or microscopic polyangiitis, who might need to be studied separately; small sample size owing to the rarity of those AAVs; and highly selected patients with minor comorbidities that precluded generalization. For those reasons, registry data are useful to complement data from randomized clinical trials to investigate the external validity of drugs prescribed in routine practice. Thus, it remains to be established whether rituximab is more effective than cyclophosphamide at specifically achieving GPA remission. The objective of this study was to undertake an emulation target trial using observational data to compare rituximab vs cyclophosphamide efficacies at inducing remission in a large number of unselected patients with GPA.

### Update on maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^116UZevb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a group of rare systemic diseases. The past several years have seen major therapeutic advances in the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The success rate in induction of remission is high, but reducing the high incidence of relapses remains a therapeutic challenge.

Recent Findings

Studies have shown no improvement in relapse rates in GPA and MPA over the past 2 decades. This has prompted a recent focus on therapeutic strategies to maintain remission in these relapsing diseases. Low-dose rituximab (RTX) at fixed intervals has been shown superior to azathioprine for maintenance of remission. Despite this advance, longer follow-up periods have shown late-stage relapses with withdrawal of therapy suggesting a possible need for longer treatment regimens. Evaluation of prognostic indicators is also helpful in stratifying patients who might be more likely to relapse or to respond to a particular therapy.

Summary

Results from recent research have significantly advanced our approach to prevention of relapses in GPA and MPA. Newer maintenance agents have shown benefit in maintenance of remission and relapse-free survival.

Objective

To develop and validate revised classification criteria for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

Methods

Patients with vasculitis or comparator diseases were recruited into an international cohort. The study proceeded in 5 phases: 1) identification of candidate criteria items using consensus methodology, 2) prospective collection of candidate items present at the time of diagnosis, 3) data-driven reduction of the number of candidate items, 4) expert panel review of cases to define the reference diagnosis, and 5) derivation of a points-based risk score for disease classification in a development set using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, with subsequent validation of performance characteristics in an independent set of cases and comparators.

Results

The development set for GPA consisted of 578 cases of GPA and 652 comparators. The validation set consisted of an additional 146 cases of GPA and 161 comparators. From 91 candidate items, regression analysis identified 26 items for GPA, 10 of which were retained. The final criteria and their weights were as follows: bloody nasal discharge, nasal crusting, or sino-nasal congestion (+3); cartilaginous involvement (+2); conductive or sensorineural hearing loss (+1); cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or anti-proteinase 3 ANCA positivity (+5); pulmonary nodules, mass, or cavitation on chest imaging (+2); granuloma or giant cells on biopsy (+2); inflammation or consolidation of the nasal/paranasal sinuses on imaging (+1); pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (+1); perinuclear ANCA or antimyeloperoxidase ANCA positivity (-1); and eosinophil count ≥ 1×10⁹/liter (-4). After excluding mimics of vasculitis, a patient with a diagnosis of small- or medium-vessel vasculitis could be classified as having GPA if the cumulative score was ≥ 5 points. When these criteria were tested in the validation data set, the sensitivity was 93% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 87–96%) and the specificity was 94% (95% CI 89–97%).

Conclusion

The 2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for GPA demonstrate strong performance characteristics and are validated for use in research.

### Bilateral corneoscleritis with retrocorneal plaque as the initial presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^114mt3Zu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, appears to be one of the most severe vasculitis of unknown etiology. It affects small vessels through inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis, including the ear/nose/eyes, lungs, kidneys, and skin. However, it has been reported that it usually takes 3–12 months from the appearance to the diagnosis of GPA, and only 7% of patients with GPA are diagnosed at the first visit. Approximately 30–60% of patients with GPA have ocular invasion, with 46.7% having ocular symptoms as their first presentation. For ophthalmologists, the early detection of GPA is vital for targeted treatment and prevention of impaired vision, especially in cases with localized ophthalmic presentations. However, the early ocular manifestations are not typical, and there is a dearth of publications on the detection of ophthalmic GPA cases, especially in Asian populations.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) initial glucocorticoid approach — either IV pulse glucocorticoids or high-dose oral glucocorticoids may be prescribed as part of initial therapy. There are no trials comparing the efficacy of IV pulse glucocorticoids to high-dose oral glucocorticoids, and higher doses such as pulse glucocorticoids are generally used for organ- or life-threatening disease but may be associated with an increased risk of infection.

### Lung involvement in childhood onset granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113YGAvo]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis with a low incidence in the pediatric population. Lung involvement is a common manifestation in children affected by granulomatosis with polyangiitis, both at disease's onset and during flares. Its severity is variable, ranging from asymptomatic pulmonary lesions to dramatic life-threatening clinical presentations such as diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Several radiologic findings have been described, but the most frequent abnormalities detected are nodular lesions and fixed infiltrates. Interstitial involvement, pleural disease and pulmonary embolism are less common. Histology may show necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis of small arteries and veins of the lung, but since typical features may be patchy, the site for lung biopsy should be carefully chosen with the help of imaging techniques such as computed tomography. Bronchoalveolar lavage is helpful to confirm the diagnosis of alveolar haemorrhage. Pulmonary function tests are frequently altered, showing a reduction in the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, which can be associated with obstructive abnormalities related to airway stenosis. Nodular lung lesions tend to regress with immunosuppressive therapy, but lung disease may also require second line treatments such as plasmapheresis. In cases of massive diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, ventilator support is crucial in the management of the patient.

### The use of ECMO in pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115bD6Uu]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) vasculitis with pulmonary-renal syndrome rarely presents in children and is associated with high mortality rates.

Case Presentation

We present the case of a 13-year-old male with newly diagnosed GPA vasculitis, treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy, plasmapheresis, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroids.

Conclusion

This case presentation demonstrates that ECMO can be used as a life supporting therapy in pediatric patients with pulmonary hemorrhage from ANCA vasculitis in conjunction with other therapies.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115xfWTW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is classically described as presenting with the triad of necrotizing vasculitis, asthma, and eosinophilia. Asthma is nearly universal, and while it is commonly severe and of long duration, it is not necessarily so. Cardiac involvement is relatively common (on the order of 30–50%) and accounts for a significant percentage of the attributable morbidity and mortality of EGPA. Other common target end organs include the skin, peripheral nervous system, pulmonary parenchyma (eosinophilic pneumonia and/or radiographic infiltrates), sinuses, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. Approximately one-half to three-quarters of patients will be either ANCA (primarily p-ANCA) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive. Limited presentations of EGPA may occur as well.

Overlap syndrome was postulated in 1954 by Godman and Churg, who described a patient with Wegener granulomatosis and eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. Polyangiitis overlap syndrome, previously published by Leavitt and Fauci, is defined as systemic vasculitis that does not fit precisely into a single category of classical vasculitis or overlaps more than one subtype of vasculitis. Several polyangiitis overlap syndromes have been identified, however, to our knowledge, there are only several case reports of an overlap syndrome involving both GPA and EGPA.

We conducted a PUBMED literature review using key words 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Wegener's', 'GPA', 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Churg-Strauss', 'EGPA', 'overlap syndrome' 'Wegener's with eosinophilia' and 'GPA with eosinophilia' in English only journals from 1986 to 2017. Relevant case reports and review articles were found that described cases of overlap syndromes of GPA and EGPA. In this manuscript we report a unique case of GPA/EGPA overlap syndrome and place this case in the context of the other cases that have been previously described.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting as pancreatic disease [^112sAtFs]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare necrotising small vessel vasculitis typically associated with oronasal, pulmonary and renal manifestations. Pancreatic disease is an exceedingly rare initial presentation and is associated with delayed diagnosis and rapid progression. We discuss a 66-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain, elevated lipase and radiographic evidence of focal pancreatitis. She had no relevant medical history and no lithiasis seen on imaging. Pertinent findings include strawberry gingivitis, positive proteinase-antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (98% specificity) and focal nodular parenchymal lung lesions on CT chest-all of which are consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. She was promptly started on high-dose steroids which resulted in significant clinical and biochemical improvement. Cyclophosphamide was added once biopsy confirmed the absence of malignancy. In order to optimise the clinical outcomes of GPA, physicians must keep a wide differential and high index of suspicion in the setting of unexplained pancreatitis with systemic features.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms as first remarkable signs of ANCA-associated granulomatosis with polyangiitis: a case report and reviews [^114F8bGt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic vasculitis can produce a wide variety of clinical manifestations depending on the localization of the affected vessels, and often recognized only when severe conditions and rapid progression are present.

Systemic vasculitis is classified based on the size of the inflamed vessels, as large-vessel vasculitis, medium-vessel vasculitis, small-vessel vasculitis and variable-vessel vasculitis. Small-vessel vasculitis can be further divided into immune complex-mediated and ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a necrotizing vasculitis with a few or no immune deposits in vessel walls (called pauci-immune), and usually associated with circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs), however ANCA positivity is not mandatory. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, there are three types of ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, Wegener's granulomatosis) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss syndrome). Renal manifestations are common in MPA and GPA, while symptoms of the lung and respiratory tract are more frequent in EGPA and GPA. In GPA, ears, nose and throat are usually affected. Cutaneous, musculoskeletal, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations may be also present but usually not characteristic.

Because of the wide variety of the symptoms, ANCA-associated vasculitis is challenging to be recognized even for experienced physicians. Delay of the adequate immunosuppressive therapy can accelerate the progression of the disease. Here we present the case of a young male patient with ANCA-associated vasculitis, where the first remarkable signs of the disease were gastrointestinal symptoms. The unusual manifestation led to a delayed diagnosis and therapy, which could contribute to a life-threatening complication. There are previous reports about GI symptoms of the disease, presented the cases as very rare entities. Based on our experience from a nephrology department, it is still very important to emphasise these unusual manifestations of ANCA-associated vasculitis, because they are not as rare as thought. Recognizing the disease in early stage can save lives.

What is ANCA associated vasculitis?

ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune small vessel vasculitides that can present at any age and affect 20–25 people per million per year in Europe. A typical GP practice with 8000 patients can expect to see one new case approximately every five years.

AAV diseases include microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, previously "Wegener's granulomatosis"), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, previously "Churg-Strauss syndrome"). The conditions are characterised by formation of granulomas and inflammation of small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Inflamed vessels may rupture (for example, causing alveolar haemorrhage or a purpuric rash) or become occluded (for example, causing segmental glomerular infarction), giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response, end organ microvascular injury, or the mass effect of granulomas.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulceration as a presenting feature of pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115bA8sD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a form of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis. GPA affects small to medium-sized vessels and involves most commonly the kidneys and respiratory tract. Skin involvement has been reported in 36–50% of children with GPA and is the initial presenting symptom in 7.7%. Palpable purpura and acneiform papules are most commonly seen. Rarely, patients with GPA develop pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)-like ulcerations. Very few cases of this dermatologic manifestation have been reported among GPA patients and, more specifically, in pediatric GPA patients. Early recognition of this rare entity and appropriate diagnostic work-up for GPA are essential in order to reduce morbidity and mortality by facilitating disease-specific treatment.

We describe three new pediatric cases initially diagnosed with PG who were later diagnosed with childhood-onset GPA. We also review four previously reported cases in the literature.

### Vasculitis with granulomatosis: an atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^111iBXnW]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GCA rarely presents as cutaneous manifestations. Our case highlights a unique presentation of GCA, with a few scattered indurated erythematous-to-violaceous plaques on the upper extremities, torso, and frontal aspect of the scalp. The cutaneous lesions were inflammatory, with vasculitis of medium-sized vessels.

The diagnosis of GCA can be challenging, particularly when patients present with atypical symptoms. If high-quality imaging is accessible, the European League Against Rheumatism prefers that high-quality imaging be performed early in the course of suspected GCA over temporal artery biopsy because of reduced morbidity, increased specificity, prompter results, and decreased rates of false-negative results.

In our case, cutaneous biopsy raised a concern for GCA and lead to imaging being performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. The typical histologic findings of GCA include a granulomatous infiltrate centered at the inner media of arteries comprising prominent giant cells, leading to marked elastic layer fragmentation. However, giant cells may be absent, with the only histologic finding being granulomatous involvement limited to the vessel wall. The latter is commonly referred to as vasculitis with granulomatosis based on the following pathologic differential diagnosis: polyangiitis; eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; natural killer T-cell lymphoma; lymphomatoid granulomatosis; GCA; Takayasu arteritis (TA); drug-induced, inflammatory bowel disease; paraneoplastic syndrome; tuberculosis; tertiary syphilis; and previous herpetic infections. Some of these entities were easily dismissed based our patient's clinical presentation. Her unremarkable workup for infectious and autoimmune diseases in combination with the PET-CT findings and her response to steroids was consistent with a large-vessel vasculitis.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2022 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV): part 2-treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and diagnosis and general management of AAV [^111eva15]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2016 update of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV)provided combined treatment recommendations to be applied for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) as well as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), usually based on higher levels of evidence for GPA and MPA, as compared with EGPA. Recent randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) now provide data supporting more specific treatment strategies in EGPA and a separation of the treatment approaches of EGPA and other AAVs.

Furthermore, the evidence, on which the recommendations for diagnostic procedures in AAV were made, requires updating in the context of the results of an international collaborative effort of the European Vasculitis Society comparing different methods of ANCA testing, that recently led to an update of the international consensus for testing of ANCA. In more recent EULAR recommendations, statements on 'overarching principles' where made that contained aspects of general management of the diseases.

We conducted three systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to inform the 2022 Update of the EULAR recommendations for AAV: on (1) treatment of AAV (of which EGPA is covered in this article), (2) diagnostic testing and follow-up procedures and (3) general management of AAV.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterised by systemic necrotising vasculitis of small arteries and veins with multitude of organ involvement, with the most common being the upper and lower respiratory tract and renal system. Gastrointestinal involvement is a rare late manifestation with a high mortality rate and usually results in intestinal perforation. Our patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to jejunal artery vasculitis. Gastrointestinal bleeding as initial presentation of GPA is very rarely documented. CT mesenteric angiogram is helpful for the localisation of bleed in these cases. In case of refractory bleeding, surgical excision is required.

### Circumferential eschar-covered necrotic leg ulcers in a case of granulomatous vasculitis: looking beyond ANCA serology [^116Z7Srv]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cutaneous vasculitis, either as a single organ or part of systemic vasculitis, can take various forms. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the respiratory tract and vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized blood vessels. Skin-limited GPA, an uncommon presentation, poses diagnostic challenges and may result in delayed diagnosis. We describe a 32-year-old man with painful ulcers and black eschars on both lower limbs, evolving from purpura. Despite lacking typical anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and systemic involvement, histopathology revealed granulomatous vasculitis. Treatment with prednisolone and methotrexate led to complete symptom resolution within 8 months. Skin-limited GPA, often without anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity, warrants clinical suspicion, early intervention, and increased awareness to enhance patient outcomes.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^111L7vtA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory tract. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is also a systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis, but EGPA is characterized by eosinophilic as well as granulomatous inflammation and is more commonly associated with asthma and eosinophilia.

Polyangiitis overlap syndrome is defined as systemic vasculitis that does not fit precisely into a single category of classical vasculitis classification and/or overlaps with more than one category. Several polyangiitis overlap syndromes have been identified, however, there are very few case reports of an overlap syndrome involving both GPA and EGPA in the medical literature.

Case presentation

We conducted a PUBMED literature review using key words 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Wegener's', 'GPA', 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Churg-Strauss', 'EGPA', 'overlap syndrome', 'Wegener's with eosinophilia', and 'GPA with eosinophilia' in English only journals from 1986 to 2017. Relevant case reports and review articles of overlap syndromes of GPA and EGPA were identified. We aim to report a unique case of GPA and EGPA overlap syndrome and review the cases that have been previously described.

Between 1986 and 2017, we identified 15 cases that represent an overlap syndrome with compelling features of both GPA and EGPA. Patients ranged in age between 21 and 78. Of those whose gender was identified, 80% of the patients were female. All cases described involved the lungs, 60% reported sinus involvement, and more than 50% displayed renal involvement. An overwhelming majority of patients were positive for c-ANCA and demonstrated eosinophilia (peripheral blood or tissue eosinophilia). A preponderance of the cases described were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with an immunosuppressive/cytotoxic agents.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, there have been very few cases reported of an overlap syndrome of GPA and EGPA. Identification of patients with a polyangiitis overlap syndrome of GPA and EGPA is imperative as prognosis, longitudinal management and treatment modalities may differ between these entities.

### What does the future hold for clinical studies in vasculitis? [^111TJkXZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The era prior to 1990 was a time of careful observation of disease presentation, course, outcomes and meticulous pathology studies. These mainly single-centre studies introduced new life-saving therapies for drugs still used effectively today. In the 1970–1980s, cyclophosphamide (CyP) added to glucocorticosteroids (GCS) was shown to be life-saving. The trade-off was often severe adverse events. Some forms of vasculitis were found not as ominous as thought initially. Some could be treated with safer drugs [e.g. methotrexate (MTX)]. However, whether mild or severe, patients were not cured. From 1990 to the present large collaborative networks have provided studies were not possible heretofore. Randomized controlled trials captured and manipulated vast amounts of data, banked biological specimens and shared these resources and intellectual capital, moving the field forward at an extraordinary pace. We now know that even for severe forms of granulomatosis and polyangiitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Wegener's granulomatosus (WG)], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), we do not need to use CyP for extended periods. We have learned recently that rituximab is as effective as CyP for severe WG and MPA. We should never again see the permanent toxicities born from years of chronic CyP use. However, short courses of CyP remain useful and can be life-saving. Step-down therapy from CyP is now a standard of care, perhaps to be replaced by rituximab in the future. If one accepts the premise that there are few cures at present for idiopathic large- and small-vessel vasculitis, we will serve our patients well if we can determine the most effective initial therapy that leads to a maintenance strategy for remission with least risk. Ultimately, we wish to identify causes of vasculitis so they can be used as a wedge to secure cures. Unmet needs and strategies are as follows: (1) to increase the numbers of vasculitis-trained physicians; (2) to define risk-benefit formulae for chronic maintenance therapy versus discontinuation of treatment after remission; (3) to define risk- and cost-benefit formulae for laboratory monitoring; (4) large-scale studies with longer follow-up that explore inhibition of interleukin-5 in CSS; (5) to explore the value of anti-interferon-γ for GCA, Takayasu's and other granulomatous vasculitides; and (6) identification of aetiological factors: cures will probably be linked to knowledge of the antigen driving the disease, plus vulnerabilities of the patient that prepare them to develop an illness phenotype. Improved outcomes using anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents do not rule out infection as a driver for autoimmunity. Techniques that can facilitate pathogen discovery have never been more sophisticated.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^112zkv2i]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAV) — granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) — affect small- and medium-sized vessels with multisystem organ involvement and show distinct clinicopathologic and epidemiologic features. GPA is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, is most commonly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3), and in European populations has a prevalence ranging from 24 to 157 cases per million. MPA is characterized by vasculitis without granulomatous inflammation with rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage, is most commonly associated with perinuclear ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase, and has a prevalence that ranges from 0.6 to 6 cases per million in European countries and 68 cases per million in Japan. EGPA shows eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation with asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and peripheral neuropathy, with only 40% of patients producing detectable ANCA and European prevalence estimated at 3 to 38 cases per million. Prior to the use of alkylating agents, survival of patients with GPA was ~5 months; although current regimens have reversed this poor prognosis, treatments are still associated with toxicity. This guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment and management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA and was developed considering the experience with and availability of treatment and diagnostic options in the US.

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^114B6fg9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Why is it missed?

Diagnosis of AAV is often delayed or missed because the condition has virtually no pathognomonic features, and most of the presenting symptoms are either general — and thus may be misdiagnosed as another systemic disease — or more specific but attributed to more common diseases such as uncomplicated sinusitis, asthma, or scleritis. For example, EGPA may present with shortness of breath and wheeze and is often initially misdiagnosed as refractory or frequently relapsing asthma. People with predominant myalgia may be misdiagnosed as having polymyalgia rheumatica and — because corticosteroid treatment partially treats AAV — correct diagnosis is delayed until the steroid dose is weaned and other symptoms emerge. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis with cavitating lung lesions can be misdiagnosed as lung cancer.

Diagnosis can also be delayed or missed when symptoms in disparate organs are not recognised as manifestations of a single disease. A patient may attend separate clinics: ear, nose, and throat (for nasal crusting), ophthalmology (for scleritis), and neurology (for peripheral neuropathy) without anybody "joining the dots" between these symptoms. Indeed, a UK case-control study found that patients had frequent healthcare encounters in the months before a new diagnosis of GPA, with nearly 20% of patients attending two or more specialist clinic appointments in the year before diagnosis (compared to ~5% of controls).

### Treatment guidelines in vasculitis [^116edbox]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The vasculitides encompass a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the blood vessels with severe consequences including tissue ischemia, structural abnormalities, such as aneurysms/dissections, and end organ damage. The different forms are commonly classified based on the size of the blood vessel involved as large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitis. The American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation recently published guidelines on the management of several forms of primary systemic vasculitides. In this review, the recommendations for giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are discussed. We highlight the key recommendations, aspects where they diverge from other published guidelines, controversies, and areas of uncertainty.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting as occlusive retinal vasculitis [^115umzJk]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We discuss an unusual case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) presenting as anterior uveitis with occlusive retinal vasculitis.

Methods

A case report is presented.

Results

A 60-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune disease presented to the retina clinic with red eyes and blurry vision in both eyes. An examination showed anterior uveitis with retinal vasculitis, and topical steroids were started in both eyes. One month later, the patient's vision worsened and an optical coherence tomography scan showed new central cystoid macular edema in the left eye. An antivascular endothelial growth factor injection was given. The next day, her vision was "black" in the left eye and a fundus examination showed global ischemia. A comprehensive uveitis workup was positive for cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody. A diagnosis of GPA was confirmed with a renal biopsy.

Conclusions

Physician awareness of ocular GPA presentation is vital, and GPA management is most successful with a multidisciplinary team.

### Clinical course and outcomes of childhood-onset granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^111VxuDz]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterise the clinical course and outcomes of a cohort of children with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with GPA in a tertiary care facility from 2000–2014. All subjects met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for GPA or the 2008 European League against Rheumatism/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/Paediatric Rheumatology European Society criteria for GPA. Predictors of readmission were determined using univariate logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to demonstrate the relapse-free survival probability in follow-up.

Results

Twenty-eight children (median age 14.7 years) were diagnosed during the study period. At presentation 14 (50%), 5 (18%), and 4 (14%) children required intensive care unit care, ventilator support, and dialysis, respectively. One-third of the children in our cohort had gastrointestinal involvement, one-quarter of whom were previously diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Two-thirds of children were readmitted. Renal failure and infections accounted for most readmissions. Twenty-three (85%) patients achieved remission, however, 11 subsequently flared (median time to flare 21.5 months). Haematuria at diagnosis was significantly associated with readmission (OR 6.25). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range 5 months to 6 years) 10 (37%) children had chronic kidney disease (> stage 2) and none of the children died.

Conclusions

Children with GPA frequently have severe disease presentations including significant renal, respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement. While most children with GPA achieve remission, nearly half have subsequent relapses.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulceration as a presenting feature of pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^1133c34Y]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although cutaneous manifestations are common in GPA, PG-like lesions are rarely seen. Frumholtz et al. summarized the cutaneous manifestations of 1553 adult patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. While 36.7% (273/743) of patients with GPA had cutaneous involvement, PG was observed in only 1.1% of patients. Very few cases of GPA with PG-like lesions have been reported previously, especially in children. We hereby present 3 new cases of pediatric GPA with PG-like lesions, and review these together with the 4 previous pediatric cases found in the literature.

PG is a rare, rapidly progressive, sterile ulcerating neutrophilic dermatosis which usually presents as painful pustules or nodules. It may evolve into necrotic plaques with raised edges and ultimately into deep violaceous ulcers. PG lesions most frequently affect the lower extremities and tend to be multifocal and recurrent. Adults aged 20–50 are most commonly affected, while pediatric cases account for approximately only 4% of cases. The diagnosis is based on the typical clinical appearance and accompanying histological findings which can be variable and often non-specific. These include a predominantly neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate with evidence of necrosis and hemorrhage at the base of the lesion. Approximately 50–70% of PG cases are associated with systemic conditions, particularly autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In the pediatric population, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Takayasu arteritis and immunodeficiency conditions have been associated with PG.

Weenig et al. reviewed medical charts of 240 patients who received the diagnosis of PG and found that 49 patients (20%) had a different final diagnosis including vascular occlusive disease, vasculitis, cancer and infection. The mean lag time to the final diagnosis was 10 months. Ulcerative skin involvement mimicking PG is often termed "pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulceration ". There may be a lack of widely used diagnostic criteria, but PG-like ulceration and PG are two separate entities with different histopathologic findings. The histopathologic features of PG-like ulcers in GPA include palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis, necrotizing vasculitis and basophilic collagen degeneration. These histopathologic features are not typically seen in classic PG. The term "PG-like ulceration" is preferred in the setting of systemic findings that are consistent with GPA. The clinical differential diagnosis for PG-like lesions of GPA presenting on the face also includes infections, malignancy (including squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and lymphomas), trigeminal trophic syndrome and factitial ulcer.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) vasculitis with pulmonary-renal syndrome rarely presents in children and is associated with high mortality rates.

Case presentation

We present the case of a 13-year-old male with newly diagnosed GPA vasculitis, treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy, plasmapheresis, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroids.

Conclusion

This case presentation demonstrates that ECMO can be used as a life supporting therapy in pediatric patients with pulmonary hemorrhage from ANCA vasculitis in conjunction with other therapies.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^112M1ZKp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vasculitis encompasses a group of clinical entities, all of which share the histopathologic hallmark of inflammation of blood vessel walls. One classification scheme categorizes the vasculitides by the size of the affected vessels, and in this paradigm, "small vessel vasculitis" predominantly affects the small intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis in which very few or no immune deposits are found in the vessel wall but is commonly associated with circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. The specific entities of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (formerly known as Churg Strauss Syndrome) compose the ANCA associated vasculitides.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation that usually involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as by necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis. Constitutional symptoms, destructive sinus or otic disease, ocular involvement, cutaneous involvement, neurologic involvement, musculoskeletal manifestations, and pulmonary capillaritis with hemorrhage are frequently encountered. Still, end-organ manifestations vary from patient to patient, and disease severity may vary from limited disease (upper airway, ocular or isolated pulmonary manifestations) to generalized disease to life-threatening disease (alveolar hemorrhage, cardiac or central nervous system involvement). GPA is associated with ANCA (primarily c-ANCA) and anti-proteinase-3 antibody (anti-PR3) positivity. Ultimately, the diagnosis of GPA, or any vasculitis, requires that the clinician fully integrate the clinical, radiologic, laboratory and histologic information and findings and reach a conclusion that the preponderance of the data does or does not support a compelling diagnosis of GPA.

eFigure. Cumulative Incidence of Infection and Death Among Patients 75 Years and Older With ANCA-Associated Vasculitis Treated With Rituximab as Induction Therapy or Maintenance Therapy Nonauthor Collaborators. The French Vasculitis Study Group ANCA indicates antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; and GPA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Findings In this cohort study of 93 patients 75 years and older with ANCA-associated vasculitis, induction therapy combining rituximab and high-dose glucocorticoid regimens was associated with achievement of remission but accompanied by a high rate of serious infections. When rituximab was used as maintenance therapy, relapse rates and serious infection rates were low.

Objective To examine outcomes and adverse events associated with the use of rituximab therapy in patients 75 years and older with ANCA-associated vasculitis, specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis. Design, Setting, and Participants. Of 238 patients screened, 93 were included; 52 patients had a diagnosis of GPA, and 41 had a diagnosis of MPA. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody –associated vasculitis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affects predominantly small vessels, with few or no immune deposits. 1 The disease is primarily found in the older population; its peak incidence rate occurs at ages 65 to 75 years and remains high after age 75 years. 2–4 Clinical presentation differs between older and younger patients. In a single-center cohort study15 involving 114 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the serious infection rate was 4.

9 per 100 patient-years with the use of rituximab as induction and maintenance therapy. Death occurred in 6 patients, with an incidence of 19. 7 per 100 patient-years.

### Orbital granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener granulomatosis): clinical and pathologic findings [^113gTB8f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The pathology of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly Wegener granulomatosis, typically features a granulomatous and sometimes necrotizing vasculitis targeting the respiratory tract and kidneys. However, orbital involvement occurs in up to 60% of patients and is frequently the first or only clinical presentation in patients with systemic or limited forms of GPA. Orbital GPA can cause significant morbidity and potentially lead to complete loss of vision and permanent facial deformity. Fortunately, GPA is highly responsive to medical treatment with corticosteroids combined with cyclophosphamide or, more recently, rituximab. Therefore, it is imperative for this disease to be accurately diagnosed on orbital biopsy and distinguished from other histologically similar orbital lesions. Herein, we review the clinical and pathologic findings of orbital GPA, focusing on the differentiation of this disease from other inflammatory orbital lesions.

### Lung involvement in childhood onset granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^112hfCcM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is an idiopathic vasculitis of medium and small arteries, characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract with necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis; vasculitis frequently involves also other organs. GPA is a member of a family of vasculitides associated with positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). In GPA, the pattern of autoantibody staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils is typically cytoplasmic (c-ANCA), rather than perinuclear (p-ANCA), due to the presence of antibodies against proteinase 3, which is a constituent of the azurophilic granules of the neutrophil.

The family of ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) also includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The clinical spectrum of vasculitides is broad; the lack of pathognomonic features and the presence of overlapping clinical manifestations makes diagnosis challenging, especially in discriminating one form from one another. In 1990 the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published the classification criteria for seven vasculitides, including GPA and EGPA. However, because of the poor performance of ACR criteria in classifying children with vasculitis, the EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria were developed using pediatric data. The EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for GPA (Table 1) showed improved sensitivity compared to the adult-based ACR criteria (93% vs 83%). However, both classification criteria did not include MPA, which had its specific definition thanks to the Chapel Hill Consensuses Conference (CHCC). It is therefore possible that cases classified as GPA according to ACR criteria may be described as MPA using the CHCC definition. In 2007 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed a classification algorithm to classify patients with a mutually exclusive diagnosis (EGPA, GPA, MPA, or polyarteritis nodosa). The EMA classification algorithm showed to be a promising tool to uniquely diagnose children with either GPA or MPA.

Introduction

Since the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), several high-impact clinical trials have broadened the repertory of available treatments for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and refined management strategies in daily routine care.

Cyclophosphamide (CYC) and glucocorticoids (GC) have been the mainstay of remission induction treatment in AAV. Even though successful strategies to reduce the exposure of CYC and GC, including the use of rituximab (RTX) have been in use for several years now, the toxicity and sequelae caused by these substances remain an unsolved issue in AAV. The optimal management and duration of immunosuppressive treatment balancing risk of relapse and risk of treatment-induced complications is an ongoing challenge during long-term follow-up. Biomarkers guiding the intensity or duration of immunosuppression are not yet established. Since the last update, new information is available on (i) the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for remission induction,(ii) reduced-dose GC schemes,(iii) GC-sparing treatment with avacopan,(iv) the efficacy of plasma exchange (PLEX),(v) dosing and duration of remission maintenance treatment with conventional immunosuppressives and RTXand (vi) pooled evidence from meta-analyses on several areas of the management of AAV.

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on treatment of GPA and MPA. The results presented here will provide the available evidence to the task force of the 2022 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of AAV. A second complementary article will cover the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis as well as diagnostic procedures and general management of AAV.

### Asymptomatic intracardiac mass in a 14-year-old girl with granulomatosis with polyangiitis: case report [^113B7vFm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by acute necrotizing granulomas of the upper respiratory tract and lungs, necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels and pauci-immune, necrotizing, and crescentic glomerulonephritis; however, this disease can affect virtually any organ system. In this report, we describe a case of GPA presenting as renal failure with discovery of an intracardiac mass in an adolescent patient. We will discuss the significance of this finding in light of recent literature.

### Clinical features of childhood granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener's granulomatosis) [^117Lm6yV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we have analysed the clinical features at the time of diagnosis of a large sample of children with GPA/WG whose data were retrieved from the PRINTO database and were collected on the occasion of the project that led to the validation of the EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for the classification of childhood vasculitis.

Granulomatosis with polyangiits is very rare in children and, although it appears to be the same disease observed in adults, it is not known if childhood presentations are characterized by differences in the frequency of some clinical features well described in adults. Indeed, in other connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or juvenile dermatomyositis, the frequency of several clinical manifestations differed from those observed in adults.

We have therefore investigated the clinical and laboratory features present at the time of diagnosis in our series of 56 children and compared them with those of the only other large series of paediatric patients (N = 65) reported in the literature as well as with 3 large (N > 50) reported series of adult patients with GPA/WG.

In agreement with previous studies in children, we have found a gender disproportion, as 68% of our patients were females, while in adult populations females are less often affected ranging from 29 to 50%.

In the present paediatric series, the disease was characterised by high frequency of constitutional symptoms, upper and lower respiratory tract, mucosa, skin and musculoskeletal involvement. The frequencies of symptoms typically decreased in the first few months after diagnosis, presumably due to the effect of treatment although data on treatment modalities were not collected in the database. Our series confirms the previous observation by Cabral et al that patients with time to diagnosis longer than 12 months have a higher frequency of ear, nose and throat and cutaneous symptoms and less renal symptoms in comparison with earlier diagnosed patients. This likely reflects the non-specific nature of ENT and cutaneous features in GPA, that occur commonly in children and hence may not prompt clinicians to initially consider vasculitis as the cause. Out of 26 of our patients who underwent kidney biopsy, 82% had glomerulonephritis, similar to the finding by Cabral et al. (94.4% of children with biopsies available). In adult patients, the data were similar with 73.5% of all patients found with histological evidence of glomerulonephritis.

### New features of disease after diagnosis in 6 forms of systemic vasculitis [^1128VmDo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the occurrence of features of vasculitis that initially present after diagnosis in 6 types of primary vasculitis.

Methods

Standardized collection of data on 95 disease manifestations in 6 vasculitides, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss; EGPA), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), giant cell arteritis (GCA), and Takayasu arteritis (TAK), was obtained within a set of multicenter longitudinal, observational cohorts. For each form of vasculitis, the frequency of disease-specific manifestations at diagnosis was compared to the cumulative frequency of each manifestation. The percentage of patients who initially developed severe manifestations after diagnosis, defined as organ- or life-threatening in the small and medium vessel vasculitides (GPA, MPA, EGPA, PAN) and as ischemic/vascular in the large vessel vasculitides (GCA, TAK), was reported.

Results

Out of 838 patients with vasculitis, 490 (59%) experienced ≥ 1 new disease manifestation after diagnosis. On average, patients with vasculitis experienced 1.3 new manifestations after diagnosis (GPA = 1.9, MPA = 1.2, EGPA = 1.5, PAN = 1.2, GCA = 0.7, and TAK = 1.0). New severe manifestations occurred after diagnosis in 224 (27%) out of 838 patients (GPA = 26%, MPA = 19%, EGPA = 21%, PAN = 23%, GCA = 24%, and TAK = 44%). Timing of onset of new manifestations was not significantly associated with disease duration.

Conclusion

A majority of patients with vasculitis develop new disease features after diagnosis, including a substantial number of new, severe manifestations. Ongoing assessment of patients with established vasculitis should remain broad in scope.

### Dural masses: meningiomas and their mimics [^111Ck89i]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis(GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare systemic disorder which usually begins with necrotising granulomatous inflammation within the respiratory tract and small to medium vessels. More than 90% of patients have anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), with the diffuse cytoplasmic (cANCA) staining at indirect immunofluorescence associated with severe disease and peripheral staining (pANCA) with more limited diseases. CNS involvement is seen in 20–50% of cases, with meningeal disease only reported in around 1%. Interestingly, this meningeal involvement is usually found in those patients with more limited clinical disease as well as upper respiratory tract involvement.

CNS involvement is thought to occur by several mechanisms: intracranial vasculitis; involvement of the skull base or nearby structures via direct spread from the paranasal sinuses; or independent granulomatous inflammation of the meninges or brain, without direct spread from the respiratory tract. Clinical presentation is typically with seizures, meningism, cranial nerve palsy or ischaemic phenomena due to intracranial vasculitis. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.

Methods

The SLR was performed according to the EULAR standard operating procedures (SOP) for EULAR-endorsed recommendations. A methods protocol was established prior to the conduct of the review. Based on a Delphi survey administered to the whole task force (including field expert physicians, one healthcare professional and two patient representatives), eight research questions in the patient, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format were developed to address treatment of GPA and MPA (online supplemental file 1). An electronic search focusing on treatment of AAV was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases (including trial registries clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trial Registry platform). Search strings were developed in collaboration with an experienced librarian. The search was performed as an update starting with the end date of the SLR of the previous recommendations (1 February 2015)and included studies up to 25 February 2022. For treatments not included in the last recommendations, a search without time restrictions was done. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised intervention studies were included in the review. Congress abstracts of the international meetings of EULAR, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the American Society of Nephrology, the European Renal Association/European Dialysis and Transplant Association and the Vasculitis and ANCA Workshop were additionally screened for abstracts of RCTs. Detailed PICO questions, search strategies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram are provided in the online supplemental file 1.

The SLR was performed by two independent reviewers (BS-A and JHS) under supervision of two methodologists (RAL, GT). Articles delivered by the electronic database search were screened by review of title and abstract (10% in duplicate with > 80% agreement) and relevant articles selected for full-text review. Both reviewers agreed on the included studies by consensus and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Included articles were summarised in piloted summary of evidence tables during full-text review (50% in duplicate). Data and quality of evidence of studies included in the final data synthesis were agreed on by both reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. In case of uncertainties, methodologists were consulted to resolve open questions. Case reports, editorials, retrospective studies with mixed populations (not mainly consisting of patients with AAV), retrospective studies with < 50 patients with GPA/MPA and prospective studies with < 10 patients with AAV were excluded. The SLR was limited to articles in English language.

### Evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115397Yg]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, characterized by asthma, eosinophilia and granulomatous or vasculitic involvement of several organs. The diagnosis and management of EGPA are often challenging and require an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. Current practice relies on recommendations and guidelines addressing the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis and not specifically developed for EGPA. Here, we present evidence-based, cross-discipline guidelines for the diagnosis and management of EGPA that reflect the substantial advances that have been made in the past few years in understanding the pathogenesis, clinical subphenotypes and differential diagnosis of the disease, as well as the availability of new treatment options. Developed by a panel of European experts on the basis of literature reviews and, where appropriate, expert opinion, the 16 statements and five overarching principles cover the diagnosis and staging, treatment, outcome and follow-up of EGPA. These recommendations are primarily intended to be used by healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical industries and drug regulatory authorities, to guide clinical practice and decision-making in EGPA. These guidelines are not intended to limit access to medications by healthcare agencies, nor to impose a fixed order on medication use.

### Comparison of EULAR / PRINTO / PReS ankara 2008 and 2022 ACR / EULAR classification criteria for granulomatosis with polyangiitis in children [^116kF3Af]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an ANCA-associated vasculitis. The 2022 ACR/EULAR-endorsed classification criteria for GPA was derived using data only from adult patients. We aimed to assess the performance of the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for GPA in paediatric patients and compare it with the EULAR/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO)/Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS)-endorsed Ankara 2008 criteria for GPA.

Methods

Retrospective data of paediatric patients with GPA in 20 centres from 9 countries were evaluated. The diagnosis of GPA was made according to the expert opinion. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the criteria sets were evaluated.

Results

The study included 77 patients with GPA and 108 controls [IgA vasculitis (n = 44), Takayasu's arteritis (n = 20), microscopic polyangiitis (n = 16), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 14), Behçet's disease (n = 12), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (n = 1) and Cogan's syndrome (n = 1)] with a median age of 17.8 and 15.2years, respectively. Among patients with GPA, constitutional symptoms (85.7%) and ENT involvement (79.2%) were the most common presentations. In the GPA group, 73 patients fulfilled the Ankara 2008 criteria and 69 the ACR/EULAR classification criteria. Sensitivities of the Ankara 2008 criteria and the ACR/EULAR classification criteria were 94.8% and 89.6%, while specificities were 95.3% and 96.3%, respectively. No significant difference was found between sensitivities and specificities of both classification criteria (P = 0.229 and P = 0.733, respectively).

Conclusion

In children, both the ACR/EULAR and EULAR/PRINTO/PReS Ankara 2008 classification criteria for GPA perform well and similarly.

### The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113BZQ6j]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is comprised of three specific conditions: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Since the publication of the last British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BHPR) guideline for the management of adults with AAV in 2014, a plethora of randomized controlled trials, additional research and recommendations have provided novel insights into how the management of AAV can be optimized, thus improving patient quality of life. The BSR AAV Working Group (WG) reviewed published guidelines, undertook a systematic literature review and utilized expertise from specialist vasculitis centres across the UK and patient representatives to formulate a list of 26 recommendations with corresponding strength of agreement (SOA) scores. Recommendations were updated from the published 2014 BSR and BHPR guideline. The 26 recommendations encompassed five key domains: 1. Treatment for GPA and MPA; 2. Management of subglottic stenosis and ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations of AAV; 3. Management and treatment for EGPA; 4. Service specifications; 5. Patient education and support. These recommendations provide an update on care delivery of AAV based on current evidence and specialist opinion. In addition, we have provided research and audit recommendations to support equitable access to care and improve health outcomes. The lay summary that accompanies this abstract can be found in Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online.

### Granulomatous vasculitis [^114otX9a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are uncommon disorders, characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels resulting either in ischemia or hemorrhage. They are commonly classified as small-, medium-, or large-vessel vasculitides. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis is an important group of small-vessel vasculitis. This group includes granulomatous vasculitides, namely, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and nongranulomatous vasculitis, namely, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Classic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a granulomatous medium-vessel vasculitis. This review discusses the classification, etiopathogenesis, clinical features, and management of GPA, MPA, EGPA and PAN.

### Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: understanding the disease and its management [^1148cj2c]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterized by asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia and small-vessel vasculitis. The clinical presentation is variable, but two main clinic-pathologic subsets can be distinguished: one hallmarked by positive ANCA and predominant 'vasculitic' manifestations (e.g. glomerulonephritis, purpura and mononeuritis multiplex) and the other by negative ANCA and prominent 'eosinophilic' manifestations (e.g. lung infiltrates and cardiomyopathy). The pathogenesis is not fully understood but probably results from the interplay between T and B cells and eosinophils. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis must be differentiated from several conditions, including hypereosinophilic syndromes and other small-vessel vasculitides. The overall survival is good; however, patients frequently relapse and have persistent symptoms. The recently developed monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells and eosinophilopoietic cytokines such as IL-5 are emerging as valid alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive therapies. In this review, we discuss the essential features of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with particular respect to the most relevant issues concerning clinical presentation and management.

Polyangiitis overlap syndrome is defined as systemic vasculitis that cannot be classified into one of the well-defined vasculitic syndromes. In this report, a female patient who presented with vasculitis-like and asthmatic symptoms was diagnosed as having polyangiitis overlap syndrome of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). The patient fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for GPA and EGPA. She was successfully treated with immunosuppressants and steroids and has been in remission for 20 months. It is important to establish a proper diagnosis and introduce an appropriate treatment modality in patients with this rare and serious pathology to prevent irreversible organ damage.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) encompasses a group of rare, multisystem autoimmune disorders characterised by the occurrence of inflammation and damage to small blood vessels, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations. They include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Outcomes for patients with MPA and GPA have been transformed over recent years. However, the establishment of effective maintenance therapy aiming to balance the risks of disease relapse with those related to prolonged immunosuppression has become a clinical priority. This review aims to explore two differing perspectives on this unsolved problem. Pros and Cons of the following approaches will be discussed: "Biomarker-guided personalised approach on top of generic maintenance strategy guidelines" or "ANCA specificity-related personalised maintenance treatment after intensive B-cell depletion"?

### Clinical features of childhood granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener's granulomatosis) [^115Cb3Wc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), is a necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly small vessels. This disease is typically associated with granulomatous inflammation, pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis, involvement of upper and lower respiratory tract, and with presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

The estimated annual incidence of the disease in adults is 1:100,000, and 90% of the patients are Caucasians. In children, the estimated incidence is approximately 0.1:100,000. If untreated, mortality, within one year from diagnosis is 90%. Treatment usually consists of combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and more recently rituximab to induce remission, followed by a maintenance phase with lower doses of corticosteroids combined with azathioprine or other disease modifying agents for several years. Despite treatment relapses are common and therapy related complications of significant concern.

The clinical and laboratory picture of GPA/WG was described in several large cohorts of predominantly adult patients but there is paucity of paediatric data due to the rare occurrence of the disease in childhood. Recently, new criteria for childhood GPA/WG have been established and validated by the European League Against Rheumatism/Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (EULAR/PRINTO/PRES).

The aim of this project was to describe the clinical and laboratory features at presentation of childhood GPA/WG in a large international cohort of paediatric patients collected by PRINTO, and compare this series with other paediatric series and with adult patients with WG/GPA derived from the literature.

### Thoracic manifestations of ANCA-associated vasculitis: review of the 2022 American College of Rheumatology-European alliance of associations of rheumatology classification criteria [^111UxmNa]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare disease that manifests as necrotizing vasculitis involving small vessels without immune complex deposition. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are included in this disease entity. Diagnosis and differentiation of AAV is challenging because of the diverse and overlapping clinical manifestations and lack of pathognomonic findings. Therefore, AAV classification criteria have been developed to increase the likelihood of diagnosis using multidisciplinary approaches, including clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and pathologic findings. The new American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria were released in 2022 to classify AAVs using weighted criteria and threshold scores. They are expected to make the classification of GPA, EGPA, and MPA more accurate in the setting of suspected small-vessel vasculitis. The criteria present key thoracic imaging discriminators of GPA as "pulmonary nodules, masses, or cavitation" and MPA as "interstitial fibrosis", whereas, radiologic criteria of EGPA are not present. ANCA positivity and eosinophil count are included as key laboratory discriminators. It is essential for radiologists to familiarize themselves with imaging findings of each AAV and know the key imaging discriminators to aid in the differential diagnosis of AAVs. By reviewing the radiologic findings of thoracic manifestations of each AAV and applying the new criteria in a series of cases, the authors aim to provide a practical and stepwise approach to AAV for radiologists. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

TREATMENT STANDARDS

AAV are divided into three clinical phenotypes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), which are typically combined for clinical studies given their similar initial responses to standard therapy, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (Figs 1 and 2). Although this review focuses on the 2022 management recommendations by the European League of Associations of Rheumatology (EULAR), the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) jointly with the Vasculitis Foundation (VF) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have also updated their guidelines.

### Score to assess the probability of relapse in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^114hfQbn]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are the two main antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV).GPA and MPA differ in their pathogenesis, genetics and serotypes, but patients with these two types of vasculitis share many clinical features and currently receive similar treatments. A therapeutic strategy combining glucocorticoids (GC) and cyclophosphamide or rituximab to induce remission has dramatically improved survival of AAV in the past decades.

Despite this improvement, maintaining remission in patients with GPA or MPA remains challenging. Relapse occurs in 13.7%–44% of cases at 18–36 months depending on the duration of follow-up, patient characteristics and maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy with low-dose preemptive rituximab has significantly decreased the risk of relapse in comparison with azathioprine, but relapses still occur after rituximab discontinuation. Long-term follow-up of the MAINRITSAN 1 trial showed that relapse-free survival was 58% at 60 months in patients treated with rituximab 500 mg every 6 months for 18 months. Increasing the duration of azathioprine maintenance therapy from 24 to 48 months has been shown to decrease the risk of relapse and improve renal outcome.

### The eye is a common site of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A collaborative study [^1163J6R9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare and often severe multiorgan vasculitis characterized by a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the small to medium-sized vessels, leading to endothelial damage and tissue injury. Together with microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome), GPA belongs to the group of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV). While there are substantial differences in the incidence rate of GPA in Europe and Asia and as a function of latitude, the overall incidence rate of the disease is 0.4–11.9 cases/million person-years, with a prevalence of 2.3–146.0 cases/million persons. Epidemiological studies, however, have documented a progressive increase in GPA, reflecting a wider awareness of the disease and the increased availability of reliable imaging techniques. In a population-based cohort study carried out in Denmark, the median annual incidence rate was 20.5/million persons, with an increase in the point prevalence from 64/million in 1995 to 277/million in 2015. GPA can develop in both sexes but there is a slight female preponderance. The peak age at onset is 45–65 years, but the disease can be detected at any age, including in the pediatric population.

### Executive summary: the 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114CeJ6y]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) are heterogeneous, multisystem disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small and medium-sized blood vessels with unknown aetiology. Three distinct clinico-pathological syndromes have been identified: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) associated with autoantibodies directed against neutrophil granular proteins, proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. These conditions are uncommon with incidence and prevalence rates of ∼25/million population and 200/million, respectively. Despite significant advances in treatment, mortality rates remain elevated, 2.3 times that of the general population. Early diagnosis, instituting appropriate immunosuppression swiftly, and limiting toxicity from treatment is key to mitigating mortality and damage from AAV.

### Mapping a path forward: addressing disease burden, pathways and solutions in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^111FK3Cs]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a frequently relapsing systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and destruction of small- to medium-sized blood vessels resulting in potentially life-threatening organ damage. Of the three AAV subtypes, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are the most common. The aims of treatment are to rapidly control active disease with induction therapy (typically rituximab [the new standard-of-care] or cyclophosphamide alongside glucocorticoids [GC] and avacopan), followed by less aggressive maintenance strategies to reduce the risk of relapse. International and national guidelines for the treatment of GPA/MPA are generally aligned, with all guidelines highlighting a need to reduce treatment-related adverse events through rapid GC tapering and the use of GC-sparing avacopan treatment. Guidelines will continue to evolve as ongoing studies provide new insights into alternative (GC-sparing) treatment options and optimal RTX-based treatment regimens.

Patients and methods

The PRINTO database contains data on 1398 patients with childhood vasculitides, with age at diagnosis ≤ 18 years, vasculitis diagnosis after year 2000, as previously described. The database includes demographic data, clinical diagnosis ascertained by the treating physician and a comprehensive list of 70 signs/symptoms (predominantly categorical variables) in 12 broad organ-system categories, laboratory parameters, physician global assessment of disease activity on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), biopsy findings and imaging reports. Data have been collected both retrospectively and prospectively, before or at the time of diagnosis and at least 3 months later via standardized web-based case report forms.

For the purposes of this analysis, we extracted all patients fulfilling the c-GPA/WG EULAR/PRINTO/PRES classification criteria. Patients with co-morbidities were excluded from the study. In brief, a patient is classified as childhood GPA/WG if at least three of the six following criteria are present: 1) histopathology (granulomatous inflammation); 2) upper airway involvement (nasal discharge or epistaxis/crusts/granulomata, nasal septum perforation or saddle nose deformity, sinus inflammation); 3) laryngo-tracheo-bronchial involvement; 4) pulmonary involvement by chest X-ray or CT; 5) ANCA positivity; 6) renal involvement.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Gaslini Hospital (Genoa, Italy) and by the ethics committees of all remaining participating centres and informed consent was obtained from parent(s) as required by the national law in each participating country.

Comparison with literature data (children and adults)

A PubMed search was used to retrieve studies, which included patients with GPA/WG (both children and adults), and included both prospective and retrospective cases describing the clinical picture of at least 50 patients. Search terms were "(((Granulomatosis AND (Wegener OR Wegener's OR polyangiitis)) OR (necrotizing AND vasculitis))) AND (group OR cohort OR patients) AND (prospective OR prospectively OR retrospective OR retrospectively) AND demographic AND age AND clinical AND study" in English.

Statistical analysis

The quantitative demographic, clinical and laboratory data were reported as median (1 st and 3 rd quartile); the categorical data were reported as absolute frequencies and as percentage frequencies of measured subjects.

The data were entered in an Access XP database and analysed with Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc).

### The many faces of granulomatosis with polyangiitis: a review of the head and neck imaging manifestations [^114HGihC]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Wegener granulomatosis has recently been renamed as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). In this review, we examine the clinical criteria and pathologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms of GPA, with an emphasis on findings encountered in the realm of head and neck imaging. Particular attention is paid to generating an appropriate differential diagnosis, because many of the imaging features of GPA overlap with those of other diseases, most notably lymphoma and sarcoidosis. Recent therapeutic advancements have underscored the importance of the radiologist in suggesting the diagnosis early, resulting in earlier treatment and decreased patient morbidity. This is particularly true for the head and neck manifestations of GPA; although they are less common, they often herald a refractory disease course that requires aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Knowledge of common and uncommon imaging findings enables the radiologist to diagnose GPA early enough to start treatment promptly and reduce patient morbidity.

Conclusion

Although there are no reliable pathognomonic imaging features for GPA, the present article attempts to identify patterns of disease that are suggestive of the disease. The diagnosis ultimately relies on a constellation of radiographic findings, laboratory values, and accurate clinical history.

### Cardiogenic shock from coronary vasculitis in granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^112XKZse]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis characterised by necrotising inflammatory changes in small-sized and medium-sized vessels and granuloma formation. It most commonly involves the kidneys and respiratory tract, but it can present with widespread manifestations involving any organ system. Rarely, it causes coronary vasculitis which can precipitate a severe cardiomyopathy. Here, we report a patient who presented in cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and was found to have extensive myocardial ischaemia secondary to coronary vasculitis. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of GPA, and he responded to treatment with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis.
