## Question

What is the recommended duration of anticoagulation therapy for splenic infarct?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of anticoagulation therapy for a patient with splenic infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying mechanism of splenic infarction and whether it reflects arterial embolism, venous thrombosis, or in situ thrombosis. Then, I should verify how the mechanism maps to standard VTE duration frameworks. Next, I will review disease-specific exceptions such as COVID-19, vasculitis, and splanchnic vein thrombosis. After that, I need to check for bleeding risks and contraindications that could modify duration. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a monitoring plan, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because duration hinges on it. Splenic infarction can result from arterial embolism (often cardiogenic or aortic), venous outflow obstruction (splenic or portal vein thrombosis), or in situ thrombosis from local endothelial injury or vasculitis; the spleen's end-artery anatomy makes it particularly vulnerable to infarction when perfusion is compromised, and many patients have more than one plausible predisposing condition, including celiac or splenic artery atherosclerosis, hypercoagulable states, or systemic infections and inflammatory diseases [^116MW9BR] [^112qTXQb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should map mechanism to guideline-based duration logic. For venous thrombosis, standard VTE guidance supports 3 months for provoked events with reversible risk factors, 6 months when the risk factor is not clearly reversible or when splanchnic vein thrombosis is present, and indefinite therapy for unprovoked events or documented thrombophilia. Arterial embolic infarcts are managed by treating the embolic source and providing secondary prevention rather than by a fixed-duration anticoagulation course, which means duration is driven by the underlying indication rather than the infarct itself [^112geCkt] [^117MpZ4U] [^111BzzJS] [^1138r6eY].

> I will now examine venous thrombosis–related splenic infarction, because this is where duration is most standardized. In noncirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis, guidelines recommend at least 6 months of anticoagulation when the etiology is reversible, and indefinite therapy when thrombophilia is present; observational data show improved recanalization and reduced recurrence with anticoagulation, supporting treatment rather than observation in symptomatic patients without major bleeding risk [^111BzzJS] [^1138r6eY] [^115CTNZD] [^115VH9bj].

> Wait, let me verify the arterial embolism scenario, because I initially thought "3–6 months" might apply here too. That would conflate venous and arterial frameworks. For arterial embolic splenic infarction, the infarct itself is not the determinant of anticoagulation duration; instead, duration follows the embolic source indication, such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve, or aortic mural thrombus, where indefinite anticoagulation is typically indicated unless contraindicated, while the infarct is managed supportively and with risk-factor modification [^1167p6KQ] [^115NGyU6].

> Let me consider special contexts that can shift practice. In COVID-19–associated thrombosis, hypercoagulability is common and anticoagulation is generally recommended during the acute phase per COVID-19 guidance, but there is no disease-specific duration for splenic infarction; extrapolating from VTE principles, 3–6 months is reasonable if the thrombotic risk resolves, with individualized decisions thereafter given the low-certainty evidence base [^11636sAU] [^112uZzoz]. In ANCA-associated vasculitis, a pragmatic 6-month course has been used to bridge the period until immunosuppression controls inflammation, acknowledging the absence of direct evidence and the need to balance hemorrhagic risk from inflamed vessels [^112qTXQb]. In infective endocarditis, splenic infarcts are managed with antibiotics and source control; anticoagulation is generally avoided unless there is a separate indication, and duration is dictated by the non-IE indication rather than the infarct itself [^115hb7ZP].

> I need to ensure bleeding risks and contraindications are addressed before finalizing duration. Active bleeding, high bleeding risk, or scenarios like recent splenic artery embolization may necessitate delayed initiation, dose adjustment, or alternative strategies; in partial splenic embolization, early anticoagulation has been studied and can be considered selectively, but thrombocytopenia and portal hypertensive bleeding risk must be weighed carefully, and platelet transfusion is often ineffective in splenomegaly due to sequestration, which complicates bleeding management decisions [^116upTwr] [^115FwxXc].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at the bedside. First, confirm the mechanism with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI and Doppler of the splenic and portal veins. Second, screen for reversible versus persistent risk factors and consider thrombophilia testing if results would change duration. Third, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH, UFH, or a DOAC if no major contraindication, transitioning to an oral agent for maintenance. Fourth, set duration as 3 months for provoked venous events with resolved risk, 6 months for splanchnic venous thrombosis or nonreversible risk, and indefinite for unprovoked events or documented thrombophilia. For arterial embolism, manage the source and continue anticoagulation per that indication's standard [^111BzzJS] [^1112MjPn] [^1126Kix8] [^115VH9bj].

> But wait, what if the infarct is incidental and the patient is asymptomatic? Should I treat at all? For incidental splanchnic vein thrombosis, especially in cancer or cirrhosis, many guidelines still favor anticoagulation given risks of progression and complications, though decisions should be individualized; in contrast, a small, chronic, nonocclusive venous thrombus without symptoms may be observed with serial imaging, particularly in cirrhosis where the balance of bleeding and benefit is delicate [^111U21G6].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan. During active anticoagulation, reassess bleeding and efficacy periodically; for splanchnic venous thrombosis, repeat cross-sectional imaging at about 3 months to document recanalization or progression is reasonable, and in cirrhosis, expert guidance suggests serial imaging every 3 months to guide continuation or cessation of therapy; adjust duration if thrombus resolves early or if new risk factors emerge [^111MKk3q].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise: for venous thrombosis–related splenic infarction, treat for at least 6 months if the etiology is reversible and consider indefinite therapy if unprovoked or if thrombophilia is present. For arterial embolic splenic infarction, do not use a fixed duration — treat the embolic source with guideline-directed anticoagulation and secondary prevention. Tailor decisions in special contexts such as COVID-19, vasculitis, and endocarditis, and always integrate bleeding risk and patient-specific factors before committing to extended therapy [^111BzzJS] [^1138r6eY] [^1167p6KQ].

---

The duration of anticoagulation for splenic infarction depends on the underlying cause and risk of recurrence: **3–6 months for reversible causes** (e.g. transient hypercoagulable state, infection, surgery) [^116hDABg] and **6–12 months or indefinite for irreversible causes** (e.g. thrombophilia, malignancy, chronic inflammatory disease) [^111BzzJS] [^116hDABg]. For arterial embolism (e.g. atrial fibrillation, mechanical valve), anticoagulation is **typically indefinite** unless contraindicated [^1167p6KQ]. Always reassess bleeding risk and recurrence risk at 3 months to guide continuation or cessation [^114cu6jR].

---

## General principles guiding anticoagulation duration

Anticoagulation duration is **guided by the cause of splenic infarction**, the presence of ongoing thrombotic risk, and patient-specific factors such as bleeding risk and comorbidities [^111BzzJS]. The main goals are to prevent recurrence while minimizing bleeding complications [^114HwNjX].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommended duration

### Venous thrombosis-related splenic infarction

Venous thrombosis-related splenic infarction most often reflects **splenic or portal vein thrombosis** [^notfound]. Anticoagulation duration follows established splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) guidelines:

- **Reversible risk factors**: 3–6 months of anticoagulation is recommended for patients with reversible risk factors such as transient hypercoagulable states, infections, or recent surgery [^116hDABg].

- **Irreversible risk factors**: For patients with irreversible risk factors such as thrombophilia, malignancy, or chronic inflammatory diseases, anticoagulation for 6–12 months or indefinitely may be recommended, depending on the individual risk profile [^111BzzJS] [^1112MjPn].

- **Unprovoked thrombosis**: In cases of unprovoked venous thrombosis, indefinite anticoagulation may be considered, particularly if thrombophilia is identified [^1112MjPn].

---

### Arterial embolism-related splenic infarction

Arterial embolism-related splenic infarction often results from **cardioembolic sources** such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, or aortic thrombi [^116MW9BR]. Anticoagulation duration is typically determined by the underlying embolic source:

- **Atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves**: Indefinite anticoagulation is generally recommended unless contraindicated, given the high risk of recurrent embolism [^notfound].

- **Reversible embolic sources**: If the embolic source is reversible and adequately treated (e.g. successful cardioversion, resolution of hypercoagulable state), anticoagulation may be continued for 3–6 months followed by reassessment [^notfound].

---

### Infectious or inflammatory causes

In infectious or inflammatory conditions such as endocarditis, vasculitis, or COVID-19, anticoagulation duration should be **individualized** based on the resolution of the underlying condition and the presence of ongoing thrombotic risk [^11636sAU]. Typically, anticoagulation is continued until the infection or inflammation is adequately controlled, with reassessment thereafter [^112qTXQb].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and guidelines

Although direct evidence on anticoagulation duration for splenic infarction is limited, extrapolation from SVT and VTE guidelines provides a **reasonable framework** [^111tNzSf]. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) recommend 3–6 months of anticoagulation for reversible SVT and indefinite anticoagulation for irreversible risk factors or unprovoked thrombosis [^111BzzJS] [^111974Yz] [^113UWe9r].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

Several **patient-specific factors** influence anticoagulation duration:

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk may necessitate shorter anticoagulation duration or alternative therapies [^117MpZ4U].

- **Comorbidities**: Liver cirrhosis, renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia may complicate anticoagulation management and require individualized decisions [^111U21G6].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, particularly in cases of indefinite anticoagulation [^117L7tse].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **recanalization**, monitor for **bleeding complications**, and reassess the need for ongoing anticoagulation. Imaging follow-up with ultrasound or CT is typically recommended at 3–6 month intervals initially, with adjustments based on clinical response [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of anticoagulation** |
|-|-|
| Venous thrombosis with reversible risk factors | 3–6 months [^116hDABg] |
| Venous thrombosis with irreversible risk factors | 6–12 months or indefinite [^111BzzJS] [^116hDABg] |
| Unprovoked venous thrombosis | Indefinite [^notfound] |
| Arterial embolism (atrial fibrillation, mechanical valve) | Indefinite [^notfound] |
| Infectious or inflammatory causes | Until resolution of underlying condition, then reassess |

---

The duration of anticoagulation for splenic infarction **varies with the cause** and ongoing thrombotic risk. For reversible causes, 3–6 months is typical; for irreversible causes or arterial embolism, 6–12 months or indefinite therapy may be needed. Regular reassessment of bleeding and recurrence risk is essential to guide ongoing management [^116hDABg].

Post-splenectomy thromboembolic complications

It has been reported that, following splenectomy, there is an increased risk of early and late venous and arterial thrombosis, including acute splenic and portal vein thrombosis (SPVT)and delayed severe life-long complications.

Acute splenic and portal vein thrombosis

Acute SPVT after splenectomy is an early and life-threatening complication, which can lead to bowel ischemia and/or portal hypertension. This complication has been related to stasis in the splenic vein remnant. The risk varies depending on the underlying disorder. In 2008, Krauth et al. reviewed prospective and retrospective studies and found that 11/89 patients with hemolytic disease developed SPVT (12.3%) while only 2/118 patients (1.7%) of those with immune thrombocytopenia had SPVT. None of 122 patients who underwent splenectomy because of trauma developed this complication. Large spleen size has also been identified as a risk factor for the development of SPVT. Although there are no well-designed randomized trials comparing the risk of SPVT after open splenectomy versus laparoscopic splenectomy, the surgical approach does not seem to affect the incidence of SPVT. Screening for thrombophilia has not been shown to allow early identification of patients at risk of SPVT after splenectomy.

A study in which contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used for the diagnosis of SPVT showed that the median time between splenectomy and the appearance of asymptomatic SPVT was 6 days (range, 3–11 days). A Canadian study of 40 patients suggested that an appropriate time for Doppler/ultrasound surveillance to diagnose SPVT is 1 week following splenectomy.

Most patients with documented SPVT are treated with anticoagulant therapy (i.e. intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulants) for a variable period ranging between 3 to 6 months. In one study, the majority of treated patients had documented complete (57/90, 63.3%) or at least partial (13.3%) resolution of the thrombus. However, 7.7% of this latter population showed persistence of thrombus, while 15.5% developed a cavernoma or portal hypertension.

The role of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy is unknown as strategies in the various cohorts or case reports were extremely heterogeneous in terms of duration of prophylaxis. A randomized study comparing different durations of postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis after laparoscopic abdominal surgery was terminated early due to the low incidence of thrombosis.

### Embolic risk management in infective endocarditis: predicting the 'embolic roulette' [^115hb7ZP]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guidelines recommend no delay in indicated surgery in the setting of stroke without evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or extensive neurological damage; in the setting of haemorrhagic stroke or extensive neurological damage, guidelines advise that surgery should be delayed ≥ 4 weeks. Both recommendations have a Class IIb status and are based on observational data which found similar survival and neurological outcome in operated patients without cerebral haemorrhage or major neurological impairment. The ESC guideline is consistent with these recommendations for surgery after a stroke in IE.

These recommendations are in line with a recent study that showed no statistically significant difference in postoperative stroke between patients with versus without preoperative stroke (4 out of 98 (4.1%) vs 10 out of 558 (1.8%); p = 0.148). However, the rate of postoperative haemorrhagic strokes was higher in the preoperative stroke group (3.1% vs 0.5%, p = 0.016). Lastly, for patients with preoperative stroke, early surgery within 72 hours (38 out of 98 (38.8%)) did not correlate with an increased risk of stroke (2.6% vs 5.0%, p = 0.564). These recent findings underscore the viability of an early valve surgery approach for acute endocarditis in the context of acute stroke, demonstrating a comparable postoperative stroke risk.

Splenic complications related to IE range from asymptomatic infarction to abscess formation. Splenic infarcts are frequent and often asymptomatic (20% of patients in the European Infective Endocarditis [EURO-ENDO] registry) but 5% of splenic infarcts can progress to abscess formation. For splenic infarction, conventional treatment with appropriate antibiotics is indicated and for large splenic abscess that does not respond to treatment, splenectomy performed before valve surgery is recommended to avoid spreading the infection to the new prosthesis. In patients with significant surgical risk, percutaneous drainage and/or laparoscopic surgery may be considered as alternatives to open splenectomy.

Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Hemophilus spp) is advised following splenectomy.

A study suggests that residual vegetation is frequently observed in patients who did not undergo surgery at the completion of antibiotic treatment for IE. Approximately half of the patients with non-operated valvular IE who presented with vegetation at admission continued to exhibit residual vegetation at the end of their antibiotic treatment.

### Rivaroxaban for the treatment of noncirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis: an interventional prospective cohort study [^115VH9bj]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an unusual site manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Of the different sites of SVT, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the most frequently detected, with a gender-specific annual incidence of 3.78 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in men and 1.73 per 100 000 inhabitants in women. Most common predisposing factors for SVT include liver cirrhosis, solid abdominal cancer, myeloproliferative neoplasms, abdominal surgery, and intraabdominal infection or inflammatory diseases.

SVT is a potentially life-threatening disease, with a broad range of clinical presentations, including abdominal infarction or gastrointestinal bleeding. The complex balance between bleeding risk and the risk of thrombus extension or recurrence makes the treatment of SVT a clinical challenge. Without anticoagulation, the estimated rates of major bleeding, extension of SVT, and recurrent VTE were 16%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Compared with no treatment, the use of anticoagulation significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis progression and major bleeding by 76% and 27%, respectively; it also increased the rate of recanalization by more than 2-fold, which is likely the main driver for the observed reduction in bleeding in anticoagulated patients with SVT.

In the absence of major contraindications, anticoagulant therapy is therefore recommended for all patients presenting with acute symptomatic SVT, starting with either low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) with a transition to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in most cases. Similar to the recommendations for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism (PE), it is generally recommended that anticoagulant treatment of SVT be continued for at least 3 months or indefinitely if underlying persistent prothrombotic factors are identified.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have now become the treatment of choice for most patients with DVT or PE, and their advantages over VKAs can be relevant for patients with unusual site VTE. A recent guidance document from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) suggested the possibility of prescribing DOACs in patients without cirrhosis with acute symptomatic SVT, but evidence to support this statement remains scant. In particular, no interventional studies have sufficiently investigated the role of DOACs in the acute phase treatment of SVT.

In this pilot study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa, rivaroxaban, for the treatment of acute SVT in patients without cirrhosis.

### Coeliac trunk dissection causing splenic infarction: a comprehensive review [^114uWJUx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We describe the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with a 6-day history of epigastric abdominal pain radiating to his right shoulder which started suddenly after swinging a golf club. A CT angiography of the abdomen was performed which showed dissection of the coeliac trunk extending into the splenic artery and splenic infarct. Anticoagulation was initially started but discontinued due to a small retroperitoneal haemorrhage. The patient remained stable and was discharged on aspirin 325mg for 1month followed by aspirin 81mg. We present this case as well as a review of previously reported cases of splenic infarct due to spontaneous coeliac trunk dissection with the treatments employed as well as the outcomes.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sustained eculizumab treatment in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1177YWLD]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Thrombotic events

Prior to initiation of eculizumab, 63 of 195 patients (32·3%) experienced 124 TEs, both venous and arterial, over a total of 1683 patient-years. These TEs included deep-vein thrombosis, hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome), cerebrovascular accident, mesenteric thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The percentage of patients free from TEs increased from 67·7% before treatment to 96·4% during treatment: seven patients (3·6%) reported a total of 10 TEs over 467·1 patient-years. Of these seven patients, five had a history of TEs prior to starting treatment with eculizumab and four were receiving concomitant anticoagulation therapy (including warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparins). Of the 10 TEs reported during eculizumab treatment, five were reported as thrombophlebitis/deep vein thrombosis (three events occurred in the same patient), one as deep vein thrombosis, one as retinal vein thrombosis and one as a possible thrombosis in a fistula. The remaining patient experienced portal vein thrombosis and splenic infarcts. The median time from the first dose of eculizumab to the first TE was 646 d (approximately 21 months), with a range of 170–876 d (approximately 5·6–29·0 months).

A time-matched analysis showed that in the 467·1 patient-years prior to eculizumab treatment, there were a total of 52 TEs reported in 25 patients. The administration of eculizumab reduced the TE incidence rate from 11·13 events per 100 patient-years to 2·14 events per 100 patient-years, a relative reduction of 81·8% (P < 0·0005).

Overall, 98 patients (50·3%) were treated with anticoagulants prior to or coincident with eculizumab: 11 patients before the start of the study, 84 patients both before and during treatment with eculizumab and three patients during the study following a TE. Of the 95 patients who were treated with an anticoagulant prior to the start of the study, 58 (61·1%) experienced at least one TE before receiving eculizumab. Eleven patients, six of whom had a prior history of TEs, discontinued anticoagulant therapy while receiving eculizumab. None of these 11 patients experienced a TE after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy.

2.3 Model assumptions: Splenectomy

We made several conservative assumptions to avoid overestimating the effectiveness of splenectomy. Complete response rates to splenectomy, defined as achieving a platelet count > 150 × 10⁹/L, observed at 5‐, 10‐, and 20‐year follow‐up range from 60% to 88.5%. We utilized the lower estimate of 60% and further decreased and increased this estimate by 20%, corresponding to as low as 48% and as high as 72% in our sensitivity analyses. In addition, we utilized only complete response rates for splenectomy while using less stringent overall response rates (platelet count > 30–50 × 10⁹/L) for rituximab and TRAs.

We also utilized upper‐bound estimates for postsplenectomy complications in patients with ITP. These included an annual probability of thrombosis (both venous and arterial) of 1.7% that we assumed remained constant for all 20 years in our Markov model despite annualized rates that are lower than this estimate and despite recent evidence that 5‐year arterial risk (inclusive of myocardial infarction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and stroke) in patients with ITP following splenectomy is not significantly increased as compared to age‐ and gender‐matched controls. Historic rates of postsplenectomy infection requiring hospitalization still include data from prior to the introduction of the 13‐valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and are highest in the septuagenarian decade at 13.85 per 100 person‐years. Even though lower infection rates have been reported in the fifth decade (7.46 per 100 person‐years), where our Markov model starts at a median age of 51, we utilized the higher septuagenarian rate and assumed every hospitalization was for the most severe sepsis state of septic shock, rather than for sepsis or severe sepsis. Furthermore, although the rate of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection is reported at 0.13 per 100 person‐years and the mortality range is 50%–70%, we assumed the higher mortality of 70% as our base case. We accounted for the possibility of accessory splenectomy as previously reported in 9% of cases, assumed that all redo splenectomies would result in ITP treatment failure (i.e. 0% success probability), and assumed all thrombotic sequelae following splenectomy would require indefinite anticoagulation. We assumed a perioperative mortality rate for laparoscopic splenectomy of 0.2%, rather than that for open splenectomy (1.0%), as the former is the standard‐of‐care in the United States, although in our sensitivity analyses we examined the effect of open splenectomy mortality of 1.0%.

### Acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis: a prospective multicenter follow-up study [^114HqGJs]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Current recommendations for early anticoagulation in acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis or malignancy are based on limited evidence. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in patients managed according to these recommendations. We enrolled 102 patients with acute thrombosis of the portal vein, or its left or right branch. Laboratory investigations for prothrombotic factors were centralized. Thrombus extension and recanalization were assessed by expert radiologists. A local risk factor was identified in 21% of patients, and one or several general prothrombotic conditions in 52%. Anticoagulation was given to 95 patients. After a median of 234 days, the portal vein and its left or right branch were patent in 39% of anticoagulated patients (versus 13% initially), the splenic vein in 80% (versus 57% initially), and the superior mesenteric vein in 73% (versus 42% initially). Failure to recanalize the portal vein was independently related to the presence of ascites (hazard ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3–11.1) and an occluded splenic vein (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4–8.9). Gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal infarction occurred in nine and two patients, respectively. Two patients died from causes unrelated to thrombosis or anticoagulation therapy.

Conclusion

Recanalization occurs in one-third of patients receiving early anticoagulation for acute portal vein thrombosis, whereas thrombus extension, intestinal infarction, severe bleeding, and death are rare. Alternative therapy should be considered when ascites and splenic vein obstruction are present.

### Clinical approach to splanchnic vein thrombosis: risk factors and treatment [^111gwxDN]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an unusual manifestation of venous thromboembolism which involves one or more abdominal veins (portal, splenic, mesenteric and supra-hepatic veins). SVT may be associated with different underlying disorders, either local (abdominal cancer, liver cirrhosis, intra-abdominal inflammation or surgery) or systemic (hormonal treatment, thrombophilic conditions). In the last decades, myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) emerged as the leading systemic cause of SVT. JAK2 mutation, even in the absence of known MPN, showed a strong association with the development of SVT, and SVT was suggested to be the first clinical manifestation of MPN. Recently, an association between SVT, in particular supra-hepatic vein thrombosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has also been reported. SVT occurs with heterogeneous clinical presentations, ranging from incidentally detected events to extensive thrombosis associated with overt gastrointestinal bleeding, thus representing a clinical challenge for treatment decisions. In the absence of major contraindications, anticoagulant therapy is generally recommended for all patients presenting with acute symptomatic SVT, but there is no consensus about the use of anticoagulant drugs in chronic or incidentally detected SVT. High quality evidence on the acute and long-term management is substantially lacking and the risk to benefit-ratio of anticoagulant therapy in SVT still needs to be better assessed.

### Impact of thrombocytopenia on bleeding and thrombotic outcomes in adults with cancer-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis [^1141rsRT]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication among patients with cancer and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT) refers to thrombosis of the hepatic vein, portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. Cancers, especially gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, are associated with an increased risk for SpVT. This risk is especially pronounced in patients with concomitant liver disease or those who have undergone intra-abdominal surgery. Although SpVT may be detected incidentally during surveillance imaging, it can present with complications of portal hypertension, GI bleeding, hepatic ischemia, and bowel infarction. Moreover, SpVT has been associated with increased mortality in the general populationand specifically in patients with localized or metastatic malignancy.

Patients with cancer-associated thrombosis can be particularly challenging to manage because of the high risk for VTE recurrenceand bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation therapy when compared with patients without cancer. The optimal management of cancer-associated, usual-site VTE (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) has now been assessed in several large randomized control trials. However, the existing evidence regarding the outcomes in cancer-associated SpVT and the impact of anticoagulation therapy are based primarily on limited observational data. The current society guidelines reflect this uncertainty surrounding treatment with anticoagulants in patients with cancer-associated SpVT. The American Society of Hematology guidelines suggest either short-term anticoagulation treatment or observation in patients with cancer-associated SpVT, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends treatment of incidental cancer-associated SpVT on a case-by-case basis. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) proposes treatment of symptomatic SpVT in both the general population and in those with cancer based on weak quality of evidence.

Concurrent thrombocytopenia is frequent in cancer-associated thrombosis, which can be attributed to the malignancy itself, comorbidities, or cancer-directed therapies, and can further complicate decisions surrounding anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly relevant to patients with cancer-associated SpVT because portal hypertension is associated with both lower platelet counts and an increased risk for GI bleeding. However, data on how thrombocytopenia modulates thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk in this high risk subpopulation are lacking. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, anticoagulation strategies used, and bleeding and thrombotic outcomes in patients with cancer-associated SpVT. We further aimed to determine the impact of thrombocytopenia at the time of SpVT diagnosis on these outcomes.

Regarding medical management for mesenteric vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulation therapy, duration, ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider extending anticoagulation beyond 6 months with a DOAC as an alternative to a VKA in all patients with acute MVT and transient risk factors for venous thrombosis.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis — initial and maintenance anticoagulation is outlined as follows: We recommend anticoagulation for noncirrhotic patients with acute symptomatic portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis in the absence of any contraindication (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). For duration, we suggest at least 6 months of anticoagulation when the etiology is reversible and indefinite anticoagulation in patients with thrombophilia (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For initial therapy, we suggest either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) once a decision is made to initiate anticoagulation, considering the pros and cons of either approach (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For maintenance, we suggest either LMWH or warfarin, noting limited experience with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), that some monitoring of therapy is recommended, and that tests can rule out substantial drug effect; pros and cons, including availability of reversal agents, should be considered (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Duration of oral anticoagulation after PE… [^111K3k8z]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Consecutive patients aged 18 years or older who experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism and had been treated initially for 6 uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist were potentially eligible. Median study treatment duration was 17. 5 months in the warfarin group and
17. 4 months in the placebo group.

Double-blind treatment was permanently discontinued for 38 warfarin-treated patients and for 49 placebo-treated patients who discontinued treatment. The mean interval between INR measurements was 19. 6 days for the warfarin-treated patients and
23. 5 days for the placebo-treated patients. Quiz Ref IDIn this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing an additional 18 months of anticoagulation with placebo for patients having experienced a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism and having received anticoagulant treatment for 6 months, we found a hazard ratio of 0. 22 for the risk of the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in favor of additional therapy during 18 months.

Aspirin for 2 to 4 years following vitamin K antagonist therapy reduced the risk of recurrence by about 30% compared with placebo. 21, 22 Although this 30% risk reduction may be viewed as small compared with the 80% to 90% usually reported with anticoagulation, 32 and it is uncertain whether our results apply to newer anticoagulants, both aspirin and new anticoagulants may represent valuable alternatives to vitamin K antagonists or no treatment.

### Clinical conditions associated with splenic infarction in adult patients… [^116MW9BR]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Fourteen outpatient cases with inadequate clinical information were excluded. A study radiologist reviewed all images and excluded 55 additional cases when imaging suggested nonacute infarctions, alternative explanations for splenic abnormalities, or perfusion artifacts. The total after exclusions was 163 patients with splenic infarction. Table 2 shows specific conditions associated with splenic infarction. In addition to traditional conditions, we noted a high prevalence of inflammatory or infectious abdominal conditions, sepsis, malignant tumor, and atherosclerosis involving celiac or splenic arteries. In 6 of 34 patients with celiac or splenic artery atherosclerosis, no other predisposing factor was evident. In-hospital mortality was 20%.

This study found splenic infarction to be associated with a more diverse array of clinical conditions than is typically recognized in case series. 1–6 We highlight 4 observations not emphasized in previous reports. First, in 40% of cases, more than 1 plausible predisposing condition was identified. Although decreased arterial perfusion or hypercoagulability are final common pathways for infarction in most patients, these 2 processes can coexist, and various clinical entities can predispose to each of them. Third, atherosclerosis involving the splenic artery and the celiac artery has not been discussed in most previous reviews. 1–6 Twenty-one percent of patients had this finding, which could lower the threshold for splenic infarction when hypercoagulability or hypoperfusion coexist.

In 6 patients, celiac or splenic atherosclerosis was the only identifiable factor; acute in situ arterial thromboembolism involving previously subocclusive plaque is a possible mechanism. A limitation of this study is the lack of standard protocol for evaluating patients with splenic infarction. Therefore, we might have underestimated the prevalence of conditions that can require extensive testing during or after an acute hospitalization. Traditionally, cardioembolism and identifiable hypercoagulable states have been considered to be the cause of most splenic infarctions. Our study found that splenic infarction is associated with a broader spectrum of systemic and abdominal disorders than previously reported, and that celiac or splenic artery atherosclerosis may be an additional predisposing factor.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture, an underrated cause of acute abdomen [^114sUGoh]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The majority (over 80%) of reported ASR cases are treated surgically, and splenectomy remains the treatment of choice for patients with underlying malignancies. However, similarly to low-grade splenic traumas in haemodynamically stable patients, there is an increasing trend towards non-operative management for ASR as well, which achieves a high (80%) success rate with correct patient selection. Conservative treatment including bed rest, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusions is particularly appealing in young and pediatric patients with acute infections, since preserving the spleen prevents long-term infectious morbidity. Strict clinical, laboratory, and imaging monitoring is required during nonoperative management: multidetector CT consistently allows assessment of changes in size and attenuation of haematomas over time. Albeit operator-dependent and lacking panoramicity, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound allows younger patients to avoid irradiation from repeated CT studies.

Increasingly adopted to manage traumatic splenic injuries, interventional treatment with transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) may also prove a valuable non-surgical option for ASR (Fig. 3), particularly in cases associated with anticoagulation, malaria, and mononucleosis, and when CT detects active arterial bleeding. In selected patients, TAE is useful as a temporary stabilising measure. Combined with intensive care, interventional radiology may allow a more rapid and safer haemostasis than surgery alone.

A 73-year-old male on anticoagulation suffered from spontaneous acute abdominal pain. His medical history included congestive heart failure, complete atrioventricular block treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, previous angioplasty and coronary stenting for acute myocardial infarction, and surgically treated colon carcinoma. Physical examination revealed hypotension and tender left hypocondrium. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.6; haemoglobin level was 6.5 g/dl. CT (a, b) revealed a large, roundish mixed attenuation intraparenchymal splenic haematoma without haemoperitoneum. Active bleeding was not evident during the arterial-phase acquisition (a). Faint contrast "blush" (arrow in b) was visible in the venous phase and confirmed at urgent arteriography as minimal bleeding originating from the left phrenic artery (arrow in c). Selective embolization with Spongostan and coil (thin arrow in d) was performed and allowed successful nonoperative management

Immune thrombocytopenia — immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is defined as a platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L; first-line corticosteroids can increase platelet counts rapidly within 1–2 days in approximately 70% of patients, but durable benefit is seen in only 25% of patients; intravenous immunoglobulin has a short time to response (within 24–48 h) but is transient, rarely producing sustained responses longer than 3–4 weeks; splenectomy is used as a last resort with initial responses as high as 80%, with sustained response rates decreasing to 66%; platelet transfusions alone are often ineffective unless given with intravenous immunoglobulin.

### Follow-up strategies for patients with splenic trauma managed non-operatively: the 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document [^113Tzqcz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The Western Trauma Association (WTA) suggests starting VTE prophylaxis 24 h post-injury, whereas the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) recommends starting VTE prophylaxis within 48 h of injury. Studies demonstrating the need for timely DVT prophylaxis initiation showed that a delay in initiation > 4 days is associated with a threefold VTE risk increase. Several prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated that VTE prophylaxis administration 24–48 h after arrival to the hospital is associated with reduced rates of VTE without increased need for blood transfusion or failure of NOM. The 2017 WSES guidelines stated that LMWH-based prophylactic anticoagulation should be started as soon as possible from splenic trauma, including patients treated with NOM. Our systematic review of the literature regarding this topic retrieved 15 studies, of which two were systematic reviews and meta-analyses, two were prospective cohort studies, and 11 were retrospective cohort studies. To date, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrated that patients undergoing NOM for blunt solid organ injury could be safely and effectively prescribed early VTE prophylaxis. Murphy et al. included ten studies comprising 14,675 patients that compared early (≤ 48 h) versus late (> 48 h) initiation of VTE chemoprophylaxis in adults with blunt splenic, liver, and/or kidney injury. All studies were non-randomized, and only one was prospective. The overall odds of failure of NOM were not different between early and late groups (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.92–1.29), and there was no difference in the need for blood transfusion either during overall hospital stay (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.70–1.18), or post-prophylaxis initiation (OR 1.23; 95%CI 0.55–2.73). The subgroup analysis focused on splenic injuries showed no difference in NOM failure (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.42–1.97). Conversely, there were significantly lower odds of VTE when patients received early VTE prophylaxis (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.81). In keeping with the results presented by Murphy et al. the most updated meta-analysis found a non-statistically significant trend toward an increased risk of failure of NOM among patients receiving early VTE prophylaxis (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01–3.05), with no significant difference in risk of transfusion. Conversely, odds of DVT were significantly lower in the early group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22–0.59) but without a difference in mortality (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.82–2.75). However, in both the cited meta-analyses, all studies were at serious risk of bias due to confounding as they included only observational studies. For example, patients in the delayed VTE prophylaxis arm of each primary study had higher injury severity score (ISS) and AAST injury grades and more extended hospital and ICU admissions. Moreover, some studies included patients with head injuries, which are a conditional factor in deciding the timing of VTE prophylaxis on admission.

Duration of anticoagulant therapy after nonsurgical transient risk factor–provoked VTE and reassessment of extended therapy: In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient risk factor, we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a shorter period (Grade 1B) and (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). We suggest treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a low or moderate bleeding risk (Grade 2B), and recommend treatment for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a high risk of bleeding (Grade 1B). Remarks: In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (eg, annually).

### Cytomegalovirus-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis in immunocompetent patients: a systematic review [^113CztF6]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occur in more than 5% of hospitalized patients with acute CMV infection. In immunocompetent patients, splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) and splenic infarction have been suggested to represent approximately half of the published cases of CMV-associated VTE. We performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim to describe epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and natural history of CMV-associated SVT in immunocompetent patients.

Methods

Studies were identified by a PubMed and Google Scholar electronic database search until January 2018. All published papers describing immunocompetent adults with SVT occurring concomitantly to an acute CMV infection were included.

Results

Forty-four patients with CMV-associated SVT were described in 38 papers. Twenty-three patients were male, mean age was 38.1 years (range, 17–68). Symptomatic SVT occurred in 31 patients, incidental SVT in 13 patients. In symptomatic SVT, an acute and severe onset with small bowel or splenic infarction required surgical treatment for resolution in 22.6% of cases. Anticoagulation induced both a favourable clinical outcome and a recanalization of SVT in more than 70% of the remaining cases. In incidental SVT, a favourable clinical outcome and a complete recanalization of SVT by anticoagulation were reported in more than 80% of cases. No patient with CMV-associated SVT died and no SVT recurrence was reported.

Conclusions

CMV-associated SVT has probably a favourable clinical course in most patients. Only future, well-designed, prospective studies with an adequate follow-up will allow to confirm the data of published cases.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^112XJE2t]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

COUMADIN can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with COUMADIN therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of COUMADIN therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli

Anticoagulation therapy with COUMADIN may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as "purple toes syndrome". Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

### Role of combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in COVID-19 treatment: a rapid review [^11636sAU]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Arterial thrombotic events

Apart from the venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events, there are also reports of arterial thrombosis including stroke, myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, aortic thrombosis and splenic infarcts. Microvascular thrombosis also is present in COVID-19 disease. Autopsies done on patients who died from COVID-19 infection demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs. The mechanism of development of this entity is unclear and is thought to be multifactorial.

Guideline recommendations

Guidance on the treatment of COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability has been provided by several international organisations. For outpatients with COVID-19 infection, it is not recommended to initiate anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for prevention of venous thromboembolism or arterial thrombosis unless other indications are present. However, there is general agreement that thromboprophylaxis should be administered to all patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection with the prophylactic dose anticoagulation being the backbone of the antithrombotic therapy. Nevertheless, there exist some variations concerning the recommended dosages, duration of treatment and optimal agent. Some societies recommend intermediate dose anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg two times per day or 40 mg two times per day or intravenous UFH to achieve antifactor Xa level of 0.3–0.7 units/mL) in a specific subgroup of patients considered at high risk of thrombotic events, whereas others recommend against it. In addition, extended thromboprophylaxis even after patient discharge can be considered in patients at high thrombotic and low bleeding risk. The optimal anticoagulant agent is yet to be determined. Currently, most societies recommend the use of LMWH and UFH as first-line agents for inpatient management of these patients, whereas others recommend the use fondaparinux in addition to the previously mentioned agents. However, the use of antiplatelet alone for thromboprophylaxis is not recommended. When pharmacological anticoagulation is contraindicated, it is recommended to use mechanical thromboprophylaxis.

### Portal vein thrombosis after partial splenic embolization in liver cirrhosis: efficacy of anticoagulation and long-term follow-up [^115iuHR4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the treatment and long-term outcome of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after partial splenic embolization (PSE).

Materials and Methods

From January 2006 to December 2011, 145 patients with hypersplenism caused by cirrhotic portal hypertension underwent PSE. In 11 cases, PVT was detected 13–42 days after PSE. Among the 11 patients, 5 underwent anticoagulant therapy because of clinical symptoms, and 6 did not receive anticoagulation because they were symptom-free (4 patients) or experienced variceal bleeding (2 patients). The long-term follow-up data from these 11 patients were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

The 11 patients with PVT had a mean splenic infarction ratio of 71.5%. The mean duration of follow-up was 37.6 months. During the follow-up period, none of the 5 patients who underwent anticoagulation developed variceal hemorrhage despite presenting with large esophagogastric varices. Four of the five patients achieved complete resolution of thrombosis, and one did not develop thrombus progression. However, among the 6 patients who did not undergo anticoagulation, 2 developed esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage secondary to thrombus progression, 3 developed cavernous transformation of the portal vein and variceal progression, and 1 had partial calcification of the thrombus. Two patients who had variceal bleeding or rebleeding underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Complete recanalization of the portal vein was achieved after the procedures.

Conclusions

PVT is a severe, potentially fatal complication of PSE. Early detection of PVT and prompt anticoagulation are effective to avoid serious consequences of PVT.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^112o1YVh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Most patients in our real‐world multicenter cohort study with provoked VTE received longer duration of anticoagulation therapy than recommended by ACCP guidelines. Patients taking DOACs with a history of recurrent VTE and a history of myocardial infarction were more likely to received longer treatment than what was guideline recommended. This study identifies a group of patients with provoked VTE who were more likely to receive prolonged anticoagulation and may be at increased risk of anticoagulant‐related bleeding complications. Further study will be necessary to investigate how the duration of anticoagulation therapy changes with evolving guidelines and increasingly widespread DOAC use.

### The postoperative splenic / portal vein thrombosis after splenectomy and its prevention – an unresolved issue [^116jdA7Q]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing splenectomy have an increased risk of splenic/portal vein thrombosis. We used several databases to identify publications dealing with this risk and analyzed incidence, risk factors and outcome. The risk of splenic portal vein thrombosis has been addressed in prospective and retrospective randomized or non-randomized studies. All studies combined, the overall risk is 3.3%. Risk factors are big spleens (i.e. myeloproliferative disorders) and hereditary hemolytic anemias, whereas the risk is low in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and trauma. The incidence is approximately the same in laparoscopic and open splenectomy. The median time from splenectomy to symptomatic splenic vein thrombosis is 8–12 days. Postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis ranged from no prophylaxis to heparin for seven days or longer. Treatment of symptomatic splenic vein thrombosis with heparin and warfarin leads to complete resolution of thrombosis in 67%, to partial resolution in 13%, but persistent occlusion, portal hypertension or cavernoma occurred in 20%. The long-term outcome of treatment failures is unknown. Well-designed randomized studies on the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after splenectomy are urgently needed.

For "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis of intrahepatic branches or < 50% of main trunk, splenic vein, or mesenteric vein", "Consider observation with serial cross-sectional imaging every 3 months", whereas "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis with 50%–100% occlusion of main PV or mesenteric veins" and "Symptomatic or transplant candidate" lead to "Consider timely AC" (anticoagulation). For "Complete, chronic (> 6 months) PVT with collateralization", the pathway is "No anticoagulation, unlikely to recanalize". Patients with the largest potential anticoagulation benefits are listed as "Awaiting liver transplant", "Progressive thrombus", and "Additional hypercoagulable state (ie, inherited thrombophilia, MPN)".

### Splenic infarction in acute infectious mononucleosis [^1175xdu5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The evaluation of a febrile patient with acute abdominal pain represents a frequent yet possibly challenging situation in the emergency department (ED). Splenic infarction is an uncommon complication of infectious mononucleosis, and may have a wide range of clinical presentations, from dramatic to more subtle. Its pathogenesis is still incompletely understood, yet it may be associated with the occurrence of transient prothrombotic factors.

Case Report

We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with fever, sore throat, left upper quadrant abdominal pain, and splenomegaly, with no history of recent trauma. Laboratory tests revealed a markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and positive lupus anticoagulant. Abdominal ultrasonography showed several hypoechoic areas in the spleen consistent with multiple infarctions. Magnetic resonance imaging eventually confirmed the diagnosis. He was admitted for observation and supportive treatment, and was discharged in good condition after 7 days. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Spontaneous splenic infarction should be considered in the differential list of patients presenting with left upper quadrant abdominal pain and features of infectious mononucleosis; the diagnosis, however, may not be straightforward, as clinical presentation may also be subtle, and abdominal ultrasonography, which is often used as a first-line imaging modality in pediatric EDs, has low sensitivity in this scenario and may easily miss it. Furthermore, although treatment is mainly supportive, close observation for possible complications is necessary.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^111A3jx2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study suggests that a large maximum diameter of the splenic vein (≥ 17 mm) on CT before PSE and a high percentage of infarcted spleen (≥ 58.2%) are associated with the risk of PVST appearance and growth after PSE. When the maximum diameter of the splenic vein is large (≥ 17 mm) before PSE, earlier testing may be recommended to detect the development of thrombus.

### A floating mural thrombus in the ascending aorta can cause multiorgan infarction [^115NGyU6]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his 50s with sudden-onset left-sided subcostal pain was diagnosed with splenic infarction by thoracoabdominal CT with contrast enhancement, which also revealed a mural thrombus in the thoracoabdominal aorta, raising the possibility of aortic dissection. The electrocardiographic findings were normal and transthoracic echocardiography did not detect thrombus in the heart. Antihypertensive medication was administered on admission, and anticoagulation therapy was started after he developed left renal infarction and occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Nevertheless, he subsequently sustained an acute cerebral infarction. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed an abnormal floating structure in the ascending aorta, which was surgically removed and finally diagnosed as an organising thrombus. Although most of the causes of multiorgan infarction are cardiogenic, floating mural thrombus can also be a cause. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary for patients with recurring severe embolisms even when aortic dissection has not been completely ruled out.

### Don't treat with an anticoagulant for more than three… [^111or4Ep]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is potentially harmful and costly. Patients with a first VTE triggered by a major, transient risk factor such as surgery, trauma, or an intravascular catheter are at low risk for recurrence once the risk factor has resolved and an adequate treatment regimen with anticoagulation has been completed. Evidence-based and consensus guidelines recommend three months of anticoagulation over shorter or longer periods of anticoagulation in patients with VTE in the setting of a reversible provoking factor. By ensuring a patient receives an appropriate regimen of anticoagulation, clinicians may avoid unnecessary harm, reduce health care expenses, and improve quality of life. This Choosing Wisely recommendation is not intended to apply to VTE associated with non-major risk factors, as the risk of recurrent VTE in these groups is either intermediate or poorly defined.

A total of 1343 (57.4%) patients with AF and CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk score ≥ 2 discharged alive from hospital after MI without anticoagulation therapy died or suffered a stroke during follow-up, while 2167 (45.1%) patients discharged with anticoagulation therapy died and/or suffered a stroke (table 2). Patients prescribed anticoagulation therapy had a reduced risk of all types of stroke or death (multivariate-adjusted HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.8, p < 0.001) compared with patients without a prescription of anticoagulation therapy (figure 4). Subdistribution HR for non-fatal stroke (all type) with all cause death as competing event was 0.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.1, p = 0.116) for patients with versus patients without a prescription of anticoagulation therapy.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^112y1KYQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For more than a decade, guidelines have recommended a limited 3 months of anticoagulation for the treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). How closely real‐world practice follows guideline recommendations is not well described.

Methods and Results

In our multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated trends in anticoagulation duration for patients enrolled in the MAQI 2 (Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative) registry who were receiving anticoagulation for a provoked VTE. The MAQI 2 registry comprises 6 centers in Michigan that manage patients' long‐term anticoagulation. We identified 474 patients on warfarin and 302 patients on direct oral anticoagulants who were receiving anticoagulation for a primary indication of provoked VTE between 2008 and 2020. Using a predefined threshold of 120 days (3 months plus a buffer period), predictors of extended anticoagulant use were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Most patients received > 120 days of anticoagulation, regardless of which medication was used. The median (25th–75th percentile) length of treatment for patients taking warfarin was 142 (91–234) days and for direct oral anticoagulants was 180 (101–360) days. Recurrent VTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.75 [95% CI, 1.67–4.53]), history of myocardial infarction (OR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.32–11.7]), and direct oral anticoagulant rather than warfarin use (OR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59–3.08]) were independently associated with prolonged anticoagulation.

Conclusions

In our cohort of patients with provoked VTE, most patients received anticoagulation for longer than the guideline‐recommended 3 months. This demonstrates a potential opportunity to improve care delivery and reduce anticoagulant‐associated bleeding risk.

### Thromboembolic complications after splenectomy for hematologic diseases [^113cCkiS]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Thromboembolic complications following splenectomy for hematologic diseases occur in up to 10% of patients and may range from portal vein thrombosis (PVT) to pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Up to now there exist no recommendations for the duration and intensity of prophylactic anticoagulation, which usually follows local institutional protocols. We report on three consecutive patients with severe portal vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism — one with fatal outcome — 7 to 35 days after splenectomy for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immunothrombocytopenia, and indolent lymphoma, respectively. Incidence and pathophysiology of thromboembolic events (TE) in this patient group as well as prophylactic anticoagulation will be discussed, including a review of the current literature on this topic.

### Rivaroxaban for the treatment of noncirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis: an interventional prospective cohort study [^111Zch3L]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was major bleeding during the 3 months of active treatment and up to 2 days after the end of study treatment. Major bleeding events were classified using a modified ISTH definition, the European Medicines Agency definition. According to this definition, bleeding was defined as major if it was associated with death; if it was overt and associated with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration by at least 2.0 g/L or with the need for transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells; if it occurred in a critical area or organ such as retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular, intraspinal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome; or if it resulted in surgical intervention.

Secondary outcomes included all-cause and SVT-related mortality; clinically relevant, nonmajor bleeding occurred during the 3 months of active treatment and up to 2 days after the end of study treatment; detection of alanine aminotransferase levels of 3 times the upper limit of the normal range or higher with or without bilirubin levels of 2 times the upper limit of the normal range or higher during follow-up; patency of the portal vein trunk and at least 1 of its main right or left branches and patency of the superior and inferior mesenteric veins and of the splenic veins; symptomatic recurrent SVT; symptomatic VTE in other sites; and mesenteric infarction.

In patients who died during follow-up, death certificates and, if available, autopsy findings were reviewed to establish the cause of death.

Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was defined as any overt bleeding requiring a medical intervention, unscheduled contact with a physician, or temporary cessation of oral anticoagulants or causing discomfort for the patient (such as pain) or impairment of activities of daily living and not meeting any of the criteria for major bleeding.

Major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were confirmed with investigational reports, including clinic notes, hemoglobin results, and imaging. Diagnostic tests were performed as per standard of care.

Patency of SVT was defined as the normal appearance of a previously obstructed segment as opposed to "obstruction", defined as the presence of solid material in the vascular lumen. In case of reduction of thrombus extension as compared with the baseline test or patency of at least 1 previously occluded multiple vessels, patients with obstruction were subclassified as having partial recanalization.

Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis — anticoagulation outcomes and adjunctive therapies are summarized: In a systematic review of noncirrhotic acute MVT, 68% received anticoagulation among 80 patients, and mild to moderate self-limited bleeding occurred in 10 cases. Of 50 patients with follow-up imaging, 50% developed long-term sequelae of portal hypertension over a median follow-up of about 2 years. Anticoagulation is given for a finite duration of 3–6 months for reversible etiologies, while indefinite anticoagulation is required for inherited or acquired thrombophilia. In an observational series using streptokinase thrombolysis, treatment was successful in 19 cases and was associated with bleeding in 6 cases without need for major intervention. When intestinal infarction or gangrene is suspected or confirmed, patients are treated with surgical resection, and second-look laparotomy is often required in extensive infarction.

### Comparing clinical outcomes of vitamin K antagonists vs non-vitamin K antagonists in anticoagulant therapy for mesenteric venous thrombosis [^11311az9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: A study comparing treatment outcomes for 44 patients receiving either vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin K antagonists for mesenteric venous thrombosis reported no evidence of recurrence or symptom recurrence in either group (0% vs 0%). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in major bleeding events (0% vs 4%; p = 0.489).
- **Take Home Message**: Non-vitamin K antagonists could provide a safe and effective alternative to vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of mesenteric venous thrombosis.

Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a thrombotic process involving the portal, mesenteric, splenic, and hepatic veins either alone or in combination. This is a rare and non-specific symptom that makes diagnosis difficult. However, because of recent developments in imaging diagnostic equipment (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging, and Doppler ultrasound), the prevalence of diagnoses from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients has increased compared with the past. To prevent intestinal infarction, portal hypertension, and thrombosis recurrence, the key principle of treating MVT is recanalization or prevention of the thrombotic process.

Anticoagulant therapy can be considered the first-line therapy. Prior to anticoagulant therapy, physicians must evaluate the bleeding risk, which is primarily related to portal hypertension complications such as ascites, varices, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage at the time of clinical presentation. Without significant contraindication, patients with acute symptomatic MVT are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy. Generally, low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is used first, followed by vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin K antagonists. Multiple studies in recent years have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and it is recommended that NOACs be used to treat typical sites of venous thromboembolism, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. However, insufficient studies have been performed on the usage of NOACs in patients with MVT.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with MVT.

### Surgical repair vs splenectomy in patients with severe traumatic spleen injuries [^1133GYYx]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Southern California. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines. Informed consent was not obtained because the data are deidentified, in accordance with 45 CFR §46.

Study Design and Setting

This is a trauma registry–based cohort study using the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database from January 2013 to December 2019. The TQIP database is maintained by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and aggregates patient data from more than 760 trauma centers across the US.

Participants: Eligibility Criteria

The database was queried to identify all adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years old) who sustained severe splenic injury, defined as an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 to 5 (range, 1 [minor] to 6 [maximal]). Exclusion criteria included hospital transfers and missing information on splenic procedure timing, age, sex, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (range, 3 [worst] to 15 [best]).

Only patients who underwent laparotomy with splenic repair or splenectomy within 6 hours of admission were considered for final analysis. Patients who underwent splenectomy after initial splenic repair were considered as having a failed splenic repair.

Variables

Patient variables were extracted from the TQIP database (refer to the eAppendix and eTable 1 in Supplement 1 for detailed definitions). Demographic characteristics included age, sex, race (Asian, Black, White, and any other race not otherwise specified), height (centimeters), and weight (kilograms). In the TQIP database, race is self-reported by patients or identified by a family member; data on race are included here because race may be a potential confounder for our primary end point and can, therefore, be considered in the analysis. Comorbidities included steroid use, current smoker, diabetes, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, respiratory disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, disseminated cancer and/or receipt of chemotherapy, dementia, substance abuse disorder, bleeding disorder, and anticoagulation therapy. Admission data included heart rate, systolic blood pressure, GCS score, and mechanism of injury (blunt vs penetrating), including treatment at a level I trauma center. Injury data included anatomic location and severity of injury using the AIS. Details on surgical splenic procedures, including procedure timing, were also included.

In the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease, novel oral anticoagulants have emerged as alternatives to warfarin. A major challenge continues to be the reversal of their anticoagulant effect in the case of life-threatening haemorrhagic complications. We report a case of spontaneous splenic rupture treated by splenic artery embolisation in a 77-year-old woman who was anticoagulated with rivaroxaban.

### Diagnosis and treatment of splenic torsion in children: preoperative thrombocytosis predicts splenic infarction [^114ccxSb]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Adjacent organs involvement is common, occurring in 28% of all splenic torsions, such as pancreatic tail torsion, gastric volvulus and varices, intestinal obstruction, and urinary tract compression. The failure of fusion of dorsal mesogastrium to the retroperitoneum may also cause the pancreatic tail becoming intraperitoneal, instead of retroperitoneal, which can be involved in splenic pedicle torsion. Usually after detorsion and splenopexy or splenectomy, the pancreatic tail can be replaced with no further complications. Distal pancreatectomy should only be reserved for cases with pancreatic tail necrosis due to torsion. Gastric volvulus may also be replaced without further gastropexy. Although rare, gastric varices or variceal bleeding may occur in patients with splenic torsion, and can be aggravated by the coexisting gastric volvulus, namely left-sided portal hypertension. This is caused by splenic vein occlusion (torsion and/or thrombosis), which leads to the blood outflow of spleen retrograde filling the short gastric veins, left gastric vein, and left gastro-epiploic vein. There should be no esophageal varices in left-sided portal hypertension. In case 5, pancreatic tail torsion, mescenteroaxial gastric volvulus with left-sided portal hypertension (gastric fundus varices, engorged left gastric vein and gastro-epiploic vein) coexisted. After detorsion, splenectomy, and simply replacement of pancreatic tail and stomach, no gastropexy or distal pancreatectomy were performed. The postoperative CT showed normal position of pancreas and stomach, as well as obviously relived left-sided portal hypertension.

All patients had good prognosis and no complications occurred except case 5. In case 5 a transient and asymptomatic thrombus was detected in the sagittal portion of left portal vein, which resolved spontaneously within 3 days. Since this patient had a large splenic vein thrombosis, we consider the thrombus had fallen off from the splenic vein stump causing thromboembolism. Portal vein thrombosis after splenectomy is a known complication, occurring in 0.5%-55% cases depending on different diagnostic standard and method, which generally needs anticoagulation treatment. But it's postulated that many undiagnosed asymptomatic patients were not treated with no consequences. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with splenic torsion. We consider case 5 was not a portal vein thrombosis event, but a thromboembolism event, and since the patient was asymptomatic and the portal vein blood flow was not affected, no anticoagulation treatment was given under close ultrasonographic monitoring.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1148GrkE]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Splenic arterial embolization — technical approach and follow-up are outlined as follows: Distal Gelfoam embolization of large portions or the entire organ causes parenchymal infarction and increases the risk of abscess formation; subselective embolization of a large, focal pseudoaneurysm or a vessel with brisk intraparenchymal hemorrhage is sometimes indicated; however, this must be completed prior to proximal embolization to prevent blocking access to the injured vessel before the injury is adequately treated; routine post-discharge imaging after splenic embolization in the asymptomatic patient is not recommended.

### Early pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after splenic artery embolization is not associated with an increased risk of rebleed [^116upTwr]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the setting of blunt traumatic visceral injury remains controversial. A total of 181 patients underwent splenic artery embolization (SAE) and began pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis at a median time of 59.5 hours (interquartile range, 46 hours). Six patients required splenectomy for rebleed. Fifty-one patients underwent SAE but did not receive anticoagulation therapy since they were considered low risk for VTE, and no splenectomies were performed (P = 1). Multivariate analysis showed no increased risk of need for splenectomy after beginning anticoagulation within 24 hours after SAE (P = 0.441). This study suggests that patients found to be at a high VTE risk should be considered for thromboprophylaxis within 24 hours after SAE.

Guidance statements — management of recent PVT by clinical setting and extent of portal vein (PV) occlusion are as follows: "In all patients with recent PVT and concern for intestinal ischemia, immediate consultation with surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, and hematology is recommended, with the need for surgery in cases of intestinal infarction". "In patients without cirrhosis and with recent PVT, directed antithrombotic therapy should be considered in order to avoid intestinal ischemia and prevent the development of chronic PVT with portal hypertension". For patients with cirrhosis, "Treatment should be considered on a case-by- case basis", and "Decisions for treatment of an individual patient should be based on expected benefit and minimization of clot extension risk". In cirrhosis with minimally occlusive "(< 50% obstruction of the lumen)" thrombosis of the main PV, "observation with serial imaging every 3 months without therapy is reasonable. Treatment for progressive clot should then be considered in this setting". The guidance also notes a separate scenario of "occlusive or partially occlusive (> 50% obstruction of the lumen) thrombosis of the main PV or mesenteric veins".

Prognosis

All patients were advised to accept vaccines against encapsuled bacteria (multi-valent pneumococcal vaccine, H influenzae type b vaccine, and the meningococcal vaccine) 2 weeks after surgery. The median time of postoperative follow-up was 43.4 (range 9.4–74.1) months. In case 4, two days after laparoscopic splenectomy a thrombus (0.6 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm) was detected in the sagittal portion of left portal vein (Rex recessus) by ultrasonography, which didn't cause any adverse effects or symptoms. Ultrasonography showed that the thrombus resolved spontaneously within 3 days, leaving no trace on contrast CT on the 5th postoperative day. This was considered as a thromboembolism event, that the thrombus had fallen off from the splenic vein stump and stayed in left portal vein transiently. No other postoperative complications or postsplenectomy complications were noticed during follow-ups in all patients.

REVASCULARIZE

Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, we recommend completing revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories (arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, NOMI, and MVT), the relative distribution of which depends upon the patient population being served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

F. Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all AMI diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have concurrent atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Thrombolytic therapy is an option, but it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse clot and risks progression of bowel ischemia. Postintervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small-vessel thrombosis and is recommended as long as the source of potential emboli remains.

G. Arterial thrombosis has increased in recent decades, accounting for about 40% of all cases. The gradual formation of plaque can eventually progress to critical stenosis with thrombosis of mesenteric vessels, and patients with acute on chronic disease will often have concurrent atherosclerosis and stenosis of the celiac artery. Thrombosis typically occurs at the origin of the celiac trunk, SMA, and inferior mesenteric artery. Endovascular treatment options include thrombectomy and angioplasty with or without stenting. Compared with open techniques, endovascular revascularization is associated with lower short -and long-term mortality; however, there is no significant difference in the need for second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. – If bypass is performed, antegrade is preferred over retrograde because of a lower reintervention rate. If the patient has shock, peritonitis, or evidence of bowel necrosis on CT, then a joint procedure is recommended, including open revascularization, to reduce time to resection of necrotic intestine.

### Follow-up strategies for patients with splenic trauma managed non-operatively: the 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document [^113Vud1S]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

When looking at the primary studies included in the mentioned meta-analyses, patients were usually dichotomized into study groups based on VTE prophylaxis initiation time: early (≤ 48 h or ≤ 72) versus late (> 48 h or > 72 h). In the study by Rostas et al. there were no enoxaparin-related hemorrhagic complications or hemorrhages necessitating operative intervention in any group. In Alejandro et al. early use of LMWH was not associated with an increased rate of blood transfusions or an increased rate of failure of NOM. In the early group, two (4%) patients failed NOM compared with four (6%) patients in the late group (P = 0.593). The number of patients requiring blood transfusions within the first 5 days after admission was 25 (50.0%) in the early group and 36 (56.2%) in the late group (P = 0.507). The average number of blood units per patient within the first 5 days after admission was 3.2 ± 1.5 in the early group and 3.0 ± 1.8 in the late group (P = 0.782). In a retrospective study including patients aged 15 years or older who sustained blunt splenic, liver, and/or kidney injuries from January 2005 to December 2008, NOM failure rates and blood transfusion requirements were compared between patients who got LMWH early (≤ 3 days), patients who got LMWH late (> 3 days), and patients who did not receive LMWH. After adjusting for demographic differences, the overall blood transfusion requirements for the early LMWH group were significantly lower than for patients with late LMWH administration (3.0 ± 5.3 units vs. 6.4 ± 9.9 units). When analyzing specifically the outcomes of patients with splenic injuries, the overall failure rate of NOM was 7.8% and was not different between the early, late, and no LMWH group after adjustment for differences in demographics. Of those receiving LMWH early, 50.0% had a high-grade lesion, and these patients showed a similar failure rate compared with high-grade injured patients who received LMWH late or those who did not receive LMWH. Similarly, in another retrospective cohort study, prophylactic LMWH or UH was administered at two different time intervals (within 72 h after admission or 72 h after admission) in patients with blunt solid organ injuries. In contrast, one group was not put under heparin at all. Although not statistically significant, VTE was more frequent in the no heparin group compared to the early (≤ 72 h) and late (> 72 h) heparin groups (10.8 vs. 4.8 vs. 1.3%). Failed NOM occurred only in patients with splenic injuries and was significantly more frequent in the no heparin group than in the early and late heparin group. Also, Joseph et al. reported that early enoxaparin-based anticoagulation might be a safe option in trauma patients with blunt solid organ injury. They found no difference in hemorrhagic complication and NOM failure rate in patients with early (< 48 h), intermediate (48–72 h), and late (> 72 h) VTE prophylaxis. Conversely, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with late initiation of prophylaxis. In Schellenberg et al. early prophylaxis patients had significantly fewer DVT but similar rates of PE compared to late prophylaxis patients. Traumatic brain injury was the only significant risk factor for late prophylaxis, and no patient in either group required delayed intervention (operative or interventional radiology) for bleeding. There was also no difference in the volume of post-prophylaxis blood transfusion. Similarly, Griffard et al. demonstrated that administering DVT prophylaxis sooner than 48 h does not increase failure of NOM of AAST Grade III–V splenic injuries. In their prospective study, the authors included 104 high-grade (AAST III–V) splenic trauma patients who received prophylaxis with UH or LMWH within 72 h of diagnosis. They observed six failures of NOM, and there was no statistically significant difference between the < 24 h and > 24 groups or between the < 48 h and 48–72 h groups. Moreover, in the linear regression analysis model describing the time to initiation of DVT prophylaxis using age, sex, splenic injury grade, and ISS, the NOM failure rate decreased by 0.00002% for each hour prior to giving DVT prophylaxis (P = 0.111). From this, the authors proposed a non- inferiority statement that initiating DVT prophylaxis within 48 h does not increase the failure rate compared to patients receiving DVT prophylaxis between 48 and 72 h. The results reported by Kwok et al. corroborated the statement that early initiation within < 48 h of VTE prophylaxis is safe in patients with blunt splenic injuries treated non-operatively, but also it may be safe as early as 24 h. Lin et al. explored the American College of Surgeons TQIP database from 2013 to 2014 to identify adult patients who underwent NOM for isolated AAST Grade III–V blunt splenic injuries. The incidence of NOM failure after the initiation of VTE prophylaxis was compared between two groups: VTE prophylaxis ≤ 48 h after admission (early prophylaxis group) and > 48 h (late prophylaxis group). There was no significant difference in the NOM failure rate after initiating VTE prophylaxis between the early and late prophylaxis groups. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, early initiation of VTE prophylaxis was not significantly associated with NOM failure. Results of the subgroup analysis in patients with Grade IV–V splenic injuries also suggest that early administration of VTE prophylaxis is not significantly associated with an increased incidence of NOM failure. Skarupa et al. performed a 2-year retrospective analysis of 36,187 patients from the American College of Surgeons TQIP, including all adult trauma patients with blunt solid organ injuries who underwent NOM. Patients were stratified into three groups based on the timing of VTE chemoprophylaxis (early, ≤ 48 h of injury; late, > 48 h of injury; and no prophylaxis group). After controlling for confounders, patients receiving early prophylaxis had lower rates of DVT and PE than the no prophylaxis and late prophylaxis groups, but no difference between the three groups regarding the post-prophylaxis blood transfusions, failure of NOM, and mortality was reported. Also, in the study by Khatsilouskaya et al. early heparin administration within 72 h from hospital admission was not associated with an increased NOM failure rate or higher in-hospital mortality. According to Gaitanidis et al. thromboprophylaxis within 48 h should be considered in patients with blunt solid organ injuries undergoing NOM who are at low likelihood of bleeding. Conversely, in the presence of a higher likelihood of bleeding, along with a history of diabetes mellitus, or in the case of splenic and high-grade liver injuries, the authors suggest an intermediate delay (48–72 h) of thromboprophylaxis.

### Duration of anticoagulation: applying the guidelines and beyond [^117L7tse]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Despite an improved understanding of the risk factors underlying venous thromboembolism (VTE), extensive clinical investigation, and detailed clinical guidelines, the decision to extend anticoagulation indefinitely for an individual patient with VTE is often problematic. Patients with VTE in association with major surgery, trauma, immobilization, or pregnancy are at relatively low risk of recurrence and generally do not require more than 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy. For patients with a first unprovoked, or idiopathic, episode of VTE, an individualized approach should be taken in deciding on the duration of anticoagulation based on the patient's recurrence and bleeding risk, as well as their personal preference. Although the presence of genetic thrombophilic disorders (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations; deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) predispose patients to a first episode of VTE, there is inconsistent data on whether testing for these defects changes patient outcomes or should alter their management. In patients with a single unprovoked VTE, measurement of D-dimer several weeks following the completion of anticoagulant therapy appears useful in stratifying patients with a first unprovoked episode of VTE with regard to recurrence risk. Through a series of clinical vignettes, the utility of the laboratory in risk-stratifying patients with respect to recurrence risk will be discussed, along with decision making regarding the duration of anticoagulation. The potential impact of having a nonremovable inferior vena caval filter will also be addressed.

The mean age at baseline was 56 years (range 35–82 years) with 20 (39%) women and 31 (61%) men. All patients had the JAK2V617F mutation with 16% of subjects being newly diagnosed; 84% had known disease with a median duration of 2.2 years. One-third (33%) of patients were undergoing treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) upon study entry. At baseline, the mean ± SD hematocrit, platelets, and leukocytes were 45% ± 4.0%, 457 ×10⁹/L ± 187 ×10⁹/L and 11.8 × 10⁹/L ± 5.2 × 10⁹/L, respectively. Median spleen size was 13.2 cm with 16 (31%) having splenomegaly (defined as a longitudinal diameter of > 12 cm for women and > 13 cm for men). Eleven patients (22%) had a prior history of a major cardiovascular event including pulmonary embolism (6), stroke (2), myocardial infarction (2) and portal vein thrombosis (1).

### Essential thrombocythemia with portal vein thrombosis and splenic infarction successfully treated with platelet apheresis [^114uwCks]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 63-year-old diabetic woman presented to the outpatient clinic with a 1-week history of abdominal pain. On complete evaluation, she was diagnosed to have essential thrombocythemia. Abdominal imaging revealed portal vein thrombosis with a large splenic infarct. The patient was started on anticoagulant, antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapy. In view of persistent high platelet count, plasma apheresis was done, following which the patient's platelet counts were reduced. Essential thrombocythemia has a high rate of complications, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Few cases of this disease and its treatment have been described in the literature, especially pertaining to the Indian scenario. Further studies are needed to establish a multidisciplinary algorithm for its diagnosis and to elucidate the guidelines for the successful treatment of the condition.

### Pediatric splenic infarction: assessment of associated clinical conditions and outcome [^113cSAzy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric splenic infarction (SI) is rare yet clinically significant. Publications regarding this complication are mostly limited to case reports. This is a retrospective study examining SI etiology, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes among children. Twenty-two patients (median age: 7.9 years) were included, mostly with pre-existing hematological diseases. Splenomegaly (72%), thrombocytopenia, and anemia were common. Most of the patients did not receive antithrombotic therapy yet only two patients experienced recurrences. During follow up 36% of patients died, however no fatalities were attributed to thrombotic or bleeding complications.

### Spontaneous splenic hemorrhage after initiation of dabigatran (pradaxa) for atrial fibrillation [^116pCCs9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT) is an oral anticoagulant that produces a reliable, dose-dependent anticoagulant effect without the need for routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, acting like other members in its class (bivalirudin, argatroban) to impede the clotting process through selective and reversible binding with both free and clot-bound thrombin. Dabigatran anticoagulates rapidly: plasma levels peak 2 hours after absorption, with a half-life that ranges between 12 and 17 hours. Dabigatran was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2010 after it compared favorably with warfarin in a large clinical trial studying its efficacy in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Currently, there is no laboratory test on the market by which a physician can quantify the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, nor is there any antidote to reverse a life-threatening bleed should it occur. We present a case of a patient with splenic hemorrhagic soon after initiation of dabigatran.

### Splenic infarction after warfarin overdose treatment: is It a coincidence or complication? [^111wsM7X]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Splenic infarction is a rare clinical condition seen in the emergency department and can mimic acute abdomen. Hematologic, vascular, and thromboembolic events are considered in the etiology. Treatment options vary between symptomatic treatment and splenectomy. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. In overdose situations, there is a possibility of bleeding in every part of the body. Prothrombin complex concentrates, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma are used in the treatment of warfarin overdose. We describe a case of splenic infarction coexistent with warfarin overdose treatment, which has never been published in literature. Prothrombin complex concentrate was administered to the patient because of warfarin overdose. A spleen infarction was detected in computerized tomography of the patient after the occurrence of abdominal pain, and there was no infarction three days before hospitalization. The patient was monitored with symptomatic treatment in the general surgery clinic and discharged without the need for operation. In the pathogenesis, it was thought that prothrombin complex concentrates might be caused by early thrombosis or by warfarin not affecting the existing clot. Emergency physicians should not forget spleen infarction in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain.

### How I treat splanchnic vein thrombosis [^114HwNjX]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a clinical challenge. Depending on the site of thrombosis, patients are at risk of developing liver insufficiency, portal hypertension, or bowel infarction and may experience recurrence in both the splanchnic veins and other vein segments. To prevent recurrence, anticoagulant therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and is often continued for an indefinite period of time. However, active bleeding is not infrequent at the time of SVT diagnosis, and major risk factors for bleeding, such as esophageal varices or a low platelet count, are frequently present in these patients. In real-world clinical practice, a proportion of SVT patients are left untreated because the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy are felt to exceed its benefits. However, the majority of patients receive anticoagulant drugs, with heterogeneous timing of initiation, drug choice, and dosages. Evidence to drive treatment decisions is limited because no randomized controlled trials have been carried out in these patients. This review provides practical guidance for the use of anticoagulant drugs in patients presenting with SVT, including symptomatic as well as incidentally detected events.

### Massive pulmonary thromboembolism in a pediatric patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: a case-based review emphasizing management [^115zrVK6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

American Society of Hematology established management guidelines regarding pediatric VTE in 2018. According to these guidelines, patients with cerebral sino/venous thrombosis should receive anticoagulation but not thrombolytics. Furthermore, pediatric patients with symptomatic DVT and PE should receive anticoagulation, while asymptomatic patients may or may not receive treatment since adult data suggest that treatment is not required for most asymptomatic patients. However, the current opinion of most clinicians leans towards treating even asymptomatic pediatric VTE cases. Additionally, ASH recommended the utilization of thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation in pediatric patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise. Our patient did not receive thrombolytics because he was hemodynamically stable, and he recovered promptly with anticoagulation. ASH did not prioritize either LMWH or vitamin K antagonists as first line treatment; both can be utilized. Anticoagulation treatment was initiated in six out of seven patients during VTE. Additionally, one patient received antiplatelet treatment along with LMWH contrary to the recommendations of ASH guidelines. The duration of the anticoagulation was not addressed. ASH recommended that patients with provoked VTE should not receive anticoagulation for longer than 3 months. Although there is no data regarding the duration of anticoagulation in our VTE patients, we recommend that continuing anticoagulation at least until disease remission is achieved due to the increased risk of thrombosis during active disease. However, there is no sufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness and relapse risk reduction of anticoagulation longer than three or six months in pediatric EGPA patients with VTE and inactive disease.

EGPA patients with arterial thrombosis and infarctions should be treated as having vasculitic involvement and managed with immunosuppressive agents. There is no available evidence regarding antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment for AAV patients with arterial thrombosis. However, antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment may worsen the clinical picture due to hemorrhage risk of already vulnerable inflamed arteries or aneurysms in certain vasculitides, including Behçet's disease. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of both the possible risks and the lack of evidence of efficacy before utilizing anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment for arterial thromboses. Future studies should investigate the efficacy and risks of anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment for arterial thrombosis in pediatric EGPA patients to establish clinical practice recommendations. In our review, intracardiac thrombus was the most common site, followed by cerebral infarcts. The clinicians utilized anticoagulation for four patients and one of them received antiplatelet along with anticoagulation, and one patient received only antiplatelet treatment. Additionally, two patients required surgical intervention out of seven arterial thrombosis patients.

### Follow-up strategies for patients with splenic trauma managed non-operatively: the 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document [^113D2Xhg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2017, the World Society of Emergency Surgery published its guidelines for the management of adult and pediatric patients with splenic trauma. Several issues regarding the follow-up of patients with splenic injuries treated with NOM remained unsolved.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi method, we sought to explore ongoing areas of controversy in the NOM of splenic trauma and reach a consensus among a group of 48 international experts from five continents (Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, America) concerning optimal follow-up strategies in patients with splenic injuries treated with NOM.

Results

Consensus was reached on eleven clinical research questions and 28 recommendations with an agreement rate ≥ 80%. Mobilization after 24 h in low-grade splenic trauma patients (WSES Class I, AAST Grades I-II) was suggested, while in patients with high-grade splenic injuries (WSES Classes II-III, AAST Grades III-V), if no other contraindications to early mobilization exist, safe mobilization of the patient when three successive hemoglobins 8 h apart after the first are within 10% of each other was considered safe according to the panel. The panel suggests adult patients to be admitted to hospital for 1 day (for low-grade splenic injuries-WSES Class I, AAST Grades I-II) to 3 days (for high-grade splenic injuries-WSES Classes II-III, AAST Grades III-V), with those with high-grade injuries requiring admission to a monitored setting. In the absence of specific complications, the panel suggests DVT and VTE prophylaxis with LMWH to be started within 48–72 h from hospital admission. The panel suggests splenic artery embolization (SAE) as the first-line intervention in patients with hemodynamic stability and arterial blush on CT scan, irrespective of injury grade. Regarding patients with WSES Class II blunt splenic injuries (AAST Grade III) without contrast extravasation, a low threshold for SAE has been suggested in the presence of risk factors for NOM failure. The panel also suggested angiography and eventual SAE in all hemodynamically stable adult patients with WSES Class III injuries (AAST Grades IV-V), even in the absence of CT blush, especially when concomitant surgery that requires change of position is needed. Follow-up imaging with contrast-enhanced ultrasound/CT scan in 48–72 h post-admission of trauma in splenic injuries WSES Class II (AAST Grade III) or higher treated with NOM was considered the best strategy for timely detection of vascular complications.

Conclusion

This consensus document could help guide future prospective studies aiming at validating the suggested strategies through the implementation of prospective trauma databases and the subsequent production of internationally endorsed guidelines on the issue.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^111MKk3q]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

Portal vein thromboses (PVTs) are common in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with advanced portal hypertension and mortality. The treatment of PVTs remains a clinical challenge due to limited evidence and competing risks of PVT-associated complications vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity in PVT phenotype based on anatomic, host, and disease characteristics, and an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options further complicate PVT management. This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) aims to provide best practice advice for the evaluation and management of PVT in cirrhosis, including the role of direct oral anticoagulants and endovascular interventions.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with PVTs identified on Doppler ultrasound should undergo cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for malignancy, and document the degree of lumen occlusion, clot extent, and chronicity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboemboli or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury. If available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Consider observation, with repeat imaging every 3 months until clot regression, in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia and recent (< 6 months) thrombosis involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches or when there is < 50% occlusion of the main portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Anticoagulation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia who develop recent (< 6 months) PVT that is > 50% occlusive or involves the main portal vein or mesenteric vessels. Patients who have increased benefit of recanalization include those with involvement of more than 1 vascular bed, those with thrombus progression, potential liver transplantation candidates, and those with inherited thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Anticoagulation is not advised for patients with cirrhosis with chronic (> 6 months) PVT with complete occlusion with collateralization (cavernous transformation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable anticoagulant options for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Decision making should be individualized and informed by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class. Direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients with compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B cirrhosis and offer convenience as their dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response to treatment. If clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in nontransplantation patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may be considered for selected patients with cirrhosis and PVT who have additional indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, such as those with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding. Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may also be considered for transplantation candidates if recanalization can facilitate the technical feasibility of transplantation.

### Frequency and treatment of venous thromboembolic events in patients with space-occupying brain infarction and decompressive craniectomy [^115BByPn]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Characterisation of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients with space-occupying brain infarction and decompressive craniectomy. DVT deep vein thrombosis, PE pulmonary embolism.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the study population

Analysing risk factors, patients with VTE were significantly younger (60.2 ± 10.5 vs. 69.5 ± 12.2 years, Mann-Whitney-U test, p = 0.004; table 2), had more often undergone DC (73.3% vs. 26.6%, χ 2 test, p < 0.001; table 2), and the cumulative duration of central venous catheter was longer (21.2 ± 9.4 days vs 13.2 ± 8.4 days, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.003; table 2).

Table 2
Comparison of demographic and clinical data between patients with/without venous thromboembolic events (VTEs)

After the diagnosis of VTE, therapeutic anticoagulation was immediately initiated in all patients: 13 (86.7%) patients received UFH, 1 (6.7%) patient was anticoagulated with LMWH and 1 (6.7%) patient with fondaparinux (table 3). In case of therapeutic anticoagulation with UFH, the targeted range of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 50–60 s in nine patients, 50 s in two patients, 40–50 s in one patient and 60–80 s in one patient (table 3). Bleeding complications occurred in 3 of 15 patients: one asymptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage into the infarcted tissue and two extracranial bleedings (one splenic haemorrhage with haematoperitoneum and one patient with a bleeding from a duodenal ulcer). All three patients with bleeding complications were anticoagulated with UFH with a targeted aPTT of 50–60 s. In addition, in case the thrombosis was associated with a central venous catheter, the catheter was removed after starting the anticoagulation.

### Complete splenic infarction in association with COVID-19 [^113Lf4ss]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system. As a novel disease, understanding of its management and complications continues to grow. Herein, we present a case of almost complete splenic infarction in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. This case highlights the need to maintain diagnostic vigilance whilst investigating secondary complications of COVID-19. It is also important to stress the high incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19, which may occur anywhere in the vasculature.

### Follow-up strategies for patients with splenic trauma managed non-operatively: the 2022 World Society of Emergency Surgery consensus document [^111sk99c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Research Question 2: What is the optimal timing and type of anti-thrombotic prophylaxis for patients with splenic trauma treated with NOM? (High priority).

Statements. In the absence of contraindications related to associated injuries or conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic diathesis, or patients under anticoagulation therapy, the best available evidence supports that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis can safely be initiated within 48–72 h of admission for blunt splenic trauma, regardless of injury grade, without concern for exacerbation of bleeding, or failure of NOM [Quality of Evidence: Moderate]. Occurrence rates of thrombocytosis in patients after SAE seem comparable to patients who undergo splenectomy, in contrast with average platelet values in those managed with observation alone. So, SAE may be an independent risk factor for thrombotic events in WSES Class II–III (AAST Grades III–V) blunt splenic injuries [Quality of Evidence: Moderate]. Regarding the choice between low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UH), indirect evidence coming from trauma cases in general, and liver trauma specifically, suggests that LMWH is superior to UH for DVT and VTE prevention and may additionally reduce pulmonary embolism (PE) and mortality [Quality of Evidence: Low].

Recommendation. For patients with blunt splenic injuries treated with NOM with/without splenic artery angioembolization (SAE), in the absence of specific complications, the panel suggests that DVT and VTE prophylaxis with LMWH be started within 24 h from hospital admission for patients with WSES Class I (AAST Grades I–II) and within 48–72 h for those with WSES Class II–III (AAST Grades III–V) splenic injuries [Strength of Recommendation: Conditional recommendation, based on Moderate Quality of Evidence, Agreement 91.3%].

Trauma patients are at high risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE), and, without anti-thrombotic prophylaxis, more than 50% of patients may experience thrombotic complications. Thromboelastographic studies have identified a transition from trauma-induced coagulopathy to a hypercoagulable state at 48 h among patients with blunt solid organ injury, suggesting that 48 h might provide the optimal balance of minimizing the risk of both bleeding and VTE. Although DVT and VTE are not life-threatening complications, their association with pulmonary embolism (PE) carries potential morbidity and mortality. After major trauma, the reported mortality rate as a result of PE ranges from 0.4 to 50%.

### Splenic infarction and abscess complicating infective endocarditis [^111PHGt2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions confronted in the emergency department. Clues related to splenic infarction may be obscured, and the diagnosis is quite challenging even for experienced physicians or surgeons. For every patient diagnosed with splenic infarction, a scrutiny on the possible source of emboli should be carried out. In addition, splenic abscess must be suspected in patients of splenic infarction, especially if the infectious signs persist despite appropriate treatment. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential as its course can prove fatal. Infective endocarditis is the most common condition predisposing a patient to splenic abscess. Indeed, splenic abscess or infarction may be a disease entity at different stages in patients of infective endocarditis due to septic emboli of the spleen. The treatment of choice has been antibiotics, splenectomy, and valve replacement surgery. Herein, we report a case of splenic abscess and infective endocarditis cured by antibiotic treatment without the aid of drainage or surgery.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^115Ud4jz]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Several investigators have reported associations between splenic infarction percentages and splenic infarction volume and post-PSE complications. Zhu et al. reported that when 62 patients undergoing PSE were divided into three groups with percentages of infarcted spleen of < 50%, 50–70%, and > 70% as measured by CT, serious complications including PVST were significantly higher in the > 70% group. Hayashi et al. reported that among 71 patients who underwent PSE, risk factors for complications differed significantly between uni- and multivariate analyses for splenic infarction volume ≥ 540 mL. However, PVST was not included as a complication in this study. Cai et al. examined risk factors for eight patients with serious complications among 52 patients who underwent PSE. The study included 3 cases of PVST out of 8 complications. They reported significant differences in splenic infarct volume in multivariate analysis, and cutoff values were 513.1 mL in ROC analysis. These reports and our results suggest that a large splenic infarct volume or a high percentage of infarcted spleen is associated with an increased risk not only for all complications of PSE but also for the appearance of PVST only.

Several investigators have reported the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for PVST by anticoagulant and antithrombin III. However, use of thrombolytic therapy for PVST in patients with liver cirrhosis is currently controversial. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline for the management of PVST in liver cirrhosis was published in 2009 and recommended anticoagulation for acute PVST in patients with cirrhosis be given on a case-by-case basis, depending on prothrombin status, symptoms, and thrombus progression to SMV. Ten of the 67 patients in this study (14.9%) received intravenous heparin after PSE for the purpose of preventing PVST. However, no significant differences were seen in the appearance or growth of PVST with intravenous heparin after PSE. Detection of PVST may thus be more important than prophylactic treatment.

### Thromboembolic safety and efficacy of prothrombin complex concentrates in the emergency reversal of warfarin coagulopathy [^114TzGNp]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and incidence of thromboembolic events in patients treated with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) for the emergency reversal of warfarin effect.

Methods

During 2002 to 2010 we prospectively included 160 patients treated with PCC for emergency reversal of warfarin either for bleeding or because of the need of emergency surgery. A possible relationship to PCC was considered if objectively verified thromboembolism occurred within 7days of PCC administration. Efficacy was adjudicated as good if the bleeding was controlled promptly or if the surgeon did not report excessive perioperative bleeding.

Results

We included 160 patients; 72% received PCC for bleeding. The median international normalized ratio (INR) before and after treatment with PCC was 3.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.6–5.4) and 1.4 (IQR 1.2–1.6). The mean dose of PCC was 1800IU (IQR 1200–2000). In addition to PCC, 74% of the patients received vitamin K and 34% received plasma. Six patients (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–8.0%) developed thromboembolic events (3 strokes, 1 myocardial infarction, 1 deep vein thrombosis, 1 splenic infarction), possibly related to PCC. The clinical efficacy was good in 146 (91%), moderate in 6 (4%), poor in 4 (2.5%) and non-evaluable in 4 patients.

Conclusion

The administration of PCC for the emergency reversal of warfarin may be associated with a low risk of thromboembolism. The contribution of an unmasked thrombotic process by cessation of anticoagulation or of activation of coagulation by the hemorrhagic event should also be considered.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) — treatment phases and baseline duration: In patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend long-term (3 months) anticoagulant therapy over no such therapy (Grade 1B). The minimum duration of anticoagulant therapy for DVT or PE is usually 3 months and is referred to as long-term therapy, while treatment for longer than 3 months is termed extended anticoagulant therapy and usually implies that anticoagulant therapy will be continued indefinitely.

### Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^117RTuLN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for anticoagulant therapy do not so far suggest any form of differentiated approach to cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This review article provides an overview of the published literature in cancer patients with VTE, mostly using data from the RIETE registry. Our findings provide some insights into what factors may be used to guide physicians in adapting recommended anticoagulant regimens to the individual patient, as oncologists are increasingly doing with cancer treatments. For instance, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) alone might benefit from curtailing treatment intensity as anticoagulant therapy progresses. The site of cancer also needs to be considered. In patients with incidental PE or splanchnic vein thrombosis, we should be more cautious before prescribing anticoagulant therapy. The optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy is unknown.

### Anticoagulant therapy for splanchnic vein thrombosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111tNzSf]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis of individual patient data was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guideline.

Database search and study selection

Medline and Embase were searched from inception up to June 2021 for prospective studies and RCTs including patients with SVT (supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, we searched clincaltrials.gov for ongoing or completed studies and screened the reference lists of relevant studies to retrieve additional records. No language restrictions were applied.

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified from the search to select studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) prospective study or RCT including ≥ 50 patients with SVT, (2) reporting of the outcomes of interest (ie, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality), and (3) anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or no anticoagulant therapy. We excluded retrospective cohorts, case series, and case reports.

The risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent authors using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions-I tool. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion or involving a third author.

Individual patient data extraction

Authors of included studies were asked to provide individual patient data from their published study, and, in case of ongoing cohorts or registries, data also were requested for patients included after the publication of the main study identified by the search.

The following individual patient data were collected: demographic factors (eg, age and sex), clinical presentation (ie, symptomatic or incidentally detected SVT), site and extension of thrombosis, risk factors for SVT (eg, solid and hematological cancer, liver cirrhosis, myeloproliferative neoplasm, pregnancy, oral contraceptive agents, hormonal therapy, recent surgery, pancreatitis, abdominal infections, and inflammatory bowel disease), laboratory parameters, type and duration of anticoagulant therapy, use of antiplatelet agents or thrombolysis, and outcomes of interest. Data from individual databases were verified and merged into a single electronic database. Any discrepancy with published data were resolved by contacting the corresponding or first author.

Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were aged < 18 years, had follow-up < 7 days, or were missing relevant information (ie, start or end date of anticoagulation, type of anticoagulant agent, end of follow-up, and date of study outcome).

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^114CrtVA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background For more than a decade, guidelines have recommended a limited 3months of anticoagulation for the treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). How closely real-world practice follows guideline recommendations is not well described. Methods and Results In our multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated trends in anticoagulation duration for patients enrolled in the MAQI 2 (Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative) registry who were receiving anticoagulation for a provoked VTE. The MAQI 2 registry comprises 6 centers in Michigan that manage patients' long-term anticoagulation. We identified 474 patients on warfarin and 302 patients on direct oral anticoagulants who were receiving anticoagulation for a primary indication of provoked VTE between 2008 and 2020. Using a predefined threshold of 120days (3 months plus a buffer period), predictors of extended anticoagulant use were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Most patients received > 120days of anticoagulation, regardless of which medication was used. The median (25th-75th percentile) length of treatment for patients taking warfarin was 142 (91–234) days and for direct oral anticoagulants was 180 (101–360) days. Recurrent VTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.75 [95% CI, 1.67–4.53]), history of myocardial infarction (OR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.32–11.7]), and direct oral anticoagulant rather than warfarin use (OR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59–3.08]) were independently associated with prolonged anticoagulation. Conclusions In our cohort of patients with provoked VTE, most patients received anticoagulation for longer than the guideline-recommended 3months. This demonstrates a potential opportunity to improve care delivery and reduce anticoagulant-associated bleeding risk.

### Anticoagulant therapy for splanchnic vein thrombosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^115CTNZD]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) includes portal, mesenteric, or splenic vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome.SVT is frequently associated with liver cirrhosis, solid cancers, and myeloproliferative neoplasms and less often with oral contraceptive agents, pregnancy, abdominal infections, pancreatitis, or surgery.

Despite several observational studies and a few relatively small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatment for SVT, robust evidence on SVT management is lacking. Recommendations from international societies or expert panels remain highly variable, and, in routine clinical practice, physicians have to decide empirically about the type, dose, and duration of anticoagulant therapy. A recent study-level meta-analysis including 7969 patients with SVT suggested a potential benefit of anticoagulant treatment in terms of improved vein recanalization and reduced thrombosis progression, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and all-cause mortality compared with no anticoagulation. Conclusions were limited by the inherent heterogeneity of included populations, the potential for immortal bias, and residual confounding.

To fill these knowledge gaps, we undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with SVT and obtain a better understanding of the incidence of clinically relevant outcomes in subgroups at higher risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications.

### PR3 vasculitis presenting with symptomatic splenic and renal infarction: a case report and literature review [^112qTXQb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The spleen is particularly predisposed to infarction due to occlusive infarction of distal parenchymal splenic arteries and arterioles, which are end-vessels that lack collaterals. Clinically apparent splenic infarction appears to be a rarer phenomenon with few reported cases, but typically presenting with left sided abdominal pain. In contrast, in the case reported here the patient reported flank and back pain as the predominant presenting complaint, which probably represented symptomatic renal and splenic wedge infarction and was initially misdiagnosed as a urinary tract infection. We have identified only two previously reported cases of ante mortem presentation of renal cortical infarction in the context of multiorgan infarction in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Both were clinically silent and discovered incidentally, one in a young and one in an elderly patient, and the latter was associated with a poor outcome. The mechanism is presumed to relate to necrotising medium and small vessel inflammation with endothelial cell dysfunction and in situ thrombosis, with resultant downstream infarction.

The decision to anticoagulate the patient in this setting was a pragmatic one and discussed at length with clinical haematologists. There is no trial or clinical evidence to support this approach in the setting of AAV or autoimmune disease given the relative paucity of information regarding peripheral or abdominal vascular thrombosis in the absence of other factors such as cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant.

Given the presumptive mechanism discussed above, the definitive treatment for the effectively pro-coagulant milieu should be to treat the underlying inflammation with appropriate immunosuppression. However, as this may take a number of days or even weeks to achieve maximal effect, it was felt appropriate to use systemic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of further, potentially catastrophic, vascular infarction in the interim. The decision to continue anticoagulation for a six month period was similarly a pragmatic one and reflected a) the potential duration of time to achieve remission of her AAV and b) extrapolation of guidelines relating to central thrombosis in other settings. Given the presence of endothelial cell dysfunction in AAV, the empirical use of antiplatelet agents may have been an acceptable, albeit similarly unevidenced, alternative.

### Splenic vein diameter is a risk factor for the portal venous system thrombosis after partial splenic artery embolization [^1111bpmh]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Some limitations must be considered when interpreting the findings from this study. First, this study was used a retrospective design. The duration of CECT before and after treatment was thus not constant. Conducting a prospective study to evaluate both pre- and post-treatment CT with the same duration is thus desirable. In addition, embolization materials were also inconsistent. Second, differences in splenic venous flow rate by ultrasonography before and after PSE were not evaluated. We speculated an association between PSE-induced reduction in splenic venous flow and the appearance and growth of PVST. However, the evaluation of changes in splenic venous flow rate is necessary to prove this association. Third, few patients were treated with anticoagulation therapy. Only 10 patients underwent intravenous heparin anticoagulation after PSE, because intravenous heparin has been administered after PSE in patients other than those with emergency splenic hemorrhage since September 2015.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^115H8hrd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — harms, burden, and certainty for splenic artery embolization: None of the outcomes based on the identified evidence definitively favored the comparison, and increased mesenteric venous thrombo-embolic disease (MVTE) may be associated with splenic artery embolization (1 observation study of 50 participants; OR 8.24 [95% CI, 0.37–181.31]), but the actual risk is not known due to imprecise research evidence; additional undesirable effects include increased time required and increased cost, and the panel felt the undesirable effects were small in magnitude; certainty notes state that only comparative evidence addressing the key question was used, albeit it was of very low certainty, and single cohort evidence was deemed inappropriate for inclusion given lack of a comparative group.
