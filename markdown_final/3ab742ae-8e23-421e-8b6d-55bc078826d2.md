## Question

What are the most effective antihypertensive medications for this patient population?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive medication class is most effective for treating hypertension in the general adult population, without specifying comorbidities or special circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "most effective" clinically. Then, I should review head-to-head comparative effectiveness across drug classes. Next, I will weigh nuances such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure outcomes. After that, I should align with contemporary guideline hierarchies. Finally, I will translate this into a practical recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations, making sure I verify where beta-blockers fit and when to favor diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or CCBs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical meaning of "most effective". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure we prioritize hard outcomes such as cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and all-cause mortality rather than just blood pressure reduction, because the net clinical benefit is what matters most in practice.

> Next, I should review high-quality comparative evidence. A 2020 JAMA Network Open network meta-analysis of 46 randomized trials including 248,887 patients found that ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were broadly similar for reducing overall cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and stroke, with only modest, nuanced differences between classes, which argues against a single "best" agent across all outcomes [^116Sst98] [^113MmWk8]. Wait, let me verify consistency; another large analysis pooling contemporary RCTs similarly concluded that these classes had broadly comparable benefits on first-in-trial cardiovascular events, again emphasizing equivalence at similar blood pressure lowering [^112MMytN].

> I will now examine class-specific advantages that could influence the "most effective" choice depending on the outcome of interest. Let me think about this carefully: ACE inhibitors showed the greatest relative reduction in myocardial infarction in some analyses, thiazide-type diuretics had a signal for fewer heart failure events, and dihydropyridine CCBs were consistently strong for stroke prevention. However, these are relative strengths rather than universal superiority across all outcomes, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize [^116Sst98] [^113MmWk8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also double-check the role of thiazides; the Cochrane comparison suggests thiazides may have fewer withdrawals and slightly lower cardiovascular events versus beta-blockers, and possibly a small advantage versus ACE inhibitors in some comparisons, reinforcing that they are a solid first-line option in many contexts [^114VRfqY].

> Now, I should align with guideline hierarchies. Contemporary European and Canadian guidelines recommend that any of the five major classes can be used as initial therapy, with preference for combinations of a renin–angiotensin system blocker with a CCB or thiazide, especially in higher-risk or stage 2 hypertension, while beta-blockers are generally reserved for compelling indications such as coronary disease, heart failure, or arrhythmia control. This aligns with the evidence that beta-blockers are less effective for stroke prevention and have inferior tolerability as first-line agents in many patients [^114Vx2JC] [^113u9ZD3] [^116wAucT] [^116ekrY6]. Hold on, I should verify that the combination-first strategy improves outcomes; although direct outcome evidence for initial combination versus monotherapy is limited, guidelines favor initial dual therapy in most adults because it accelerates control and improves adherence when delivered as a single-pill combination [^113i4TjW] [^111rJjTU].

> But wait, what if a large observational dataset contradicts RCT equivalence? The LEGEND-HTN analysis of 4.9 million patients suggested thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics might outperform ACE inhibitors for MI, heart failure, and stroke, whereas non-dihydropyridine CCBs appeared inferior. I should note this is observational and could reflect residual confounding despite sophisticated methods, so it complements but does not supersede RCTs [^114P3VVD] [^1125GPSn]. I need to ensure I balance this signal by reminding myself that randomized evidence remains the highest quality for causal inference and that guidelines still endorse class equivalence for most patients without compelling indications [^113u9ZD3] [^113wcFJf].

> Let me consider special populations briefly, even though the user asked about the general adult population. For Black adults, evidence and guidelines favor starting with a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB, with RAS blockers as co-therapy when indicated; for older adults, especially those who are frail, targets may be less aggressive; for pregnancy, methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred; these are important exceptions that would shift the "most effective" choice in those contexts [^115CjvEw] [^1124e2kh] [^114crCvZ] [^112pCAbj]. Hold on, I should verify that these exceptions do not alter the general conclusion for adults without comorbidities; they do not, and they reinforce tailoring therapy to phenotype and comorbidity rather than seeking a single best agent [^114Vx2JC].

> I should translate this into a practical recommendation. For most adults with hypertension and no compelling comorbidity, thiazide-type diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs are all reasonable first-line choices, with selection guided by patient-specific factors such as potassium status, renal function, edema, comorbidities, cost, and tolerability; when blood pressure is markedly elevated or cardiovascular risk is high, starting with a two-drug combination in a single pill is favored to improve speed of control and adherence [^114Vx2JC] [^113u9ZD3] [^113wcFJf]. Let me reconsider whether beta-blockers have any role; yes, but primarily when there is a compelling cardiac indication such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, angina, or post–myocardial infarction care, rather than as routine first-line therapy in otherwise uncomplicated hypertension [^114Vx2JC] [^112JZRK2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the dosing and follow-up plan supports effectiveness in real-world care. Low-dose thiazide-type therapy, especially with chlorthalidone or indapamide, is preferred over high-dose thiazides because of better tolerability and favorable cardiovascular outcomes in trials; combination therapy at moderate intensity yields about a 15 mm Hg systolic reduction, which is clinically meaningful and can shorten time to target; and adherence strategies, including once-daily dosing and single-pill combinations, materially influence effectiveness at the population level [^115FQHjS] [^1133UAxf] [^117EReWz]. I should double-check that I am not overpromising a single "best" agent; the totality of evidence shows broad equivalence of the main classes with small, outcome-specific advantages, so the safest conclusion is that thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and dihydropyridine CCBs are the most effective foundational options, with the optimal choice being individualized to patient phenotype and risk [^116Sst98] [^1125GPSn] [^114Vx2JC].

---

The most effective antihypertensive medications are **ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics** [^113u9ZD3] [^114Vx2JC], which are first-line because they reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^116Sst98] [^112MMytN]. Beta-blockers are reserved for **compelling indications** (e.g. heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias) [^112JZRK2] [^1124e2kh] because they are less effective for stroke prevention and have more side effects [^116ekrY6]. Combination therapy — especially single-pill combinations — is recommended for most patients to achieve faster, more durable control and improve adherence [^111rJjTU] [^117EReWz]. Choice should be individualized by comorbidities, age, race/ethnicity, and patient preference, with close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^113wcFJf] [^1124e2kh].

## First-line antihypertensive medication classes

Current guidelines recommend **four major classes** as first-line therapy:

| **Medication class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical benefits** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors (ACEis) | Inhibit angiotensin II production, causing vasodilation and reduced aldosterone | - Effective in reducing cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction [^112MMytN] [^1125GPSn] <br/> - Preferred in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure [^notfound] |
| Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) | Block angiotensin II receptors, resulting in vasodilation and reduced aldosterone | - Similar cardiovascular benefits to ACEis [^115udNgw] <br/> - Preferred in patients intolerant to ACEis [^notfound] |
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | Inhibit calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation | - Particularly effective in preventing stroke [^113MmWk8] [^113W6CTu] <br/> - Preferred in older adults and patients of African descent [^1124e2kh] |
| Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics | Inhibit sodium reabsorption, promoting diuresis and reducing blood volume | - Effective in reducing cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure [^114VRfqY] <br/> - Preferred in older adults and patients with isolated systolic hypertension [^notfound] |

---

These classes have **comparable effectiveness** in reducing major cardiovascular events and mortality [^112MMytN] [^1125GPSn], with **minor differences** in specific outcomes [^116Sst98] [^114VRfqY].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety profiles

Recent network meta-analyses and large-scale observational studies show **similar cardiovascular risk reduction** across ACEis, ARBs, CCBs, and thiazide diuretics [^112f9VGv] [^112MMytN], with **small differences**: ACEis may better reduce myocardial infarction risk [^1125GPSn], CCBs may better reduce stroke risk [^113MmWk8], and thiazide diuretics may better reduce heart failure risk [^114VRfqY]. Regarding safety, **beta-blockers have a less favorable side-effect profile** [^116ekrY6] and are less effective in preventing stroke, so they are not first-line unless there is a compelling indication [^113wcFJf] [^1124e2kh].

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is **increasingly recommended** to achieve faster and more durable blood pressure control, improve adherence, and reduce cardiovascular events [^111rJjTU] [^117EReWz]. Preferred combinations include a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACEi or ARB) with a CCB or thiazide diuretic, ideally as a single-pill combination [^112XTFfx] [^111rJjTU]. Triple therapy (ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide) is recommended if dual therapy fails to achieve target blood pressure [^116Uiyap] [^1159oxhV].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

Medication choice should be **individualized** based on:

- **Comorbidities**: ACEis/ARBs for diabetes, CKD, heart failure; beta-blockers for coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, or post-myocardial infarction [^115CjvEw] [^112JZRK2].
- **Age and race/ethnicity**: CCBs or thiazide diuretics preferred in older adults and patients of African descent [^1124e2kh] [^115CjvEw].
- **Patient preferences and adherence**: Consider side-effect profiles, dosing frequency, and cost [^116tefkE] [^1135ewQM].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel antihypertensive agents

Recent developments include **novel agents** targeting the endothelin system, renin–angiotensin system, and atrial natriuretic peptide pathways, with potential advantages such as once-weekly dosing and enhanced adherence [^113AnEZ8]. However, **long-term cardiovascular outcome data are limited**, and these agents are not yet first-line [^1178Mdxh] [^113wcFJf].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy

Regular monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, electrolytes, and adverse effects is essential [^114HUXbU]. Therapy should be adjusted based on **response, tolerability, and patient preference**, with consideration of adherence strategies and patient education [^1178zvj4] [^113BfzmY].

---

ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs, and thiazide diuretics are the **most effective first-line antihypertensive medications**, with similar cardiovascular benefits [^115udNgw]. Beta-blockers are reserved for compelling indications [^112JZRK2]. Combination therapy, especially single-pill combinations, is recommended for most patients to achieve faster, more durable control and improve adherence [^111rJjTU] [^117EReWz].

### Hypertension pharmacogenomics: in search of personalized treatment approaches [^113y48m4]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular and renal diseases are associated with many risk factors, of which hypertension is one of the most prevalent. Worldwide, blood pressure control is only achieved in ∼50% of those treated for hypertension, despite the availability of a considerable number of antihypertensive drugs from different pharmacological classes. Although many reasons exist for poor blood pressure control, a likely contributor is the inability to predict to which antihypertensive drug an individual is most likely to respond. Hypertension pharmacogenomics and other 'omics' technologies have the potential to identify genetic signals that are predictive of response or adverse outcome to particular drugs, and guide selection of hypertension treatment for a given individual. Continued research in this field will enhance our understanding of how to maximally deploy the various antihypertensive drug classes to optimize blood pressure response at the individual level. This Review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing genetic signals associated with antihypertensive drug responses and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Future research in this area will be facilitated by enhancing collaboration between research groups through consortia such as the International Consortium for Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies, with the goal of translating replicated findings into clinical implementation.

### An update on the pharmacogenetics of treating hypertension [^113Ao4jR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, but only one third of patients achieve blood pressure goals despite antihypertensive therapy. Genetic polymorphisms may partially account for the interindividual variability and abnormal response to antihypertensive drugs. Candidate gene and genome-wide approaches have identified common genetic variants associated with response to antihypertensive drugs. However, there is no currently available pharmacogenetic test to guide hypertension treatment in clinical practice. In this review, we aimed to summarize the recent findings on pharmacogenetics of the most commonly used antihypertensive drugs in clinical practice, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Notably, only a small percentage of the genetic variability on response to antihypertensive drugs has been explained, and the vast majority of the genetic variants associated with antihypertensives efficacy and toxicity remains to be identified. Despite some genetic variants with evidence of association with the variable response related to these most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes, further replication is needed to confirm these associations in different populations. Further studies on epigenetics and regulatory pathways involved in the responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs might provide a deeper understanding of the physiology of hypertension, which may favor the identification of new targets for hypertension treatment and genetic predictors of antihypertensive response.

### Antihypertensive drug treatment: are we ready for the future? [^113AnEZ8]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hypertension generally requires multiple antihypertensive drugs. Yet, not all patients are treated adequately, largely because of nonadherence, although drug ineffectiveness and counterbalancing mechanisms may also play a role. Novel antihypertensive drugs have not been introduced for at least one to two decades. Remarkably, over the last few years, a range of novel compounds is being introduced, acting either on novel targets, or displaying an exceptionally long half-life. The former may help to improve blood pressure lowering, for instance by interfering with counterbalancing mechanisms, while the latter might help to circumvent nonadherence. This review summarizes the latest developments, focusing on novel drugs acting on the endothelin system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^114NbSxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta‐blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re‐assessed the place of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113YfHuH]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Can antihypertensive medications be reduced or stopped — the guideline notes that "In some patients in whom treatment is accompanied by effective BP control for an extended period, it may be possible to reduce the number and/or dosage of drugs". This "may particularly be the case if BP control is accompanied by healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise habit, and a low-fat and low-salt diet", and "A reduction of medications should be made gradually, and the patient should be checked frequently". Blood pressure (BP) is defined on-page.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113MmWk8]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

First-step antihypertensive medication selection — comparative effectiveness and guideline position: A meta-analysis of first-step treatments found diuretic, β-blocker, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and angiotensin receptor blocker agents were more effective than placebo for prevention of stroke; subsequent meta-analyses showed first-step therapy with β-blockers was inferior to the other classes and that calcium channel blocker treatment was the most consistently beneficial. In the most scientifically rigorous RCT comparison, there was no superiority for prevention of stroke in those randomized to amlodipine or lisinopril compared with the thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone, although chlorthalidone was superior for prevention of heart failure. The ACC/AHA BP guideline recommends the use of diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for first-step antihypertensive drug therapy.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113RTAkr]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evidence from randomised trials of pharmacological treatments on long-term blood pressure (BP) reduction is limited. We investigated the antihypertensive drug effects on BP over time and across different participant characteristics.

Methods

We conducted an individual patient-level data meta-analysis of 52 large-scale randomised clinical trials in the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration using mixed models to examine treatment effects on BP over 4 years of mean follow-up.

Results

There were 363 684 participants (42% women), with baseline mean age = 65 years and mean systolic/diastolic BP = 152/87 mm Hg, and among whom 19% were current smokers, 49% had cardiovascular disease, 28% had diabetes and 69% were taking antihypertensive treatment at baseline. Drugs were effective in lowering BP showing maximal effect after 12 months and gradually attenuating towards later years. Based on measures taken ≥ 12 months postrandomisation, mean systolic/diastolic BP difference (95% CI) between more and less intense BP-lowering treatment was −11.1 (−11.3 to −10.8)/−5.6 (−5.7 to −5.4) mm Hg; between active treatment and placebo was −5.1 (−5.3 to −5.0)/−2.3 (−2.4 to −2.2) mm Hg; and between active and control arms for drug comparison trials was −1.4 (−1.5 to −1.3)/−0.6 (−0.7 to −0.6) mm Hg. BP reductions were observed across different baseline BP values and ages, and by sex, history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and prior antihypertensive treatment use.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that BP-lowering pharmacotherapy is effective in lowering BP, up to 4 years on average, in people with different characteristics. Appropriate treatment strategies are needed to sustain substantive long-term BP reductions.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113okMsc]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for mortality and disability-adjusted life-yearsworldwide. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 17.7 million deaths in 2015, which represented 31% of all deaths worldwide. Hypertension is an important factor in cardiovascular disease. In 2010, it was estimated that one-third of the world's adult population had hypertension. The introduction of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association hypertension guidelines in 2017 resulted in higher estimates of the number of people with hypertension. Knowledge of optimal first-line antihypertension medications for the prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality will be important for clinical decision-making. Moreover, the identification of treatments that are most effective for controlling hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality and that have the least harmful effects is imperative to guide clinicians and decrease cardiovascular disease burdens worldwide.

Previous meta-analyses have examined the efficacy of antihypertension treatments in reducing cardiovascular events. These meta-analyses have used pairwise comparisons of only 2 classes of antihypertension medications; however, pairwise meta-analysis does not enable comparison of multiple classes of medications. Only 1 network meta-analysishas compared the effectiveness of different classes of antihypertension medications in preventing cardiovascular events, but this meta-analysis was published more than 15 years ago and included medications, such as α-blockers, that are less frequently used in contemporary health care.

To provide an updated perspective on the comparative efficacy of antihypertension medications, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the reported effects of different classes of antihypertension medications that are currently used to reduce the risk of individual cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization) and to examine the medications' reported effectiveness in reducing the overall risk of any cardiovascular event. Findings from this study will be relevant for the contemporary clinical management of hypertension, especially in light of the new American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association hypertension guidelines.

### Factors associated with antihypertensive medication non-adherence: a systematic review [^1135ewQM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Non-adherence to antihypertensive medication is the most important cause of uncontrolled blood pressure and is influenced by multiple interrelating factors. Understanding the complexity of medication non-adherence and its associated factors is important to determine intervention strategies. Therefore, a systematic review was performed aimed to identify factors associated with antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Different databases were searched for observational studies reporting on factors associated with non-adherence to antihypertensive medication. Titles, abstracts and full texts were reviewed by three researchers. Subsequently, the methodological quality of each study was assessed. Factors that were extracted from the included studies were categorised as factors with consistent or inconsistent evidence to put their potential importance into perspective. Forty-four studies were included. Higher co-payment, side effects and a poor patient-provider relationship were identified as factors with consistent evidence since consistent significant relationships were found for these factors whenever studied. The relationships between non-adherence and multiple other factors were inconsistent among the reviewed studies. However, some of these factors deserve some consideration. Since multiple potentially relevant factors were identified, patient-tailored interventions focussing on identifying and addressing patients' specific barriers to adherence are needed. Further research should clarify the influence of inconsistent factors on adherence and their potential to be addressed in interventions.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^117QxVCs]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In two recent network analyses on the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs, the authors limited their analysis to one outcome: heart failure and diabetes incidence. Despite slightly different study inclusion criteria, their effect estimates are very similar to ours. The systematic review and network meta-analysis by Psaty and colleagues only included comparisons against diuretics, not between other types of antihypertensive drugs. A network analysis by Aursnes and colleagues, also from 2003, focussed on comparing ACE-inhibitors and CCB, and was limited to three outcomes. Our findings are not in full agreement with these two earlier reports, presumably due to our more strict inclusion criteria and perhaps also to the inclusion of results from more recent studies.

Law and colleagues authored a recent comprehensive review and meta-analysis on antihypertensive drug treatment. They conducted traditional meta-analyses, without the network approach. Their conclusion was that "all the classes of blood pressure lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing CHD (coronary heart disease) effects and stroke". This is close to, but not entirely in agreement with our findings, which may be due to some of the following issues. First, they elected to compare each drug class with the pooled results from all other drug classes, for example, beta-blockers versus all non-beta-blockers. This analytical approach can be misleading because favorable effects from one non-beta-blocker may be off-set by unfavorable effects from another non-beta-blocker drug-class. Second, they included trials where high dose diuretics were used. This may be misleading as there are good reasons to believe that high dose diuretics lead to less favorable outcomes than low dose diuretics. Consequently, as high dose diuretics were used in many of the trials comparing beta-blockers and diuretics, beta-blockers came out more favorably in their analyses than they probably should. Third, in two studies included in their analysis the participants were randomised to either active drug or placebo, and these should, therefore, not be classified as drug comparison studies, in our view. Fourth, they did not explicitly assess the quality of the evidence underlying their effect-estimates, which is essential for judgements about how confident we can be about the validity of the findings. Last, they included two studies we classified as non-randomised trials.

### Are there benefits to specific antihypertensive drug therapy? [^112n24wb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive drug classes that have reduced cardiovascular events safely either in large placebo-controlled trials or in comparison with other effective antihypertensive drugs in large morbidity trials are diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although control of blood pressure (BP) is a primary goal of therapy, evidence from several clinical trials suggests that certain antihypertensive agents provide clinical benefits independent of their effect on BP. In the recently reported Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), an ACE inhibitor, a CCB, and an alpha-blocker reduced coronary events and mortality to a similar extent as a thiazide-type diuretic, but the diuretic reduced one or more major cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, more than the other agents. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial, the ARB losartan reduced cardiovascular morbidity (primarily stroke) more than the beta-blocker atenolol. Although an ARB has not yet been compared with a diuretic in a morbidity trial, as most patients require more than one drug to control BP, and a diuretic plus an ARB is a very effective and well-tolerated combination, this uncertainty applies to a minority of patients. A primary goal in treating hypertension should be to reach a patient's goal BP, but initial selection of drugs based on hypertension morbidity study results and other compelling indications should be given priority.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112zkx4m]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment strategy states that among all antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are indicated as the basis of therapy because they have demonstrated effective reduction of BP and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials. Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy, and preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic, though other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control. It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC), with exceptions for frail older patients and those at low risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by the addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^1158JMbp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

This is the third update of a review that was originally published in 1998 and updated in 2009 and 2019. Hypertension increases with age, most rapidly over age 60. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and for people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mmHg, or both. Secondary objectives
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.
- To assess the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to June 2024: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted the authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Outcomes

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, and withdrawal due to adverse effects.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used RevMan for data synthesis and analyses. We based quantitative analyses of outcomes on intention-to-treat results. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to combine outcomes across trials using a fixed-effect model.

Included Studies

This update identified no new trials and no ongoing trials. Overall, 16 trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.8 years) with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years.

Synthesis Of Results

Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (10% with treatment versus 11% with control; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 13 studies, 25,932 participants; high-certainty evidence); probably reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (10% with treatment versus 14% with control; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; 15 studies, 26,747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); probably reduced cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (3.4% with treatment versus 5.2% with control; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; 13 studies, 26,042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably reduced coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (3.7% with treatment versus 4.8% with control; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; 11 studies, 24,559 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Withdrawals due to adverse effects may have increased with treatment (16% with treatment versus 5.4% with control; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30; 4 studies, 11,310 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a sensitivity analysis of the three trials restricted to people with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. We cannot rule out that the observed reduction in all-cause mortality was due mostly to a reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old participant subgroup compared with those 80 years or older. The RR for all-cause mortality in those 60 to 79 years old was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; 9 studies, 19,017 participants) compared with 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.10; 8 studies, 6701 participants) in the 80 years or older subgroup, though the test for subgroup difference showed no evidence of a difference. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was due in large part to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. The most common reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was risk of bias, in particular incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic or diastolic hypertension, or both, with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality and probably reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most of the evidence pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment. Given that no new or ongoing trials were identified in this update, the certainty of existing evidence is moderate or high, and we do not expect new trials in the future, this review is considered stable and will no longer be updated.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^112G4LYX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in drug effectiveness and provider prescribing patterns have been reported in different racial and ethnic populations. We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self-identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Non-Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first-line medications.

### Effects of blood pressure-lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 5. head-to-head comparisons of various classes of antihypertensive drugs-overview and meta-analyses [^113W6CTu]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

We have recently published an overview and meta-analysis of the effects of the five major classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs on cardiovascular outcomes when compared with placebo. However, possible differences in effectiveness of the various classes can correctly be estimated only by head-to-head comparisons of different classes of agents. This has been the objective of a new survey and meta-analysis.

Methods

A database search between 1966 and August 2014 ide ntified 50 eligible randomized controlled trials for 58 two-drug comparisons (247006 patients for 1029768 patient-years). Risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of seven outcomes were estimated by a random-effects model.

Results

The effects of all drug classes are not significantly different on most outcomes when their blood pressure effect is equivalent. However, there are also significant differences involving almost all classes of drugs. When compared to all other classes together, diuretics are superior in preventing heart failure; beta-blockers less effective in preventing stroke; calcium antagonists superior in preventing stroke and all-cause death, but inferior in preventing heart failure; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors more effective in preventing coronary heart disease and less in preventing stroke; angiotensin receptor blockers inferior in preventing coronary heart disease; and renin-angiotensin system blockers more effective in preventing heart failure. When stratifying randomized controlled trials according to total cardiovascular risk, no drug class was found to change in effectiveness with the level of risk.

Conclusions

The results of all available evidence from head-to-head drug class comparisons do not allow the formulation of a fixed paradigm of drug choice valuable for all hypertensive patients, but the differences found may suggest specific choices in specific conditions, or preferable combinations of drugs.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^112S62Be]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypertension is well established as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although there is undeniable evidence to support the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity and mortality, adequate blood pressure management still remains suboptimal. Research into the treatment of hypertension has produced a multitude of drug classes with different efficacy profiles. These agents include β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. One of the oldest groups of antihypertensives, the calcium channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of medications.

Methods

This review paper will focus on amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which has been widely used for 2 decades.

Results

Amlodipine has good efficacy and safety, in addition to strong evidence from large randomised controlled trials for cardiovascular event reduction.

Conclusions

Amlodipine should be considered a first-line antihypertensive agent.

### Clinical policy: a critical issue in the outpatient management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure: approved by the ACEP board of directors January 22, 2025 [^114uTdJ4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ACEP clinical policy — critical question on initiating outpatient antihypertensive therapy at ED discharge — asks: In adult ED patients being discharged with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure, is initiation of outpatient antihypertensive medications from the ED safe and effective? Level A recommendations: None. Level B recommendations: None. Level C recommendations: Consider the initiation of outpatient antihypertensive medications for patients being discharged from the ED with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure. Patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure should be referred for outpatient follow-up (Consensus recommendation). Potential benefit of implementing the recommendations includes improvement in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk, initiation of treatment sooner, and potential reduction in health care disparities, whereas potential harm includes adverse effect of the medication and treating of a falsely elevated blood pressure and thus creating hypotension.

### Reconciling multiple hypertension guidelines to promote effective clinical practice [^1177QiTj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

Other criteria of choice

As mentioned by the 2007 European Society of Hypertension–European Society of Cardiology guidelines, other criteria that may help selection of appropriate drug treatment are represented by 1) the duration of the BP-lowering effect because drugs that cover the 24-h time interval and thus can be given on a once-a-day basis provide a simplified form of management that helps adherence to the therapeutic regimen, 2) the cost of treatment, 3) the contraindications to different drugs as summarized by the European guidelines (Table 1), and 4) the previous experience of the patient with the BP-lowering ability and side effects of a given drug class. Continuing attention to development of side effects is particularly important because treatment-related side effects are the main cause of treatment discontinuation, which is accompanied by a marked increase in hypertension-related complications.

### Rationalizing the treatment of hypertension [^117CLCoV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^112pCAbj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve pregnancy outcome. This Cochrane Review is an updated review, first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2007 and 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

For this update, we included 63 trials (data from 58 trials, 5909 women), with moderate to high risk of bias overall. We carried out GRADE assessments for the main 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' comparison only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading mainly due to design limitations and imprecision. For many outcomes, trials contributing data evaluated different hypertensive drugs; while we did not downgrade for this indirectness, results should be interpreted with caution. Antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug (31 trials, 3485 women)Primary outcomes: moderate-certainty evidence suggests that use of antihypertensive drug(s) probably halves the risk of developing severe hypertension (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; 20 trials, 2558 women), but may have little or no effect on the risk of proteinuria/pre-eclampsia (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; 23 trials, 2851 women; low-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence also shows that antihypertensive drug(s) probably have little or no effect in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) (aRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04; 29 trials, 3365 women), small-for-gestational-age babies (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18; 21 trials, 2686 babies) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; 15 trials, 2141 women).

Secondary Outcomes

we are uncertain of the effect of antihypertensive drug(s) on the risk of maternal death, severe pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia, orimpaired long-term growth and development of the baby in infancy and childhood, because the certainty of this evidence is very low. There may be little or no effect on the risk of changed/stopped drugs due to maternal side-effects, or admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery (low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of elective delivery (moderate-certainty evidence). Antihypertensive drug versus another antihypertensive drug (29 trials, 2774 women)Primary outcomes: beta blockers and calcium channel blockers together in the meta-analysis appear to be more effective than methyldopa in avoiding an episode of severe hypertension (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 11 trials, 638 women). There was also an increase in this risk when other antihypertensive drugs were compared with calcium channel blockers (RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.15; 5 trials, 223 women), but no evidence of a difference when methyldopa and calcium channel blockers together were compared with beta blockers (RR1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.48; 10 trials, 692 women). No evidence of a difference in the risk of proteinuria/pre-eclampsia was found when alternative drugs were compared with methyldopa (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06; 11 trials, 997 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR: 1.24, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.19; 5 trials, 375 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.67; 12 trials, 1107 women). For the babies, we found no evidence of a difference in the risk oftotal reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) when comparing other antihypertensive drugs with methyldopa (aRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14; 22 trials, 1791 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57; nine trials, 700 babies), or with beta blockers (aRR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.88; 19 trials, 1652 babies); nor in the risk for small-for-gestational age in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20; seven trials, 597 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.73; four trials, 200 babies), or with beta blockers (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.60; 7 trials, 680 babies). No evidence of an overall difference among groups in the risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) was found in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22; 11 trials, 835 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.23; six trials, 330 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.66; 9 trials, 806 women).

Secondary Outcomes

There were no cases of maternal death andeclampsia. There is no evidence of a difference in the risk of severe pre-eclampsia, changed/stopped drug due to maternal side-effects, elective delivery, admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery when other antihypertensive drugs are compared with methyldopa, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers. Impaired long-term growth and development in infancy and childhood was not reported for these comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduces the risk of severe hypertension. The effect on other clinically important outcomes remains unclear. If antihypertensive drugs are used, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear to be more effective than the alternatives for preventing severe hypertension. High-quality large sample-sized randomised controlled trials are required in order to provide reliable estimates of the benefits and adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension for both mother and baby, as well as costs to the health services, women and their families.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

### Efficacy and safety of a four-drug, quarter-dose treatment for hypertension: the QUARTET USA randomized trial [^116s2k44]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than 1 billion adults have hypertension globally. Despite widespread availability of generic blood pressure lowering drugs for decades, hypertension control rates (defined as a blood pressure < 140/ < 90 mm Hg) remain persistently low (< 50%) among adults in the United States. Control rates are even lower (< 25%) when accounting for newer, lower blood pressure targets (defined as a blood pressure < 130/ < 80 mm Hg) recommended by national and international clinical practice guidelines. Hypertension is more prevalent in racially and ethnically minoritized individuals, in whom control rates are also lower than other groups. Most patients with hypertension are initially treated with a single blood pressure lowering drug that is titrated up over multiple, monthly office visits with additional medications added sequentially. Therapeutic inertia contributes to persistently low hypertension control rates and has not improved. Thus, a new approach is needed. New strategies are especially important among low-income individuals who seek care within federally qualified health centers, where the burden of hypertension is high and control rates are lower than the general population.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^1126s4dQ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Rationale

Cardiovascular diseases are a major public health challenge, representing 10% of the global burden of disease. The annual number of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease is expected to rise by more than 33% over the coming two or three decades. Hypertension is among the most important modifiable risk-factors for cardiovascular diseases. Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antihypertensive medication have shown that such treatment can prevent, or postpone myocardial infarction and stroke. But the key question remains: Which of the many available types of blood pressure lowering drugs is the better choice as first-line medication?

Several clinical trials and systematic reviews have addressed this issue, but have failed to convincingly show that one or more drug-classes are superior to the others. Still, controversy remains about possible important differences between the various drugs. The findings from the alpha-blocker arm of the ALLHAT-trial a decade ago, and reviews in recent years assessing the effectiveness of beta-blocking agents cast doubt about the assumption that all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective with regards to cardiovascular disease prevention. Also, recent systematic reviews have found potentially important differences regarding their effectiveness for some specific outcomes.

Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials comparing different drugs provide evidence for decisions about choice of antihypertensive medication. Unfortunately, direct comparative studies are lacking for many of the competing drug-classes. Conventional meta-analyses of antihypertensive medication, therefore, typically provide comparative effectiveness estimates for only some drug-comparisons, that is, those that have been tested head-to-head in clinical trials. However, a decision maker would want to have effect-estimates for as many comparisons as possible, preferably with a ranking of the various drugs. Multiple treatments (network) meta-analyses provide this by utilizing indirect comparisons, making it possible to estimate the comparative effectiveness of drugs that have not been tested directly in clinical trials.

The most recent systematic review addressing several of the most clinically important outcomes and using multiple treatments meta-analysis of antihypertensive drug therapy was published by Psaty and colleagues in 2003. An update is warranted to reflect the current evidence-base in the field and to address some shortcomings of the earlier review, for example, that the authors neither explicitly assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, nor graded the quality of the overall body of evidence.

A broad systematic review of various interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases was recently requested by the Norwegian Directorate for Health. The current paper is an updated and substantially revised version of that report's section on antihypertensive treatment.

### Blood pressure-elevating and antihypertensive medication prescription trends [^112U3fWt]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

From 2017 to 2023, prescription fills for antihypertensive medications increased over time across most sex and age groups. Although prescription fills for antihypertensive medications were higher among older age groups, consistent with their higher prevalence of hypertension, the most meaningful increase in prescription fills for antihypertensive medications was observed among younger age groups. Our estimates suggest an increasing trend of prescription fills for antihypertensive medications among women (29.8% increase) and men (18.6% increase) of reproductive age (18–44 years) from Q1/2017 to Q4/2023. Although, to our knowledge, there are no recent estimates of antihypertensive usage by age- and sex-specific groups for the US population overall, our results are consistent with recent estimates of antihypertensive usage among adults with hypertension. For example, Sekkarie et alreported that antihypertensive usage among adults with hypertension increased for women (from 64.4% to 68.5%) and men (from 56.8% to 59.4%) from 2017 to 2021. Similar to our findings, Sekkarie et aldocumented the highest increase in antihypertensive use among people aged 18 to 44 years (from 38.0% to 42.5%) from 2017 to 2021. Given the increasing percentage of reproductive-age women taking antihypertensive medications, these women and their medical providers may need to be aware of the clinical guidance for the safe use of contraception among women with medical conditions such as hypertension when providing contraceptive counseling.

The findings of this study have important implications for public health and clinical practice. Establishing clinical guidance for managing concurrent BP-elevating and antihypertensive medications could help mitigate adverse effects on BP control. For patients with hypertension, mitigation strategies could include the adoption of appropriate alternative treatment without prescribing medications that are known to elevate BP or intensification of antihypertensive therapy when BP-elevating medication is needed and conflicting effects on BP are unavoidable. Clinical decision support tools that screen for medications with divergent effects on BP could help facilitate tailored medication regimens to support hypertension management. Finally, pharmacotherapy research is needed to understand if certain antihypertensive medications are more effective at lowering BP when various classes of BP-elevating medications are being taken.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1125GPSn]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

From 46 randomized clinical trials that examined the effect of the most commonly used antihypertension medications on preventing cardiovascular events, pooled results showed that ACE inhibitors, DH CCBs, and diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in preventing cardiovascular death (approximately 20% reduction compared with placebo), stroke (approximately 35% reduction compared with placebo), and overall cardiovascular events (approximately 30% reduction compared with placebo). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were reported to be the most effective in preventing myocardial infarction (approximately 30% reduction compared with placebo). Diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing revascularization (approximately 30% compared with placebo). Our study provides the most current evidence to date on the comparative efficacy of antihypertension medications reported to reduce cardiovascular events in randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to pool the results of studies that tested the efficacy of antihypertension medications in reducing the risk of revascularization.

Our results are consistent with those reported in previous meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Psaty et alfound that low-dose diuretics were reported to be the most effective treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular mortality. Law et alindicated that for stroke, all antihypertension medication classes were reported to have similar risk reduction effects for a given reduction in blood pressure. Our findings further supported the evidence indicating that the reported differences of the effects on reducing cardiovascular events between medication classes are small. We also provided more up-to-date information regarding the reported efficacy of antihypertension medications in reducing cardiovascular events. A recent systematic multinational analysis, the Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation Across a Network of Databases for Hypertension (LEGEND-HTN) study, used observational data encompassing millions of patients and found that diuretics were associated with advantages in reducing various cardiovascular events compared with other classes of medications. This finding is different than that of our study, which indicated that diuretics had similar reported effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular events compared with ACE inhibitors and DH CCBs and that ACE inhibitors appeared to be most effective in reducing myocardial infarction. The difference in findings may be owing to the varied study designs (randomized clinical trials vs observational studies), and it is not clear to what extent the LEGEND-HTN study may be subject to selection bias.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113mV2US]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights the role of pharmacological agents in effectively reducing BP over several years across individuals with a wide range of characteristics, although the achieved between-group reductions, even with the intensive BP-lowering regimens, were relatively modest. Given that large-scale trials have shown the effects of pharmacological BP reduction on improving clinical outcomes, the modest BP reductions estimated in our study should still be clinically meaningful. Indeed, the estimates of long-term BP reduction in this study could inform treatment strategies and help in setting realistic treatment goals in the pharmacologic management of raised BP.

### Individualization of antihypertensive drug treatment [^113gBMkP]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drug classes are usually classified as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th or 5th choice to help physicians select the drug most suitable for treatment initiation among the very many classes available to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with a BP elevation. However, this approach was appropriate decades ago when several drugs had inconveniences that made their use in monotherapy inadvisable. An example was the then widely used vasodilator hydralazine whose sodium-retaining and tachycardic effects made its administration recommendable only with a diuretic or a β-blocker, with, thus, a classification as a 2nd- or 3rd-choice drug. This is no longer the case because several current antihypertensive drug classes are characterized by a similar BP-lowering effect, a good tolerability profile, and evidence of cardiovascular protection in prospective randomized trials. As recently argued in a document of the European Society of Hypertension, this implies that rather than classifying drugs as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and further choice, it might be more appropriate to help physicians select the drug (or drug combination) that might be preferred for treatment initiation in a given patient or a given clinical condition. This article will discuss the factors that may help physicians move toward this more individualized treatment approach.

Quality-assessment of the evidence

We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome for each comparison, using the GRADE-instrument (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - GRADE). Through this process, factors like study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision and reporting bias are assessed. The quality of the evidence was rated as high, moderate, low or very low quality, reflecting the confidence we have in the estimated effect size (see Table 1).

Table 1
Grades of quality of evidence in GRADE

In line with recommendations from the GRADE Working Group by default, we graded the included evidence as "high quality", as all studies were randomized controlled trials. We then downgraded when deemed appropriate. For the comparisons where we had no direct evidence (that is, the effect-estimates were only based on indirect comparisons) we rated the quality as "low" unless we found reasons to upgrade or to downgrade further. When the findings were based on a combination of direct and indirect evidence we elected to grade as "high quality" unless there were reasons to downgrade. The inconsistency of results-dimension in GRADE was only assessed for direct comparisons (using the I²-statistic). The grading process was done by one reviewer (AF) and validated by a second person.

### Effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality: 14-effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in older and younger patients: overview and meta-analysis [^112xabTm]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The five major classes of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs have all been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events when compared with placebo, and when directly (head-to-head) compared, no significant differences in their overall effectiveness have been detected, except for minor differences in cause-specific events. It is unknown, however, whether age-related differences exist and if some classes of drugs are differently effective in older or younger individuals. This clinically relevant question has been the object of a systematic search and meta-analysis of all available data.

Methods

Two databases we had previously identified [72 placebo-controlled BP-lowering randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in 260210 individuals and 50 RCTs head-to-head comparing treatments with BP-lowering drugs of different classes in 247006 individuals) were searched for separately reported data on patients older or younger than 65 years, and the data were further stratified according to the class of drug [diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers] compared with placebo or with other drug classes. Seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were considered for benefits. Adverse events were investigated as permanent treatment discontinuations for adverse events. Risk ratios and absolute risk changes were calculated by a random effects model. Effects at older and younger ages were compared by heterogeneity test.

Results

We identified 20 placebo-controlled RCTs on 55645 older individuals and 21 on 99621 younger individuals, and 21 head-to-head drug comparison RCTs on 94228 older individuals and 27 on 100232 younger individuals (for a total of 349726 individuals). When compared with placebo, all five classes of BP-lowering drugs significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or stroke, with no significant difference between older and younger patients. However, in head-to-head comparisons, no significant difference was found between older and younger patients in the effects of diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on all cardiovascular outcomes, whereas beta-blockers revealed an age-dependent effectiveness, being equally effective as the other agents at an age below 65 years, but less effective at an older age.

Conclusion

Most BP-lowering classes are equally effective in preventing risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events both in older and younger patients, whereas beta-blockers, though being equally effective as the other agents in patients younger than 65, loose some of their effectiveness at an older age.

### Do we AGREE on the targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults: a systematic review of guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^114crCvZ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the worldwide leading predisposing condition for disease burden, and as the most important modifiable risk factor, its management forms an essential pillar of primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Globally, hypertension is prevalent in roughly one in four adults and steadily rises with age. For example, data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that more than 90% of the normotensive participants between 55 and 65 years developed hypertension, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful treatment strategy. Nevertheless, an international analysis of health surveys estimated that the proportion of hypertensive adults between 35 and 85 years receiving antihypertensive drug therapy ranges from 29.0% to 80.5%.

Only during the last three decades randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that pharmacological treatment of hypertension in older adults is beneficial. Although those studies included octogenarians, frail older adults are largely underrepresented as many of them are excluded from trials due to their comorbidities. To date, no interventional studies specific to antihypertensive treatment in older frail individuals have been conducted. Several population-based cohort studies, in contrast, have shown that low blood pressure (BP) under antihypertensive drug treatment, especially in older adults with frailty or other complex health problems, is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. Despite the high quality of the available evidence, translation into clinical guidance for the heterogeneous population of older adults is challenging.

In the current discussion on hypertension management in older adults, the clinical problem is not only when to start, but predominantly how low the target BP needs to be. This intensity and thereby numerical target of antihypertensive drug therapy is set on the balance between cardiovascular risk reduction and chance of side effects. Recent trial evidence favours intensive treatment for most patients; however, frail older adults seem to be at higher risk for both cardiovascular events and severe side effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, resulting in an unclear net benefit.

Because translation of the available evidence concerning primary cardiovascular prevention into clinical guidance for older adults is challenging, insight into the actual guidelines about hypertension management will contribute to the present debate. Therefore, the primary aim of this review was to provide a systematic, cross-continental and present-day overview of the thresholds and targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults recommended in the currently used guidelines. A secondary aim was to explore the potential relationships between the advised targets and guideline characteristics, including methodological quality, continent of origin, intended users and the guideline committee's selection of evidence supporting the recommended targets.

### Joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Obesity and the European Society of Hypertension: obesity and difficult to treat arterial hypertension [^1174ccre]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Obese patients are prone to arterial hypertension, require more antihypertensive medications, and have an increased risk of treatment-resistant arterial hypertension. Obesity-induced neurohumoral activation appears to be involved. The association between obesity and hypertension shows large inter-individual variability, likely through genetic mechanisms. Obesity affects overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk; yet, the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk is complex and not sufficiently addressed in clinical guidelines. The epidemiological observation that obesity may be protective in patients with established cardiovascular disease is difficult to translate into clinical experience and practice. Weight loss is often recommended as a means to lower blood pressure. However, current hypertension guidelines do not provide evidence-based guidance on how to institute weight loss. In fact, weight loss influences on blood pressure may be overestimated. Nevertheless, weight loss through bariatric surgery appears to decrease cardiovascular risk in severely obese patients. Eventually, most obese hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive medications. Data from large-scale studies with hard clinical endpoints on antihypertensive medications specifically addressing obese patients are lacking and the morbidity from the growing population of severely obese patients is poorly recognized or addressed. Because of their broad spectrum of beneficial effects, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are considered to be the most appropriate drugs for antihypertensive treatment of obese patients. Most obese hypertensive patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs. Finally, how to combine weight loss strategies and antihypertensive treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome is unresolved.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^114X8KMZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^115SPTjv]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines for managing hypertension have invariably lowered the recommended blood pressure (BP) targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, informed by evidence from large-scale randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses showing substantial reductions in cardiovascular risk with more intensive BP-lowering treatment and independently of baseline BP values. For most hypertensive patients, the lowered BP targets inevitably lead to a larger gap between their usual BP and the recommended target value, requiring more intensive pharmacological treatment.

Attributing changes to treatment based on repeated measures of BP of an individual patient can be unreliable since measurements are subject to random fluctuations, regression to the mean, non-pharmacological effects and other sources of variability that can exceed true variability in treatment response. However, it would be useful to have reliable information about the expected effects of drug treatment on BP levels over time from randomised comparisons to help interpret BP readings such as those obtained during clinical encounters. To date, randomised evidence on the effect of antihypertensive drugs on BP has come from efficacy trials with small numbers of highly selected participants and short follow-up durations. Pooled evidence from RCTs using information from individual participants' repeated BP measurements currently does not exist, which might explain why there is no guidance on the expected magnitudes of BP reduction with the various proposed treatment strategies and whether these reductions are expected to vary among people with different characteristics.

We addressed this evidence gap by using information from 52 trials involving 363 684 participants with individual-level data on repeated BP measurements over several yearsto conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the unconfounded effects of BP-lowering drugs on BP over time and examine these effects across different subgroups.

### Examining therapeutic goals: population versus individual-based approaches [^114A5eJG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

In the individual patient, the goal of antihypertensive treatment is to lower the blood pressure (BP) to a level that minimizes the patient's risk of cardiovascular complications. However, most of our knowledge regarding what this level of BP should be is derived from population studies and large clinical trials. Population studies have shown that elevated BP is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and renal failure. Cardiovascular risk begins to increase when BP exceeds 115/75 mm Hg and doubles with each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP and 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP. The clinical benefit of BP reduction in patients with hypertension is well established. Thus, patients with less severe elevations in BP (high-normal) are at increased risk. Patients with diabetes or proteinuria benefit from even more aggressive reductions in BP. Despite the well-established benefits of BP reduction, hypertension is still not well treated, underscoring the need for more aggressive detection and better management. Although data from large clinical trials have provided valuable information to help guide treatment, application of clinical trial results to individual patients is limited by the heterogeneity of patient populations with respect to patient risk, comorbidities, and differences in genetic and environmental background. Ultimately, the treatment decisions should be tailored to each patient, integrating as much information as possible concerning the patient's history, risk, pathophysiology, and lifestyle.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^1133UAxf]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to quantify the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations from the five major drug classes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adult participants randomly assigned to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. Eligibility criteria included follow-up duration between 4 weeks and 26 weeks, antihypertensive drug treatment fixed in all participants for at least 4 weeks before follow-up blood pressure assessment; and availability of clinic blood pressure for the calculation of mean difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups. Crossover trials with less than 2 weeks' washout between the crossover periods were excluded. Eligible studies published between database inception and Dec 31, 2022 were identified from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Epistemonikos; searches were updated to include studies published between Jan 1, 2023, and Feb 28, 2025. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure-lowering efficacy was estimated using fixed-effects meta-analyses standardised to mean baseline blood pressure across included trials. Drug regimens were categorised into low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of < 10 mm Hg, 10–19 mm Hg, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively, from a baseline of 154 mm Hg. A model was developed to calculate efficacy for any combination of antihypertensives and validated on external trials of dual and triple combination antihypertensives. The study protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410036).

Findings

We analysed 484 trials including 104176 participants (mean age 54 years [SD 8], 57422 [55%] men, 46754 [45%] women, and mean baseline systolic blood pressure 154/100 mm Hg). Mean follow-up duration was 8.6 weeks (SD 5.2). On average, monotherapy at standard dose reduced systolic blood pressure by 8.7 mm Hg (95% CI 8.2–9.2), and each doubling in dose conferred an additional 1.5 mm Hg (1.2–1.7) reduction. Dual combinations at one standard dose conferred a 14.9 mm Hg (95% CI 13.1–16.8) reduction in systolic blood pressure, with each doubling of doses of both drugs conferring an additional reduction of 2.5 mm Hg (1.4–3.7). Each 10 mm Hg decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure reduced pressure-lowering efficacy by 1.3 mm Hg (1.0–1.5) for monotherapies, although differences between drug classes were observed. Among 57 monotherapies at standard dose, 45 (79%) were classified as low intensity. Of 189 different drug-dose dual combinations, 110 (58%) were classified as moderate intensity, and 21 (11%) as high intensity. There were considerable differences in dose-response and baseline blood pressure-response relationships between and within drug classes. The efficacy model showed a high correlation between predicted and observed systolic blood pressures when validated on external trials (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

These analyses provide robust estimates of the expected blood pressure-lowering effect for any combination of antihypertensive drugs, allowing their efficacy to be classified into low, moderate, and high intensity.

### New developments in antihypertensive drugs [^113tKWjt]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

New developments in antihypertensive drug treatment include optimizing the use of established drugs, the introduction of novel compounds, and a renewed appreciation that hypertension is but one of various cardiovascular risk factors that must be addressed in managing the patient with raised blood pressure. Thus, the approach used must be tailored to the individual patient both in terms of drug choice and dose as well as preventive measures. New drug development depends very much on improving our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertension and seems likely to be applied at the level of the renin angiotensin system and other local factors governing vascular smooth muscle function.

### Comprehensive comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes: a systematic, multinational, large-scale analysis [^114P3VVD]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice.

Methods

We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested.

Findings

Using 4.9 million patients, we generated 22000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75–0.95), hospitalisation for heart failure (0.83, 0.74–0.95), and stroke (0.83, 0.74–0.95) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes.

Interpretation

This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^114EkVCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^115uEuV7]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

International guidelines consider most antihypertensive medication (AHM) classes as equivalent options for treating primary hypertension. However, limited research has examined whether general practitioners (GPs) share this view or have specific prescribing preferences. Understanding GPs' perspectives is crucial for identifying how guidelines are implemented in daily practice. This study explores the perspectives, preferences, and prescribing practices of Dutch GPs regarding AHM classes in patients with primary hypertension who have no cardiovascular comorbidities or diabetes.

We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews among Dutch GPs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed.

Results

We interviewed 18 Dutch GPs (56% female) and identified three key themes: contextual factors when initiating treatment, preferences for AHM classes, and considerations on combination therapy. GPs consider lifestyle modifications, patient age, and initial blood pressure (BP) when deciding on treatment. Most GPs do not view all AHM classes as interchangeable, with their preferences shaped by perceived efficacy, side effects, and patient-specific factors, including ethnicity and patient preferences. GPs often favour a gradual titration approach, starting with one class before adjusting the dosage or adding another.

Conclusion

GPs adopt a multifaceted, patient-centred approach to hypertension, prioritizing lifestyle interventions and weighing short-term risks against long-term benefits. We identified several discrepancies between guideline recommendations and everyday practice-particularly regarding the perceived non-equivalence of AHM classes and limited support for initiating combination therapy. Incorporating GPs' perspectives into guideline development may lead to more practical, tailored recommendations that improve adherence and patient outcomes in real-world care.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112MMytN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Antihypertension medications have been associated with prevention of cardiovascular events, although less is known about the comparative effectiveness of different medication classes.

Objective

To compare contemporary aggregated first-in-trial cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities.

Data Sources

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and October 24, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that tested commonly used antihypertension medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics) and that reported selected cardiovascular outcomes for at least 6 months of follow-up.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The analysis was conducted from October 2017 to December 2019. Two reviewers extracted the number of cardiovascular events at the end of treatment for all study groups. For each outcome, a frequentist network meta-analysis was used to compare risk reductions between medication classes (random-effects models weighted by the inverse variance). The dose-response association between a 10-mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure and a 5-mm Hg reduction of diastolic blood pressure and the risk of first-in-trial cardiovascular events was estimated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

First-in-trial cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization.

Results

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, data were pooled from 46 eligible clinical trials (248 887 total participants with a mean [SD] age of 65.6 [5.8] years; 52.8% men). In the network meta-analysis, compared with placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events (25%), cardiovascular death (20%), and stroke (35%); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were reported to be the most effective in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (28%); and diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing revascularization (33%). In the metaregression analyses, each 10-mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, and overall cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities, different classes of antihypertension medications were associated with similar benefits in reducing cardiovascular events. Future studies should compare the effectiveness of combinations of antihypertension medications in reducing cardiovascular events.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^112f9VGv]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, there seems to be little or no difference between commonly used blood pressure lowering medications with regards cardiovascular risk reduction. Beta-blockers (atenolol) and alpha-blockers are the only drug-classes that were not significantly superior to any other drugs, for any outcome, and may thus not be prime candidates for first-line antihypertensive treatment.

### Newer renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker combinations: is there an advantage? [^1178Mdxh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The necessity for new and more effective management approaches to achieve blood pressure goals is still present in spite of the number of antihypertensive medications available. One of the cornerstones of successful therapy is implementation of drug combinations that act on complementary biological pathways. This review article focuses on the evaluation of recent data supporting newer combinations involving inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with other drug classes such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics.

Recent Findings

New angiotensin receptor blockers as well as renin inhibitors, with a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect than their predecessors, have emerged recently. The data presented in this text also strongly supports a combination therapy approach as initial therapy to achieve blood pressure goals in a timely fashion. Additionally, the blood pressure-lowering effect is more robust with lower-dose, single-pill combinations than with highest doses of single agents alone. Therefore, using combination agents is less prone to side effects. The challenges for such single-pill combinations remain affordability. For this reason, payers and patients have traditionally not preferred such agents in spite of better blood pressure control and adherence rates.

Summary

The new combinations of renin inhibitors and the new angiotensin receptor blocker combinations add to the armamentarium of agents to control blood pressure. Whereas the new angiotensin receptor blocker offers greater efficacy on blood pressure control over other agents in the class and the availability of the only chlorthalidone combination, no outcome data exist yet with any of the new agents.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^114HUXbU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

Our findings in relation to other systematic reviews

Other research groups have conducted network meta-analyses in this field before us, but our contribution adds important dimensions. First, some reviewers have only included one clinical outcome, while we included six clinically important ones. Second, others have reported only on selected drug-drug comparisons, rather than the full range of competing options. Third, a weakness across earlier reviews of the comparative effectiveness of different antihypertensive drugs is that they have not included an explicit assessment of the quality of the evidence backing the reported effect estimates. An important exception is the systematic review that informed the recently updated guidance from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), but their effect-estimates were based on the traditional, not the network meta-analytical approach.

Although disagreements between our findings and those of other systematic reviews are few and relatively minor, the conclusions drawn by authors vary somewhat.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Characteristics of populations excluded from clinical trials supporting intensive blood pressure control guidelines [^1122ZJKN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The majority of younger adults and older adults diagnosed with hypertension and recommended additional antihypertensive treatment by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would not have been eligible from the clinical trials underlying more intensive BP treatment thresholds. Clinical trials studying the outcomes of intensive BP treatment in younger adults at low cardiovascular risk and in older adults with multimorbidity are urgently needed, and, until these data are available, a patient‐centered approach that tailors treatments and targets by degree of BP elevation, comorbidity, and likelihood of benefit is likely preferable to universal adoption of intensive treatment targets.

### Do the combined blood pressure effects of exercise and antihypertensive medications add up to the sum of their parts? A systematic meta-review [^112M556J]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most predominant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) affecting nearly one in two adults in the USA; while CVD is the leading cause of death and disability in the USA and world accounting for one in three deaths. Zanchetti et al performed a meta-analysis (MA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and found antihypertensive medication use reduced all major types of cardiovascular events and death. Indeed, pharmacological treatment generated reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 9–10 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) of 4–5 mm Hg decreased the relative risk for all-cause mortality by 11%, cardiovascular morality by 16%, coronary heart disease by 18% and stroke by 36%. Exercise is also recommended as antihypertensive lifestyle therapy because it lowers BP 5–8 mm Hg among adults with hypertension, prevents the development of hypertensionand reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the well-established BP benefits of antihypertensive medications and exercise to prevent, treat and control hypertension, little is known about their comparative BP effects alone and combined in the treatment of hypertension.

Two recent network MAs (NMA) addressed this important knowledge gap with slightly different findings. Naci et al were the first to compare the BP lowering effects of exercise vs medications on SBP among healthy adults with normal BP, prehypertension and hypertension. They found aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise performed alone or combined reduced SBP by ~9 mm Hg among adults with hypertension, with no detectable difference in the magnitude of the SBP reductions to those resulting from antihypertensive medications. Noone et al were the second to compare the BP-lowering effects of exercise and medications among adults with hypertension on BP in RCTs with a sample size of > 20 participants. They concluded there was insufficient evidence to suggest antihypertensive medications were better than exercise in lowering BP. Despite the efforts of these two investigative teams to directly compare the effectiveness of exercise and medication as antihypertensive therapeutic options, the authors acknowledged the exercise arms contained participants treated with medication so that the BP effects reported were not necessarily due to exercise per se, and RCTs that directly compared exercise to medications were not included.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^116gxaYu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but most of the evidence is in people 60 years of age and older. We wanted to know what the effects of therapy are in people 18 to 59 years of age.

Objectives

To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. To quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality plus morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality plus morbidity), withdrawal due adverse events and estimate magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering at one year.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year' duration comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater or DBP 90 mmHg or greater at baseline, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular (CVS) mortality plus morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse events, and decrease in SBP and DBP. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed-effect model to combine outcomes across trials. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

The population in the seven included studies (17,327 participants) were predominantly healthy adults with mild to moderate primary hypertension. The Medical Research Council Trial of Mild Hypertension contributed 14,541 (84%) of total randomized participants, with mean age of 50 years and mean baseline blood pressure of 160/98 mmHg and a mean duration of follow-up of five years. Treatments used in this study were bendrofluazide 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg to 240 mg daily with addition of methyldopa if required. The risk of bias in the studies was high or unclear for a number of domains and led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes. Based on five studies, antihypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or untreated control may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality (2.4% with control vs 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.13). Based on 4 studies, the effects on coronary heart disease were uncertain due to low quality evidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19). Low quality evidence from six studies showed that drug therapy may reduce total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity from 4.1% to 3.2% over five years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (1.3% with control vs 0.6% with treatment; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Very low quality evidence from three studies showed that withdrawals due to adverse events were higher with drug therapy from 0.7% to 3.0% (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.92). The effects on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drugs used to treat predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension have a small absolute effect to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity primarily due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease were not reduced. There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to adverse events. Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

### Comparison of cardiovascular events among users of different classes of antihypertension medications: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Sst98]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which classes of antihypertension medications are reported to be associated with reductions in first-in-trial cardiovascular events?

Findings

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of 46 randomized clinical trials that performed direct comparisons of individual antihypertension medication classes among 248 887 patients with hypertension and no substantial comorbidities, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and diuretics were reported to be similarly effective in reducing cardiovascular death, stroke, and overall cardiovascular events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics were reported to be the most effective in reducing myocardial infarction and revascularization, respectively.

Meaning

The reported effects of different antihypertension medication classes were largely similar, with only nuanced differences.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

Our analysis is, to date, the most comprehensive analysis of the existing data on the comparative effectiveness of different antihypertensive drug-classes used in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

As for most other systematic reviews in this field we find limited evidence of important differences between the various drug-classes. The differences we do find are not easy to put into practice as the ranking of a drug-class depends on which outcome one chooses to emphasize, and no drugs are consistently among the best across all important outcomes.

Our ranking of drug-classes, as presented in Table 5 may be useful to decision makers, or it may add to the confusion. By presenting the chance that a drug is among the top three for an outcome, we had hoped that one or two drugs would emerge as first choice candidates by being among the three best drugs across several important outcomes. However, no such pattern appeared. We should also point out that the quality of the underlying evidence is not taken into consideration in the ranking, thus the results should be interpreted cautiously, and in conjunction with the drug-comparison findings (Tables 3 and 4).

Beta-blockers (atenolol) were inferior to all drug-classes for all primary outcomes, and although the difference in many cases was non-significant and the quality of the evidence was mixed, this may be seen as evidence against opting for these drugs as the first choice. Beta-blockers and alpha-blockers were the only drug-classes that were not significantly superior to any drug, for any outcome, which could suggest not recommending these as first line medication.

Clinical inferences

Successful management of hypertension is dependent on many factors, and choice of drug class is one that seems to be of limited importance. Thus, clinicians should probably focus more on issues such as limiting adverse events, improving adherence and better follow up of patients rather than on which drug to select. However, there is considerable variation in costs across different antihypertensive agents, thus cost-effectiveness assessments may be important for decisions about choice of medications.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^116ekrY6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses, as appropriate. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).

Main Results

Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. They compared beta-blockers to placebo (4 RCTs, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 RCTs, 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 RCTs, 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 RCTs, 10,828 participants). These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta-blockers, three-quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons. Total CVD was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Most outcome RCTs on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice [^111bx9qM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

A clear relationship exists between elevated blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the availability of numerous treatment guidelines, hypertension remains inadequately controlled, with only a small proportion of patients achieving target BP levels. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Major determinants include the implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not enable patients to achieve goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely acknowledged that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve BP goal; however, physicians may be reluctant to employ such treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to explore factors that contribute to poor hypertension control rates and how to overcome these, including the rationale for selecting combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations.

### Hypertension: evolving from standardized to individualized care [^111Tt2kE]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The hypertension paradigm has contributed to a dramatic reduction in CVD mortality. This has been achieved by applying average results of population studies to identify a target population and design a common intervention to achieve a BP goal. Progressive lowering of the BP threshold has expanded the fraction of persons at risk who have access to treatment. Meanwhile, falling risk reduces potential benefit, while treatment-induced adverse events increase - making further expansion of the treatment pool no longer tenable. Still, CVD remains the leading cause of death. Fortunately, new science reveals opportunities to enhance CVD prevention when BP management is based upon individual characteristics. Treatment can be directed at those most likely to benefit, while sparing others the hazards of unnecessary therapy. Treatment can be designed to achieve a variety of physiological objectives that influence cardiovascular outcomes. This new strategy should improve both the efficacy and efficiency of BP-related CVD prevention.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend to consider adding antihypertensive drugs from other classes if the goal BP cannot be reached using only the above drugs because of a contraindication or the need to use more than three drugs to reach the goal BP.

Relative risk estimates and quality of evidence

The various drug-classes and number of studies per direct comparison included in our network-analysis are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2
Direct comparisons in network model.

Tables 3 and 4 display effect estimates for our primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. The tables also include the results of the quality assessment of the evidence underlying each effect estimate. We have limited the tables to include only the most clinically relevant comparisons, that is, we have excluded "diuretics and/or beta-blockers", "conventional drugs" or "placebo/control". The complete presentation is found in Additional files 3 and 4. A detailed presentation of the quality of evidence assessments is found in Additional file 5.

As expected, the results were favoring active drug treatment over placebo or no treatment.

For most drug-drug comparisons, we found few significant differences, and for most comparisons the quality of the evidence was rated as low (or very low). Overall, the results were ambiguous, with no drug-class standing out as superior across different outcomes.

There was high quality evidence that beta-blockers are inferior to ARB in terms of total mortality (RR 1.14; 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.28). Other significant mortality differences represented only low or very low quality evidence.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116iPpfD]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend to increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEi, or ARB) if goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment. Continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until the goal BP is reached.
