## Question

Can an ACE inhibitor be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ACE inhibitors can be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ductal closure and which pharmacologic pathways actually modulate it. Then, I should verify what the labeled and evidence-based pharmacologic options are and in which age groups they work. Next, I will examine standard-of-care management for PDA in adults and confirm whether any role for ACE inhibitors exists there. Finally, I'll synthesize whether there is any mechanistic or clinical rationale for ACE inhibitors to achieve ductal closure in adults and clarify their potential supportive role while definitive therapy is arranged [^113Pade5] [^112E2XhD].

> Let me first confirm the biologic pathway that governs ductal patency and closure. The ductus arteriosus remains patent via prostaglandin E2 signaling and closes postnatally with prostaglandin withdrawal and rising oxygen tension; pharmacologic closure hinges on cyclooxygenase inhibition with agents like indomethacin or ibuprofen, which is effective primarily in preterm neonates, not in older infants or adults; ACE inhibitors reduce afterload via the renin-angiotensin system but do not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis or directly constrict ductal smooth muscle, so mechanistically they are not ductus-closing drugs; hold on, I should verify the on-label pharmacologic option to ensure I'm not missing an adult indication — yes, the FDA label for indomethacin restricts closure indications to premature infants, underscoring that pharmacologic closure targets prostaglandins in the neonatal period, not in adults [^115dxge6] [^116HP8Uf] [^1143UpA1].

> Wait, let me verify whether any of the provided literature even suggests ACE inhibitors close the ductus. I see only one tangential pediatric Medicaid cohort where patients treated with digoxin or preload/afterload reducers, including ACE inhibitors, were more likely to proceed to PDA repair; that signal reflects sicker patients receiving supportive heart failure therapy en route to definitive closure, not pharmacologic ductal closure by ACE inhibitors; in fact, this association argues that ACE inhibitor use tracks with hemodynamically significant shunts that ultimately required repair, not spontaneous or drug-induced closure by ACE inhibitors [^115AiRUq].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for adults. For adults, transcatheter occlusion is the preferred treatment, with excellent safety and outcomes across registries; surgery is reserved for anatomically unsuitable ducts, including calcified or very large ducts, and alternative endovascular approaches like stent-grafts have been described in select scenarios; to be thorough, I need to check whether any adult guideline or review inserts a pharmacologic option — none do — and contemporary reviews emphasize device closure as the mainstay beyond early infancy [^112E2XhD] [^113Pade5] [^114mbiWN] [^116NfUdk] [^116JkvEr].

> Hold on, I should verify age-related efficacy of pharmacologic closure. Multiple sources reiterate that outside the first postnatal months, pharmacologic therapy like indomethacin or ibuprofen is no longer effective at closing the ductus; efficacy data for cyclooxygenase inhibitors come from preterm infant randomized trials and do not translate to older children or adults, and overviews of neonatal interventions further highlight the limitations of medical therapy even in preterms, reinforcing that adults are well beyond the effective window for drug-induced closure [^113Pade5] [^116HP8Uf] [^112MymwN].

> Let me think about clinical implications and potential harms of relying on ACE inhibitors instead of definitive closure. ACE inhibitors may palliate heart failure by afterload reduction in a left-to-right shunt but will leave the anatomic defect and shunt physiology in place, risking progression to pulmonary hypertension and maintaining the substrate for endarteritis; adults with PDA and pulmonary hypertension are managed with careful hemodynamic assessment and, when appropriate, closure, not chronic medical therapy aimed at closing the duct; I need to ensure I'm clear here: using ACE inhibitors as supportive therapy while arranging closure is reasonable, but they are not a closure therapy and should not delay referral for transcatheter or surgical occlusion when indicated [^112E2XhD] [^116Svoga] [^113pkLvA].

> Synthesis and direct answer: No, ACE inhibitors cannot be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in adults; there is no mechanistic basis via prostaglandin pathways, no clinical evidence of efficacy for ductal closure in this age group, and adult standard-of-care management is mechanical occlusion; ACE inhibitors may be used adjunctively for heart failure symptom control in adults with PDA while definitive transcatheter or surgical closure is planned, but they are not therapeutic agents for ductal closure itself [^113Pade5] [^112E2XhD] [^115AiRUq].

ACE inhibitors are **not effective** for closing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in adults and are **not recommended** for this purpose [^113Pade5]. They **do not target the prostaglandin-mediated pathway** required for ductal closure [^1143UpA1] and may worsen hemodynamics by increasing shunt flow. The standard of care for adult PDA is transcatheter device closure, with surgical ligation reserved for cases unsuitable for catheter-based intervention [^112E2XhD].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and increase bradykinin, causing vasodilation and lower systemic vascular resistance. However, they **do not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis**, which is central to ductal closure; NSAIDs (indomethacin [^1143UpA1], ibuprofen [^1122ETx8]) achieve closure by reducing prostaglandin E2, but ACE inhibitors do not [^115dxge6].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for ACE inhibitors to close PDA in adults [^113Pade5]. They are not included in any adult PDA management recommendations [^113Lrwde], and no trials or case series support their use for this indication.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

ACE inhibitors can **increase left-to-right shunt flow** by lowering systemic resistance, potentially worsening heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. They also carry risks of hypotension, renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough, which may complicate management in adults with hemodynamically significant PDA.

---

## Current standard of care for PDA closure in adults

The standard of care for adult PDA is **transcatheter device closure**, which is safe and effective with high success and low complication rates [^1112pWUY]. Surgical ligation is reserved for anatomically unsuitable cases or when transcatheter closure is not feasible [^113Pade5] [^116Svoga].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

ACE inhibitors are **not effective for PDA closure in adults** and are not recommended. They do not address the prostaglandin pathway required for closure [^1143UpA1] and may worsen hemodynamics. Transcatheter device closure remains the preferred definitive therapy, with surgery as a backup for unsuitable cases [^113Pade5].

Treatments in older patients (term infant through adulthood)

Beyond the first postnatal months, term infants are outside the window when pharmacological therapy, such as indomethacin and ibuprofen, is effective for closing the ductus. Although diuretics may be used to treat pulmonary overcirculation among term infants with a PDA in the first months of life, decisions regarding the need for ductal closure are largely driven by the presence or absence of HSPDA. Consideration is also given to the direction of ductal shunting and pulmonary artery systemic pressure and/or pulmonary vascular resistance indexed to systemic pressure (see Figure 5). The frequency and timing of outpatient follow‐up are determined based on PDA classification.

- **Transcatheter PDA closure**: This remains the mainstay for definitive ductal closure in older patients. In patients weighing over 6 kg, most PDAs are amenable to transcatheter occlusion, with the notable exception of the type B ductus (see Figure 2). According to 2011 guidelines from the American Heart Association on cardiac catheterization in pediatric heart disease, transcatheter PDA occlusion is indicated in older patients for the treatment of an HSPDA with a "left‐to‐right shunt that results in any of the following: congestive heart failure, failure to thrive, pulmonary overcirculation, or an enlarged left atrium or left ventricle, provided the anatomy and patient size are suitable".

### Challenges encountered during closure of patent ductus arteriosus [^111dM2Sr]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was one of the first interventions established in invasive cardiology and is now more than 30 years old. The challenges for successful closure with the first devices in children included handling the rather large introducer sheaths and stiff application systems. Today, interventional closure can be performed with different types of plugs, occluders, and coils. Beyond infancy, transcatheter closure can be successfully performed in almost all cases.

- **Technical challenges**: Closure of window-type ducts can be technically challenging, as excessive protrusion of the device into the descending aorta should be avoided. Similarly, closure of tubular ducts can be difficult due to the challenges associated with securely anchoring one or more devices in the vessel. For a combination of coarctation and an open duct, different strategies can be considered. In selected cases, the use of a covered stent can be helpful.

- **Physiological challenges**: Open ducts in patients with pulmonary hypertension, with or without concomitant congenital heart diseases, can present physiological challenges. Testing vasoreactivity with a temporarily blocked duct and considering treatment with vasodilators may be necessary before deciding on definitive duct occlusion.

Large ducts in infants less than 8 kg can be difficult to treat due to a relative mismatch of introducers, plugs, or occluders to the small anatomic dimensions. The implantation of multiple coils can be associated with a higher risk.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^114mbiWN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The technique and safety of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure have evolved during the past 20 years. We sought to report a multicenter experience of PDA closure with a focus on the rate of adverse events (AE) and a review of institutional practice differences.

- **Methods and results**: Outcome data on transcatheter PDA closure were collected at 8 centers prospectively using a multicenter registry (Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcome Registry). Between February 2007 and June 2010, 496 PDA closures were recorded using a device in 338 (68%) or coils in 158 (32%). Most patients had an isolated PDA (90%). Fifty percent of patients were between 6 months and 3 years old, with only 40 patients (8%) who had a PDA measuring over 2 mm. In 9% of cases (n = 46), an AE occurred; however, only 11 (2%) were classified as high severity. Younger age was associated with a higher AE rate. Coil-related AEs were more common than device-related AEs (10% versus 2%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: PDA closure in the present era has a very low rate of complications, although these are higher in younger children. Technical intervention-related events were more common in coil procedures compared with device procedures.

### Study protocol: Baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^115ihPHv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The question of whether to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) early or wait until symptoms appear remains high on the research agenda for neonatal medicine. Around 7,000 extremely preterm babies under 29 weeks' gestation are born in the UK every year. In 40% of cases, the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by four months of age. Untreated PDA can be associated with several serious and life-threatening short and long-term complications. Reliable data to support clinical decisions about PDA treatment are needed to prevent serious complications in high-risk babies, while minimizing undue exposure of infants. With the availability of routine bedside echocardiography, babies with a large PDA can be diagnosed before they become symptomatic.

- **Methods**: This is a multicentre, masked, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to determine if early-targeted treatment of a large PDA with parenteral ibuprofen in extremely preterm babies (23+0–6 weeks' gestation) improves short and long-term health and economic outcomes. With parental informed consent, extremely preterm babies (born between 23+0–6 weeks' gestation) admitted to tertiary neonatal units are screened using echocardiography. Babies with a large PDA on echocardiography, defined by a diameter of at least 1.5 mm and an unrestricted pulsatile PDA flow pattern, are randomly allocated to either ibuprofen or placebo within 72 hours of birth. The primary endpoint is the composite outcome of death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: An overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^112MymwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The need for subsequent open-label therapy, including definitive surgical PDA closure, highlights that medical therapy, although better than placebo, is not a highly effective option for PDA closure. Most RCTs of medical treatment focus on drug therapy rather than on eliminating the PDA shunt. Despite growing calls for accepting the null hypothesis and abandoning further clinical trials on PDA management, evidence underscores the need to clearly establish which PDA shunts, if any, are associated with worse clinical outcomes. It is crucial to pursue further clinical trials that include only those infants at the highest risk of PDA-attributable morbidities and to explore highly effective and safe shunt elimination strategies for these clinically significant PDA shunts.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^112sqteu]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a large body of basic science, clinical research, and clinical experience with thousands of infants over nearly six decades, there is still uncertainty and controversy about the significance, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. This results in substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice. The purpose of this clinical report is to summarize the evidence available to guide evaluation and treatment of preterm infants with prolonged ductal patency in the first few weeks after birth.

### Congenital heart disease in aircrew [^113Lrwde]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is usually recognized early in life and closed pharmacologically with ibuprofen or indomethacin, through surgical ligation, or using a percutaneous closure device. PDA can be associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), subaortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis (PS), and aortic root disease; these conditions must be excluded before PDA closure. Occasionally, PDAs closed early in childhood can recanalize as the individual grows. In adulthood, further recanalization is unlikely. With appropriate follow-up, a closed PDA in childhood is compatible with unrestricted flying. However, if a percutaneous device closure has been used, it may preclude aircrew from high-performance flying due to concerns regarding device movement or embolization. Additionally, the risk of endocarditis may preclude military service.

If the PDA is small and untreated, abnormal physiology is rarely seen in adults. A small, untreated PDA is rarely associated with an increased risk of endocarditis. It may, rarely, result in pulmonary hypertension, which can sometimes develop slowly over many years. In aircrew, this may manifest as palpitations secondary to right atrial dilation, dyspnea on exertion, or hypoxia. Pulmonary hypertension is a barrier to initial flying certification and is usually associated with the restriction of flying privileges, or grounding, if diagnosed in existing aircrew.

Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defects are present in 25–33% of the population. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is often an incidental finding in asymptomatic aircrew undergoing echocardiography for the investigation of other conditions.

### Transcatheter closure of residual patent ductus arteriosus [^113pkLvA]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Residual patent ductus arteriosus (rPDAs) can occur following surgical or transcatheter treatment and are indicated for closure because of the risks of infective endarteritis and hemolysis, in addition to the hemodynamic effect of the residual left-to-right shunt.

- **Methods**: This retrospective descriptive study describes our experience at two Egyptian centers (Cairo University Children's Hospital and Tanta University Hospital) with transcatheter treatment of rPDAs, from January 2009 to October 2017.

- **Results**: Twenty cases were treated: 17 out of 20 postsurgical and 3 out of 20 post-transcatheter, at a mean period of 13.4 ± 9.3 months from the initial procedure. The median rPDA size was 2 mm (range 2–3.5 mm). The most common ductal anatomy was the conical shape. All rPDAs were successfully closed with either coils (13 out of 20) or devices (6 out of 20), except one case where the residual flow was within the device mesh material. Coils could be deployed from the antegrade or the retrograde approaches, although the latter was associated with a higher incidence of late shunt occlusion. One case with a malpositioned device required simultaneous device and LPA stent deployment.

- **Conclusion**: Transcatheter closure of rPDAs is feasible in most cases but may be technically challenging.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^116HP8Uf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor(s), placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 39 studies enrolling 2,843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.86]).

### Adult patent ductus arteriosus: treatment with a stent-graft [^116JkvEr]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with a short patent ductus arteriosus and aneurysmal pulmonary arteries who was treated by placement of a stent-graft. The technique proved simple and safe. Further research is required to improve the design of stent-grafts and their release system for use of this technique in adult patients with this disorder.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^113SSYjq]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

In many preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus remains patent beyond the first few days of life. This prolonged patency is associated with numerous adverse outcomes, but the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established. Different treatment strategies have failed to improve short-term outcomes, with a paucity of data on the correct diagnostic and pathophysiological assessment of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in association with long-term outcomes.

Echocardiography is the selected method of choice for detecting a PDA, assessing the impact on the preterm circulation, and monitoring treatment response. PDA in a preterm infant can result in pulmonary overcirculation and systemic hypoperfusion; therefore, echocardiographic assessment should include evaluation of PDA characteristics, indices of pulmonary overcirculation with left heart loading conditions, and indices of systemic hypoperfusion.

In this review, we provide an evidence-based overview of the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer indications and limitations for using Neonatologist Performed Echocardiography to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA.

### Failure of ductus arteriosus closure is associated with increased mortality in preterm infants [^112gcmL7]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Because the standard of care has been to attempt to close the patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates, there is a paucity of information on the outcome of patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Our objective was to compare the mortality of preterm infants with and without a persistent patent ductus arteriosus.

This was a single-center, retrospective study. Very preterm infants (birth weight ≤ 1500 g and gestational age ≤ 29 weeks) who survived beyond the first 3 postnatal days and did not undergo surgical ligation were included in the primary analysis. Mortality of neonates with a persistent and a closed patent ductus arteriosus was compared during the initial hospitalization using the chi-square test. Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression were used to take into account the time until death and assess the independent effect of each risk factor on mortality. We also performed three secondary analyses by excluding patients who died during the first 7 and 14 postnatal days and including patients who underwent surgical ligation using different group assignments. A persistent patent ductus arteriosus was defined as a failure of either spontaneous or pharmacologic ductal closure during the initial hospitalization.

Patients with a persistent patent ductus arteriosus (n = 41) had lower birth weight and were less mature than those with a closed ductus (n = 260). The unadjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with a persistent (70.7%) than with a closed (11.2%) ductus. After adjustment for perinatal factors, the analysis continues.

### Novel drug targets for ductus arteriosus manipulation: Looking beyond prostaglandins [^115dxge6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Forty years ago, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were first reported to decrease systemic prostaglandin levels and promote ductus arteriosus (DA) closure. However, prolonged patency of the DA (PDA) remains a significant clinical problem, complicated by imperfect therapies and wide variations in treatment strategy. There are few pharmacology-based tools available for treating PDA, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, or for maintaining DA patency with PGE1, which is necessary to facilitate corrective surgery for ductus-dependent congenital heart defects. Unfortunately, all of these treatments are inefficient and are associated with concerning adverse effects. This review highlights novel potential DA drug targets that may expand our therapeutic repertoire beyond the prostaglandin pathway.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^113yxuqw]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

The significance of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its impact on long-term cardiorespiratory health remain areas of ongoing debate in neonatology. Even the persistent patency of a PDA is a clinical conundrum, as most premature neonates in whom the PDA fails to close in the first week of age or even by the time of discharge will undergo spontaneous closure without experiencing significant cardiac morbidity. Although prolonged patency may be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established. Currently, echocardiography is the most clinically applicable modality for identifying a PDA, with Neonatologist Performed Echocardiography (NPE) potentially playing an essential role in devising treatment options and assessing their impact on the preterm circulation. Centers that develop NPE may greatly benefit from the "unfettered" access to echocardiography with a targeted approach that focuses on the high-risk patient population with specific hemodynamic characteristics receiving treatment.

The purpose of this review is not to advise on treatment options but to provide a practice guideline on how to evaluate hemodynamic significance and characterize shunt volume using NPE. Specifically, in this review, we discuss the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer recommendations for using NPE to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA and understand the implications of such approaches.

### Patent ductus arteriosus, its treatments, and the risks of pulmonary morbidity [^114AxfY6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of hydrostatic fluid filtration into the lung's interstitium, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure leads to improved alveolarization and minimizes the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although routine prophylactic treatment of a PDA on the day of birth does not appear to offer any more protection against BPD than delaying treatment for 2–3 days, recent evidence from quality improvement trials suggests that early pharmacologic treatment decreases the incidence of BPD compared with a treatment approach that exposes infants to a moderate-to-large PDA shunt for the first 7–10 days after birth. After the first week, routine pharmacologic treatment (compared with continued PDA exposure) no longer appears to alter the course of BPD development. Evidence from epidemiologic, preclinical, and randomized controlled trials demonstrates that early ductus ligation is an independent risk factor for the development of BPD.

### Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults [^116Svoga]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults carries a higher risk than in children.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the application of self-expandable occluders for transcatheter closure of PDA associated with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults, and the assessment of immediate and short-term results.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine adult patients (6 men, 23 women) underwent attempted transcatheter closure of PDA at a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 31.1 (11.4) years (range 18–58 years) and a mean (SD) weight of 54.1 (7.1) kg (range 42–71 kg). Based on hemodynamic and clinical data obtained before and after trial occlusion, the final duct occlusion was determined and carried out. Radiographs of the chest, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms were used for follow-up evaluation of the treatment within 1 day, 1 month, and 3–6 months after successful closure.

- **Results**: Twenty of the 29 patients had successful occlusion (group 1), and 9 patients failed (group 2). In group 1, mean (SD) pulmonary arterial pressures decreased markedly after trial occlusion: 78 (19.3) mm Hg (range 50–125 mm Hg) before occlusion to 41 (13.8) mm Hg (range 23–77 mm Hg) after occlusion. Systemic arterial oxygen saturation was found to be > 90% in 19 patients and 95% during inhalation of oxygen or after occlusion in all 20 patients. In group 2, occlusion was not successful because, in two patients, the device was not available.

### Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder clinical trial for percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in patients ≥ 700 grams [^112vvHz5]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Characterize the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure.

The presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in children born premature.

This was a single-arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study evaluating the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder to treat PDA in patients ≥ 700g. From June 2017 to February 2019, 200 patients were enrolled at nine centers, with 100 patients weighing ≤ 2kg. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of PDA closure at 6-month follow-up, while the primary safety endpoint involved the rate of major complications through 6 months. The secondary endpoint was the rate of significant pulmonary or aortic obstruction through 6 months' follow-up.

The implant success rate was 95.5% (191/200) overall and 99% in patients ≤ 2 kg (99/100). The primary effectiveness endpoint was achieved in 99.4% of implanted patients. Four patients experienced a primary safety endpoint event, which included two transfusions, one case of hemolysis, and one aortic obstruction. No branch pulmonary artery obstructions occurred. Five patients, all ≤ 2 kg, presented with worsening tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after the procedure; however, none of the TR incidences were clinically significant. The Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder received FDA approval in January 2019, becoming the first device approved for PDA closure in patients ≥ 700g.

This study supports the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder, particularly in patients between 700g.

### Adult patent ductus arteriosus closure with a pedicled pulmonary arterial patch [^116NfUdk]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The vascular wall of patent ductus arteriosus in adults is usually fragile due to atherosclerosis with calcification. In adults, surgical treatment, such as direct or patch closure, is sometimes required for a wide, short, or calcified patent ductus arteriosus. We present a novel technique for patent ductus arteriosus closure with a pedicled patch created from the wall of a dilated pulmonary artery. We believe that this technique, in which only autologous tissue is used, is safe and has excellent durability.

### Study protocol: Baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^113ZYHup]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a vessel that allows blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetal lungs to the placenta. In term babies, it closes spontaneously after birth when breathing is established and is structurally closed following a few days. However, in a large number of preterm babies, the vessel does not close spontaneously, resulting in a condition known as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Around 7,000 extremely preterm babies (< 29 weeks' gestation) are born in the UK every year. In 40%, the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by 4 months of age.

PDA is associated with a number of serious and life-threatening short and long-term complications. Complications of prematurity, such as low blood pressure (hypotension), bleeding in the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage), and brain (intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)), present soon after birth. Other systemic complications, such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), present before discharge, and long-term health problems, such as neurodevelopmental disability and chronic respiratory problems, can be associated with PDA. The persistence of PDA has also been reported to be associated with an 8-fold increase in neonatal mortality. Additionally, it places a significant financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS).

Historically, clinicians who have been concerned about the symptomatic PDA or complications of prematurity have attempted to close PDA utilizing medical (pharmacological) or surgical treatment. Traditionally, medical treatment is instituted as prophylactic treatment.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^112ihpzK]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Refining the use of NPE in the management of the PDA involves recognizing early predictors to improve treatment outcomes. Identifying early echocardiographic predictors of ductal patency might lead to a more targeted approach, potentially reducing the side effects of therapy by avoiding unnecessary treatment and prolonged exposure to a potentially harmful shunt. Several studies have addressed this and identified different variables with varying predictive capacity. Most parameters have good specificity but lack sensitivity. The studies varied significantly in the timing of the initial echocardiography, study population, and endpoint preferences.

A ductal diameter of ≥ 1.5 mm within the first 31 hours, a Doppler pulsatile ductal flow pattern appearance, and a ratio of systolic to end-diastolic ductal flow velocity > 1.9 within the first 48 hours are predictors with the highest sensitivity and specificity for patency. Recently, a PDA severity score, based on echocardiographic variables of pulmonary overcirculation and diastolic left ventricular function, was significantly associated with chronic lung disease or death. Serial echocardiography in one study showed marked divergence in parameters between infants with and without PDA during the first week of life.

Currently, one prospective trial has studied a targeted approach based on echocardiographic prediction of patency. Unfortunately, the study remained underpowered to test the primary outcome, but there was a significant reduction in pulmonary hemorrhage in the treatment group.

### Indomethacin [^1143UpA1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Indomethacin for injection is indicated to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,750 grams when 48 hours of usual medical management (e.g. fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc) is ineffective. Clear-cut clinical evidence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus should be present, such as respiratory distress, a continuous murmur, a hyperactive precordium, cardiomegaly, or pulmonary plethora on chest x-ray.

Indomethacin for injection is a cardiovascular drug indicated to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,750 grams.

### Sizing of patent ductus arteriosus in adults for transcatheter closure using the balloon pull-through technique [^112dpNxi]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

To describe a novel balloon sizing technique used during adult transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure, this study determines the clinical and procedural outcomes in six patients who underwent PDA balloon sizing with the subsequent deployment of a PDA occluder device.

Transcatheter PDA closure in adults is known for its excellent safety and procedural outcomes. However, PDA sizing can be challenging due to variable defect size, high flow state, or anatomical complexity. This paper describes a series of six cases where the balloon pull-through technique was successfully performed for PDA sizing prior to transcatheter closure.

Consecutive adult patients undergoing PDA closure at our institution were studied retrospectively. A partially inflated sizing balloon was pulled through the defect from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, and the balloon waist diameter was measured. Procedural success and clinical outcomes were obtained.

Six adult patients underwent successful balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing during transcatheter PDA closure, as conventional angiography often gave suboptimal opacification of the defect. All PDAs were treated with closure devices based on balloon PDA sizing with complete closure and no complications. In three patients who underwent preprocedure computed tomography, the balloon size matched the CT-derived measurements.

The balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing is confirmed as a safe and accurate sizing modality in adults undergoing transcatheter PDA closure.

### Transcatheter closure of large patent ductus arteriosus using custom made devices [^114UeY72]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

There has been a paradigm shift in the transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) over the last 45 years. With the availability of various coils, plugs, and occluders, PDAs of almost all shapes and sizes are amenable to transcatheter closure. However, very large PDAs diagnosed late in life are often referred for surgical closure in the absence of large-size devices, especially in developing countries. In this case series, we describe four patients with large PDAs, three of whom were closed using transcatheter custom-made PDA occluders.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^112GymJp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Overall rates of adverse events (AEs), including high-severity AEs (levels 3, 4, and 5), were higher in patients weighing less than 6 kg. In smaller patients, vascular access is more challenging, leading to a higher rate of compromised limb circulation or hematoma compared to larger patients. Given the higher incidence of AEs when a coil was used in the group weighing less than 6 kg, it is preferable to use a device; this is feasible because the patent ductus arteriosuses (PDAs) tend to be larger in this group. Although surgery might be preferred for this age group, it is also associated with complications such as bleeding, pneumothorax, vocal cord paresis, diaphragm paralysis, bronchial compression, and ligation of the left pulmonary artery and aorta.

- **Univariate analysis**: The best predictor of AEs was young age (less than 6 months). There was a notable trend of increased AEs with low body weight (less than 6 kg), pulmonary hypertension, and a complex cardiac defect besides a PDA. In a multivariate model that included age less than 6 months, other patient and procedural characteristics did not prove to be independent predictors of AEs.

Because transcatheter closure of PDA is the treatment of choice outside of the newborn period, understanding the AEs associated with this procedure is critical. The results of the study enhance our comprehension of patient and procedure characteristics linked to AEs in PDA closure. This information is vital for informing families and preparing physicians to perform safer procedures.

This report presents the largest cohort of patients with PDA closure recorded in a prospective manner.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^112E2XhD]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a condition resulting from the failure of the physiological mechanism that closes the fetal duct between the left pulmonary artery and the thoracic aorta after birth. Isolated PDA is estimated to account for 10–12% of all congenital heart diseases. Presentation in adult life is rare. The clinical manifestations of PDA mainly depend on the ductus size and the pressure gradient, which may lead to pulmonary hypertension and consequently to chest pain. PDA can be tolerated for many years without clinical signs or symptoms, but patients may become symptomatic when associated with acquired conditions such as recurrent pneumonia or the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For adults, transcatheter occlusion of the patent ductus is the preferred treatment. CT provides valuable pre-treatment information regarding the localization, size, and shape of the duct.

### Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in very-low-weight infants [^1148j7Dg]. NeoReviews (2020). Low credibility.

In view of the known complications of drug therapy and open surgical ligation, and the potential for prolonged patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exposure to be harmful, health care practitioners have sought new approaches to achieve definitive ductal closure. Interest in percutaneous (catheter-based) PDA closure has emerged within the neonatal community as a viable treatment option, fueled by recent procedural and device modifications and mounting feasibility and safety data.

Herein, we provide a contemporary review of percutaneous PDA closure among infants at the crux of the medical debate — very-low-weight infants (≤ 1,500 g). This includes:

- **Characterization of traditional PDA treatments**: Drug therapy, open surgical ligation, and conservative (nonintervention) management options.
- **General overview of the major procedural steps**: Details of percutaneous ductal closure, including efforts to reduce thrombotic complications and the emergence of a novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved device.
- **Systematic review and meta-analysis**: Aimed at better understanding the risk profiles of percutaneous PDA closure in this population.
- **Discussion of gaps in our understanding of optimal PDA care**: Emphasizes the critical need for well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: Pathophysiology and management [^115WKVXq]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm newborns prior to 28 weeks of gestation presents numerous challenges concerning treatment regimens' type and timing. A PDA results in increased pulmonary blood flow and redistribution of flow to other organs. Several co-morbidities such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy are associated with the presence of a PDA. However, whether a PDA is responsible for their development remains unclear. The prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, effectively treats PDA. Questions regarding the optimal timing of intervention — either early prophylaxis or treatment once signs and symptoms become evident — have challenged physicians for decades. Both evidence and experience are explored in this article. Comparative physiology between full-term and preterm newborns and the barriers preventing the necessary cascade of events leading to the permanent constriction of the PDA are reviewed.

### Transcriptional evaluation of the ductus arteriosus at the single-cell level uncovers a requirement for Vim (vimentin) for complete closure [^114r9GCC]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). High credibility.

Failure to close the ductus arteriosus, known as patent ductus arteriosus, accounts for 10% of all congenital heart defects. Despite significant advances in the management of patent ductus arteriosus, including pharmacological treatment targeting the prostaglandin pathway, a proportion of patients fail to respond and must undergo surgical intervention. Further refinement of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern vascular remodeling of this vessel is required.

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of the ductus arteriosus in mouse embryos at E18.5 (embryonic day 18.5), P0.5 (postnatal day 0.5), and P5 to identify transcriptional alterations that might be associated with remodeling. We confirmed our findings using transgenic mouse models coupled with immunohistochemistry analysis.

The intermediate filament vimentin emerged as a candidate contributing to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Mice with genetic deletion of vimentin fail to complete vascular remodeling of the ductus arteriosus. To explore mechanisms, we turned to the RNA-sequencing data that indicated changes in Jagged1 with a similar profile to vimentin, pointing to potential links with Notch. In fact, Notch3 signaling was impaired in vimentin-null mice, and these mice phenocopy patent ductus arteriosus in Jagged1 endothelial and smooth muscle-deleted mice.

Through single-cell RNA-sequencing and by tracking closure of the ductus arteriosus in mice, we uncovered the unexpected contribution of vimentin in driving complete closure of the vessel.

### Prevalence and management of patent ductus arteriosus in a pediatric medicaid cohort [^115AiRUq]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Widespread use of echocardiography has made earlier diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) possible, but pharmacological or surgical intervention is highly variable. Herein, we investigate the prevalence of PDA and its management in a routine care system.

- **Methods**: A 15-year retrospective dataset (1996–2010) was analyzed. Selection criteria included age ≤ 17 years, enrollees in South Carolina State Medicaid, and diagnosed as having PDA on one or more service visits to a pediatrician or pediatric cardiologist.

- **Results**: The 15-year treated prevalence rate of PDA was 0.25/1000 pediatric cases of congenital heart disease (CHD). PDA was more prevalent in non-African American patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.12), but not in females after controlling for all other CHDs diagnosed in the cohort. Associated CHDs were present in 57.6% of the cases, primarily atrial or ventricular septal defects, and fewer patients (5.5%) developed pulmonary hypertension. Of 3627 PDA cases examined, 70.0% received no medications or PDA repair. Therapeutic ibuprofen was used for closure in 24.4% of the cases, and a PDA repair was performed in 7.8%. Younger children (aOR: 0.82), those who received an atrial septal defect closure (aOR: 5.18), and those who were treated with digoxin (aOR: 1.86) or with diuretics or preload/afterload reducing agents (i.e. calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) (aOR: 5.72) were significantly more likely to have a PDA repair procedure.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of diagnosed PDA cases did not require pharmacological or surgical intervention.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^1112pWUY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The technique and safety of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure have evolved over the past 20 years. We sought to report a multicenter experience of PDA closure, focusing on the rate of adverse events (AEs) and reviewing institutional practice differences.

- **Methods and results**: Outcome data on transcatheter PDA closure were collected at eight centers prospectively using a multicenter registry (Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcome Registry). Between February 2007 and June 2010, 496 PDA closures were recorded using a device in 338 cases (68%) or coils in 158 cases (32%). Most patients had an isolated PDA (90%). Fifty percent of patients were between 6 months and 3 years old, with only 40 patients (8%) weighing less than 2 kg. Among the narrow PDAs, 248 (52%) were less than or equal to 2 mm in size, with all PDAs at or under 1.5 mm. In 9% of cases (n = 46), an AE occurred; however, only 11 (2%) were classified as high severity. Younger age was associated with a higher AE rate. Coil-related AEs were more common than device-related AEs (10% versus 2%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: PDA closure in the present era has a very low complication rate, although these are higher in younger children. Technical intervention-related events were more common in coil procedures compared with device procedures.

### Patent ductus arteriosus and short- and long-term respiratory outcomes [^114Ec75Q]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

The patency of the ductus arteriosus is very common in extremely premature infants. The increased pulmonary blood flow that results from left-to-right ductal shunting can produce an acute deterioration in lung function, and some data suggest that it may increase the risk of chronic lung damage. However, there is no clear evidence that prophylactic or early closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results in a clear reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For this reason, and because of the side effects of the available therapies to close the ductus, there is a wide variation in the approach to the PDA in this population, and most clinicians will intervene to close the ductus only in cases of significant shunt with hemodynamic decompensation.

### PDA-TOLERATE trial: An exploratory randomized controlled trial of treatment of moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus at 1 week of age [^113APnDE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare early routine pharmacologic treatment of moderate-to-large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at the end of week 1 with a conservative approach that requires prespecified respiratory and hemodynamic criteria before treatment can be given.

A total of 202 neonates of less than 28 weeks of gestational age (mean, 25.8 ± 1.1 weeks) with moderate-to-large PDA shunts were enrolled between 6 and 14 days of age (mean, 8.1 ± 2.2 days) into an exploratory randomized controlled trial.

At enrollment, 49% of the patients were intubated, and 48% required nasal ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure. There were no differences between the groups in either the primary outcome of ligation or presence of a PDA at discharge (early routine treatment [ERT], 32%; conservative treatment [CT], 39%) or any of the prespecified secondary outcomes of necrotizing enterocolitis (ERT, 16%; CT, 19%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (ERT, 49%; CT, 53%), BPD/death (ERT, 58%; CT, 57%), death (ERT, 19%; CT, 10%), and weekly need for respiratory support. Fewer infants in the ERT group met the rescue criteria (ERT, 31%; CT, 62%).

In secondary exploratory analyses, infants receiving ERT had significantly less need for inotropic support (ERT, 13%; CT, 25%). However, among infants who were ≥ 26 weeks gestational age, those receiving ERT took significantly longer to achieve enteral feeding of 120 mL/kg/day (median: ERT, 14 days [range, 4.5–19 days]; CT, 6 days [range, 3–14 days]), and had significantly higher incidences of late-onset non-coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^111W7G4X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The cohort includes 496 PDA closures performed at 8 institutions and recorded in the database between February 1, 2007, and June 30, 2010. A device was initially used in 338 cases and a coil was used in 158 cases. The majority of patients (90%) had an isolated PDA with no associated congenital heart disease, and cases were predominantly performed electively (98%).

Most procedures were performed under general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation (66%), while inotrope support was rarely necessary (1%). Patients under 6 months of age were more likely to undergo device closure: 36 out of 40 cases (90%) versus 302 out of 456 cases (66%).

Case duration was similar in the two treatment groups. More contrast was required for device placement cases compared with coil cases: median 3.9 mL/kg versus 2.3 mL/kg (P < 0.001). Coils were predominantly reserved for the smallest PDAs.

- **Patient and procedural characteristics**: The majority of patients had isolated PDAs without associated congenital heart disease, with procedures mostly elective.

- **Proportion of closure methods**: A comparison of the two PDA closure methods (coils vs devices) based on PDA internal diameter shows a preference for coils for the smallest PDAs.

### Transcriptional regulation during development of the ductus arteriosus [^111rBU9r]. Circulation Research (2008). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a specialized blood vessel containing highly differentiated and contractile vascular smooth muscle, derived largely from neural crest cells, that is essential for fetal life but typically closes after birth. Impaired development of the ductus arteriosus or disruption of signaling pathways that initiate postnatal closure can result in persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus, the third most common congenital heart defect.

We found that Tfap2beta, a transcription factor associated with patent ductus arteriosus in humans, was uniquely expressed in mouse ductal smooth muscle. Endothelin-1 and the hypoxia-induced transcription factor, Hif2alpha, were also highly enriched in ductal smooth muscle at embryonic day 13.5 and were dependent on Tfap2beta for their expression in this domain. Hif2alpha functioned as a negative regulator of Tfap2beta-induced transcription by disrupting protein-DNA interactions, suggesting a negative feedback loop regulating Tfap2beta activity.

Our data indicate that Tfap2beta, Et-1, and Hif2alpha act in a transcriptional network during ductal smooth muscle development, and that disruption of this pathway may contribute to patent ductus arteriosus by affecting the development of smooth muscle within the ductus arteriosus.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^114ccxbe]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Application of NPE in the evaluation of PDA

A significant shunt through the PDA that remains clinically "silent" may occur in the first days of life. The development of echocardiographic signs of hemodynamic significance precedes the development of clinical signs by a mean of 2 days. Echocardiography is currently the preferred tool for predicting or diagnosing ductal patency and assessing hemodynamic significance. There is some evidence that serial echocardiography facilitates early identification of a HsPDA and might reduce morbidity associated with the PDA.

- **Considerations for using echocardiography**: There are important considerations when using echocardiography, which were recently set out by the European consensus statement on NPE. Firstly, it is important that measures are taken to ensure the patients' comfort. Secondly, the initial scan should be a comprehensive appraisal of cardiac anatomy, sufficient to confirm structural normality of the heart and avoid inadvertent PDA treatment in the presence of a duct-dependent lesion. Finally, the clinician must be aware that echocardiographic indices of hemodynamic significance have variable reproducibility between observers. It is important to strive for consistency between operators on where and how to measure the different variables involved in the assessment of the PDA.

- **Assessment of hemodynamic significance of the PDA**: The traditional view of the PDA as a dichotomous entity based on transductal dimension represents a physiologic oversimplification. Assessment of transductal diameter alone is confounded by image quality, vessel geometry, and the dynamic nature of the vascular structure.

### Safety of percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure: An unselected multicenter population experience [^115SQzDX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Of a total of 12,143 cases reported by the eight institutions, 496 (4%) were attempted percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closures. The annual average PDA case volume per institution was a median of 5%, with a range of 2.1% to 7.4%. There was institutional bias in the choice of closure method: three centers preferred the use of devices for a minimal PDA diameter of 1.5 mm, while the other five centers were more likely to use coils for a PDA diameter up to 2.5 mm.

There was a significant difference in the occurrence of any adverse events (AEs) by institution (P < 0.0001); however, there was no difference in high-severity AEs (P = 0.75).

- **Annual average PDA cases per institution**:
	- The shaded bars in Figure 2 represent the average annual PDA cases, while the stippled bars represent the PDA percentage of total cases.

- **Differences in preferred PDA closure method**:
	- Figure 3 illustrates the differences in the preferred PDA closure methods (coils vs. devices) based on internal diameter in eight institutions. The figure shows the median minimum diameter, interquartile range (IQR), and range by device or coil for each institution.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: An overview of Cochrane systematic reviews [^116HK1N1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

With increasing emphasis on conservative management, surgical PDA ligation is primarily reserved for infants with persistent symptomatic PDA following the failure of medical management. Surgical PDA ligation is associated with reduced mortality, but surviving infants were found to be at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, which could be due to the lack of studies addressing survival bias and confounding by indication.

### Lack of equipoise in the PDA-TOLERATE trial: A comparison of eligible infants enrolled in the trial and those treated outside the trial [^116zT4HV]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The PDA: TO LEave it alone or Respond And Treat Early trial compared the effects of two strategies for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in infants less than 28 0/7 weeks of gestation. However, 137 potentially eligible infants were not recruited and received treatment of their PDA outside the PDA-TOLERATE trial due to "lack-of-physician-equipoise" (LPE). Despite being less mature and needing more respiratory support, infants with LPE had lower rates of mortality than enrolled infants. Infants with LPE treated before day six had lower rates of late respiratory morbidity than infants with LPE treated on or after day six.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^1122ETx8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor(s), placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 39 studies enrolling 2843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV Ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86).

### Ductus arteriosus: More than just the patent ductus arteriosus [^113VFwRq]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is crucial to fetal circulation. Its failure to close at birth is a common event. In this educational pictorial essay, the association of the ductus arteriosus with a variety of congenital cardiac, vascular, and pulmonary lesions is illustrated. These lesions can impact systemic circulation, pulmonary circulation, or the airway. They include coarctation of the aorta, ductal origin of the pulmonary artery, and vascular rings.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: Are current neonatal treatment options better or worse than no treatment at all [^1128iNfc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although a moderate-sized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) needs to be closed by the time a child is 1–2 years old, there is great uncertainty about whether it needs to be closed during the neonatal period. Although 95% of neonatologists believe that a moderate-sized PDA should be closed if it persists in infants born before 28 weeks who still require mechanical ventilation, the number of neonatologists who treat a PDA in infants who do not require mechanical ventilation varies widely.

Both the high likelihood of spontaneous ductus closure and the absence of randomized controlled trials specifically addressing the risks and benefits of neonatal ductus closure add to the uncertainty. New information suggests that early pharmacologic treatment has several important short-term benefits for the preterm newborn. By contrast, ductus ligation, while eliminating the detrimental effects of a PDA on lung development, may create its own set of morbidities that counteract many of the benefits derived from ductus closure.

### The ductus arteriosus: a refined approach [^113qSYtV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although ongoing patency of the ductus arteriosus is common in small, extremely preterm infants, consensus is lacking regarding its clinical significance and treatment strategies. Literature regarding the likelihood of spontaneous closure, impact on neonatal morbidity and long-term outcomes, and adverse effects of intervention has led to uncertainty as to the best course of action. Enhancing the determination of hemodynamic significance and refining patient selection for therapeutic intervention will streamline the decision-making process. Targeted neonatal echocardiography performed by the clinician has gained popularity worldwide, and preliminary data show that it has the potential to optimize patient outcomes.

- **Arguments for and against therapy**: We review the arguments for and against medical and surgical therapy.
- **Refining treatment approach**: We explore how targeted neonatal echocardiography used in conjunction with biomarkers may refine the treatment approach.
- **Future directions**: We consider future directions in the field.

### Early prediction of spontaneous Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^11581V3u]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Research design overview**: A number of clinical, echocardiographic, and biomarker variables have known associations with an increased likelihood of either spontaneous PDA closure or PDA-associated morbidity. However, no one has incorporated all reported predictors to develop comprehensive, clinically-focused PDA prediction models. In addition, most prior investigations have been limited by retrospective study designs, with echocardiographic surveillance at the clinician's discretion rather than uniform echocardiogram collection at pre-specified time points.

The few prospective studies were limited by exposure measurements at single, early time points, short durations of PDA exposure, and/or small sample sizes. Historically, most PDA investigations have been conducted at sites favoring early, aggressive PDA treatment, thus preventing an unbiased examination of the relationships between early PDA indicators, spontaneous closure, and outcomes following persistent PDA. The proposed research is innovative because we will prospectively collect sequential echocardiographic measures, serum and urine biomarkers, and important clinical risk factors within a cohort of untreated infants with PDA. We will utilize that data to develop robust models to evaluate their combined ability to predict both spontaneous PDA closure timing and PDA-associated mortality, respiratory, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study uses a prospective cohort and a rigorously designed observational study to answer proposed questions that cannot be answered with a randomized trial.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^114jQHCR]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

In many preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus remains patent beyond the first few days of life. This prolonged patency is associated with numerous adverse outcomes, but the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established. Different treatment strategies have failed to improve short-term outcomes, with a paucity of data on the correct diagnostic and pathophysiological assessment of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in association with long-term outcomes. Echocardiography is the selected method of choice for detecting a PDA, assessing the impact on the preterm circulation, and monitoring treatment response.

PDA in a preterm infant can result in pulmonary overcirculation and systemic hypoperfusion; therefore, echocardiographic assessment should include evaluation of PDA characteristics, indices of pulmonary overcirculation with left heart loading conditions, and indices of systemic hypoperfusion. In this review, we provide an evidence-based overview of the emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer indications and limitations for using Neonatologist Performed Echocardiography to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^1119kcqX]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Despite widespread uncertainty about the management of the PDA, NPE is increasingly recognized as an important tool for screening, diagnosing, and assessing the hemodynamic significance of the PDA. This information can be used to follow up patients and/or to decide on treatment. Although echocardiographic measurements are limited by clinical validation and most variables lack good repeatability, training frameworks, practice guidelines, and expert agreement on the standardization of different variables might help to overcome these issues. Standardization of assessment would limit over-treatment and help develop a consensus approach through objective patient selection and test interventions.

### Can early echocardiographic findings predict patent ductus arteriosus [^117CxLRS]. Neonatology (2009). Low credibility.

Prophylactic treatment with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (PSI) is potentially harmful. Moreover, long-term benefits of the prophylactic use of indomethacin or ibuprofen are not proven. Early treatment of a high-risk population is an alternative to the routine prophylactic use of PSI, but it remains unclear which newborn is at greatest risk for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

- **Objective**: Evaluation of the prognostic value of early echocardiographic studies with respect to PDA in later life.

- **Methods**: Sixty preterm infants with a mean birth weight of 1,087 g and mean gestational age of 28.5 weeks were included in a prospective study. Cardiac scans were performed on all newborns upon entry into the study (within 12–48 hours after birth) and subsequently in case of clinical suspicion of PDA, or obligatory on the 7th and 28th days of life. There was no prophylactic or treatment use of any PSI during the study period. Newborns were divided into two cohorts: those with significant left-to-right shunt requiring surgical ligation of PDA (n = 16) and those without significant PDA during follow-up (control group, n = 44).

- **Results**: On entry, the mean internal diameter of the ductus arteriosus (2.6 vs. 0.91 mm/kg) was predictive of symptomatic PDA with a diameter greater than 1.5 mm/kg indicating a higher likelihood of the condition.

### The modern approach to patent ductus arteriosus treatment: Complementary roles of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and interventional cardiology coil occlusion [^116GV5LM]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

In an effort to analyze our experience and develop treatment guidelines, we reviewed all our patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or interventional cardiology coil occlusion.

- **Methods**: One hundred patients underwent 102 cardiac catheterizations. Forty-five children underwent VATS. The entire cohort of patients is 141 because 4 patients underwent both catheterization and VATS.

- **Results**: Successful PDA coil occlusion occurred in 91 patients (91 of 100; 91%); 8 had unsuccessful attempts at coil occlusion, and 1 was referred for surgical ligation after catheterization without any attempt at coil placement. Thirty-nine children had successful VATS PDA closure. Six children required conversion to thoracotomy because of inadequate exposure during VATS. Hospital stay for children more than 45 days of age was as follows: VATS median stay, 1 day, mean, 1.4 days; thoracotomy median stay, 4 days, mean, 4.6 days. One patient treated with PDA coil occlusion developed a rePDA and required reembolization. Three children underwent initial catheterization without successful coil placement with subsequent successful VATS. All VATS patients left the operating theater with echocardiography documenting no residual PDA. Two children who underwent successful VATS with no residual PDA at hospital discharge were found on outpatient follow-up to have developed tiny rePDAs and both were successfully coil occluded; 1 of these 2 children is 1 of the 3 children initially evaluated by catheterization and then referred.

### Catheter closure through a venous approach of patent ductus arteriosus in small pediatric patients using combined angiographic and echocardiographic guidance [^1163LtV4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The standard technique of catheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may be associated with arterial complications, particularly in small pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether catheter closure of PDA in small children using an exclusive venous approach is a safe and effective alternative to closure with the standard technique. One hundred twelve patients, aged 2 to 24 months, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to catheter closure of PDA using the standard technique (group 1) and an exclusive venous approach (group 2), respectively.

In group 2, the procedure was guided using hand injections of contrast media through the delivery sheath and 2-dimensional and color Doppler echocardiography.

- **Group 1**: The PDA diameter ranged from 2 to 5.5 mm, and the device diameter ranged from 4 to 8 mm. The PDA occluders were permanently implanted in all patients. Five losses of the arterial pulses were restored with intravenous infusion of heparin and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), and four groin hematomas were the main complications of the procedure.

- **Group 2**: The mean PDA diameter ranged from 2.5 to 6 mm, and the device diameter ranged from 3 to 8 mm. The PDA occluders were permanently implanted in all but two patients. There were no complications.

Complete echocardiographic closure of PDA at 1-month follow-up was observed in all 110 patients. Exclusive transvenous PDA occlusion is an effective and safe technique that prevents the arterial complications of the standard approach in small children.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant: To treat or not to treat [^117SPecN]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacological and/or surgical closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the very preterm infant has been the standard of care over the past few decades. However, the rationale for the closure of PDA has recently been challenged. In this article, the factors that have fueled the controversy over the approach to the management of PDA and the gap in our knowledge are reviewed in detail. In addition, the pros and cons of the different treatment strategies applied in clinical care are evaluated, with a focus on discussing the available evidence in the literature.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: Is early transcatheter closure a paradigm shift [^116UmbWz]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

The optimal management approach of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants remains uncertain due to the lack of evidence for long-term benefits and the limited analyses of the complications of medical and surgical interventions at the time of writing. In recent years, devices suitable to plug the PDA of premature infants (including extremely low birthweight, < 1000g) have become available, and several trials have demonstrated successful and safe transcatheter PDA closure (TCPC) in this population. Whether TCPC represents a paradigm shift in PDA management that will result in improved short- and long-term outcomes, less bronchopulmonary dysplasia, improved neurodevelopment, or better long-term renal function remains to be seen. Careful, rigorous study of the potential benefits of TCPC in this highly vulnerable population in the context of well-designed, adequately powered trials is needed prior to the widespread adoption of this approach.

### Ductal closure with paracetamol: A surprising new approach to patent ductus arteriosus treatment [^116opMrc]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Standard pharmacologic closure of the patent ductus arteriosus currently involves the administration of one of two cyclooxygenase inhibitors: either indomethacin or ibuprofen. However, both of these drugs can be associated with potentially significant adverse effects. We present here the cases of five preterm infants (gestational age: 26–32 weeks; postnatal age: 3–35 days) with large, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus who had either failed or had contraindications to ibuprofen therapy. Each of these infants was treated with off-label oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours). Ductal closure was achieved within 48 hours in all the treated infants. No toxicity was observed.

### Incidental discovery of a patent ductus arteriosus in adults [^117AvqM5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an uncommon clinical finding in adult primary care patients. However, with improved survival of premature infants at risk for PDA and an increase in cases discovered incidentally on echocardiograms performed for other purposes, the incidence of PDA is rising. Thus, primary care physicians need to be alert to the clinical situations suggesting a previously undiagnosed PDA. It is estimated that the incidence of PDA is approximately 0.02% to 0.04% in term infants and slightly higher in premature infants. PDA accounts for 6% to 11% of all congenital heart defects.

Although most cases of PDA would seem to occur sporadically, multifactorial inheritance is believed to underlie many cases. These individuals are thought to possess a genetic predisposition acted on by an environmental trigger that occurs at an unknown but vulnerable time during pregnancy. The clinical spectrum of presentation of a PDA may range from a "silent" PDA, one with no clinical manifestations but which is incidentally discovered on an echocardiogram for other purposes, to patients who present with congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, signs of volume overload, endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, or pneumonia. We describe two cases that illustrate the discovery of an asymptomatic PDA during routine physical examination of adult patients.

### Genetics of patent ductus arteriosus susceptibility and treatment [^116MuVos]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a vital fetal structure designed to close shortly after birth. Although many physiological and pharmacological investigations have characterized the closure of this structure, genetic studies of persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) are relatively recent. Progress in the identification of specific genes associated with PDA is well behind that of many adult-onset diseases due to several reasons, ranging from the lack of large biorepositories for this unique population to the belief that any genetic contribution to PDA is minimal. Viewing the PDA as a complex, developmentally influenced disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors has resulted in initial successes in some genetic studies.

- **Genetic approaches**: We will introduce several genetic approaches that have been or are currently being applied to the study of PDA. These approaches have been successful in identifying polymorphisms associated with adult diseases. Genetic investigations of PDA will be discussed with respect to heritability, in general, and to specific risk genes. Several animal models that have been used to study PDA-related genes will also be presented. Further advances in discovering genetic variations causing PDA will drive the more rational use of therapies and may help identify currently unknown targets for future therapeutic manipulation.

### The ductus arteriosus: A review of embryology to intervention [^114gpNtf]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

This article reviews the physiology of the ductus arteriosus, the pathophysiology of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and the role advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can play in guiding diagnosis and percutaneous or surgical intervention. A PDA can have variable clinical and radiologic presentations and can be important to characterize in patients with vascular rings, aortic maldevelopment, and congenital heart disease. An understanding of the PDA and the application of CT and MRI can allow the radiologist to provide key information to physicians who plan to close a PDA or maintain PDA patency in the setting of ductal-dependent congenital heart disease.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^111NsUpB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Traditional approaches in PDA management, based on prostaglandin inhibitors and interventional ductus closure, are reactive. New treatment options should ideally be proactive, targeting endogenous ductus regulators, and applicable to broader PDA subpopulations with bona fide long-term benefits. These options should document not only validation (i.e. safety and efficacy) but also utility (i.e. favorable outcomes).

- **Clinical development goals and path for next-generation treatments**: Milestones toward therapeutic goals include protocol optimization to enhance success rates in potentially responsive preterm infants and proactive alternatives for cohorts not responding to existing strategies. Establishing surviving disease models, combined with noninvasive cardiac imaging quantifying shunt and its impact on the cardiopulmonary system and symptomatology, would enable preclinical safety and efficacy validation in a clinically relevant scenario. PDA, patent ductus arteriosus.

At the time of writing, more than 100 genes associated with defective morphogenesis, abnormal sensing, and inefficient contraction/sealing of the ductus arteriosus have been identified. These genes are considered, in principle, druggable and potentially qualifying for early-stage theranostics screening. This growing list consists of prostaglandin receptors and related enzymes; adenosine triphosphate–sensitive potassium channels that regulate vascular tone by linking energetic demand and membrane electrical activity (Cantú syndrome); TFAP2B and TBX1 transcription.

### Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in infants ≤ 2 kg: IMPACT registry insights [^114eDQpF]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure is becoming the standard of care for definitive closure in progressively smaller and younger neonates. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of percutaneous PDA closure in patients weighing ≤ 2 kg.

- **Methods**: This cohort study utilized the IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatments) from the American College of Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Patients who were ≤ 2 kg at the time of percutaneous PDA closure were included. The primary outcome was the composite of technical failure and/or major adverse event.

- **Results**: A total of 1587 attempted PDA closures were included, with a 3% incidence of technical failure and 5.5% incidence of the composite outcome. Major adverse events were observed in 3.8% of the patients. The most common events were device embolization requiring retrieval and unplanned cardiac or vascular surgery, occurring in 1.3% and 1.3% of cases, respectively. The incidence of the composite outcome was associated with the need for arterial access (P < .001) and the annual hospital volume of percutaneous PDA closures in infants ≤ 2 kg (P = .001). Over time, the incidence of the composite outcome has decreased, and median weight at the time of the procedure has also diminished.

- **Conclusions**: Percutaneous PDA closure appears to be a safe and feasible procedure in infants ≤ 2 kg. The incidence of major adverse events has continued to decline over the years and seems to have a strong correlation with individual center case volumes and expertise.

### Consensus guidelines for the prevention and management of periprocedural complications of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure with the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder in extremely low birth weight infants [^111z9KBj]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

For device embolization into the systemic circulation, prompt recognition and treatment are warranted because it is unlikely to be tolerated by small infants (< 2 kg). This will result in acute symptoms characterized by abdominal distention, progressing to full-blown necrotizing enterocolitis, decreased lower extremity pulse and perfusion, oliguria, and renal failure. Device embolization into the aorta requires emergency intervention and may potentially be amenable to transcatheter retrieval depending on whether a retrieval sheath may be introduced safely across the ductus into the aorta or from the carotid artery into the aorta.

- **Management considerations for device embolization into the descending aorta**:
	- Assess the feasibility of transcatheter retrieval via the ductus or carotid artery, or consult with a surgeon for retrieval via a surgical approach.
	- If the device embolizes into the descending aorta during the procedure, a long sheath may be introduced via the existing femoral venous access site across the ductus to snare and retrieve the device similarly to techniques used in the pulmonary circulation.
	- For a device that embolizes post-procedure, two options exist for transcatheter retrieval depending on whether the ductus is patent. If the ductus is patent, then a long sheath may be introduced via the femoral vein across the ductus to snare a device.

### Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder clinical trial for percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in patients ≥ 700 grams [^117Pc8pa]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Transcatheter device closure of PDA is the standard of care in larger infants, children, and adults. Historically, transcatheter closure of PDA has not been routinely performed in very small infants (weight ≤ 2 kg). Recently, a growing body of clinical evidence has emerged suggesting that transcatheter closure of PDA can be performed safely and effectively in premature infants as small as 700 g or smaller. The Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder (Abbott Structural Heart, Plymouth, MN), previously called the Amplatzer Duct Occluder II Additional Sizes (ADO II AS), obtained CE‐Mark in Europe in 2011 for PDA closure in patients ≥ 6 kg. The PDA morphology in extremely premature infants resembles its fetal counterpart (so‐called F-type PDA morphology). It is typically long and tubular with a hockey stick configuration, such that the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder has favorable features (size, shape, delivery system) for closure of PDAs in premature neonates. A clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder was conducted, leading to the approval of this device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients ≥ 700 g.

### Improved closure of patent ductus arteriosus with high doses of ibuprofen [^115zx5se]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). High credibility.

The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with various complications of prematurity. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors are the first-line intervention for the closure of PDA. However, the rates of PDA closure remain unsatisfactory. Therefore, an individual trial was performed by changing the strategy for treating neonates with ibuprofen to induce the closure of PDA.

In a retrospective study, patients receiving 20, 10, and 10 mg/kg body weight ibuprofen (Group 1) were compared by chart review with those receiving 10, 5, 5 mg/kg (Group 2). The rate of PDA closure, the incidence of side effects related to the use of ibuprofen, and the need for surgical intervention for closure of the PDA were analyzed. A higher rate of closure after three doses in Group 1 was observed (60.9% vs. 52.6%; p = 0.75), which was not significant but indicated a clear positive trend.

If closure of the PDA was unsuccessful, intravenous ibuprofen was continued for an additional 2 days. After 5 days, 91.3% of PDA in Group 1 was closed compared with 68.4% in Group 2. In summary, only 8.7% of the Group 1 neonates needed surgical closure of PDA after insufficient medicamentous closure compared with 31.6% in Group 2 (p = 0.25). Although not statistically significant, a clear positive trend for using the higher-dose medication can be seen. More research addressing the limitations of a retrospective study is required. Based on the data from this study, high-dose ibuprofen seems able to increase the rate of effective medicamentous PDA closure without any further unwanted side effects.

### Catheter-based closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in lower weight infants [^114dZzdB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Risks associated with drug therapy and surgical ligation have led health care providers to consider alternative strategies for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. Catheter-based PDA closure is the procedure of choice for ductal closure in adults, children, and infants with a weight of ≥ 6 kg. Given the evidence among older counterparts, interest in catheter-based closure of the PDA in lower weight (< 6 kg) infants is growing.

The goals of this review among these smaller infants are to:

- **Provide an overview of the procedure**: Catheter-based PDA closure is technically feasible.
- **Review the types of PDA closure devices**: Various devices are used depending on the specific needs and circumstances of the infant.
- **Review the technical success (feasibility)**: The procedure's success is subject to specific technical considerations.
- **Review the risks (safety profile)**: There are identifiable risks associated with the procedure.
- **Discuss the quality of evidence on procedural efficacy**: However, a lack of comparative trials exists.
- **Consider areas for future research**: Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal strategy for ductal closure in this subgroup of infants.

The review suggests that while catheter-based PDA closure is technically feasible, the absence of comparative trials precludes determination of the optimal strategy for ductal closure in lower weight infants.

### Transesophageal echocardiography-guided percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus closure without fluoroscopy [^116hiVvF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Currently, the main approaches for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment in infants and children are open surgery, percutaneous closure under fluoroscopy guidance, thoracoscopic PDA closure, and transthoracic PDA closure via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) guidance. Open surgery generally involves a large surgical incision, affecting the appearance and chest development in children. Porstmann et al. were the first to consider using percutaneous interventional therapy and achieved success in 1967. So far, closure under fluoroscopy guidance has been widely performed. However, fluoroscopic guidance exposes physicians and children to radiation directly. Additionally, children may be prone to allergies from contrast agents. Thoracoscopic PDA closure has relatively high risks, including bleeding and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

In recent years, PDA closure through a small thoracic incision under transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance has been gradually reported. Although this technique avoids radiation exposure and the use of contrast agents, it still leaves a surgical incision on the chest. The debate continues on whether PDA can be minimally occluded through the femoral vein under the guidance of TEE. The feasibility of this method has been proven after successful animal experiments using veins under TEE guidance. Currently, TEE-guided transcatheter femoral vein occlusion of PDA has achieved certain clinical outcomes. This method successfully occludes PDA through the femoral vein without using contrast agents and X-ray. Additionally, there are no severe complications, indicating the safety and effectiveness of this technique.
