## Question

For a patient receiving testosterone cypionate 150 mg every 2 weeks, when should the testosterone level be checked?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to check the testosterone level for a patient receiving testosterone cypionate 150 mg every 2 weeks, including the optimal timing of the lab draw relative to the injection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the hypogonadism diagnosis and proper sampling conditions. Then, I should determine when steady state is achieved and when to obtain the first on-treatment level. Next, I will clarify timing relative to the injection to capture a trough. After that, I need to set appropriate target ranges and adjustment rules. Finally, I should review ongoing monitoring intervals, safety labs, and special considerations like SHBG effects and prostate risk, ensuring all of this aligns with major guidelines and labeling data [^11618rAB] [^112vT6mz] [^113ss2Ag].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation and sampling conditions, because if the baseline diagnosis or sample timing is off, the rest of the plan wobbles. I need to ensure total testosterone was low on two separate fasting morning measurements between 7–11 AM with a reliable assay, and that testing was done when the patient was at baseline health, since acute illness can transiently suppress the HPT axis and confound interpretation [^111zq8AY] [^113ss2Ag] [^1126QHXo] [^111EbdnM].

> Now, when should I first check an on-treatment level after starting injections? I initially thought, "Why not at 2 weeks after the first dose", but wait, let me verify steady-state guidance before jumping to conclusions. The XYOSTED label for weekly subcutaneous testosterone enanthate instructs measuring total testosterone trough after 6 weeks of dosing to ensure steady-state assessment, and that principle of waiting until steady state applies across injectable formulations, so I should check after roughly 6 weeks of consistent dosing and also recheck about 6 weeks after any subsequent dose adjustment to reassess steady-state exposure [^112tokHm] [^116c7BAA].

> Next, I should confirm timing relative to the injection. The XYOSTED label specifies obtaining trough concentrations 7 days after the last weekly dose, so by analogy for an every-2-week cypionate regimen, I need to capture the trough immediately before the next scheduled injection on Day 14 to assess the nadir and avoid being misled by peak-phase measurements, which can appear therapeutic while the trough is subtherapeutic [^112tokHm].

> Specimen conditions still matter on therapy. Hold on, I should verify we keep the sampling rules consistent with diagnostic best practice. I need to draw the trough sample in the morning between 7–11 AM in a fasting state, using a reliable assay, because diurnal variation and food intake can lower measured testosterone by clinically relevant margins and jeopardize comparability over time [^117KjQL3] [^114QxHTp] [^111zq8AY].

> I will now examine target ranges and how to interpret the trough. The XYOSTED label uses a trough target of about 350–650 ng/dL to yield normal-range exposure across the dosing interval, which is a pragmatic target for injection-based regimens, while BSSM guidance aims for a physiologic range of about 15–30 nmol/L (approximately 430–865 ng/dL), emphasizing tailoring to symptom control within physiologic bounds; if troughs fall below target, I should consider increasing total weekly exposure or shortening the interval, and if supraphysiologic, reduce dose to avoid adverse effects from peaks and cumulative exposure [^112tokHm] [^111HqSMM] [^1126eeUR].

> Next, I should review ongoing monitoring cadence. Wait, let me double-check hematologic safety recommendations. The EAA advises checking hematocrit at 3–6 months after initiation, then annually, holding therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54% and resuming at a reduced dose once safe; clinically, I recheck testosterone levels periodically every 3–6 months once stable, and after any dose change I re-assess at the next steady-state time point, approximately 6 weeks, to confirm the effect of the adjustment and maintain troughs in range [^112vT6mz] [^112tokHm].

> Additional considerations should not be overlooked. I need to ensure assessment of symptom response alongside labs, evaluate cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk with careful monitoring in higher-risk patients, and incorporate prostate risk assessment before and within 3–12 months after initiation according to shared decision-making, while pausing or adjusting therapy for safety signals such as rising hematocrit above 54% or uncontrolled comorbidities; if SHBG is abnormal or total testosterone is borderline, I should confirm with an accurate free testosterone method or calculation and tailor decisions accordingly, and if nadir symptoms or low troughs persist on a biweekly schedule, I should reconsider splitting to weekly dosing to minimize peak–trough swings while keeping the trough therapeutic [^111zb767] [^11618rAB] [^116yTpN9] [^114mNUJU] [^112vT6mz] [^115ESkDg].

> Putting this together for testosterone cypionate 150 mg every 2 weeks, I should obtain the first on-treatment level at about 6 weeks to capture steady state, draw it as a fasting morning trough immediately before the next injection on Day 14, aim for a trough around 350–650 ng/dL while individualizing within a physiologic window based on symptoms and safety, then monitor testosterone and hematologic parameters periodically every 3–6 months once stable and 6 weeks after any dose change, remaining vigilant for adverse effects and adjusting dose or interval as needed to keep the patient safe and optimally treated [^112tokHm] [^111HqSMM] [^112vT6mz].

---

Check testosterone levels **midpoint between injections** (i.e. 7 days after the last dose) to best reflect average exposure and guide dose adjustments. Alternatively, measure a **trough just before the next injection** to assess the nadir and avoid subtherapeutic lows [^112tokHm]. Always draw samples in the **morning (7–11 AM)** and fasting when possible to reduce diurnal and nutritional variability [^117KjQL3] [^114QxHTp]. Adjust the dose to maintain mid-interval levels within the normal adult male range (typically 350–650 ng/dL), and monitor hematocrit, PSA, and lipids per guidelines.

## Pharmacokinetics of testosterone cypionate

Testosterone cypionate is a long-acting ester with a **half-life of approximately 8 days**, with levels peaking at **2–3 days** and reaching a **nadir by day 14**, leading to **significant fluctuations with biweekly dosing**.

---

## Recommended timing for testosterone level monitoring

A **midpoint measurement (day 7)** best reflects average exposure and guides dose adjustments, whereas a **trough measurement (day 14)** assesses the nadir and helps avoid subtherapeutic lows.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

A **midpoint measurement** is preferred for dose titration and maintaining physiologic levels, while **trough measurement** helps detect subtherapeutic lows and guide dosing frequency adjustments.

---

## Practical considerations for testosterone level monitoring

Draw samples in the **morning (7–11 AM)** to reduce diurnal variability, and, when possible, use a **fasting collection** to minimize nutritional effects [^114QxHTp]. Use reliable, validated assays to ensure accurate results [^115LrmTB].

---

## Clinical implications of timing testosterone measurements

| **Aspect** | **Midpoint (day 7)** | **Trough (day 14)** |
|-|-|-|
| What it shows | Reflects average exposure | Detects subtherapeutic lows |
| Management use | Guides dose adjustments; maintains physiologic levels | Identifies need for shorter intervals or higher doses |

---

## Recommended monitoring schedule

- **Initial monitoring**: Measure at day 7 after the first or second injection to establish baseline exposure.

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Recheck at day 7 after any dose change or every 3–6 months once stable.

- **Additional monitoring**: Consider day 14 troughs if symptoms suggest lows before the next dose [^112tokHm].

---

## Clinical management based on testosterone levels

- **Midpoint level within normal range (350–650 ng/dL)**: Continue current dose and interval.

- **Midpoint level below normal range**: Increase dose or shorten interval (e.g. 75 mg weekly) [^117F6xua].

- **Midpoint level above normal range**: Decrease dose or lengthen interval.

---

## Potential risks of improper timing

Improper timing can cause **misinterpretation of exposure**, leading to inadequate control with persistent symptoms or adverse effects and potentially increasing the risk of polycythemia [^112vT6mz], cardiovascular events, and other complications.

---

## Additional laboratory monitoring

- **Hematocrit**: Check at 3–6 months, then annually; hold therapy if > 54% [^112vT6mz].

- **PSA**: Monitor per prostate cancer risk and guidelines [^111zb767] [^11618rAB].

- **Lipid profile**: Monitor periodically due to metabolic effects.

---

For a patient on 150 mg testosterone cypionate every 2 weeks, **measure testosterone levels at the midpoint (day 7)** to guide dosing, with troughs (day 14) as needed for lows. Use morning, fasting samples [^117KjQL3] and adjust therapy to keep mid-interval levels in the normal range, with regular hematocrit, PSA, and lipid monitoring.

In the context of medical management for male hypogonadism, particularly concerning testosterone therapy, the 2018 guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend considering the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy in patients aged 55–69 years with hypogonadism. This consideration is advised for those with a life expectancy greater than 10 years, but only following a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks. This includes evaluating prostate cancer risk and deciding on prostate monitoring. It is crucial to engage the patient in shared decision-making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. Prostate cancer risk assessment should be conducted before and within 3–12 months after starting testosterone therapy in patients who opt for monitoring.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations. This can be done either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin concentrations. These measurements are particularly important for patients with conditions affecting SHBG, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid use, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age, HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, and the use of certain anticonvulsants or estrogens, or those with initial total testosterone concentrations at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL). It is advised not to use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^113ZrDBB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

- **Patient preparation**: A review of historic laboratory values may show a rise in haemoglobin and haematocrit, with the development of erythrocytosis in severe cases of androgen excess. Steroid hormone concentrations are subject to diurnal variation and may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. Concentrations typically peak in the morning at 8:00–10:00 h before falling in the afternoon and evening. Most evidence‐based reference ranges are derived from fasted, early morning follicular phase samples. Contrary to previous dogma, serum testosterone levels do not appear to fluctuate significantly during the menstrual cycle when measured by LC‐MS/MS methods. Conversely, luteal phase A4 levels appear to be significantly higher than those measured in the follicular phase. Although many patients with androgen excess have amenorrhoea or irregular cycles, where possible, specimens should be collected during the follicular phase at 8:00–10:00 h following an overnight fast.

Patients taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) will typically have reduced concentrations of circulating sex steroids due to a reduction in gonadotropin stimulation and increased SHBG concentrations. If undertaking biochemical investigations, the COCP should ideally be stopped for at least 3 months before sampling. Most testosterone immunoassay methods are also prone to cross‐reactivity with progestogenic components of the combined pill (e.g. norethisterone) that could over‐estimate testosterone concentrations.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114Pw7bk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although this man's initial serum total testosterone concentration was very low, he had a recent severe illness (hospitalization for pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the initial testosterone measurement). Any significant acute systemic illness or flare of chronic systemic illness can transiently suppress the HPT axis and serum testosterone. Assessment for hypogonadism should not be performed in men who are acutely unwell or during hospital admission.

Although there are no prospective data on the time frame of HPT axis recovery after an acute systemic illness, clinical experience indicates that the time to recovery is inversely related to the severity and duration of the illness. Because making a diagnosis of hypogonadism is not urgent, we recommend deferring testosterone measurements until the patient has recovered to their baseline health for at least 2 months. In patients with a protracted systemic illness lasting more than a few weeks, serial measurements of testosterone over several months are helpful; a pattern of increasing serum testosterone suggests that the HPT axis might fully recover.

In our patient, the initial measurement of serum testosterone was done on a nonfasting afternoon sample. Serum testosterone has a circadian rhythm with the highest concentrations in the morning, and the normal range of serum testosterone is based on early morning blood samples. Although this circadian rhythm might be attenuated in many older men, male hypogonadism should be diagnosed based on an early morning testosterone concentration.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: Challenges beyond the guidelines [^1166f6hx]. The Prostate (2020). Low credibility.

The panel reached a consensus on the three options to achieve castration, which include bilateral orchiectomy, LHRH agonists, and LHRH antagonists, as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The panel did not reach a consensus on whether combined androgen blockade (CAB) is superior to castration alone, but CAB was considered a reasonable alternative to castration alone, in agreement with the NCCN guideline.

Unanimous consensus was reached on the role of monitoring serum testosterone (T). Obtaining a baseline T level before initiating ADT is essential. Subsequently, in patients with mCSPC and CRPC, the optimal T level should be 20 ng/dL. Clinicians should check luteinizing hormone levels to determine whether ADT was administered effectively. If T levels are greater than 20 ng/dL despite low luteinizing hormone, there should be a consideration to switch to an alternative agent.

### Profile of serum testosterone levels after application of testosterone ointment (glowmin) and its clinical efficacy in late-onset hypogonadism patients [^116u2qf8]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy has been applied to alleviate the various symptoms of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) patients. Several routes are available for the administration of testosterone to LOH patients, and transdermal delivery is an attractive method above all.

- **Aim**: The aim of this article was to clarify the profile of serum total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT) levels after application of testosterone ointment (Glowmin [GL], Daito Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) and its clinical efficacy in LOH patients.

- **Methods**: Serum TT and FT levels were examined in healthy male volunteers and LOH patients after application of 3 mg of GL. Then, 50 LOH patients received 3 mg of GL twice daily on scrotal skin (6 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Subsequently, TT and FT levels immediately prior to GL application were compared with those at 1 hour after GL treatment. Furthermore, the clinical effects of GL in the aforementioned 50 LOH patients were estimated after 12 weeks of GL treatment.

- **Main outcome measures**: Hormonal effects of GL were evaluated by serum TT and FT levels. Aging males symptoms (AMS), international index of erectile function (IIEF-5), and MOS 36-item short form Healthy Survey (SF-36) questionnaire were used to assess the clinical efficacy of GL for LOH patients.

- **Results**: Maximum TT and FT values, which were detected 1–2 hours after application of a 2-cm line of GL (3 mg of testosterone) to scrotal skin, were not elevated beyond physiological levels; subsequently, these levels returned to circadian rhythm after 4 hours in four healthy ma.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Approach to diagnosis and management**: The approach to diagnosing and managing possible hypogonadism in men aged 50 years and older includes several key steps. Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia, and osteoporosis are preliminary indicators. Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) levels measured without high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. In such cases, it is generally useful to repeat the measurement.

- **Measurement and confirmation**: Measure TT when the patient is at baseline health and confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. The confirmatory measurement should be on a fasting sample drawn between 7:00 and 10:00 AM.

- **Serum free testosterone assessment**: Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on the confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected. Although some experts discourage measuring free testosterone due to limitations discussed in the manuscript, focusing on SHBG interpretation along with total testosterone is an acceptable approach.

- **Investigation for cause of HPT disorder**: Investigation into the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications affecting the HPT axis, and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated, and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia includes reviewing medications and measuring TSH.

### Testosterone therapy in late-life major depression in males [^116rHPBq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Major depression associated with aging in males may improve with anabolic/androgenic steroid therapy. The efficacy and safety of testosterone therapy in the treatment of depression in elderly hypogonadal males is inconclusive. This study identifies a subgroup of elderly depressed males who may benefit from testosterone therapy.

- **Method**: Participants included 16 elderly eugonadal males with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score > 18. Following a single-blind 2-week placebo lead-in, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either a physiologic dose of testosterone cypionate (TC), 100 mg/week, or a supraphysiologic dose of 200 mg/week IM for 6 weeks. Psychometric testing was carried out at entry into the study, at the TC injection baseline, and every 2 weeks thereafter. Tests included an objective measurement, the HAM-D, and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory.

- **Results**: One patient meeting inclusion criteria responded during the placebo lead-in; thus, 15 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (100 mg/week, N = 8; 200 mg/week, N = 7). There was a 42% decrease in the mean HAM-D scores from 20.1 to 11.9 (p < .0001). However, the majority of the change was due to improvement in the 10 late-onset (≤ 45 years old) depression patients, whose mean HAM-D score decreased from 19.8 to 9.3 (53%), versus the 5 early-onset depression patients, whose mean HAM-D score decreased from 20.8 to 17.0 (18%) (p = .0110). The TC dose did not affect the response. Similar HAM-D decreases of 43% and 41% were observed in other evaluations.

### Testopel [^115MSxxK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prior to initiating TESTOPEL® (testosterone pellets), confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

The suggested dosage for androgens varies depending on the age and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions. The dosage guideline for the testosterone pellets for replacement therapy in androgen-deficient males is 150 mg to 450 mg subcutaneously every 3 to 6 months.

- **Inducing pubertal changes**: Various dosage regimens have been used; some experts advocate for lower doses initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease in maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

- **Delayed puberty dosages**: Dosages generally are in the lower range of that listed above and, for a limited duration, for example, 4 to 6 months.

The number of pellets to be implanted depends upon the minimal daily requirements of testosterone propionate, determined by a gradual reduction of the amount administered parenterally. The usual dosage is as follows: implant two 75 mg pellets for each 25 mg testosterone propionate.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^111zb767]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to evaluation before testosterone therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend treating comorbidities before initiating testosterone therapy. Treat patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or chronic cardiac failure requiring testosterone therapy with caution by ensuring careful clinical monitoring and regular measurement of hematocrit (not exceeding 54%) and testosterone levels.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111zq8AY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend measuring total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings in the fasting state. This is because testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after approximately 6 months. Sense of well-being and sexual function are complex and depend on multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men.

The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, after attempts to treat reversible causes, are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by restoration of normal HPT axis function through weight loss.

With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected. A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone, except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations. The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism) are obesity and type 2 diabetes.

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### European Academy of Andrology (EAA) guidelines on investigation, treatment and monitoring of functional hypogonadism in males: Endorsing organization: European Society of Endocrinology [^112VMz2m]. Andrology (2020). High credibility.

The EAA 2020 guidelines provide specific recommendations for the management of male hypogonadism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Notably, these guidelines advise against initiating testosterone replacement therapy solely for the purpose of improving glycometabolic control in male patients with T2DM and/or metabolic syndrome.

### Testosterone enanthate [^112HFNcY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Women with disseminated breast carcinoma should have frequent determination of urine and serum calcium levels during the course of androgen therapy (see warnings).

Periodic (every six months) X-ray examinations of bone age should be made during the treatment of pre-pubertal males to determine the rate of bone maturation and the effects of androgen therapy on the epiphyseal centers. Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically for polycythemia in patients who are receiving high doses of androgens.

- **Drug interactions**: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with androgens:
	- **Anticoagulants, oral**: C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirement. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when androgens are started or stopped.
	- **Antidiabetic drugs and insulin**: In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements.
	- **ACTH and corticosteroids**: There is an enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease.
	- **Oxyphenbutazone**: Elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone may result.

- **Drug/laboratory test interferences**: Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.

### Efficacy over time of LHRH analogs in the treatment of PCa — a prospective analysis using serum testosterone to determine dosing intervals [^115zf5Td]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To examine the duration of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen suppression after each dose of a 4-month depot leuprolide acetate for 18 months and to assess the potential for using serum testosterone as a guide for redosing the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs instead of using fixed dosing intervals, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs are well established for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many open questions remain regarding the optimal dosing.

- **Methods**: Thirteen patients with PCa were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Serum testosterone levels were obtained at baseline and then monthly beginning 4 months after the first injection and every 2 months after the subsequent injections, for a total of 18 months. The median number of days from injection to the first serum testosterone level ≥ 50 ng/dL was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.

- **Results**: The median duration of effect was 159, 189, and 163 days for the first, second, and third treatment cycle, respectively. The prostate-specific antigen values from entry to completion decreased in all subjects. The total number of injections was reduced in all but one subject who completed the 18-month trial. One patient developed hormone-refractory PCa.

- **Conclusions**: Serum testosterone measurement might be a useful method for redosing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs. Using testosterone levels to determine the time of reinjection has a significant economic impact. Monitoring serum testosterone not only helps to identify patients with optimal dosing intervals but also minimizes unnecessary treatments.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone levels, the BSSM 2017 guidelines recommend repeating total testosterone measurement on two or more occasions using a reliable method. Measurement of free testosterone should be obtained in patients with levels close to the lower normal range (8–12 nmol/L) or in those with suspected or known abnormal SHBG levels.

### Determining dosing intervals for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists based on serum testosterone levels: A prospective study [^114UsPjq]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Long-acting luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists are the predominant form of androgen suppression in the treatment of prostate cancer, with the goal of maintaining castrate levels of testosterone. Dosing of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists does not include monitoring the end organ response of serum testosterone. Recent evidence suggests that standard dosing regimens fail to achieve castrate levels of testosterone in some patients, while in others, testosterone can remain at castrate levels longer than the manufacturer-recommended dosing interval. We prospectively evaluated patients with prostate cancer receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist hormonal therapy to determine the length of time that serum testosterone remains at or below castrate levels.

A 3-month dose of 22.5 mg leuprolide was administered to all patients as a first dose, followed by a second dose 3 months later. Serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen were measured prospectively before starting hormonal therapy, after the first dose (12 weeks), and again following the second dose (24 weeks) to assess if castrate levels of testosterone (50 ng/dl or less) had been reached. At 24 weeks, if patient serum testosterone was 50 ng/dl or less, then 22.5 mg leuprolide were not administered, and serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen were checked monthly. When serum testosterone was greater than 50 ng/dl, a subsequent dose of 22.5 mg leuprolide was given. Serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen were then checked 3 months later.

### Long vs short acting testosterone treatments: A look at the risks [^112UZF2p]. Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Prescriptions for testosterone therapy (TT) to treat testosterone deficiency have increased in recent years. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the risks of several treatment modalities to better counsel patients. Both short-acting and long-acting TT have been shown to restore normal serum testosterone levels and improve symptoms of testosterone deficiency. Short-acting pharmacology mimics normal physiology more closely than long-acting TT but requires multiple doses per day. Long-acting TT has a higher rate of patient adherence but is more likely to create supraphysiologic serum testosterone and pathologic sequelae.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114uAeDH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

A 67-year-old man is referred for evaluation and management of possible hypogonadism. He reports a decline in libido over the last 10 years, with his primary sexual complaint being that his erections have gradually become less firm, resulting in decreased sexual satisfaction. He also experiences fatigue and a feeling of being "washed out" most days. His wife sleeps in another room because he snores very loudly, and she reports occasional gasping for breath during his sleep. Additionally, he has experienced a low mood that has worsened since retiring two years ago.

Comorbidities include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) diagnosed five years ago, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He lives a sedentary lifestyle and has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit five years ago. He has no history of myocardial infarction or stroke and was briefly hospitalized for a viral pneumonia about 10 weeks ago. His medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and sitagliptin. He has never used glucocorticoids, opioids, or anabolic steroids and reports no tendency for bruising, weakness, headaches, or visual disturbances. He fathered two children (now adults) without difficulty and recalls experiencing normal puberty at "about the same time as his friends".

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, his weight is 99.3 kg (219 lb), and his BMI is 31.3 kg/m². He has normal body hair and lipomastia but no palpable gynecomastia. His genital exam is normal, including testes that measure 20 cc each by Prader orchidometry. Pedal pulses are reduced. The remainder of the examination is not provided.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above. These experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with the assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies are needed to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases).

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 AM) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Such an assay facilitates application of findings from the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone versus placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err on the side of underdiagnosing.

### Jatenzo [^116c7BAA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating JATENZO, it is essential to confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by measuring serum testosterone concentrations in the morning on at least two separate days. These concentrations should be below the normal range.

JATENZO should be taken with food. The starting dose is 237 mg orally, taken once in the morning and once in the evening. The dose can be adjusted based on serum testosterone levels, which should be checked 6 hours after the morning dose, at least 7 days after starting treatment or following a dose adjustment, and periodically thereafter. Dosage adjustments range from a minimum of 158 mg twice daily to a maximum of 396 mg twice daily.

- **Confirmation of hypogonadism before initiation of JATENZO**: As stated, confirm hypogonadism by ensuring serum testosterone concentrations are measured on at least two separate mornings and are below the normal range.

- **Dosing and dose adjustment information**: The dosage of JATENZO should be individualized based on the patient's response in serum testosterone concentration. The recommended starting dose is 237 mg taken orally twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, with food.

	- **Dose adjustment**: To ensure accurate dose adjustment, serum testosterone concentrations should be measured 6 hours after the morning dose. Blood samples should be clotted at room temperature for 30 minutes before centrifugation. Adjust the JATENZO dose based on these measurements. It is crucial to wait seven days after starting treatment or adjusting the dose for accurate assessment.

### Safety of a new subcutaneous testosterone enanthate auto-injector: Results of a 26-week study [^112m6UVh]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with testosterone deficiency (TD) can be treated with exogenous testosterone (T) to achieve and maintain physiologic T levels and prevent negative clinical symptoms. With many testosterone replacement therapies currently available, this registration safety study was conducted to further characterize the clinical profile of chronically administered, concentration-guided subcutaneous testosterone enanthate (TE) dosing.

- **Aim**: The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the subcutaneous TE auto-injector (SCTE-AI) in adult men with TD.

- **Methods**: In this phase III, 26-week study, 133 men aged 18–75 with symptomatic TD self-administered SCTE-AI 75 mg once weekly for 6 weeks from July 2015 to June 2016. Dosing was adjusted when indicated to 50 mg or 100 mg to maintain T trough levels between 350 and 650 ng/dL (12.1–22.5 nmol/L). PK data were collected from a subgroup of patients receiving 75 mg SCTE-AI through week 12. Safety, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), lipid levels, and adverse drug reactions, as well as PK, were assessed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes were the documentation of the reproducibility of trough concentration-guided exposure to SCTE, a 6-month safety profile, and PK data for the 75 mg dose of SCTE.

- **Results**: In total, 34 patients (25.6%) experienced adverse drug reactions. The most frequently reported were increased hematocrit (≥ 52%) in 10 patients (7.5%), injection-site hemorrhage in 6 patients (4.5%), and injection-site bruising in 4 patients (3.0%).

### Concomitant intramuscular human chorionic gonadotropin preserves spermatogenesis in men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy [^115wmzVp]. The Journal of Urology (2013). High credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy results in decreased serum gonadotropins and intratesticular testosterone, impairing spermatogenesis and leading to azoospermia in 40% of patients. However, intratesticular testosterone can be maintained during testosterone replacement therapy through the co-administration of low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin, which may support continued spermatogenesis in these patients.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy and concomitant low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin. Testosterone replacement consisted of daily topical gel or weekly intramuscular injection, with intramuscular human chorionic gonadotropin (500 IU) administered every other day. Serum and free testosterone, estradiol, semen parameters, and pregnancy rates were evaluated before and during therapy.

A total of 26 men with a mean age of 35.9 years were included in the study. The mean follow-up was 6.2 months. Of the men, 19 were treated with injectable testosterone, and 7 were treated with transdermal gel. Mean serum hormone levels before vs. during treatment were testosterone 207.2 vs. 1,055.5 ng/dl (p < 0.0001), free testosterone 8.1 vs. 20.4 pg/ml (p = 0.02), and estradiol 2.2 vs. 3.7 pg/ml (p = 0.11). Pretreatment semen parameters included volume 2.9 ml, density 35.2 million per ml, motility 49.0%, and forward progression 2.3. No differences in semen parameters were observed during more than 1 year of follow-up. There was no impact on semen parameters as a function of testosterone replacement therapy.

### Society for Endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^1155XWp5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

In cases of 46, XY disorders of sex development (DSD) with low testosterone and high steroid precursors, variants of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) such as 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) deficiency, P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3βHSD2) deficiency can be present. These are caused by inactivating mutations in the corresponding genes: CYP17A1, POR, and HSD3B2, respectively. Another common presentation of 46, XY DSD with low testosterone and increased precursors occurs in individuals with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17βHSD3) deficiency, caused by mutations in the HSD17B3 gene.

Deficiency of CYP17A1 accounts for about 1% of 46, XY DSD cases. Affected individuals typically present with female genitalia and low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and testosterone. There is an increase in mineralocorticoid synthesis, and despite potential cortisol deficiency, symptoms rarely manifest as corticosterone can activate the glucocorticoid receptor.

In PORD, sex steroid levels are consistently low, sometimes at the low end of normal, while pregnenolone and progesterone, along with their metabolites, accumulate. This results from the combined block of CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 activity. Although there is often an excess of mineralocorticoid over glucocorticoid metabolites, hypertension typically appears only in adolescence or later. While baseline glucocorticoid secretion tends to be adequate, most cases exhibit a significant impairment in the stress response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), necessitating at least stress dose hydrocortisone or permanent glucocorticoid coverage.

### Effects of oral androstenedione administration on serum testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women [^114JfQwB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Androstenedione is a steroid hormone and an intermediate in the synthetic pathway of both testosterone and estradiol in men and women. It is available without prescription and is taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women are unknown.

We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0, 50, or 100 mg of androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione administration, we made hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 hours of frequent blood sampling.

- **Androstenedione results**: The mean change (± SD) in serum androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) was greater in both the 50-mg (79 ± 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 ± 184%) than in the control group (-29 ± 28%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum androstenedione AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than the 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026).

- **Estrone results**: The mean change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 ± 72%) and 100-mg dose groups (116 ± 119%) than in the control group (-5 ± 19%). However, the comparison between the control and the 100-mg group did not quite meet statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 for controls vs. 100-mg group).

- **Estradiol results**: The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after supplementation in all groups.

### Xyosted [^112tokHm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating XYOSTED, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone has been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these concentrations are below the normal range. The starting dose is 75 mg, administered subcutaneously in the abdominal region once weekly. Avoid intramuscular and intravascular administration.

- **Dose adjustment**: Measure total testosterone trough concentrations 7 days after the most recent dose, following 6 weeks of dosing, and periodically thereafter. A trough concentration between 350 ng/dL and 650 ng/dL generally provides testosterone exposures in the normal range during the entire dosing interval. Decrease the dose by 25 mg if the total testosterone trough concentration (Ctrough) is ≥ 650 ng/dL. Conversely, increase the dose by 25 mg if the total testosterone trough concentration is below the normal range.

Discard any unused portion.

### Testosterone therapy with subcutaneous injections: A safe, practical, and reasonable option [^117F6xua]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Injections with intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters have been available for almost eight decades and result in predictable serum testosterone levels at low costs. However, they are difficult to self-administer and may cause discomfort. Recently, subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone esters has gained popularity due to easier self-administration. Although data is limited, it supports the feasibility of this route. This review examines the pharmacokinetics and safety of SC testosterone therapy with both long- and ultralong-acting testosterone esters, providing guidance for clinicians on counseling and managing patients who choose the SC route.

- **Evidence acquisition**: This includes a systematic review of available literature on SC testosterone administration, including clinical trials, case series, and case reports. We also explore the pharmacology of testosterone absorption after SC administration.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The available evidence, though limited, suggests that SC testosterone therapy at doses similar to those given via the IM route results in comparable pharmacokinetics and mean serum testosterone levels. With appropriate training, patients should be able to safely self-administer testosterone esters SC with greater ease and less discomfort compared to the IM route.

- **Conclusion**: Although studies directly comparing the safety of SC versus IM administration of testosterone esters are desirable, clinicians should consider discussing the SC route with their patients due to its easier self-administration benefits.

### Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT): A patient's guide [^1127x2HG]. The Prostate (2022). Low credibility.

Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) is a new treatment approach for asymptomatic men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. BAT involves administering sufficient amounts of testosterone to rapidly achieve a higher than normal level (i.e. supraphysiologic) of testosterone in the blood. The normal level of testosterone in the blood of a 70-year-old man is 300–400 ng/dl. In contrast, the testosterone level in a man on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is less than 50 ng/dl.

BAT is achieved by injecting a long-lasting (depot) generic form of testosterone known as testosterone cypionate into the muscle of the buttocks every 28 days. The dose of testosterone cypionate is 400 mg. This is considered a high dose of testosterone, but this dosage is within the FDA-approved dose range of this drug.

The term "bipolar androgen therapy" was coined to reflect the fact that over a 28-day treatment cycle, blood levels of testosterone oscillate between the polar extremes of supraphysiologic (1000–3000 ng/dl) to nearly castrate (100–200 ng/dl). For this oscillation to occur, all patients should continue receiving continuous ADT (conADT) throughout treatment with BAT, and ADT should not be stopped when BAT is administered.

### Could testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men ameliorate anemia, a cardiovascular risk factor? An observational, 54-week cumulative registry study [^1139MJpC]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we investigated whether testosterone undecanoate attenuates anemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypogonadism.

- **Materials and methods**: A registry study consisted of 58 participants with a subnormal total testosterone level (less than 2.35 ng/ml) and at least mild symptoms of testosterone deficiency. All patients received an injection of 1,000 mg testosterone undecanoate at the initial visit, followed by injections at 6, 18, 30, 42, and 54 weeks. Serum hormones, hemoglobin, hematocrit, anemia risk factors, lipid profiles, whole blood viscosity, and anthropometry were measured.

- **Results**: Total testosterone (from mean ± SD 1.87 ± 1.09 to 5.52 ± 1.92 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and free testosterone (from 3.04 ± 2.03 to 7.23 ± 2.90 pg/ml, p < 0.001) were restored by testosterone undecanoate therapy. Hemoglobin and hematocrit significantly increased after testosterone undecanoate therapy by an average of 2.46 gm/dl (p < 0.001) and 3.03% (p < 0.001), respectively. The prevalence of anemia (from 29.6% to 10.0%) significantly decreased (p < 0.001), and patients with anemia showed a significant increase in erythropoietin after testosterone undecanoate therapy (p = 0.047). A reduction in total cholesterol (from 165.89 ± 39.16 to 153.80 ± 154.27 mg/dl, p = 0.002), increased whole blood viscosity, and increased hematocrit were observed until 54 weeks compared with baseline. However, whole blood viscosity and hematocrit stabilized after 18 weeks.

After 54 weeks, testosterone undecanoate decreased the prevalence of anemia and components of the metabolic profile.

### Subjective sexual response to testosterone replacement therapy based on initial serum levels of total testosterone [^113dXcWR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has been shown to be beneficial for men with hypogonadism. However, it is unknown how well hypogonadal men respond to TRT based on the severity of testosterone deficiency.

- **Aim**: To determine subjective sexual response rates to TRT based on initial serum testosterone values, with particular interest in men with "low-normal" levels of total testosterone (TT).

- **Main outcome measures**: Subjective responses to TRT in the domains of erectile dysfunction, libido, orgasm, and morning erections.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on 211 men with sexual symptoms of hypogonadism who underwent TRT. All men had either low values of TT (< 300 ng/dL) or free testosterone (FT) (< 1.5 ng/dL). The cohort was divided into three groups based on initial TT levels:
	- **Group 1**: 0–200 ng/dL (N = 26; 12.3%)
	- **Group 2**: 201–300 ng/dL (N = 64; 30.3%)
	- **Group 3**: 301 ng/dL or greater (N = 121; 57.3%)

	- Improvement in erectile function was determined prior to the addition of any other treatment (e.g. phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). The mean follow-up was 9 months (range 3–36 months).

- **Results**: The mean age was 55.2 years. Testosterone gel was used in approximately two-thirds of each group. Improvement in libido was reported in 61.5%, 96.6%, and 29.8% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < 0.001). Improvement in erectile function was noted in 46.2%, 45.3%, and 73.6% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < 0.001). At the time of last follow-up, the percentage of men continuing with TRT was 73.1%, 57.8%, and 58.7% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

### A randomized pilot study of monthly cycled testosterone replacement or continuous testosterone replacement versus placebo in older men [^113NXkbu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Cycling androgens have been reported by athletes to improve physical performance by enhancing muscle mass and strength. This paradigm, which has not been extensively studied, may hold clinical value for older men receiving testosterone treatment.

We investigated the efficacy of a monthly cycled testosterone regimen, using half the testosterone dose of the standard continuous therapy, on body composition and muscle strength in older men. Twenty-four community-dwelling older men, aged 70 ± 2 years with total testosterone levels below 500 ng/dl, were randomized at the Institute for Translational Sciences-Clinical Research Center into a 5-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

Subjects received weekly doses over 5 months, including continuous testosterone (TE, n = 8; 100 mg testosterone enanthate, intramuscular injection), monthly cycled testosterone (MO, n = 8; alternating months of testosterone and placebo), or placebo (PL, n = 8).

- **Main outcome measures**: Main outcomes included body composition assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and upper and lower body muscle strength. Secondary outcomes comprised body weight, serum hormones, and mixed-muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR).

Total lean body mass increased, and percent body fat was reduced after 5 months in both TE and MO (P < 0.05). Upper body muscle strength increased in TE, while lower body muscle strength increased in both TE and MO (P < 0.05). Additionally, FSR increased in TE and MO (P < 0.05), but not in PL.

In conclusion, cycled testosterone improved body composition and increased muscle strength and protein synthesis rate in older men.

### Observational study of clinical outcomes for testosterone treatment of pubertal delay in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112H5sfB]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Once the baseline visit is completed and the participant has received the first testosterone injection, each subject will be asked to return to either our center or their local doctor every 4 weeks for further injections. Every 24–28 weeks, a follow-up visit will also be scheduled concurrently. The evaluations in this study will be carried out as part of the standard care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aligning with the study protocol and follow-up. Both medical care and research components will be conducted during the same visit.

At each 4-week visit, the testosterone dosage may be increased depending on the regimen. This approach aims to closely mimic the body's natural processes for boys with pubertal delay. If adverse side effects occur due to the study drug, documentation will be made, and the study doctor may decide to interrupt or reduce the dose being administered. Whenever feasible, testosterone injections will coincide with study visits to minimize inconvenience for participants.

- **12-weekly follow-up visits at 12, 40, 64, and 92 weeks** (at CRF or with local doctor):
	- Testosterone level
	- Pulse and blood pressure, skin examination
	- Concomitant medications and adverse events recorded

- **24–28 weekly follow-up visits at 24–28, 52, 76–80, and 104 weeks** (at CRF/Great North Children's Hospital):
	- Blood and urine samples
	- Pulse and blood pressure
	- Concomitant medications and adverse events recorded
	- General and pubertal examination

### The significance of biological variation in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency, and consideration of the relevance of total, free and bioavailable testosterone determinations [^116nFE2H]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndrome is based on clinical manifestations and documentation of low testosterone. Which biochemical tests to use and the importance of morning sampling are still controversial. Biological variation, including interindividual and intraindividual biological variation, must be considered when interpreting individual results as it determines the usefulness of reference intervals and the change (reference change value) necessary for a significant difference between results.

A total of 87 healthy men, aged 50 to over 70 years, provided blood samples in the morning of the first day and 4 weeks later in both the morning and afternoon. Samples were frozen at -70°C and analyzed in the same run for serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, bioavailable testosterone, and free testosterone calculations.

Serum testosterone was lower in the afternoon by 1.5 nmol/l (43 ng/dl, p < 0.05), with larger changes observed with higher morning values. However, this diurnal effect was dwarfed by the normal biological variation observed for repeat morning samples (serum testosterone ± 4 nmol/l [115 ng/dl]). Between-day intra-individual biological variation for morning serum testosterone was 18.7%, while within-day intra-individual biological variation was 12.9%. A change of 52% (reference change value) is necessary between serial morning results to confirm a significant difference. The biological variation parameters of calculated bioavailable testosterone and calculated free testosterone confer no advantage.

### Adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in men during testosterone treatment: an individual patient and aggregate data meta-analysis [^116CaR55]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Testosterone is the standard treatment for male hypogonadism, but there is uncertainty about its cardiovascular safety due to inconsistent findings. We aimed to provide the most extensive individual participant dataset (IPD) of testosterone trials available, analyze subtypes of all cardiovascular events observed during treatment, and investigate the effect of incorporating data from trials that did not provide IPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, including IPD.

### Injectable estradiol monotherapy effectively suppresses testosterone in gender-affirming hormone therapy [^115Fvry2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the association between injectable estradiol and serum testosterone (TT) concentrations and to determine additional associations between covariates such as age, intramuscular vs. subcutaneous administration, ester type (cypionate vs. valerate), injection timing relative to lab draw, antiandrogen use, and progestogen use on TT concentration.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional, retrospective multisite study included adult transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) patients without a history of gonadectomy or concurrent GnRH agonist use. These patients were prescribed weekly injectable estradiol at a stable dose for more than 75 days between 2019 and 2023, with confirmed timing of estradiol and TT concentrations relative to the last injection. Patients who achieved the guideline-recommended TT suppression (< 50 ng/dL) were compared to those who did not. A weighted linear mixed model was used to evaluate the relationship between TT concentration and covariates.

- **Results**: Of the 357 patients included in the study, the median estradiol dose was 4 mg (interquartile range [IQR] 3–6), estradiol concentration was 232 pg/mL (IQR 134–371), and TT concentration was 17 ng/dL (IQR 10–33). There was no significant difference in TT concentration or the proportion reaching TT suppression between patients using estradiol monotherapy versus those using estradiol with antiandrogen(s) and/or a progestogen. In the weighted linear mixed model, higher estradiol concentrations, fewer days since injection, and progestogen use were associated with lower TT concentrations.

- **Conclusions**: Injectable estradiol, even as monotherapy, was effective in achieving TT suppression in 82.6% of patients and was comparable to combination therapy with antiandrogen(s) or progestogen.

### Blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms [^112Sp4X3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

There are few systematic studies of the relationship between blood testosterone concentrations and the symptoms of overt androgen deficiency. Most testosterone preparations are relatively short-term, and the rapid changes in blood testosterone concentrations they cause make it difficult to define any testosterone threshold. By contrast, subdermal testosterone implants provide stable blood testosterone concentrations over days to weeks, while gradually declining to baseline over 5–7 months. This provides an opportunity to define a blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms by observing androgen-deficient men as their familiar symptoms return.

Among 52 androgen-deficient men who underwent 260 implantations over 5 years, the blood total and free testosterone concentrations were highly reproducible within individuals at the time of the return of symptoms (F = 0.8, P = 0.49 and F = 1.4, P = 0.24, respectively). However, these concentrations varied markedly between men (F = 167 and F = 138, both P < 0.001), indicating that each person had a consistent testosterone threshold for symptoms that differed between individuals. The most reported symptoms were lack of energy, lack of motivation, and reduced libido. The symptomatic threshold was significantly lower in men with secondary hypogonadism compared to men with primary or mixed hypogonadism (total, 9.7 ± 0.5 nmol/liter vs. 11.7 ± 0.4 nmol/liter and 10.2 ± 0.3 nmol/liter, P = 0.006; free, 146 ± 10 pmol/liter).

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured, as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG due to unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure that the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased based on clinical response and blood levels, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing rather than to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels, testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, and the deepening of voice.

### Testosterone treatment comes of age: new options for hypogonadal men [^115ESkDg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is one of the most frequent yet underdiagnosed endocrinopathies. The required testosterone treatment is straightforward and highly effective when properly administered. Although testosterone has been used clinically for seven decades, earlier treatment modalities were less than ideal. Subdermal testosterone pellets require minor surgery for insertion and often cause local issues. Injectable testosterone enanthate, once the most widely used form, lasts two to four weeks but initially produces supraphysiological levels and low levels before the next injection. Oral testosterone undecanoate must be taken three times daily and has an uncertain absorption pattern, resulting in fluctuating serum testosterone levels.

With the advent of transdermal testosterone preparations, achieving desired physiological serum levels became possible for the first time. Scrotal testosterone patches initially fulfilled this need, followed by nonscrotal skin patches, which caused significant skin reactions, including erythema and blisters. Recently, invisible transdermal testosterone gels, which increased application intervals, have begun to replace other modalities. A mucoadhesive buccal testosterone tablet offering sustained release is also a recent competing option. Lastly, injectable testosterone undecanoate in castor oil has been developed into a true depot preparation requiring only four injections per year for replacement therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115wnLUL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hirsutism, particularly in the context of serum testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of early morning serum total and free testosterone using a reliable specialty assay. This is advised if serum total testosterone levels are normal, sexual hair growth is moderate/severe, or if sexual hair growth is mild but there is clinical evidence of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder, such as menstrual disturbance or progression despite therapy.

### Does baseline serum testosterone influence androgen deprivation therapy outcomes in hormone naïve patients with advanced prostate cancer [^113tam8h]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

To study the prognostic value of baseline serum testosterone in hormone naïve advanced prostate cancer patients receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy, a post-hoc analysis was conducted. The study pooled data from two large prospective, randomized, parallel arm phase 3b trials (NCT00295750-Global; NCT00928434-USA), involving patients undergoing continuous androgen deprivation therapy (agonist or antagonist) with a 1-year follow-up. Survival end points were evaluated for the effect of baseline serum testosterone as a continuous variable and compared for low (less than 250 ng/dl) vs. normal (250 ng/dl or greater) groups based on the saturation model, using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating established clinically important baseline factors.

On intention-to-treat analysis, 138 (16.5%) of 838 eligible men had baseline serum testosterone levels less than 250 ng/dl. Key cancer characteristics for low vs. normal baseline serum testosterone cohorts were comparable: Gleason sum 7–10 (55% vs. 58%), stage, and prostate-specific antigen levels of 20 ng/ml or greater (38% each). The lowest baseline serum testosterone quartile cutoff value was 282 ng/dl or less (206 patients). Multivariable analysis showed a significant effect of baseline serum testosterone on all survival endpoints. For the saturation model with a low cutoff of less than 250 ng/dl, significance was maintained for overall (HR 2.24; p < 0.02) and progression-free survival (HR 1.57; p < 0.02), but not for time to prostate-specific antigen progression (HR 1.37; p = 0.2).

### Effects of aromatase inhibition in elderly men with low or borderline-low serum testosterone levels [^116urwLV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

As men age, serum testosterone levels decrease, a factor that may contribute to some aspects of age-related physiological deterioration. Although androgen replacement has been shown to have beneficial effects in frankly hypogonadal men, its use in elderly men with borderline hypogonadism is controversial. Furthermore, testosterone replacement methods have important limitations. We investigated the ability of the orally administered aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, to increase endogenous testosterone production in 37 elderly men (aged 62–74 years) with screening serum testosterone levels less than 350 ng/dl.

Subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion to the following 12-week oral regimens:

- **Group 1**: Anastrozole 1 mg daily (n = 12)
- **Group 2**: Anastrozole 1 mg twice weekly (n = 11)
- **Group 3**: Placebo daily (n = 14)

Hormone levels, quality of life (MOS Short-Form Health Survey), sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function), benign prostate hyperplasia severity (American Urological Association Symptom Index Score), prostate-specific antigen, and measures of safety were compared among groups.

Mean ± SD bioavailable testosterone increased from 99 ± 31 to 207 ± 65 ng/dl in group 1 and from 115 ± 37 to 178 ± 55 ng/dl in group 2 (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for both groups and P = 0.054 group 1 vs. group 2). Total testosterone levels increased from 343 ± 61 to 572 ± 139 ng/dl in group 1 and from 397 ± 106 to 520 ± 91 ng/dl in group 2 (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for both groups and P = 0.012 group 1 vs. group 2). Serum estradiol levels decreased from…

### Longitudinal changes in liver enzyme levels among transgender people receiving gender affirming hormone therapy [^1131J9HG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Four US-based studies and one study from Belgium evaluated the effects of shorter-acting testosterone esters given as weekly or biweekly injections at doses ranging from 25 to 300 mg. All but one of these studies relied on retrospective chart review. The only study with prospective follow-up was based on a relatively small cohort (n = 12) of patients who received masculinizing GAHT at a clinical center in Boston, MA. The average ALT levels in that study increased from 19 IU/L at baseline to 24 IU/L after 12 months of treatment with 50–125 mg of testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate injected every two weeks. The corresponding increase for AST was from 21 to 25 IU/L; however, none of the observed differences was statistically significant due to the small sample size.

Statistically significant upward trends in ALT and AST concentrations following weekly or biweekly testosterone injections were also reported in a study from Ghent, Belgium, and in a recent study from Dallas, TX. By contrast, two other US-based studies found no evidence that testosterone was associated with higher levels of either enzyme.

### Is a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LqG3z]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The study investigated whether a previously or currently reduced testosterone level in male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease.

- **Methods - Searched databases and strategies**: The Cochrane Database of Randomized Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, and EMBASE were carefully searched for studies related to testosterone, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD) or cardiovascular risk using the search terms 'testosterone', 'diabetes mellitus', and 'cardiovascular disease'. The term 'cardiovascular disease' was later interchanged with 'atherosclerosis' and 'coronary artery disease'. Abbreviations such as T2DM, DM, CVD, and CAD were also used to enhance the search process. The search was limited to articles published in English.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Various inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied during the selection process. The inclusion criteria were as follows:

- Studies including only male patients with T2DM
- Studies comparing diabetic patients with low testosterone levels to those with normal testosterone levels
- Studies reporting the number of patients with CAD at baseline or during the follow-up period

The exclusion criteria were:

- Studies not focusing on male patients with T2DM
- Studies not comparing diabetic patients with low testosterone levels to those with normal testosterone levels
- Studies not reporting the number of patients with CAD at baseline or during the follow-up period

- **Endpoints**: The only endpoint in this analysis was CAD/atherosclerosis/coronary plaque/major adverse coronary event prior to or following testosterone reduction.

Outcomes relevant to each study were considered and recorded.

### Similar frequency of testosterone surge after repeat injections of goserelin (Zoladex) 3.6 mg and 10.8 mg: Results of a randomized open-label trial [^116txoYe]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate whether testosterone surges occur on repeat injections of 3.6 or 10.8 mg goserelin (Zoladex) depot and, if so, their extent, men with prostate cancer for whom hormonal therapy was indicated were randomized. The study involved administering open-label goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days (n = 129) or 10.8 mg every 84 days (n = 118) for 48 weeks. Serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were measured before the repeat injection on day 1 of each treatment cycle, and then on days 4 and 8. Surges were defined in three ways:

- **Type 1**: Simultaneous increase in both testosterone and luteinizing hormone to within the age-specific normal range.
- **Type 2**: Increase in testosterone to within the age-specific normal range.
- **Type 3**: Elevation in testosterone from less than to greater than the castrate level (greater than 18.5 ng/dL).

Most patients did not experience a testosterone surge. In the 10.8-mg group, two patients (1.8%) had a type 1 surge after one repeat injection, while two (1.6%) in the 3.6-mg group had a type 2 surge after one repeat injection. Type 3 surges occurred after one or more repeat injections in 34 (27.0%) and 20 (17.7%) patients in the 3.6-mg and 10.8-mg groups, respectively (P = 0.065). The mean surge (± standard deviation) was 11.2 ng/dL (± 13.5) and 17.3 ng/dL (± 24.6), respectively. No patient with a testosterone surge experienced clinical symptoms of a tumor flare reaction.

The testosterone levels were consistently maintained within the castrate range (18.5 ng/dL or less) in most (77.4%) patients receiving long-term 3.6 mg or 10.8 mg goserelin.
