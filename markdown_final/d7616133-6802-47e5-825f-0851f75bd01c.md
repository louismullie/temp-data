## Question

what is the recommended duration for p.o. antibiotic management of appendicitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration for p.o. (oral) antibiotic management of appendicitis across clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are treating appendicitis nonoperatively with antibiotics alone. Then, I should consider postoperative care after appendectomy, distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated disease. Next, I will consider pediatric-specific adjustments and when to switch from IV to oral therapy safely. Finally, I will synthesize practical, reference-aligned durations and criteria based on contemporary guidelines and randomized trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios because the duration hinges on context: nonoperative antibiotic-first treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis versus postoperative antibiotics after appendectomy, and within the latter, uncomplicated versus complicated disease with adequate source control; I also need to check criteria for IV-to-oral conversion and outpatient completion, as guidance differs by setting in major guidelines such as WSES 2020 and SIS 2024.

> For nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis, I should verify the highest-quality regimen and duration; the pivotal APPAC RCT used 3 days of IV ertapenem followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin 500 mg daily plus metronidazole 500 mg three times daily, for a total of 10 days, which established 7 days of oral therapy after an initial short IV course as a reference protocol, with long-term follow-up confirming feasibility but acknowledging recurrence risk over time [^114iwFwt] [^116t2rQ3]. Hold on, I should double-check the broader evidence on duration; systematic reviews of conservative antibiotic regimens suggest total 7–10 days is most common, which aligns with APPAC and supports a 7-day oral tail after initial IV stabilization, with outpatient oral completion feasible in selected, clinically improving patients and even ED-discharge antibiotic-first pathways in pilot RCTs [^116QgqRJ] [^112ognUK] [^117Q4Mzw]. But wait, what about overall success and recurrence when counseling patients; contemporary meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews indicate antibiotics can avoid immediate surgery for many but carry lower 1-year efficacy versus appendectomy and higher recurrence, which should be discussed when selecting nonoperative care and planning duration [^113ZHYDz] [^1156TaFe].

> Now, I will examine postoperative management for uncomplicated appendicitis; I need to ensure I don't over-prescribe, so let me verify guideline positions. WSES 2020 and EAES 2016 agree routine postoperative antibiotics are not indicated after appendectomy for uncomplicated disease; standard perioperative prophylaxis suffices and no oral antibiotics are recommended on discharge in these cases [^111HvSnp] [^116bkrxP]. I should confirm primary care guidance concurs; AAFP similarly supports considering nonoperative options for some patients but does not endorse postoperative antibiotics in uncomplicated appendectomy, reinforcing the "no postop antibiotics" stance in this subgroup [^notfound].

> For postoperative management of complicated appendicitis with adequate source control, I was initially going to say to use 3–5 days for everyone, as older guidance allowed that range; wait, let me verify the most current data because I need to correct this if newer trials support shorter durations [^115oT7cS]. Hold on, I should review SIS 2024 and the APPIC trial; SIS 2024 recommends limiting postoperative antibiotics to 24–48 hours with adequate source control, and APPIC demonstrated that 2 days of IV antibiotics was noninferior to 5 days for complex appendicitis regarding infectious complications at 90 days, with fewer antibiotic adverse effects and lower costs, suggesting that routine oral completion is not required if stopping at 24–48 hours after clinical improvement, which updates the older 3–5 day practice I first mentioned [^112Wnxex] [^116i1KEj] [^111psqAZ]. I should double-check other RCT data; a randomized trial also found 24 hours noninferior to extended courses after source control, and WSES 2020 still advises not to exceed 3–5 days when antibiotics are indicated, which I now interpret as an upper bound when source control is uncertain or recovery lags, while favoring 24–48 hours when criteria for early cessation are met, with oral conversion only if an abbreviated total course is being completed at home [^1154BYhd] [^115oT7cS].

> Next, I should review when it is safe to switch to oral therapy postoperatively and what total durations apply in children; in pediatrics with complicated appendicitis, WSES 2020 recommends early switch to oral antibiotics after 48 hours with total duration under 7 days when clinically improving, and the Arnold RCT shows outpatient oral therapy yields similar outcomes to home IV after perforated appendicitis in children, supporting oral completion once afebrile, tolerating diet, and clinically stable [^111KDH5G] [^116oPJMX]. Let me verify that postoperative antibiotics add no benefit in pediatric uncomplicated appendicitis; WSES pediatric statements indicate postoperative antibiotics do not reduce SSI in uncomplicated cases, so no routine oral antibiotics should be used after straightforward pediatric appendectomy either [^1157pUPj].

> I need to ensure the IV-to-oral conversion criteria and agent selection align with stewardship; patients should be afebrile 24–48 hours, tolerating oral intake and medications, with improving pain and downtrending inflammatory markers before switching, recognizing that dual-agent coverage can be as effective as triple therapy and that overly broad regimens are discouraged unless local resistance risks justify them, with common oral options including a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate when appropriate based on local resistance and patient factors [^116oPJMX] [^116QgqRJ] [^115EsRaw]. Hmm, wait a minute, fluoroquinolones may face resistance concerns regionally; I should confirm local antibiograms or consider beta-lactam options accordingly, keeping courses as short as evidence allows to support antimicrobial stewardship and minimize adverse effects [^115EsRaw].

> Putting this together, I should conclude with clear, scenario-specific durations; for nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis, complete approximately 7 days of oral antibiotics after an initial short IV phase, totaling 7–10 days, with regimens like levofloxacin plus metronidazole modeled on APPAC, acknowledging recurrence risk and aligning with systematic reviews; for postoperative uncomplicated appendicitis, do not prescribe oral antibiotics; and for postoperative complicated appendicitis with adequate source control, target 24–48 hours total (for example, 2 days IV per APPIC) and stop when recovery criteria are met, reserving extension toward a maximum of 3–5 days only if clinical response is delayed or source control is uncertain, using oral agents only to complete a short remaining course at discharge when necessary, with pediatric patients often switching to oral after 48 hours and completing under 7 days total [^114iwFwt] [^116QgqRJ] [^111HvSnp] [^112Wnxex] [^116i1KEj] [^115oT7cS] [^111KDH5G].

---

The recommended duration for oral antibiotic management of appendicitis is **7–10 days** [^112ognUK] for uncomplicated cases managed nonoperatively, typically 3 days IV followed by 7 days of oral therapy [^114iwFwt]. For complicated appendicitis, total antibiotic therapy should be **3–5 days** [^115oT7cS] after adequate source control, with an early switch to oral therapy when clinically stable [^116oPJMX]. Prolonged therapy beyond 5 days [^112Wnxex] is not recommended unless there is ongoing infection or inadequate source control [^115oT7cS] [^112BiZp7].

---

## Uncomplicated appendicitis

Uncomplicated appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix **without perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis**. It has been traditionally managed surgically; however, recent evidence supports **antibiotic therapy as a safe alternative** in selected patients [^113ZHYDz] [^115o7Ngf]. In nonoperative management, evidence includes the **APPAC trial** [^114iwFwt], which used IV ertapenem for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole (total 10 days) [^116QgqRJ], and a **systematic review** [^112ognUK] showing that most trials used 7–10 days of total antibiotics, typically 3 days IV followed by oral therapy. Thus, the recommended duration for uncomplicated appendicitis managed nonoperatively is **7–10 days**, with an initial IV phase followed by oral therapy.

---

## Complicated appendicitis

Complicated appendicitis involves perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis, **requiring longer antibiotic therapy** and often surgical intervention.

- **WSES 2020 guidelines**: 3–5 days of antibiotics post-appendectomy with adequate source control [^115oT7cS].
- **SIS 2024 guidelines**: Limit postoperative antibiotics to 24–48 hours for low- and high-risk patients with adequate source control [^112Wnxex] [^1154BYhd].
- **APPIC trial**: 2 days of IV antibiotics non-inferior to 5 days in complex appendicitis [^1177hEAT].

Therefore, the recommended duration for complicated appendicitis is **3–5 days**, with an early switch to oral therapy when clinically stable.

---

## Pediatric considerations

Pediatric patients may require **individualized antibiotic duration** based on clinical response and disease severity. In pediatric complicated appendicitis, the **WSES 2020 guidelines** recommend an early switch to oral antibiotics after 48 hours, with total therapy < 7 days [^111KDH5G]. Many **clinical response-based protocols** [^111LtGzP] continue IV antibiotics until the child is afebrile, has a normal WBC, and can tolerate oral intake, then switch to oral antibiotics [^111o8Fvp].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic duration

- **Clinical response**: Resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain.
- **Imaging findings**: Absence of abscess or phlegmon [^116c7ahG].
- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, immune status [^111nLwqn].
- **Surgical factors**: Adequacy of source control [^112BiZp7].

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged antibiotic therapy may reduce recurrence but **increases adverse events**, resistance, and costs. Supporting this risk–benefit balance, the **APPAC trial** reported a 27% recurrence at 1 year with antibiotics alone [^114iwFwt], and prolonged courses are associated with higher rates of **adverse events**, including C. difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance [^112BiZp7].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **short-course antibiotics** with early switch to oral therapy [^112Wnxex] [^115oT7cS]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Route** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated appendicitis | 7–10 days [^112ognUK] | IV followed by oral |
| Complicated appendicitis | 3–5 days | IV followed by oral |
| Pediatric complicated appendicitis | < 7 days [^111KDH5G] | Early switch to oral after 48 hours |

---

The recommended duration for oral antibiotic management of appendicitis is **7–10 days** for uncomplicated cases and **3–5 days** for complicated cases, with an early switch to oral therapy when clinically stable.

Broad-spectrum, single, or double-agent therapy is equally efficacious but more cost-effective than triple-agent therapy. It was reported that dual therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and metronidazole offers more efficient and cost-effective antibiotic management compared with triple therapy; however, prospective studies are required to determine whether this policy is associated with higher rates of wound infections and changes in antibiotic therapy.

Postoperative antibiotics can be administered orally if the patient is otherwise well enough to be discharged. Arnold et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 82 pediatric patients to compare the effect of home intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy on complication rates and resource utilization following appendectomy for perforated acute appendicitis (AA). Forty-four patients (54%) were randomized to the intravenous (IV) group and 38 (46%) to the oral group. The study showed no difference in length of stay (4.4 ± 1.5 vs. 4.4 ± 2.0 days), postoperative abscess rate (11.6% vs. 8.1%), or readmission rate (14.0% vs. 16.2%), whereas hospital and outpatient charges were higher in the IV group.

Other retrospective cohort studies have confirmed that after appendectomy for perforated AA in children, oral antibiotics show equivalent outcomes compared with intravenous antibiotics but with shorter lengths of hospitalization and fewer medical encounters required.

Compared to pediatric patients who receive intravenous antibiotics, those who are treated with oral antibiotics have statistically lower rates of repeated ultrasound (US) imaging (49.6% vs. 35.1%) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement (98.3% vs. 9.1%).

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

- **Methods**: A PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

- **Results**: Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90%, and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths.

### Antibiotic therapy vs appendectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: The APPAC randomized clinical trial [^114iwFwt]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

An increasing amount of evidence supports the use of antibiotics instead of surgery for treating patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Objective**: To compare antibiotic therapy with appendectomy in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis confirmed by computed tomography (CT).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter, open-label, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 2009 until June 2012 in Finland. The trial enrolled 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with uncomplicated acute appendicitis confirmed by a CT scan. Patients were randomly assigned to early appendectomy or antibiotic treatment with a 1-year follow-up period.

- **Interventions**: Patients randomized to antibiotic therapy received intravenous ertapenem (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times per day). Patients randomized to the surgical treatment group were assigned to undergo standard open appendectomy.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint for the surgical intervention was the successful completion of an appendectomy. The primary endpoint for antibiotic-treated patients was discharge from the hospital without the need for surgery and no re-appendicitis during a 1-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: There were 273 patients in the surgical group and 257 in the antibiotic group. Of 273 patients in the surgical group, all but one underwent successful appendectomy, resulting in a success rate of 99.6% (95% CI, 98.0% to 100.0%).

### Sages guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^115TMznS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer eight key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or nonoperative management, and specific technical and postoperative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

- **Results**: Conditional recommendations were made in favor of both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), using either suction and lavage or suction alone, with no routine drain placement. Short-term antibiotics were recommended postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively was recommended to undergo interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms, although it also indicates uncertainty.

- **Conclusions**: These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### Antibiotics versus surgical therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42015016882) [^115o7Ngf]. Annals of Surgery (2017). High credibility.

The aim was to investigate available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of surgical versus conservative treatment of acute appendicitis. There is ongoing debate on the merits of surgical and conservative treatment for acute appendicitis.

A systematic literature search using the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase, along with a hand search of retrieved reference lists up to January 2016, was conducted to identify randomized and nonrandomized studies. After critical appraisal, data were analyzed using a random-effects model in a Mantel-Haenszel test or inverse variance to calculate risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Four trials and four cohort studies (2551 patients) were included. We found that 26.5% of patients in the conservative group required appendectomy within 1 year, resulting in a treatment effectiveness of 72.6%, which was significantly lower than the 99.4% in the surgical group (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.7–0.79; P = 0.00001; I = 62%). Overall postoperative complications were comparable (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.35–2.58; P = 0.91; I = 0%), whereas the rate of adverse events (RR 3.18; 95% CI 1.63–6.21; P = 0.0007; I = 1%) and the incidence of complicated appendicitis (RR 2.52; 95% CI 1.17–5.43; P = 0.02; I = 0%) were significantly higher in the antibiotic treatment group. Randomized trials showed significantly longer hospital stays in the antibiotic treatment group (RR 0.3 days; 95% CI 0.07–0.53; P = 0.009; I = 49%).

Although antibiotics may prevent some patients from appendectomies, surgery remains a highly effective treatment option for uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Appendectomy versus antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis [^113ZHYDz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergency general surgical conditions worldwide. Uncomplicated or simple appendicitis can be treated with either appendectomy or antibiotics. Some studies have suggested possible benefits with antibiotics, such as reduced complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and fewer days off work. However, surgery may improve the success of treatment, as antibiotic treatment is associated with recurrence and a future need for surgery.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated or simple acute appendicitis compared with appendectomy for resolution of symptoms and complications.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) on 19 July 2022. We also searched for unpublished studies in conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation search. There were no restrictions on date, publication status, or language of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies where most participants were adults with uncomplicated or simple appendicitis. Interventions included antibiotics (by any route) compared with appendectomy (open or laparoscopic).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane and employed GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes included mortality and success of treatment, while secondary outcomes included the number of participants.

### Antibiotics versus appendicectomy in the management of acute appendicitis: An ongoing debate [^111sxBDu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common cause of acute abdomen in young adults, and the mainstay of treatment at most centers continues to be appendicectomy. This occurs despite the fact that many other intra-abdominal pathologies, such as diverticulitis, are routinely managed conservatively with antibiotics.

A study by Varadhan et al. (2012) aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to appendicectomy, specifically for the management of uncomplicated appendicitis, through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. The authors included only randomized controlled trials with clearly defined management protocols, excluding all other types of studies, including those related to complicated appendicitis.

The primary outcome measures were complications such as wound infections or peritonitis. Secondary outcome measures included the duration of hospitalization, readmission rate, and treatment efficacy. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search covering January 1966 to December 2011, with associated back-chaining of articles. The meta-analysis adhered to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, assessed outcomes on an intention-to-treat basis, and separately accounted for the potential confounder of alternate antibiotic regimens.

Following the evaluation of six trials, the study included a total of 900 patients (n = 470 antibiotic treatment, n = 430 appendicectomy) derived from four trials, as the other two trials met the exclusion criteria. The results indicated a 63% success rate (277 out of 438 patients) following antibiotic treatment at one year.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^1139biUs]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

We explored a comparison of four (12%) outlier studies with initial antibiotic response rates in the 60% to 70% range to 30 trials (88%) with rates 80% or greater. The analysis considered components of conservative management that might affect outcomes: inclusion of patients with abscess or unspecified, 50% versus 27%; inclusion of patients with appendicolith or unspecified, 75% versus 60%; use of a guideline nonrecommended intravenous and oral antibiotic or unspecified, 25% versus 17%; total antibiotic duration of less than 7 days or unspecified, 25% versus 23%; and allowed time for clinical response less than or equal to 24 hours or unspecified, 75% versus 62%, respectively.

- **Discharge criteria and short-term follow-up**: Seventeen trials (50%) described hospital discharge criteria. Studies generally required improvement, control of pain with oral analgesics, and resolution of fever for discharge eligibility. Most studies mandated that antibiotic-treated participants be hospitalized for a minimum of 1 to 3 days. One pediatric pilot trial allowed hospital discharge if the participant was afebrile and tolerated a diet after 8 hours of treatment, and one adult trial allowed discharge if there was improvement by the next morning. In one adult pilot RCT, 14 of 15 consecutive antibiotic-randomized adults achieved hemodynamic stability, temperature less than 38.5°C, pain control with oral analgesics, and tolerance for oral fluids and medications. These patients were successfully managed as outpatients and had symptom resolution, having been initially treated with a comprehensive antibiotic regimen.

### Role of preoperative antibiotic treatment while awaiting appendectomy: The PERFECT-Antibiotics randomized clinical trial [^116WqZhm]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics are thought to decelerate inflammation progression and reduce complications in acute uncomplicated appendicitis, although the evidence of their effectiveness is insufficient, and treatment practices vary widely.

The objective of this multicenter, noninferiority, open-label randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effect of preoperatively started antibiotic treatment on the rate of appendiceal perforation.

Conducted in two hospitals in Finland and one hospital in Norway between May 18, 2020, and January 22, 2023, data analysis was performed from March 2023 to March 2024. Eligible patients were adults (aged > 18 years) diagnosed with presumed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients were excluded if they had allergies or other contraindications to study antibiotics, previously started antibiotic treatment, pregnancy, suspicion of perforated appendicitis, or other reasons to perform prompt surgery. Patients were randomized 1:1 with a web-based service simultaneously as the laparoscopic appendectomy was scheduled.

- **Interventions**: Antibiotic treatment was started while waiting for surgery (cefuroxime, 1500 mg, and metronidazole, 500 mg, every 8 hours until the surgery) or waiting without antibiotic treatment. Patients in both groups received a single prophylactic dose of antibiotics in the induction of anesthesia.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was perforated appendicitis diagnosed during surgery. The absolute difference in perforation rates was compared between the groups by an intention-to-treat analysis.

### Antibiotics-first versus surgery for appendicitis: A US pilot randomized controlled trial allowing outpatient antibiotic management [^117Q4Mzw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

This study evaluates the feasibility of a multicenter US study comparing antibiotics-first treatment, including outpatient management, with appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 5 years or older with uncomplicated appendicitis at one US hospital were randomized to either appendectomy or an antibiotics-first approach, which involved intravenous ertapenem for at least 48 hours followed by oral cefdinir and metronidazole. Stable participants aged over 13 years could be discharged after at least 6 hours of observation in the emergency department, with follow-up the next day. Outcomes measured included the 1-month major complication rate (primary outcome), hospital duration, pain, disability, quality of life, hospital charges, and the rate of appendectomy among the antibiotics-first group.

- **Results**: Of 48 eligible patients, 30 (62.5%) consented to participate. Out of these, 16 (53.3%) were randomized to the antibiotics-first group and 14 (46.7%) to the appendectomy group. The median age was 33 years (range 9 to 73 years), with a median white blood cell count of 15,000/μL (range 6,200 to 23,100/μL) and a median computed tomography appendiceal diameter of 10 mm (range 7 to 18 mm). Fourteen out of 15 antibiotic-treated adults (93.3%) were discharged from the emergency department, and all experienced symptom resolution. At 1 month, major complications occurred in 2 participants from the appendectomy group (14.3%; 95% CI 1.8% to 42.8%) and 1 participant from the antibiotics-first group (6.3%; 95% CI 0.2% to 30.2%).

### Two days versus five days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: Cost analysis of a randomized, noninferiority trial [^114NsRDh]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a common disease among children and adults. Although nonoperative management is gaining popularity, appendectomy is still performed in most patients. Complex appendicitis, which includes appendicitis with necrosis, perforation, or abscess, is observed in approximately 30% of patients who undergo an appendectomy. In these patients, postoperative antibiotics are administered to reduce infectious complications. The duration of postoperative antibiotics remains debatable.

- **Benefits of restrictive antibiotic use**: Reduced hospitalization and decreased adverse effects related to antibiotics. The growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) calls for antibiotic stewardship.

In international literature on acute appendicitis, a gap was acknowledged regarding the optimum duration of antibiotic use for complex appendicitis. The antibiotics after an aPPendectomy In Complex (APPIC) appendicitis trial confirmed what previous studies suggested: two days of intravenous (IV) antibiotics is comparably effective and safe compared to five days.

While safety and efficacy are crucial in determining treatment strategy, costs and cost-effectiveness should also be considered. Health care costs have risen over the past decades in both developed and developing countries. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further accelerated this trend. The latest WHO report on global health expenditure indicated that health care spending continues to increase across developed and developing countries. In many high-income countries, health care expenditure has surpassed 10% of the gross domestic product.

### The current management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: Should there be a change in paradigm? A systematic review of the literatures and analysis of treatment performance [^113aZZDY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Appendectomy has long been the mainstay of intervention for acute appendicitis, aiming at preventing perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation, and recurrence. With a better understanding of the disease process, non-operative management (NOM) with antibiotics alone has been proved to be a feasible treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis. This article aimed to systematically review the available literatures and discuss whether NOM should replace appendectomy as the standard first-line treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Method**: A search of the Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library was performed using the keywords 'acute appendicitis' and 'antibiotic therapy'. A meta-analysis with the inverse variance model for continuous variables and the Mantel-Haenszel model for dichotomous variables was performed to evaluate the one-year treatment efficacy, morbidity rate, sick leave duration, and length of hospital stay associated with emergency appendectomy and NOM.

- **Results**: Six randomized control trials were identified out of 1,943 publications. NOM had a significantly lower treatment efficacy rate at one year, 0.10 (95% CI 0.03–0.36, p < 0.01), when compared to appendectomy. The morbidity rate was comparable between the two interventions. However, the length of hospital stay was longer with a mean difference of 1.08 days (95% CI 0.09–2.07, p = 0.03), and the sick leave duration was shorter, with a mean difference of 3.37 days (95% CI -5.90 to -0.85 days, p < 0.01) for NOM.

- **Conclusion**: The paradigm remains unchanged, with appendectomy being the gold standard of treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Antibiotics as first-line alternative to appendicectomy in adult appendicitis: 90-day follow-up from a prospective, multicentre cohort study [^111DQTh9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Antibiotics as the first-line treatment for adult acute appendicitis is an accepted, but often overlooked, strategy. Recent trial evidence has reported that antibiotics can be successful and avoid surgery in the majority of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, both in the short and longer term. In addition, international guidelines state that antibiotics are a safe and effective alternative to surgery in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis where imaging has not shown the presence of a faecolith. Despite this, the implementation of antibiotics as first-line treatment has not occurred, and laparoscopic appendicectomy remains the first-line treatment for acute appendicitis in Europe and the United States.

The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic raised significant concerns around the choice of surgical intervention, including potentially increased morbidity and mortality in those infected with COVID-19 undergoing an operation, and viral transmission via aerosolization during laparoscopy. These concerns led to professional surgical societies recommending non-operative management with antibiotics over surgery as the first-line management of acute appendicitis. Anticipating a significant shift in practice, the authors designed and implemented a pragmatic, observational, unselected cohort study of the management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

The collaborative's previous publication on the first 500 adult patients confirmed a significant shift in practice towards non-operative management of acute appendicitis and a higher number of CT scans (71 percent) performed to aid diagnosis.

### Compliance with published recommendations for postoperative antibiotic management of children with appendicitis: A chart audit [^114inDhS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for postoperative antibiotics for appendicitis were published by the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) in 2010. However, the implementation of practice recommendations often takes years. We measured the compliance of pediatric surgeons, who receive reminders every six months from the Division Chief, with the APSA recommendations.

- **Methods**: With Research Ethics Board approval, we completed a retrospective review of children who underwent appendectomy since 2010. Compliance with APSA recommendations was analyzed descriptively. Agreement between pediatric surgeons and pathologists was analyzed by kappa.

- **Results**: We reviewed 242 charts. Patients were excluded for missing data (n = 5) and diagnoses other than appendicitis (n = 27), resulting in 210 patients with appendicitis (119 acute, 91 perforated). Agreement on perforation status between surgeons and pathologists was good (κ = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.66–0.83). Many patients with nonperforated appendicitis received antibiotics in excess of the APSA recommendations (62/119, 52%), as did those with uncomplicated perforated appendicitis (52/84, 62%).

- **Conclusions**: Despite the availability of published recommendations, surgeons continue to prescribe postoperative antibiotics for appendicitis in excess of the recommendations. Overtreatment leads to potential medication errors and increased length-of-stay/medication costs. An intensive implementation program with ongoing education and monitoring may improve compliance with established recommendations to decrease the use of excess postoperative antibiotics and their associated risks.

### 2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: A pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial [^116i1KEj]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The appropriate duration of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis is unclear. The increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance warrants restrictive antibiotic use, which could also reduce side-effects, length of hospital stay, and costs.

- **Methods**: In this pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority trial conducted in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, patients with complex appendicitis (aged ≥ 8 years) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2 days or 5 days of intravenous antibiotics after appendicectomy. Randomisation was stratified by centre, and treating physicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of infectious complications and mortality within 90 days. The main outcome was the absolute risk difference (95% CI) in the primary endpoint, adjusted for age and severity of appendicitis, with a non-inferiority margin of 7.5%. Outcome assessment was based on electronic patient records and a telephone consultation 90 days after appendicectomy. Efficacy was analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Safety outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NL5946.

- **Findings**: Between April 12, 2017, and June 3, 2021, 13,267 patients were screened and 1,066 were randomly assigned, with 533 to each group. Thirty-one were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2-day group and 30 from the 5-day group due to errors in recruitment or consent. Appendicectomy was performed laparoscopically in 955 (95%) of 1,005 patients.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^117PGYUc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

This EAES consensus development conference regarding the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis resulted in 46 statements and recommendations based upon the available evidence. Results from this meeting led to this paper, which can be used as a guideline for surgeons treating patients with appendicitis. Local guidelines, national guidelines, and guidelines from scientific communities regarding appendicitis were available but showed great heterogeneity. With this consensus meeting, we managed to gather experts from different European nations to compare and debate the management of patients with acute appendicitis. This led to a consensus meeting in which 41 of the 46 statements and the majority of the members of the EAES supported recommendations. The transfer of knowledge between the member countries, the opportunity to discuss views and, above all, the creation of a widely supported paper appears valuable.

Our list of topics was created by the coordinating team and expert panel and was thought to cover the most important topics in the field of acute appendicitis. Despite local differences, the general idea within the consensus group on the management of patients with acute appendicitis was comparable. In some cases, differences in treatment strategies between members of the expert panel were due to available surgical supplies and finances. This is reflected, for instance, in the statements and recommendations regarding SILS and MRI. However, we want to emphasize that in defining statements, we refrained from stating specific procedures and rather stated the general approaches.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^114S5HeT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

While diet approaches varied and included restricting intake to nothing by mouth for 8 to 48 hours, early introduction of oral fluids and a diet as tolerated was used in about one-third of trials in which this was specified. This approach appears safe and may promote comfort and earliest discharge.

The optimal time to allow for an antibiotic response is unknown. However, of 21 trials that specified the response time threshold, 38% allowed more than 24 to 48 hours, and 24% allowed more than 48 to 72 hours, with no related deaths or cases of progression to severe sepsis. Compared with patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, those with complicated appendicitis appear to take longer to respond to antibiotics. For example, in one series of 88 patients with perforated appendicitis complicated by abscess who were treated non-operatively, the mean time to resolution of fever and leukocytosis was approximately 3 days, and the success rate was greater than 95%.

In the few trials that described time to response to conservative antibiotic treatment for patients with clinically- and imaging-diagnosed uncomplicated appendicitis, most participants responded within 1 to 2 days. Since both providers and patients need to know what to expect with conservative care, including atypical responses, additional initial response data from future trials would be helpful. Patients with perforation not identified on CT, which may occur in about 20% of cases and reflect the degree to which patients with more advanced disease are included, likely take longer to respond to antibiotics than those without perforation.

### The SIFIPAC/WSES/SICG/SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^113p1z2d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Should the pre-operative antibiotic therapy be recommended before appendectomy in elderly patients? The rationale for pre-operative antibiotics in acute appendicitis is to reduce and prevent the formation of abdominal abscesses and the superficial wound infection rate, similar to elective surgery. Several studies have investigated this issue, but no specific data on elderly patients are available in the literature. A meta-analysis including 9,576 patients demonstrated that the administration of pre-operative broad-spectrum antibiotics, when compared to no antibiotics, significantly reduced the rate of intra-abdominal abscesses and the surgical site infection rate. Despite the absence of data dedicated to the elderly, which forced us to downgrade the level of evidence from high to moderate, after discussion, we decided to make a strong recommendation to use pre-operative antibiotics. This decision is due to the large beneficial effect compared to the very low potential harm of the treatment and the extreme unlikelihood that a study dedicated to elderly patients could change the outcome.

- **Statement 13**: We recommend pre-operative broad-spectrum antibiotics in elderly patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

- **Statement 14**: Should post-operative antibiotic therapy be recommended in elderly patients with acute appendicitis? The issue of post-operative antibiotic therapy in intra-abdominal infections and appendicitis is largely debated and studied, with several researches published, but no specific data on elderly patients are available.

### EAES rapid guideline: appendicitis in the elderly [^111nLwqn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

There is a lack of trustworthy, evidence-informed guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis in elderly patients.

- **Methods**: We developed a rapid guideline in accordance with GRADE and AGREE II standards. The steering group consisted of general surgeons, members of the EAES Research Committee/Guidelines Subcommittee with expertise and experience in guideline development, advanced medical statistics and evidence synthesis, biostatisticians, and a guideline methodologist. The guideline panel consisted of three general surgeons, an intensive care physician, a geriatrician, and a patient advocate. We conducted systematic reviews, and the results of evidence synthesis were summarized in evidence tables. Recommendations were authored and published through an online authoring and publication platform (MAGICapp), with the guideline panel making use of an evidence-to-decision framework and a Delphi process to arrive at consensus.

- **Results**: This rapid guideline provides a weak recommendation against the use of clinical scoring systems to replace cross-sectional imaging in the diagnostic approach of suspected appendicitis in elderly patients. It provides a weak recommendation against the use of antibiotics alone over surgical treatment in patients who are deemed fit for surgery, and a weak recommendation for laparoscopic over open surgery. Furthermore, it provides a summary of surgery-associated risks in elderly patients. The guidelines, with recommendations, evidence summaries, and decision aids in user-friendly formats, can also be accessed in MAGICapp.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^113vogwh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Primary appendectomy is the standard of care for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but interest in conservative treatment with antibiotics alone has been increasing in recent years. Clinical trials so far have shown controversial results.

- **Methods**: A series of meta-analyses were reviewed. Studies comparing surgery versus antibiotics alone for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults were included. Descriptive statistics and data on treatment effects were retrieved and summarized.

- **Results**: The conservative approach has a success rate of around 60% and is associated with shorter pain duration, reduced analgesic medication, faster resolution of the inflammation process, lower expenses, and quicker return to work. On the other hand, medical treatment leads to high (up to 20%) readmission rates and more often requires surgery. An operative approach is associated with higher treatment success rates (> 90%) and a very low mortality rate.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the body of evidence, the use of antibiotics for primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis cannot be routinely recommended. Appendectomy remains the gold-standard treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^113r3zaY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). High credibility.

Unequivocal international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with acute appendicitis are lacking. The aim of the consensus meeting 2015 of the EAES was to generate a European guideline based on the best available evidence and expert opinions of a panel of EAES members. After a systematic review of the literature by an international group of surgical research fellows, an expert panel with extensive clinical experience in the management of appendicitis discussed statements and recommendations.

Statements and recommendations with more than 70% agreement by the experts were selected for a web survey and the consensus meeting of the EAES in Bucharest in June 2015. EAES members and attendees at the EAES meeting in Bucharest could vote on these statements and recommendations. If more than 70% agreement was reached, the statement or recommendation was defined as supported by the scientific community. Results from both the web survey and the consensus meeting in Bucharest are presented as percentages.

In total, 46 statements and recommendations were selected for the web survey and consensus meeting. More than 232 members and attendees voted on them. In 41 of 46 statements and recommendations, more than 70% agreement was reached. All 46 statements and recommendations are presented in this paper and comprise topics regarding the diagnostic work-up, treatment indications, procedural aspects, and post-operative care. The consensus meeting produced 46 statements and recommendations on the diagnostic work-up and management of appendicitis.

### WSES Jerusalem guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis [^116U9B9c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The APPAC (Antibiotic Therapy vs Appendectomy for Treatment of Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis) trial, published in JAMA in 2015, enrolled 350 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis confirmed by CT scanning (257 antibiotic therapy, 273 appendectomy). The one-year recurrence rate and appendectomy in the antibiotic group was reported as 27%. The intention-to-treat analysis yielded a difference in treatment efficacy between groups of −27.0% (95% CI, −31.6% to ∞) (P = 0.89). The authors concluded that the antibiotic treatment did not meet the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority compared with appendectomy.

In the recent review published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Flum, it is stated that appendectomy should be considered the first-line therapy in uncomplicated appendicitis and recommended to the patient. In the patients with an equivocal clinical picture, equivocal imaging, strong preferences for avoiding an operation, or major comorbid medical problems, it is reasonable to treat with antibiotics first.

However, an interesting and still not well-studied topic is the role of spontaneous resolution of uncomplicated appendicitis. In fact, the effect of antibiotic treatment could be biased due to spontaneous healing as a result of the expectant management.

- **Statement 3.1**: Antibiotic therapy can be successful in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis who wish to avoid surgery and accept the risk of up to 38% recurrence (EL 1, GoR A).

- **Statement 3.2**: Evidence supports initial intravenous antibiotics with subsequent conversion to oral antibiotic therapy.

### Antibiotics and appendicitis in the pediatric population: An American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committee systematic review [^111LtGzP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to review evidence-based data regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of appendicitis in children.

Data were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and citation review. A literature search was conducted using "appendicitis" combined with "antibiotics" with children as the target patient population. Studies were selected based on relevance for the following questions:

- **Perioperative antibiotics for nonperforated appendicitis**: What perioperative antibiotics should be used for pediatric patients with nonperforated appendicitis?

- **Perioperative management for perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy**:
	- What perioperative intravenous antibiotics should be used?
	- How long should perioperative intravenous antibiotics be used?
	- Should oral antibiotics be used?

- **Initial nonoperative management for perforated appendicitis**: What antibiotics should be used in the initial management?

Children with nonperforated appendicitis should receive preoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics. In children with perforated appendicitis who had undergone appendectomy, intravenous antibiotic duration should be based on clinical criteria. Furthermore, broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as efficacious as, but more cost-effective than, triple agent therapy. If intravenous antibiotics are administered for less than 5 days, oral antibiotics should be administered for a total antibiotic course of 7 days. For children with perforated appendicitis who did not initially undergo an appendectomy, the duration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be determined based on clinical response.

### Contemporary microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of complicated appendicitis: The value of a short-term study [^112w9SDy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship interventions to curtail the use of third-generation cephalosporins and antipseudomonal penicillins for the treatment of complicated appendicitis in children are challenging, given the tendency to treat complicated disease with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Reasons for this are unclear, but there is a paucity of contemporary microbiologic data associated with the child presenting with either acute perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. This study aimed to justify the appropriateness of an empiric regimen consisting of ampicillin, tobramycin/gentamicin plus metronidazole, and to analyze the duration of postoperative therapy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018, involving children who underwent appendectomy or interventional radiologic drainage for primary complicated appendicitis. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had a pathogen isolated from peritoneal fluid culture that was not susceptible to the recommended empiric therapy. The secondary outcomes were the total duration of antimicrobial therapy and the proportion of patients with a postoperative infectious complication within 30 days after intervention.

- **Results**: Of 425 children with primary acute appendicitis, 158 (37%) had complicated appendicitis at presentation. Culture was performed in 53 (40%) of the 133 who underwent surgical or interventional radiologic intervention. The group with peritoneal cultures was more likely to present with longer symptom duration before admission [3 (interquartile range, 2–5) vs. 2].

### The SIFIPAC/WSES/SICG/SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^112QLT7Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

In cases of complicated appendicitis, such as when there is perforation, abscess, or peritonitis, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is recommended. Based on these evidences and due to the indirectness of their low quality, we suggest administering antibiotics after the intervention only in cases of complicated acute appendicitis or whenever the source control is inadequate (conditional recommendation based on low quality evidence).

- **Statement 14.1**: In elderly patients operated on for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, we suggest not administering post-operative antibiotics (conditional recommendation based on low quality evidence).

- **Statement 14.2**: In elderly patients operated on for complicated acute appendicitis, we suggest post-operative broad-spectrum antibiotics (conditional recommendation based on low quality evidence).

- **Antibiotic therapy duration**: Should short-term post-operative antibiotic therapy be preferred over prolonged therapy after appendectomy in elderly patients? The duration of antibiotic therapy in intra-abdominal infection is another matter of debate. Few studies dedicated to acute appendicitis exist, and no studies dedicated to elderly patients are available. When post-operative antimicrobial therapy is indicated, some studies demonstrated the non-inferiority of a limited course of post-operative antibiotics compared to longer therapies. Taylor and colleagues randomized patients with complicated acute appendicitis to receive a minimum of 5 days of post-operative antibiotics versus no indications. In the liberal antibiotic duration group, they demonstrated a lesser use of antibiotics.

### Variation in classification and postoperative management of complex appendicitis: A European survey [^113bRSEx]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The most common duration of prolonged prophylaxis for complex appendicitis was almost evenly spread over less than 3 days, 3, 5, and 7 days. About half the respondents answered that prophylaxis was most often extended beyond 3 postoperative days. A large prospective cohort study demonstrated that 3 and 5 days of postoperative antibiotics result in similar rates of infectious complications; thus, substantial overtreatment may exist.

Another sign of potential overuse of antibiotics is the considerable difference between the minimum durations outlined in hospital protocols and the most commonly practiced durations. Randomized studies will need to confirm whether a reduced course is indeed safe and effective. In this survey, responses from Denmark were unambiguous: all but one indicated that 3 days of postoperative antibiotics was both the minimum and the most common duration. This duration has become the standard in Denmark. For the remainder, responses on duration varied greatly within and between geographical regions, implying considerable variation in care. For an individual patient, this may affect their length of stay in the hospital and potentially their risk of an infectious complication. Moreover, on a national or international level, a reduced or prolonged antibiotic course may significantly impact antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance, and hospital costs.

A recent survey among Dutch surgeons and residents demonstrated similar ambiguity concerning appendicitis with localized pus and gangrenous appendicitis: 61% and 38% of 80 respondents indicated…

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117MPm9P]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Appendicectomy has been the mainstay for the treatment of acute appendicitis since it was first reported by McBurney in 1889, and the general assumption since the 19th century has been that, in the absence of surgical intervention, the disease often progresses from uncomplicated to perforated appendicitis. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and the low threshold for operative intervention have led to a risk of high negative appendicectomy rates with unnecessary surgery-related morbidity.

Only 20% of patients present with complicated appendicitis, and non-operative management with antibiotics and supportive treatment has been explored as a therapeutic option for patients with early uncomplicated appendicitis, resulting in resolution for most of them. Antibiotic treatment was often considered a bridge to surgery in patients with suspected appendicitis but no clear indications for appendicectomy, such as signs of perforation or peritonitis. However, the routine use of antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis was not well supported, owing to inherent pitfalls in the quality and design of individual studies. The role of antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis may have been overlooked mainly on the basis of tradition rather than evidence, considering that other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes such as colonic diverticulitis are primarily managed non-operatively.

This time-honored practice has been challenged recently, with reports of less morbidity associated with antibiotic treatment than surgery in uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: A position statement by the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery [^112BiZp7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

In patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) undergoing adequate source control, four days of fixed-duration antibiotic therapy is sufficient. In the setting of complicated acute appendicitis, the duration of antibiotic therapy may be shortened further in selected patients (high-quality evidence, strong recommendation).

Ongoing signs of abdominal infection or systemic illness after seven days of antibiotic therapy warrant cessation of therapy and a diagnostic investigation rather than prolongation or modification of antibiotic therapy (low-quality evidence, strong recommendation).

Biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, can guide antibiotic duration in patients with signs of ongoing infection (low-quality evidence, weak recommendation).

Short-duration antimicrobial treatment of cIAIs improves outcomes while adhering to the principles of antimicrobial stewardship. The prospective STOP-IT trial demonstrated that for patients with cIAIs undergoing adequate source control, outcomes after approximately four days of fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those following a longer course (approximately eight days) of antibiotics that extended until 48 hours after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. STOP-IT trial data were also evaluated retrospectively to identify risk factors associated with treatment failure, which included corticosteroid use, an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score of five or more points, hospital-acquired infection, or a colon source of cIAI. Despite the presence of risk factors, there were no differences in treatment failure rates between groups.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^116QgqRJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Most antibiotic regimens were consistent with the 2010 and 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Surgical Infection Society (SIS) guidelines for treating mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. Initial parenteral antibiotic regimens used included a second- or third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefmetazole, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole (or tinidazole) or single-agent regimens of amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (ertapenem or meropenem). Upon hospital discharge, oral (and alternative parenteral) regimens included a fluoroquinolone or an advanced generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Four trials (12%) used intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), which are recommended against by IDSA and SIS guidelines. In three pediatric trials, ciprofloxacin was used. One pilot RCT allowed outpatient management facilitated by administering long-acting ertapenem. Daily-dosed ceftriaxone and metronidazole have also been used. Conservatively managed patients have been shown to experience more, mostly mild, antibiotic-related side effects compared to appendectomy patients.

Total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration ranged from 4 to 15 days. The most common total antibiotic duration was 10 days, used in 12 trials (35%); seven trials (21%) used 7 days. The shortest duration was 4 days, used in four trials (12%).

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^1134SNA8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess a series of meta-analyses comparing appendectomy to antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Our review of these meta-analyses shows that conservative treatment with antibiotics is associated with fewer complications, faster recovery from an inflammatory state, shorter pain duration, reduced consumption of analgesic medication, faster return to work, and reduced costs. Conversely, conservative treatment is associated with significantly higher treatment failure and readmission rates compared to primary appendectomy.

Treating appendicitis implies understanding acute appendicitis as a spectrum of disease, ranging from mild spontaneous resolution cases (up to 20%) through perforation and generalized peritonitis. The actual challenge is distinguishing patients who will spontaneously resolve the inflammatory state from those who will develop complications such as gangrene, abscess, perforation, and peritonitis. Some studies attempt to determine the risk factors for complicated appendicitis. The main risk factors associated with complicated appendicitis are clinical factors (i.e. male sex, age ≥ 60 years, and onset of symptoms) and laboratorial indicators (i.e. leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and bilirubin). Imaging investigations may improve diagnosis, avoiding conservative treatment of patients with complicated appendicitis.

Regarding medical management for acute appendicitis, specifically in the context of nonoperative management for complicated disease, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend considering nonoperative management with antibiotics. Furthermore, percutaneous drainage should be performed, if available, in patients with complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess, particularly when laparoscopic expertise is not available.

### Twenty-four hour versus extended antibiotic administration after surgery in complicated appendicitis: A randomized controlled trial [^1154BYhd]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recent investigations have noted the noninferiority of short-course antimicrobial treatments following source control in abdominal infections. We aimed to investigate the noninferiority of a short and fixed (24 hours) antibiotic administration compared to extended treatment after source control in complicated appendicitis. This study was conducted as a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, all consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with complicated appendicitis, including gangrenous appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and appendicitis with periappendicular abscess, were randomly allocated between May 2016 and February 2018. They received antibacterial therapy for either 24 hours (short) or more than 24 hours (extended) after appendectomy. The primary outcomes included composite postoperative complications and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). A secondary outcome was the hospital length of stay (HLOS). Follow-up analysis at 1 month was conducted according to both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

- **Results**: A total of 80 patients were enrolled, with 39 allocated to the short therapy group and 41 to the extended therapy group. The demographic profile and disease severity were similar between the groups. The overall rate of complications was 17.9% in the short group and 29.3% in the extended group (p = 0.23). The mean CCI did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.29). The hospital length of stay was significantly reduced in the short therapy group (61 ± 34 hours vs. 81 ± 40 hours, p = 0.005).

- **Conclusion**: The study demonstrated that short-course antibiotic treatment of 24 hours was noninferior to an extended antibiotic treatment in terms of postoperative complications and resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay.

### Antibiotic duration after laparoscopic appendectomy for acute complicated appendicitis [^112kJtNj]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment to reduce infectious complications after an appendectomy for acute complicated appendicitis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of antibiotic duration on infectious complications following laparoscopic appendectomy for acute complicated appendicitis.

Conducted in June and July 2014, this national multicenter prospective, observational, surgical resident-led cohort study involved academic teaching hospitals (n = 8), community teaching hospitals (n = 38), and community non-teaching hospitals (n = 16). The study included all consecutive patients (n = 1975) who underwent surgery for suspected acute appendicitis.

Patients treated laparoscopically had their antibiotic regimens prolonged postoperatively due to complicated appendicitis. The main outcomes and measures focused on receiving either 3 or 5 days of antibiotic treatment, with additional variables explored as risk factors for infectious complications using regression analyses.

A total of 1975 patients were included across 62 participating Dutch hospitals; 1901 (96.3%) of these underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis, with laparoscopy used in 74.4% of patients (n = 1415). In 415 laparoscopically treated patients, antibiotic treatment was continued for more than 24 hours due to acute complicated appendicitis (29.3%). The prescribed antibiotic duration varied between 2 and 6 days across these patients, and in 123 patients (29.6%), the length of treatment was adjusted.

This trial demonstrated that 2 days of postoperative IV antibiotics for complex appendicitis offers statistically significant savings in overall societal costs compared to 5 days. These savings derive mainly from reduced hospital admissions. Developing strategies to further restrict postoperative antibiotic use and minimize the length of hospital stay may deliver a substantial reduction in health care costs in the future.

### Five-year follow-up of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in the APPAC randomized clinical trial [^116t2rQ3]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in its support for the short-term efficacy of antibiotics as an alternative to surgery in treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis; however, long-term outcomes remain unknown.

- **Objective**: To determine the late recurrence rate of appendicitis after antibiotic therapy in treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study is a five-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial, which compared appendectomy with antibiotic therapy. The trial included 530 patients aged 18 to 60 years with computed tomography-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis, randomized to undergo an appendectomy (n = 273) or receive antibiotic therapy (n = 257). The initial trial was conducted from November 2009 to June 2012 in Finland, with the last follow-up on September 6, 2017. This analysis focused on assessing the 5-year outcomes for the group of patients treated with antibiotics alone.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included open appendectomy versus antibiotic therapy, which involved intravenous ertapenem for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The prespecified secondary end points reported at the 5-year follow-up included late (after 1 year) appendicitis recurrence after antibiotic treatment, complications, length of hospital stay, and sick leave.

- **Results**: Of the 530 patients enrolled in the trial (201 women; 329 men), 273 patients (median age, 35 years [IQR, 27–46]) were randomized to undergo an appendectomy, and 257 (median age, 33 years [IQR, 26–47]) were randomized to receive antibiotic therapy.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11245jYt]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To compare the safety and efficacy of antibiotic treatment versus appendicectomy for the primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was conducted.

- **Population**: Randomised controlled trials of adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, diagnosed by haematological and radiological investigations.
- **Interventions**: Antibiotic treatment versus appendicectomy.
- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was complications. Secondary outcome measures included the efficacy of treatment, length of stay, and incidence of complicated appendicitis and readmissions.

Four randomised controlled trials, with a total of 900 patients (470 undergoing antibiotic treatment and 430 undergoing appendicectomy), met the inclusion criteria. Antibiotic treatment achieved a 63% (277/438) success rate at one year. Meta-analysis of complications revealed a relative risk reduction of 31% for antibiotic treatment compared with appendicectomy (risk ratio (Mantel-Haenszel, fixed) 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.89; I(2) = 0%; P = 0.004). A secondary analysis, excluding the study with crossover of patients between the two interventions after randomisation, indicated a significant relative risk reduction of 39% for antibiotic therapy (risk ratio 0.61; 0.40 to 0.92; I(2) = 0%; P = 0.02). Of the 65 (20%) patients who had appendicectomy after readmission, nine had perforated appendicitis and four had gangrenous appendicitis. No significant differences were observed for treatment efficacy, length of stay, or risk of developing complicated appendicitis.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^1123URgi]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Participants were prohibited from oral intake for 12 hours in two studies (6%), 24 hours in nine studies (26%), and 48 hours in one study (3%), and were allowed diet as tolerated in seven studies (21%; four pediatric and three adult trials). The diet was unspecified in 15 studies (44%).

Rates of initial clinical response during the index hospitalization were 88% or greater in 27 studies (79%). There were four outlier studies (12%) with rates in the 60% to 70% range. Among 2,944 antibiotic-treated patients, no related deaths or cases of progression to severe sepsis were reported.

Trials differed regarding the time limit to demonstrate improvement before transitioning to appendectomy.

- **Response evaluation within timeframe**: Eight trials (24%) evaluated response within 24 hours, eight (24%) between 24 and 48 hours, five (15%) after 48 to 72 hours, and in 13 (38%), the timeframe was unspecified. Studies also varied in the specific criteria for antibiotic nonresponse. Most trials indicated no improvement or worsening as criteria. Some trials further required an increase in total white blood cell count or C-reactive protein levels, and/or abnormal findings on repeat imaging.

### Response-based therapy for ruptured appendicitis reduces resource utilization [^115u7i5M]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

We examined the effectiveness of a postoperative ruptured appendicitis protocol that eliminated Pseudomonas coverage and based the duration of IV antibiotic treatment and length of hospital stay on the patient's clinical response.

- **Methods**: In our new protocol, IV antibiotics were administered until the patient met discharge criteria: adequate oral intake, pain control with oral medications, and afebrile for 24 hours. We collected data on all patients with ruptured appendicitis at our institution following protocol implementation (May 1, 2012, to April 30, 2013) and compared them to a control group.

- **Results**: 306 patients were treated (154 prior to the protocol, 152 under the new protocol). The new clinical response-based protocol led to a decrease in hospital stay from 134 hours (SD 66.1) to 94.5 hours (SD 61.7) (p < 0.001) and total cost of care per patient also decreased from $13,610 (SD $6859) to $9870 (SD $5670) (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Our clinical response-based protocol for pediatric patients with ruptured appendicitis decreased LOS, cost, and IV antibiotics use without significant changes in adverse events.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^1163o7MT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Using standard pilot-tested forms along with detailed instructions and working in teams of two, reviewers extracted data independently. A clinician–methodologist adjudicator resolved disagreements. Authors were contacted to check the data for accuracy and to provide additional information regarding the original studies when needed.

The following data were extracted: sample size, participants' characteristics, antibiotic regimens, and details of surgical management (laparoscopic or open, any antibiotic use). The outcomes for both treatment groups included major complications at 1 year, such as Clavien–Dindo complication classification grade III or above (conditions requiring endoscopic, radiological, or surgical intervention, or causing organ dysfunction or death), appendiceal perforation, deep infections, incisional hernias, and adhesive bowel obstruction not requiring intervention; minor complications at 1 year, such as superficial wound infections, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort; confirmed or suspected recurrence of appendicitis between 1 month and 1 year; rate of appendicectomy within 1 month of intervention; duration of hospital stay; and duration of sick leave.

In the risk-of-bias assessment, each study was evaluated using a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument according to four criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of data. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at either high or low risk of bias.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^1123RUeD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) after appendectomy has been reported to range from 0 to 11%. The severity of appendicitis strongly influences the risk of developing post-operative complications, resulting in a substantially higher complication rate — up to 2–4 times — in patients with complicated appendicitis. In this specific group, the post-operative administration of antibiotics significantly reduces the rate of SSIs. To reduce bacteremia and sepsis, these patients are uniformly treated with a course of post-operative antibiotics.

In uncomplicated appendicitis, there is no evidence supporting the routine administration of post-operative antibiotics; therefore, only one pre-operative dose is advised. The choice of antibiotics depends on the local microbiome and resistance patterns, and should therefore be left up to the discretion of the surgeon. Available evidence on the duration of treatment is limited and mainly focused on children. However, there is no firm evidence on the duration (3, 5, 7, or 10 days) and route of administration (usually intravenous for 48 hours, followed by oral administration).

### Operation versus antibiotics — the "appendicitis conundrum" continues: a meta-analysis [^114xSNgF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis continues to constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nonoperative versus surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed with respect to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement (end-of-search date: January 29, 2017). Data on the study design, interventions, participants, and outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. The random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used to calculate pooled effect estimates when substantial heterogeneity was encountered; otherwise, the fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) model was implemented. Quality assessment of included RCTs was performed using the modified Jadad scale.

- **Results**: Five RCTs were included in this review. Overall, 1,430 adult patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent either nonoperative (n = 727) or operative management (n = 703). Treatment efficacy at 1-year follow-up was significantly lower (63.8%) for antibiotics compared with the surgery group (93%) (risk ratio [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.77; p < 0.001). Overall complications were significantly higher in the surgery group (166/703 [23.6%]) compared with the antibiotics group (56/727 [7.7%]) (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24–0.43; p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two treatment modalities in terms of perforated appendicitis-related outcomes.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115AzMsj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infections has been extensively debated. Shorter durations of therapy have proven to be as effective as longer durations for many common infections. A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing 3- and ≥ 5-day ertapenem regimens in 111 patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections reported similar cure and eradication rates (93% vs. 90% and 95% vs. 94% for 3- and > 5-day regimens, respectively).

Studies have demonstrated a low likelihood of infection recurrence or treatment failure when antimicrobial therapy is discontinued in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections who no longer show signs of infection. Lennard et al. compared post-operative outcomes in 65 intra-abdominal sepsis patients with and without leukocytosis and fever at the conclusion of antimicrobial therapy. Intra-abdominal sepsis patients at risk for post-operative infection were those who were afebrile with persistent leukocytosis or those who remained febrile after the antibiotics were discontinued.

Hedrick et al. retrospectively analyzed the relationship between the duration of antibiotic therapy and infectious complications, such as reinfection by the same organism or renewed infectious focus at the same anatomical site. In the study, 929 patients with intra-abdominal infections associated with fever or leukocytosis were categorized into quartiles based on either the total duration of antibiotic therapy or the duration of treatment following the resolution of fever and leukocytosis.

- **Statement 7.4**: Postoperative antibiotics after appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children seem to have no role in reducing the rate of surgical site infection.

- **Recommendation 7.4**: In pediatric patients operated on for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, we suggest against using postoperative antibiotic therapy [QoE: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2C].

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^115EsRaw]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The most common total duration of intravenous and oral antibiotics was 7 to 10 days. Four trials (12%) used only a 4-day duration. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for a median of 4 days (i.e. 2 days after symptom resolution) resulted in similar outcomes as treatment for a median of 8 days among patients with intra-abdominal infection. As opposed to conservative management of appendicitis, all patients in the Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy trial had source control. However, among studies of nonoperative treatment of appendicitis, lower initial antibiotic response rates did not appear to be associated with shorter treatment duration, suggesting a shorter antibiotic course may be possible.

Guidelines do not recommend broad-spectrum regimens with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing bacteria for patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections unless antimicrobial resistance risk factors exist, such as recent antimicrobial exposure, past infection with a resistant strain, or high prevalence of resistance in the patient's community or in recent areas of travel. Several trials used broad-spectrum regimens such as piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, which are discouraged by guidelines to promote antibiotic stewardship.

A major limitation of most past trials is the absence of any specific pain control protocol or description of the extent to which pain control was achieved.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^111M8U8b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Primary appendectomy is the standard of care for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but interest in conservative treatment with antibiotics alone has been increasing in recent years. Clinical trials so far have shown controversial results.

- **Methods**: A series of meta-analyses were reviewed. Studies comparing surgery versus antibiotics alone for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults were included. Descriptive statistics and data on treatment effects were retrieved and summarized.

- **Results**: The conservative approach has a success rate of around 60% and is associated with shorter pain duration, reduced analgesic medication, faster resolution of the inflammation process, lower expenses, and a quicker return to work. On the other hand, medical treatment leads to high (up to 20%) readmission rates and more often requires surgery. An operative approach is associated with higher treatment success rates (> 90%) and a very low mortality rate.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the body of evidence, the use of antibiotics for primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis cannot be routinely recommended. Appendectomy remains the gold-standard treatment.

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials [^1156TaFe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. We have exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1-year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL), and costs.

- **Results**: Eight RCTs involving 3,213 participants (1,615 antibiotics/1,598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61–1.04, P = 0.07, I² = 69%). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I² = 87%) and at 1 year was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I² = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference −0.58 days; 95% confidence interval −1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I² = 99%). The trial sequential analysis has revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter the current evidence.

### 2 days versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotics for complex appendicitis: a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised trial [^1177hEAT]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

The study APPIC was published by Elisabeth M. L. de Wijkerslooth and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following disease: acute appendicitis. The APPIC study investigated whether a short 2-day course of postoperative antibiotics is noninferior to a standard 5-day course in patients with complex appendicitis.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, open-label, RCT.
- **Population**: 1,005 patients.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged ≥ 8 years with complex appendicitis.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: No informed consent; interval appendectomy; clinical suspicion of severe sepsis; conservative treatment of acute appendicitis; immunocompromised state; pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Short 2-day course (n = 502)**: Intravenous cefuroxime/metronidazole 1,500/500 mg TID or ceftriaxone/metronidazole once daily 2,000 mg/TID 500 mg for 48 hours according to local antibiotic policy.
	- **Standard 5-day course (n = 503)**: Intravenous cefuroxime/metronidazole 1,500/500 mg TID or ceftriaxone/metronidazole once daily 2,000 mg/TID 500 mg for 5 days according to local antibiotic policy.

- **Primary outcome**: Difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of infectious complications and death within 90 days (10% vs. 8%; AD 2%, 95% CI -1.6 to 5.6).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in hospital readmission (12% vs. 6%; OR 2.135, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.4).
	- Significant decrease in adverse effects of antibiotics (9% vs. 22%; OR 0.344, 95% CI).

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES Jerusalem guidelines [^111KDH5G]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute appendicitis, particularly in pediatric patients, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend switching to oral postoperative antibiotics early, after 48 hours. This recommendation is for pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis, and the overall length of therapy should be less than 7 days.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^111o8Fvp]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

There is no single evidence-based antibiotic treatment strategy for uncomplicated or perforated appendicitis, particularly because there is no indisputable evidence for any optimal antimicrobial therapy after surgery for appendicitis in children. Despite a marked decline in associated mortality during the past 50 years, perforation and complication rates remain unchanged because they are strongly influenced by factors untouched by intervening therapeutic advances. Scant data exist about the optimal duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment, while it is important to treat patients with adequate antimicrobial therapy and avoid overtreatment.

Some authors advocate a predefined duration of antimicrobial treatment, whereas others discontinue antibiotics based on the patient's clinical signs irrespective of the therapy's length. Unfortunately, studies investigating antibiotic regimens, including the duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment, often involve children with perforated as well as gangrenous appendicitis, assembling a different population with a lower rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. The recently published guidelines from the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society for antimicrobial therapy in children recommend that, regarding perforated appendicitis, treatment duration should be based on the patient's response to treatment. Intravenous therapy should be continued until the patient is afebrile and has normal white blood cell counts — in brief, shows no symptoms.
