## Question

Ursodiol for acute diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid) has any role in treating acute diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and pharmacology of ursodiol. Then, I should review the pathophysiology of diverticulitis to assess any mechanistic rationale. Next, I will examine major society guidelines for acute diverticulitis management to see if ursodiol appears anywhere. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion about clinical use, including standard-of-care alternatives and any preventive strategies that are evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the labeled uses of ursodiol, because if the indication or pharmacology obviously diverges from colonic inflammatory disease, that already points away from use in diverticulitis. The FDA labeling specifies ursodiol for dissolution of radiolucent, noncalcified gallbladder stones less than 20 mm and for prevention of gallstone formation during rapid weight loss; there is no mention of diverticulitis as a labeled or described use, and the therapeutic action is in the liver, bile, and gut lumen within the enterohepatic circulation rather than the colon wall pathology of diverticulitis [^115BkwmM] [^113w5yL1].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic target in diverticulitis before I conclude there is no plausible rationale. Diverticulitis reflects inflammation and often microperforation of colonic diverticula, typically triggered by fecalith obstruction, bacterial overgrowth, and transmural inflammatory response; the dominant therapeutic targets are infection control and inflammatory complications, not cholesterol solubilization or bile acid pool modification, so ursodiol's mechanism does not map to the drivers of disease progression or resolution in acute diverticulitis [^113NWVLs].

> Hold on, I should confirm what contemporary guidelines actually recommend for acute diverticulitis, because if ursodiol were relevant it would likely appear in consensus statements. AGA 2021 and ACP 2022 support selective, not routine, antibiotic use for immunocompetent patients with mild uncomplicated disease; they recommend antibiotics for complicated disease and higher-risk presentations, with CT imaging to confirm diagnosis or assess severity and complications; ASCRS and WSES recommendations align on risk-stratified antibiotic use and procedural escalation when abscess or peritonitis is present, and none of these guidelines incorporate ursodiol in diagnostic or therapeutic pathways [^111PGekX] [^111FL5kK] [^116P5YkJ] [^116URQ3o] [^1174RrCX].

> I need to check supportive care and disposition guidance as well, in case non-antibiotic measures are emphasized and whether bile-acid agents show up there; but again, I suspect not. Supportive care for uncomplicated presentations includes a clear liquid diet with advancement as tolerated and outpatient management in carefully selected, clinically stable patients; emergency medicine and gastroenterology literature emphasize safety of outpatient care with close follow-up in appropriate patients, without any role for bile acid therapy such as ursodiol [^115kUeHR] [^1144uKss] [^115XUUdp].

> Next, I should review agents studied for prevention of recurrent diverticulitis to see if ursodiol has been evaluated there. Let me double-check the secondary prevention literature: AGA recommends against mesalamine for recurrence prevention, evidence for rifaximin is mixed and methodologically limited, and fiber-rich diet or supplementation is suggested for those with a history of diverticulitis; notably, ursodiol is absent from preventive pharmacotherapy discussions across guidelines and reviews [^1166BgQz] [^112Sfuqw] [^1164Qsgz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could there be any off-target anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial effects of ursodiol that might be relevant to the colon that I am overlooking? Ursodiol's pharmacokinetics show primary hepatic extraction, conjugation, biliary secretion, and cycling with only small systemic levels; while there is some bacterial modification in the gut, the labeled and described therapeutic sites are liver and bile ducts with action on bile composition, not colonic mucosal immunity or luminal antimicrobial activity, making a mechanistic benefit in diverticulitis unlikely based on available pharmacology and absence from disease-specific guidance [^113w5yL1] [^111PGekX] [^116URQ3o].

> But wait, what if there are rare or emerging reports outside guidelines? I should confirm within the provided references whether any clinical studies, observational cohorts, or case series evaluate ursodiol for diverticulitis. I see no randomized trials, cohort studies, or case reports in the provided material supporting ursodiol for treatment or prevention of diverticulitis, whereas multiple RCTs and meta-analyses inform the selective omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated disease and risk-stratified escalation for complicated cases, reinforcing that bile acid therapy has no established place here [^115GJJpx] [^112Ayosi] [^112NPuGT].

> I will now synthesize the clinical implications. I should confirm that for uncomplicated disease in immunocompetent patients, observation with supportive care is reasonable, and antibiotics are indicated for complicated presentations or higher-risk phenotypes; surgical consultation and source control are indicated for abscesses or generalized peritonitis, with percutaneous drainage considered for larger abscesses; none of these steps involve ursodiol at any point in the care pathway [^1174RrCX] [^113sdRcJ] [^117H9Cyy].

> Final judgment, after self-checking across labeling, mechanism, pathophysiology, and guidelines: Ursodiol has no role in the management of acute diverticulitis, either as treatment during acute episodes or as prevention of recurrence; its approved indications pertain to gallstone dissolution and prevention during rapid weight loss, and its mechanism does not address the inflammatory or infectious drivers of diverticulitis; standard care should follow evidence-based guidelines with selective antibiotics, supportive diet, appropriate imaging, and surgical or interventional radiology input for complications, while preventive strategies should prioritize lifestyle and fiber and avoid mesalamine, with no evidence to support bile acid therapy such as ursodiol for this condition [^115BkwmM] [^111PGekX] [^111FL5kK] [^1166BgQz] [^1164Qsgz].

---

Ursodiol is **not indicated for acute diverticulitis** and should not be used for its management. No evidence supports **ursodiol for diverticulitis**, and it is not included in any guideline for this condition. Standard care is supportive management, with selective antibiotics [^114tSnhe] reserved for complicated or high-risk cases [^116t3h3t], and ursodiol should be avoided given its lack of efficacy and potential adverse effects.

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical indications of ursodiol

Ursodiol is a hydrophilic bile acid that reduces cholesterol saturation in bile, stabilizes hepatocyte membranes, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects in cholestatic liver disease [^113w5yL1]. It is **FDA-approved** for:

- **Gallstone dissolution**: Radiolucent, non-calcified cholesterol gallstones in patients who are poor surgical candidates or refuse surgery [^115BkwmM].

- **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**: To improve liver biochemistry and slow disease progression.

- **Prevention of gallstones**: In patients undergoing rapid weight loss [^115BkwmM].

Ursodiol is **not approved or recommended** for acute diverticulitis.

---

## Pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis

Acute diverticulitis is **inflammation of colonic diverticula**, typically due to microperforation, bacterial translocation, and localized infection [^113NWVLs]. Management focuses on controlling inflammation, preventing complications, and reducing recurrence [^111wPfNc].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for acute diverticulitis management

Major society **guidelines** (AGA, ASCRS, ACP, WSES) recommend:

- **Uncomplicated diverticulitis**: Supportive care (clear liquids [^115kUeHR], analgesia) [^111FL5kK]; selective antibiotics [^114tSnhe] for immunocompromised [^112GtzkF], severe symptoms, or high inflammatory markers [^111j4YAs].

- **Complicated diverticulitis**: Antibiotics [^117H9Cyy], possible percutaneous drainage [^116VYm5s], and surgical consultation [^111TYn2T].

- **No role for ursodiol**: Ursodiol is not mentioned or recommended in any guideline for acute diverticulitis.

---

## Evidence regarding ursodiol in acute diverticulitis

There is **no clinical evidence** (RCTs, observational studies, or case reports) supporting the use of ursodiol for acute diverticulitis. Its pharmacological actions do not address bacterial infection or colonic inflammation, which are central to diverticulitis [^113w5yL1].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of ursodiol

Ursodiol is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects** include:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia.

- **Hepatic effects**: Rare elevations in liver enzymes.

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity.

These risks are **unjustified** given the absence of benefit in diverticulitis.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard treatments (supportive care, selective antibiotics, surgery when indicated) are evidence-based and guideline-supported [^111TYn2T]. Ursodiol lacks evidence and is **not recommended**, so it is inferior to standard care.

---

## Clinical scenarios where ursodiol might be considered

There are **no clinical scenarios** in which ursodiol is appropriate for acute diverticulitis. Its use should be limited to approved indications (gallstone dissolution, PBC, prevention of gallstones in rapid weight loss) [^115BkwmM].

---

## Ongoing research or clinical trials

There are **no ongoing trials** or studies evaluating ursodiol for acute diverticulitis.

---

Ursodiol is **not indicated for acute diverticulitis** and lacks supporting evidence or guideline endorsement. Management should follow established guidelines; ursodiol should be avoided in this context.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this clinical practice update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for the management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices.

In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients.

To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first episode of acute diverticulitis.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^1151qznQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis.

Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older Western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here.

The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^117Nn3fY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Alternative therapies**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the development rate of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal, but it carries a high risk in some patients. Approximately 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies with age and the presence of other diseases besides cholelithiasis. Women in good health or with only moderate systemic disease and under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); in contrast, men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

### Emergency medicine updates: Acute diverticulitis [^115XUUdp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

- **Objective**: This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

- **Discussion**: Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Changes in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^1118rQkH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have recently assessed the role of mesalazine in treating patients. The first trial investigated the efficacy and safety of mesalazine granules 3 g/day vs. placebo in patients with lower abdominal pain as a symptom of SUDD. The change in lower abdominal pain to week 4 (baseline defined using pain score from 7 days pre-treatment) was significantly lower in the mesalazine group (P = 0.05) in the per-protocol (PP) but not in the intention-to-treat (P = 0.374) population. Post hoc adjustment for confounding factors resulted in P = 0.005 (PP). Safety was comparable.

The second trial assessed the effectiveness of mesalazine, with or without probiotic, vs. placebo in maintaining remission in SUDD patients. Four groups were randomly enrolled:

- **Group M**: Active mesalazine 1.6 g/day plus Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) subsp. DG placebo
- **Group L**: Active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus mesalazine placebo
- **Group LM**: Active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus active mesalazine
- **Group P**: L. casei subsp. DG placebo plus mesalazine placebo

SUDD recurred in none (0%) of the patients in group LM, in 7 (13.7%) patients in group M, in 8 (14.5%) patients in group L, and in 23 (46.0%) patients in group P (LM group vs. M group, P = 0.015; LM group vs. L group, P = 0.011; LM group vs. P group, P = 0.000; M group vs. P group, P = 0.0001; L group vs. P group, P = 0.0001). No adverse events were recorded during the study. Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial not yet published assessed the efficacy of mesalazine in controlling abdominal pain in S.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^113uymya]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Several national and international guidelines on acute diverticulitis have been published in recent years. The recommendations in these guidelines are conflicting, and the evidence on which they are based differs. Most of the guidelines (6 of 8) recommend routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis to rule out malignancy. However, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests that previous colonoscopies, co‐morbidities, persistent symptoms, and patients' preferences may influence the decision.

The scientific grounds for the recommendations in these six guidelines are noteworthy. The AGA and German guidelines are based on a previous systematic review, whereas two other guidelines used only two observational studies. An Italian guideline published in 2015 stated that evidence‐based data were not available. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons made strong recommendations based on studies with a low quality of evidence. They based their recommendation for routine colonoscopy mainly on studies that assessed the risk of malignancy in a selected group of patients with signs suggestive of malignancy, such as colonic wall thickening or mass on CT.

Two guidelines recommend not performing routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis. Of these, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommends omitting colonoscopy only in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. The fact that the AGA and WSES guidelines make opposite recom…

### Acute diverticulitis: Key features for guiding clinical management [^111MoAL8]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon and small bowel is an important cause of pathology leading to emergency department visits and urgent gastrointestinal surgery. CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for diagnosing acute diverticulitis and its complications, as well as for excluding alternate causes of pathology. Ultrasound, MRI, and virtual CT colonoscopy have important adjunct roles in screening and the workup of complications in specific patient populations.

While diverticular disease most commonly involves the descending and sigmoid colon, it can also affect the proximal colon and small bowel. Acute diverticulitis may be categorized as uncomplicated or complicated according to the degree of inflammatory changes and related complications it induces, although some degree of overlap exists in clinical practice. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is classically characterized by localized inflammation surrounding a diverticulum, ranging from wall thickening and phlegmonous change to the development of small, localized pericolic abscesses. Complicated forms of the disease manifest with larger pericolic and distant abscesses, fistulae to adjacent organs, perforation, and peritonitis.

Recurrent episodes of diverticulitis may lead to muscular hypertrophy of the bowel wall and luminal narrowing, potentially leading to bowel obstruction. Several imaging features may help differentiate diverticulitis from colonic malignancy; however, this remains a diagnostic imaging challenge that often requires further evaluation with colonoscopy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and clinical management of diverticulitis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112tbaLB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

A more recent systematic review summarized the evidence from studies that tested the effectiveness of mesalazine in preventing the recurrence of acute diverticulitis episodes. Authors identified six randomized trials comparing treatment with mesalazine in various doses and schedules of administration versus placebo, involving a total of 1,898 participants. The meta-analysis of the six RCTs found a summary OR of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92–1.44) for diverticulitis recurrence with mesalazine. No dose–effect relationship was documented. In the same systematic review, four RCTs reported time to relapse, but with conflicting results. Parente et al. reported worse outcomes with mesalazine: patients treated with mesalazine 1.6 g/day (10 days per month) had a shorter mean time to relapse than patients treated with placebo [MD, −151 days (95% CI: −366 to −66 days)]. The other three studies found no statistically significant differences between mesalazine and placebo.

The role of mesalazine in the prevention of diverticulitis recurrence was also investigated in a few non-randomized studies. The two observational studies previously discussed, comparing mesalazine versus rifaximin, produced conflicting results.

In another study on 218 patients, the combination of mesalazine and rifaximin (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days/month) was shown to be more effective than rifaximin alone (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid for 7 days).

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^113w5yL1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

About 90% of a therapeutic dose of ursodiol is absorbed in the small bowel after oral administration. Following absorption, ursodiol enters the portal vein and undergoes efficient extraction from portal blood by the liver, exhibiting a significant "first-pass" effect. In the liver, it is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Ursodiol in bile is concentrated in the gallbladder and expelled into the duodenum in gallbladder bile via the cystic and common ducts due to gallbladder contractions provoked by physiological responses to eating. Only small quantities of ursodiol appear in the systemic circulation, and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The sites of the drug's therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen.

Beyond conjugation, ursodiol is not altered or catabolized appreciably by the liver or intestinal mucosa. A small proportion of orally administered drug undergoes bacterial degradation with each cycle of enterohepatic circulation. Ursodiol can be both oxidized and reduced at the 7-carbon, yielding either 7-keto-lithocholic acid or lithocholic acid, respectively. Further, there is some bacterially catalyzed deconjugation of glyco- and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid in the small bowel. Free ursodiol, 7-keto-lithocholic acid, and lithocholic acid are relatively insoluble in aqueous media. Larger proportions of these compounds are lost from the distal gut into the feces. Reabsorbed free ursodiol is reconjugated by the liver. Eighty percent of lithocholic acid formed in the small bowel is excreted.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: A scoping review [^112Sfuqw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The medical treatment in patients with previous diverticulitis, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, involves various therapies.

- **Rifaximin**: The role of rifaximin in the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis has been evaluated in a few studies, most of them non-randomized. In a multicenter, randomized open-label study conducted on 165 patients with a recent diagnosis of acute diverticulitis, the combination of rifaximin (400 mg twice a day for 7 days a month) and fibers (3.5 g/day) was demonstrated to be more effective than fibers alone in preventing recurrence at 48 weeks (10.4% versus 19.0%). In multivariable analysis, the risk of relapse for the fiber supplement-only group compared with the supplement plus rifaximin group was 2.64 (HR; 95% CI: 1.08–6.46; p = 0.033). Regarding gastrointestinal symptoms, no improvements were shown at 48 weeks in either group.

In a retrospective study on patients with a previous acute diverticulitis episode, 72 subjects treated with rifaximin were compared with 52 subjects treated with mesalazine. During a median follow-up of 15 months, the risk of diverticulitis recurrence was 73% lower (HR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10–0.72) with rifaximin, administered at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for 10 days per month.

In another controlled, non-randomized study, patients with an acute episode of diverticulitis, once remission was achieved, were treated with mesalazine 1.6 g/day (59 patients) or with rifaximin 800 mg/day for 7 days a month (52 patients). The probability of maintaining clinical remission at 24 months was significantly higher in the mesalazine group (p = 0.002).

The paucity of RCTs and the major methodological issues in existing studies highlight the need for more robust research in this area.

### Outpatient treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^113o6Ku8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Traditionally, treatment of acute diverticulitis has mostly been based on inpatient care. The question arises whether these patients can be treated on an outpatient basis, as admissions for diverticular disease have been shown to increase every year. We studied whether outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is feasible and safe, and which patients could benefit from outpatient care.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in two teaching hospitals using hospital registry codes for diverticulitis. All patients diagnosed with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis between January 2004 and January 2012, confirmed by imaging or colonoscopy, were included. Exclusion criteria included patients with recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis (Hinchey stages 2, 3, and 4), and right-sided diverticulitis. Inpatient care was compared with outpatient care. The primary outcome was admission for outpatient care and the complication rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify potential factors for inpatient care.

- **Results**: Of 627 patients with diverticulitis, a total of 312 consecutive patients were identified with primary uncomplicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon. Among them, 194 patients had been treated as inpatients, and 118 patients were treated primarily as outpatients. In the outpatient group, 91.5% were treated successfully without diverticulitis-related complications or the need for hospital admission during a mean follow-up period of 48 months.

Despite inherent patient selection in a retrospective cohort study, these findings suggest that outpatient care for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis may be a viable and safe alternative for selected patients.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113yJpdz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with or without antibiotics does not rely on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favor of using antibiotics and reasons for omitting them should be considered. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, or sigmoid resection and is, therefore, a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be minimized to reduce the global threat of rising microbial resistance and prevent antibiotic-related morbidity (8.3 percent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Ultimately, individual-patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision-making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcomes — such as high pain scores, high white blood cell counts, and a history of acute diverticulitis — no beneficial role for antibiotics in preventing such adverse outcomes was found.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: A 5-year review [^115G3cS9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management of uncomplicated diverticulitis involves evaluating the need for antibiotics. For at least a decade, the use of antibiotics during an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis has been challenged. Several well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide Level I evidence and inform numerous society recommendations regarding the omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this approach has not gained as much traction in American populations as it has in the European populations where it was originally studied.

The AVOD trial, initially published in 2012, followed Swedish patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who were randomized to treatment with or without antibiotics. Neither the initial study nor the recent long-term follow-up published in 2019 suggested any differences in outcomes between the two groups. At a median follow-up of 11 years, similar rates of recurrence, surgery, and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) were observed in both groups.

The Dutch Diverticular Disease (3D) Study Group published the DIABOLO RCT in 2017, which also suggested the safety of avoiding antibiotic therapy in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. At six months, no significant differences were found in days to recovery, recurrence, readmission rates, or mortality, among other endpoints. Their 24-month follow-up published in 2018 supported this conclusion.

Despite solid evidence refuting the routine use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis, controversy remains. A 2018 joint survey of members of the society indicated ongoing debate on the issue.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^114jzNeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology two decades ago. Guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies as suggested United States of America guidelines. In reality, these guidelines reflect practices at Yale New Haven hospitals in Connecticut.

The epidemiology and pathophysiology are described in detail. Diverticulitis is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease that results in high intracolonic pressure, leading to the outpocketing of diverticula at the weakest points of the colon at sites of vascular penetration, with developing elastin deposition in the colon wall. Age and gender distribution details indicate they are most common in the sigmoid colon.

Management guidelines are based on the accepted classification of the disease at all stages. This includes onset, early formation, mild disease, complicated disease, and rare specific states. The outcomes and mortality associated with these stages are discussed.

### Treatment of diverticular disease of the colon and prevention of acute diverticulitis: A systematic review [^116zJ56o]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disorder characterized by symptoms and complications such as diverticulitis, which often require hospital admissions and surgery. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for medical therapy of diverticular disease in reducing symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and Embase databases (1966 to February 2010).

- **Study selection**: The studies selected were prospective clinical trials on uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon.

- **Interventions**: Four investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality according to standardized criteria.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes measured were improvement in symptoms, complete remission of symptoms, and prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Results indicated that 31 studies were identified, including 6 placebo-controlled trials. The methodological quality of these studies was suboptimal. Only 10 trials provided a detailed description of patient history, while 8 assessed symptoms using a validated questionnaire. Furthermore, 14 studies appropriately defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only one long-term double-blind placebo-controlled study was identified, which reported a significant improvement in symptoms and a greater prevalence of symptom-free patients at 1 year with fiber plus rifaximin compared to fiber alone. The efficacy of treatment in preventing acute diverticulitis was evaluated in 11 randomized trials. Four trials compared rifaximin plus fiber vs. fiber alone and failed to show a distinct advantage for the combination therapy.

### Risk of recurrent disease and surgery following an admission for acute diverticulitis [^115gK8Bn]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease accounts for significant morbidity and mortality and may manifest as episodes of acute diverticulitis. The role of elective surgery is not clearly defined. This study aimed to define the rate of hospital admission for acute diverticulitis recurrence and risk factors associated with recurrence and surgery.

- **Design**: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study.
- **Settings**: National Health Service hospital admissions for acute diverticulitis in England between April 2006 and March 2011 were reviewed.
- **Patients**: Hospital Episode Statistics data identified adult patients with the first episode of acute diverticulitis (index admission) and then identified readmissions and elective or emergency surgery for acute diverticulitis over a minimum follow-up period of 4 years. Exclusion criteria included previous diagnoses of acute diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, or GI bleeding, and prior colectomy or surgery or death during the index admission.
- **Interventions**: There were no interventions.
- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were readmissions for acute diverticulitis and patients requiring either elective or emergency surgery during the study period.

Results indicated that 65,162 patients were identified with the first episode of acute diverticulitis. The rate of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis was 11.2%. A logistic regression model examined factors associated with recurrent acute diverticulitis and surgery, including patient age, female sex, smoking, obesity, and comorbidity score.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diverticulitis, particularly concerning endoscopic follow-up in uncomplicated cases, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a colonoscopy following a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. This decision should be based on the patient's history, the most recent colonoscopy, and the severity and course of the disease. It is advised to consider deferring colonoscopy if a high-quality examination was performed within the past year, or to perform it sooner if alarm symptoms are present.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^117LCw2H]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A prospective, single-arm study overviewed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (non-antibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic gas. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. The primary outcome measure of the study was to find the incidence of complicated diverticulitis. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but 2 days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%) patients (6 orally, 8 intravenously).

A recent Dutch randomized controlled trial of observational versus systemic antibiotic treatment (DIABOLO trial) for a first episode of CT-proven acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (ALCD) Hinchey stages 1a and 1b confirmed that observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and could be considered appropriate in these patients.

This study included 22 clinical sites involving 528 patients; Hinchey modified stages 1a (confined pericolic inflammation or phlegmon) to 1b (pericolic or mesocolic abscess) and Ambrosetti's "mild/moderate" diverticulitis stage confirmed within 24 hours by CT were included. Patients with previous diverticulitis, higher Hinchey stages, or "severe" diverticulitis on Ambrosetti's classification were excluded. The antibiotic treatment was a 10-day course of IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 1200 mg four times daily for at least 48 hours.

### SAGES white paper on antibiotic omission in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: why, when, who, and most importantly, how [^115MqEkG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Historically, the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was centered on antibiotics. However, modern theories regarding the pathogenesis of diverticulitis have challenged the notion that antibiotics are necessary in all cases. Despite major reform in many societal guidelines, the adoption of non-antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis has been limited, especially in North America. The purpose of this SAGES White Paper was to review the available evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis and to explore methods of safe implementation.

- **Methods**: A task force within the SAGES Colorectal Surgery Committee was formed to work on this White Paper. The committee and its leadership approved an outline that would focus on the following topics:
	1. Defining the problem with unnecessary antibiotic exposure.
	2. Evaluating the evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis.
	3. Identifying the appropriate patient for antibiotic omission.
	4. Outlining how to counsel patients who are treated without antibiotics.
	5. Reviewing methods to safely implement this practice in both the hospital and community setting.

	- These topics were divided up among members of the task force, who performed a structured literature search in preparation for their assignments.

- **Results**: Antibiotics are associated with several patient and societal adverse effects, including the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no superiority to the routine administration of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^115egEyg]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This Delphi study provides a consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research.

- **Objective**: To generate an international, expert-based consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top five acute diverticulitis experts in five international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

- **Interventions**: The Delphi study used three rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis was developed.

- **Results**: Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following three rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. Additionally, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis.

In conclusion, controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: A scoping review [^115fXx7s]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

No additional studies following the publication of the two systematic reviews were identified, nor were studies on lifestyle interventions. The lack of intervention studies evaluating the effects of smoking cessation or body weight reduction/physical activity promotion on diverticular disease (DD) certainly falls among the unmet needs linked to the management of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). In fact, although epidemiological studies suggest an important protective role of lifestyle habits on the risk of DD, no study conducted on SUDD patients is available.

Overall, epidemiological studies indirectly provide a rationale for assessing the efficacy of lifestyle interventions to prevent DD complications even in SUDD patients.

- **Medical treatment in patients with SUDD, without previous diverticulitis**:

	- **Rifaximin**: It has been proposed that gut microbiota imbalance is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying symptomatic DD. On this basis, rifaximin, a broad-spectrum non-absorbable antibiotic, has been tested as a possible treatment for symptom relief in DD.

In a systematic review, Maconi et al. examined the evidence regarding the role of medical therapy in reducing symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis. Overall, 31 prospective clinical studies were analyzed, which presented high heterogeneity in study design, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics, treatment regimens, and combinations and outcome type. This heterogeneity precluded quantitative synthesis of the results, limiting their interpretation.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^117LyXok]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence rates of acute diverticulitis have been increasing rapidly over recent decades. Acute diverticulitis has traditionally been associated with an increased risk of colorectal malignancy, which has led to routine colonic evaluation by colonoscopy after the episode of acute diverticulitis has resolved. However, a causal association between colonic diverticulitis or diverticulosis and malignancy has never been found. The association is most likely explained by misdiagnosis of colorectal malignancy as acute diverticulitis. The fact that acute diverticulitis used to be diagnosed based on the clinical picture or barium enemas, and later on by ultrasonography, probably increased the number of misdiagnoses and thereby played a role in establishing the association between acute diverticulitis and colorectal malignancy. CT has a higher accuracy for the detection of an alternative diagnosis such as colorectal carcinoma. If this were accurate enough, colonoscopy would not be needed in every patient, thereby reducing the healthcare burden and colonoscopy‐related morbidity.

Even though the risk of colorectal carcinoma in patients with acute diverticulitis has been the topic of debate in multiple studies, there remains a lack of clarity. The majority of guidelines still recommend routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis. The objective of this review was to assess the role of colonoscopy in patients with CT‐proven acute diverticulitis in detecting colorectal carcinoma.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^112MyQaU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Data on the role of fiber in the primary prevention of diverticulitis are particularly conflicting. Patients with a history of diverticulosis or diverticular disease (DD) commonly seek dietary and lifestyle recommendations to reduce their risk of occurrence, recurrence of the disease, and complications. The traditional recommendation has been to consume a high-fiber diet. Using data from a single case-control study that included 56 participants, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the number of complications by 52 cases per 1000 patients treated and the need for surgery by 100 cases per 1000 patients treated.

Based on a prospective cohort study that examined the association of dietary fiber intake and risk of incident hospitalization for DD, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet may reduce the risk of acute diverticulitis by 59 cases per 1000 patients. We rated the quality of this evidence as very low based on substantial differences between our target population (those with a history of diverticulitis) and those in the cohort study (those without a history of diverticulitis).

Only three randomized trials analyzed the role of fiber in preventing diverticulitis occurrence in these patients. Unfortunately, the sample size of these trials was far too small to demonstrate a significant effect of high-fiber supplementation on the prevention of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis or other complications of DD, such as abscess, perforation, stenosis, fistula, or bleeding.

In addition, a further double-blind placebo-controlled RCT not included in the previous systematic review included 120 SUDD patients treated for 3 months with (i) supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus plantarum (1 ml/kg/day) or (ii) placebo. Alteration of bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea), mucorrhea, and back pain were significantly reduced in patients supplemented with probiotics, but the reduction of abdominal pain was similar between groups.

A reduction in abdominal swelling and pain in subjects with SUDD is associated with the use of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Bifidobacterium spp. 420, or Lactobacillus paracasei, has been documented in non-randomized studies or small RCTs.

Overall, the evidence supporting the role of probiotics in SUDD is based on small, heterogeneous studies of generally poor methodological quality. Furthermore, existing studies were mainly focused on symptoms, and there is a substantial lack of information regarding the possible role of probiotics in reducing the risk of diverticulitis.

- **Dietary and lifestyle interventions in patients with previous diverticulitis with or without GI symptoms**: Evidence regarding the role of fiber intake in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis is scant.

Despite low-quality and conflicting evidence, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland recommends the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Recent studies have shown that treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery. Some new guidelines currently recommend selective use of antibiotics.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare the safety, effectiveness, and outcomes of treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library were searched with the keywords "antibiotics" and "diverticulitis".

- **Study selection**: All studies published in English on treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics and containing more than 20 individuals were included.

- **Intervention**: Treatment without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics were compared.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention during the initial episode. The secondary outcomes were the duration of hospital stay, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, and complications.

- **Results**: The search yielded 1164 studies. Nine studies were eligible and included in the meta-analysis, comprising 2505 patients, with 1663 treated without antibiotics and 842 treated with an antibiotic. The no-antibiotics group had a significantly shorter hospital stay.

### Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review [^1144uKss]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis occurs in up to 25% of patients with diverticulosis. The majority of cases are mild or uncomplicated, making it a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency department. On the basis of the National Inpatient Sample database from the United States, 86% of patients admitted with diverticulitis were treated with medical therapy. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that outpatient treatment with antibiotics is safe and effective.

The aim of this systematic review is to update the evidence published on the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines and searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for all English-language articles on the management of acute diverticulitis using the following search terms: 'diverticulitis', 'outpatient', and 'uncomplicated'. Data were extracted independently by two investigators.

A total of 11 articles were reviewed in full: one randomized controlled trial, eight prospective cohort studies, and two retrospective cohort studies. The success rate of outpatient treatment, characterized by no further complications, ranged from 91.5% to 100%. Fewer than 8% of patients required hospital readmission. Intolerance to oral intake and lack of family or social support are common exclusion criteria used for this approach, whereas severe comorbidities are not definitive exclusion criteria in all the studies. Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective, and economically efficient when applied properly.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^114AzAtg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens as per Recommendation 2C.

The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is controversial within the medical community. In 2011, a systematic review was published that overviewed antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis were sparse and of poor methodological quality, with no concrete evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently, a prospective multicenter randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The study found that antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence.

However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms. Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis depends on the condition and compliance of the patient, as well as their availability for follow-up analysis. The treatment involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens and should be tailored based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.

Another systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of routine colonic evaluation after radiologically confirmed acute diverticulitis was published in 2014. Eleven studies from seven countries were included in the analysis. Among 1,970 patients, cancer was found in only 22 cases (0.01%). The risk of malignancy following a radiologically proven episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was low, though patients with complicated diverticulitis had a significant risk of CRC at subsequent colonic evaluation.

A retrospective study of 633 patients with acute diverticulitis diagnosed by CT was also published in 2014. Of the 663 patients, 97 underwent emergency resection, while 536 were treated non-operatively, with 394 of these subsequently undergoing colonoscopy. The findings revealed 17 cancers (2.7%) among patients with an initial diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. CT findings showed that 16 cancer patients (94%) had an abscess, while one patient had pericolic extraluminal gas but no abscess. Among the patients with an abscess, 11.4% had cancer mimicking acute diverticulitis. No cancer was detected in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Long-term implications of persistent diverticulitis: A retrospective cohort study of 915 patients [^115tZutu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Low credibility.

Persistent, or ongoing, diverticulitis is a well-recognized outcome after treatment for acute sigmoid diverticulitis; however, its definition, incidence, risk factors, and long-term implications remain poorly described.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes of persistent diverticulitis.

- **Design**: This was a retrospective cohort study.

- **Settings**: Two university-affiliated hospitals in Montreal, Quebec, Canada were included.

- **Patients**: The study was composed of consecutive patients managed nonoperatively for acute sigmoid diverticulitis.

- **Intervention**: Nonoperative management of acute sigmoid diverticulitis was involved.

- **Main outcome measures**: Persistent diverticulitis, defined as inpatient or outpatient treatment for signs and symptoms of ongoing diverticulitis within the first 60 days after treatment of the index episode, was measured.

- **Results**: In total, 915 patients were discharged after an index episode of diverticulitis managed nonoperatively. Seventy-five patients (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.5%-10.2%) presented within 60 days with persistent diverticulitis. Factors associated with persistent diverticulitis were younger age (adjusted OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96–0.99), immunosuppression (adjusted OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.04–3.88), and abscess (adjusted OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.03–3.92). Among the 75 patients with persistent disease, 42 (56.0%) required hospital admission, 6 (8.0%) required percutaneous drainage, and 5 (6.7%) required resection.

Diverticular disease (DD) is a multifactorial condition where optimal patient stratification, based on disease severity, can ensure therapeutic success. The DICA classification is a novel and pragmatic tool that clinicians can use for an objective description of the colon containing diverticula. The simplicity, excellent reproducibility, and correlation with both biochemical and clinical disease markers make this classification very appealing in clinical practice. However, further studies are required to validate this classification and evaluate its reproducibility in clinical trials, as well as to determine its potential impact on the natural history of DD.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114Y6a1M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the long-time prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both inpatient and outpatient settings, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder primarily affecting older people in Western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence across all age groups worldwide. This shift has prompted researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to innovate with novel approaches to management, ranging from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require surgery. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last five years.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114KMZrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that continues to receive significant attention and study due to its heterogeneous presentation and outcomes. This review explores the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis.

Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors indicate that the epidemiology of the disease is shifting from what was previously considered a disorder primarily affecting older Western populations. Genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and summarized here.

Data on non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are evaluated, alongside pharmacologic agents studied for secondary prevention. Lastly, controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis are presented. This review aims to provide a synopsis of the last five years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: An individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115L6LTL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although evidence in favor of antibiotic treatment has always been lacking. Recently, two RCTs demonstrated the safety of omitting antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis up to 1 year of follow-up.

- **AVOD antibiotics trial**: The AVOD Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis trial showed comparable rates of complicated diverticulitis, re-diverticulitis, and sigmoid resection between observational and antibiotic treatment.

- **DIABOLO trial**: The DIABOLO (Diverticulitis: Antibiotics or Close Observation) trial found no significant differences regarding time to recovery, complicated diverticulitis, re-diverticulitis, and sigmoid resection.

However, both RCTs reported somewhat — by and large non-significant — higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resections in the non-antibiotic group. As neither of the studies was powered to analyze these secondary outcomes, uncertainty remained whether these small differences could potentially be true causal associations, the consequence of patient selection, or findings by chance in accordance with statistical non-significance.

A regular meta-analysis of the two RCTs would not be able to account for different follow-up times and different outcome definitions provided in the results papers of these studies. In contrast, a meta-analysis of individual-patient data can not only account for these differences but additionally provide an opportunity to use the increased sample size of both trials.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of diverticulitis [^113NWVLs]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. Approximately 20% of patients with incident diverticulitis experience at least one recurrence. Complications, such as abdominal sepsis, are less likely to occur with subsequent events. Several risk factors, many of which are modifiable, have been identified, including obesity, diet, and physical inactivity. Diet and lifestyle factors can affect the risk of diverticulitis through their influence on the intestinal microbiome and inflammation. Preliminary studies suggest that the composition and function of the gut microbiome differ between individuals with and without diverticulitis. Furthermore, genetic factors, as well as alterations in colonic neuromusculature, can contribute to the development of diverticulitis.

Less aggressive and more nuanced treatment strategies have been developed. Two multicenter, randomized trials of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis found that antibiotics did not speed recovery or prevent subsequent complications. Elective surgical resection is no longer recommended solely based on the number of recurrences or young patient age, and it might not be necessary for some patients with diverticulitis complicated by abscess. Randomized trials of hemodynamically stable patients requiring urgent surgery for acute, complicated diverticulitis that has not improved with antibiotics provide evidence to support primary anastomosis versus sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy. Despite these advances, more research is needed to increase our understanding and improve management strategies.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^115GJJpx]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The standard of care for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis today is antibiotic treatment, although there are no controlled studies supporting this management. The aim was to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, focusing on recovery without complications after 12 months of follow-up.

- **Methods**: This multicentre randomized trial involved ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland, recruiting 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics.

- **Results**: Age, sex, body mass index, co-morbidities, body temperature, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level on admission were similar in the two groups. Complications such as perforation or abscess formation were found in six patients (1.9%) who received no antibiotics and in three (1.0%) who were treated with antibiotics (P = 0.302). The median hospital stay was 3 days in both groups. Rediverticulitis necessitating readmission to hospital at the 1-year follow-up was similar in the two groups (16%, P = 0.881).

- **Conclusion**: Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerates recovery nor prevents complications or recurrence. It should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^115ypMkE]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute diverticulitis, particularly concerning elective colectomy, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend offering an individualized discussion on elective segmental resection for patients with a history of diverticulitis. This discussion should consider disease severity, patient preferences and values, as well as the risks and benefits, including quality of life (QoL). Patients should be counseled that while surgery reduces the risk of diverticulitis, it does not eliminate it, and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms do not always improve with surgery.

### Meta-analyses of current strategies to treat uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112NPuGT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis is common. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate management. Some authors have reported the efficacy and safety of observational management, while others argue for a more aggressive approach with oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to perform an updated meta-analysis of the different management strategies for uncomplicated diverticulitis with two separate meta-analyses.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were used.

- **Study selection**: All randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, and retrospective comparative studies were included.

- **Interventions**: Observational and antibiotics treatment or oral and intravenous antibiotics treatment were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: Successful management (emergency management, recurrence, elective management) was measured.

- **Results**: After reviewing 293 identified records, 11 studies fit the inclusion criteria: 7 studies compared observational management and antibiotic treatment (2321 patients), and 4 studies compared oral and intravenous antibiotic treatment (355 patients). There was no significant difference between observational management and antibiotic treatment in terms of emergency surgery (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.1) and recurrence (11% vs 12%; p = 0.3). Considering only randomized trials, elective surgery during follow-up occurred more frequently in the observational group than in the antibiotic group (2.5% vs 0.9%; p = 0.04). The second meta-analysis showed that failure and recurrence rates were comparable.

### Contemporary review of risk-stratified management in acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis [^114DzQgr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016).

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition. The severity of the disease is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations and dictates the need for medical or surgical intervention. Recent clinical trials have improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease, resulting in new approaches to and better evidence for the management of acute diverticulitis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Library (2004–2015), MEDLINE (2004–2015), and EMBASE (2004–2015) databases. We used the search terms "diverticulitis, colonic", "acute diverticulitis", or "divertic" in combination with "management", "antibiotics", "non-operative", or "surgery". Registers for clinical trials (such as the WHO registry and https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched for ongoing, recruiting, or closed trials not yet published.

- **Results**: Antibiotic treatment can be avoided in simple, non-complicated diverticulitis, and outpatient management is safe. The management of complicated disease, ranging from a localized abscess to perforation with diffuse peritonitis, has changed towards either percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches in selected cases. The role of laparoscopic lavage without resection in perforated non-fecal diverticulitis is still debated; however, recent evidence from two randomized controlled trials has found a higher re-intervention rate in this group of patients.

- **Conclusions**: A shift in management has occurred towards conservative management in acute uncomplicated disease. Individuals with uncomplicated acute diver…

### Antibiotics versus no antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Y7LZA]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are routinely used for diverticulitis irrespective of severity. Practice guidelines advise against the use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the role of antibiotic use in an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. **Data sources**: PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane were used. **Study selection**: Eligible studies included those with patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis receiving any antibiotics compared with patients not receiving any antibiotics (or observed alone).

- **Main outcome measures**: Pooled odds rate of total complications, treatment failure, recurrence of diverticulitis, readmission rate, sigmoid resection, mortality rate, and length of stay were measured.

- **Results**: Of 1050 citations reviewed, 7 studies were eligible for the analysis. There were a total of 2241 patients: 895 received antibiotics (mean age = 59.1 years; 38% men) and 1346 did not receive antibiotics (mean age = 59.4 years; 37% men). Antibiotics were later added in 2.7% of patients who were initially observed without antibiotics. Length of hospital stay was not significantly different between groups (no antibiotics = 3.1 days vs. antibiotics = 4.5 days; p = 0.20). The pooled rate of recurrent diverticulitis was not significantly different between both groups (pooled OR = 1.27 [95%, CI 0.90–1.79]; p = 0.18). The rate of total complications (pooled OR = 1.99 [95% CI, 0.66–6.01]; p = 0.22), treatment failure (pooled OR = 0.68 [95% CI, 0.42–1.09]; p = 0.11), and readmissions (pooled OR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.44–1.79]) were measured.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: An individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115ibJpZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Although no statistically significant differences were found between treatment groups, some of the differences in adverse event rates may be considered clinically relevant. If so, the statistical power appeared to be insufficient. Furthermore, even though antibiotic treatment may not be effective for the entire study group, some patients may possibly benefit from such treatment. Therefore, additional analyses were performed to assess the potential role of antibiotics in the prevention of these adverse outcomes.

- **Risk factors and role of antibiotics in prevention of adverse outcomes**: Risk factors for the development of ongoing diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, and sigmoid resection were assessed. To maximize power in the logistic regression analyses, risk factors for ongoing diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, or undergoing a sigmoid resection were evaluated as a single adverse outcome group. A primary episode of diverticulitis appeared to be protective against ongoing diverticulitis (OR 0.29, 97.5% CI 0.13 to 0.66). Risk factors for the development of complicated diverticulitis were a VAS pain score of more than 7 (OR 2.78, 1.18 to 6.54) and WBC higher than 13.5 × 10⁹/l (OR 2.62, 1.11 to 6.18). A pain score of more than 7 was also a risk factor for sigmoid resection (OR 2.32, 1.05 to 5.10). Analyses of all three adverse outcomes as a single adverse event group yielded no additional insights.

### Randomized clinical trial of observational versus antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^112Ayosi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

- **Methods**: Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during six months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated diverticulitis, ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection, and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.

- **Results**: A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (interquartile range: 6–35) days for the observational and 12 (7–30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0.91 (lower limit of one-sided 95% confidence interval: 0.78; P = 0.151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3.8% versus 2.6%, respectively; P = 0.377), ongoing diverticulitis (7.3% versus 4.1%; P = 0.183), recurrent diverticulitis (3.4% versus 3.0%; P = 0.494), sigmoid resection (3.8% versus 2.3%; P = 0.323), readmission (17.6% versus 12.0%; P = 0.148), adverse events (48.5% versus 54.5%; P = 0.221), and mortality (1.1% versus 0.4%; P = 0.432). Hospital stay was significantly reduced in the antibiotic group.

The objectives of therapy in patients who develop acute diverticulitis include the treatment of symptoms, the colonic infection, the prevention of complications, and the recurrence of the condition. Based on the severity of symptoms, ability to tolerate oral intake, presence of comorbidities, and adequate outpatient support, the decision on whether patients should be hospitalized or receive ambulatory care should be carefully considered. Treatment of complications may require interventional radiology or surgery.
