## Question

What is the evidence for multifidi function and imaging on low back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for multifidus function and imaging in low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the multifidus muscle's anatomical and functional role in spinal stability. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking multifidus dysfunction to low back pain. Next, I will examine imaging modalities and metrics, including MRI and ultrasound, and appraise their reliability and clinical utility. After that, I need to check whether imaging findings predict treatment response or guide management. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and outline practical clinical implications, including when imaging adds value and when it does not.

> Let me first confirm the core anatomy and function. The lumbar multifidus is the deepest paraspinal muscle, providing segmental stiffness and intersegmental control; its deep fibers are rich in muscle spindles, supporting proprioceptive feedback and neuromuscular control, which are central to functional spinal stability [^7d73528f]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of its contribution: multiple sources attribute more than two-thirds of lumbar stiffness to the multifidus, underscoring its biomechanical importance in load sharing and shear resistance [^7d73528f].

> Next, I should review the evidence that multifidus dysfunction is associated with low back pain. Wait, let me verify the directionality and strength. Observational and cohort data consistently show that patients with chronic low back pain exhibit multifidus atrophy, reduced cross-sectional area, and increased intramuscular fat infiltration compared with asymptomatic individuals, with pooled analyses suggesting moderate effect sizes for reduced functional CSA and increased fat infiltration in multifidus, particularly at L4–L5 [^3c2c15b0]. I should also note that some prospective data show associations between severe fat infiltration and current or prior pain, though prediction of future pain is inconsistent, indicating a complex, likely bidirectional relationship rather than a simple causal chain [^25973265] [^7c2d598a].

> I will now examine imaging modalities and metrics. MRI is the reference standard for quantifying multifidus morphology, including total CSA, functional CSA (total CSA minus fat), and fat infiltration graded 0–2, and can detect side-specific or level-specific changes that may correlate with symptoms and prognosis in some contexts [^6c2efbd5] [^977fcc58]. Ultrasound offers dynamic, bedside assessment of thickness and contractility, with reasonable reliability for thickness at rest and during contraction, though it cannot directly quantify fat infiltration and is operator dependent [^0afc4151] [^f2eb8d2a]. Let me double-check the reliability claim: ICCs for ultrasound thickness are typically high when standardized protocols are used, supporting its use for serial monitoring of activation, albeit with attention to technique and training [^0afc4151].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical utility. I need to check whether imaging findings predict treatment response or guide management decisions. Evidence is mixed and generally low quality: baseline multifidus thickness or activation on ultrasound has not reliably predicted benefit from stabilization exercises, and guidelines conclude there is insufficient evidence that imaging findings correlate with pain or meaningfully guide treatment decisions in nonspecific low back pain [^ab2b4e52] [^2ed3bfc6] [^e4ef49e5]. But wait, what if we consider surgical cohorts or specific interventions? In surgical populations, higher preoperative multifidus fat infiltration has been associated with worse postoperative pain and disability, suggesting a prognostic role in that context, though this should not be overgeneralized to nonsurgical care [^41f7fb8d] [^28db4265].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. Major guidelines advise against routine imaging for acute or subacute low back pain without red flags, as imaging does not improve outcomes and may lead to harm through incidental findings and unnecessary procedures; imaging is reserved for severe or progressive neurologic deficits, suspected serious pathology, or persistent symptoms despite appropriate conservative care when results would change management [^38e832ce] [^4c872801] [^9cfa3633]. I should confirm that this applies to multifidus imaging as well: yes, guidelines explicitly state insufficient evidence to recommend imaging to identify muscular changes for routine decision-making in nonspecific low back pain, reinforcing a conservative approach to imaging in this population [^2ed3bfc6] [^e4ef49e5].

> Let me consider functional assessment and rehabilitation implications. Motor control exercises can improve pain and function in some patients, and there is preliminary evidence that targeted programs may increase multifidus size over time, though superiority to other exercise approaches is not established and dose may matter; importantly, imaging is not required to prescribe or monitor these exercises in routine care [^a95ba3bf] [^234b10c1]. I should double-check whether imaging helps tailor exercise selection: current evidence does not support using ultrasound or MRI metrics to select patients for stabilization training, so clinical examination and symptom-guided progression remain standard [^ab2b4e52] [^06a036ae].

> But wait, what if multifidus dysfunction is a distinct phenotype warranting targeted therapy? Emerging literature describes a subset with impaired neuromuscular control and multifidus atrophy in whom restorative neurostimulation of the lumbar medial branch nerves can elicit multifidus contractions and yield durable improvements in pain and function; in this niche, MRI grading of atrophy and functional exam maneuvers are used to corroborate the phenotype and guide candidacy, though this remains a specialized indication rather than routine practice [^eafa5bd6] [^1a8f2f53] [^5dd99fd8]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not contradict guideline conservatism: it does not, because these approaches are reserved for carefully selected, refractory cases after conservative care fails, aligning with the principle that imaging is justified when results change management [^4c872801].

> I should also review the reliability and limitations of imaging metrics to avoid overinterpretation. While MRI fat grading and CSA are reproducible, there is variability in thresholds and cutoffs across studies, and fat infiltration can reflect age, disuse, or systemic factors rather than a pain-specific process; likewise, ultrasound activation ratios are sensitive to task standardization and patient effort, limiting comparability across cohorts and time points [^6c2efbd5] [^0afc4151]. Let me reconsider the implication: this means that isolated imaging findings should not be used to infer causation or to label a pain generator without clinical correlation and, when possible, longitudinal assessment [^7bdc9952].

> Next, I should synthesize the clinical takeaways. Multifidus dysfunction is a plausible contributor to chronic low back pain in some patients, and imaging can document atrophy and fat infiltration, but routine imaging does not improve outcomes in nonspecific cases and should be avoided absent red flags or specific procedural indications; imaging may be informative in surgical prognostication or in selecting candidates for restorative neurostimulation, but even then, diagnosis remains clinical and functional rather than purely morphologic [^38e832ce] [^41f7fb8d] [^1a8f2f53]. I need to ensure I emphasize that exercise-based rehabilitation remains first-line, with imaging reserved for refractory scenarios where results will alter management, which aligns with best-practice guidance [^4c872801] [^9cfa3633].

> Finally, I should outline practical clinical steps. In patients with nonspecific low back pain, prioritize history, examination, and graded exercise, reserving MRI for persistent symptoms with red flags or when intervention is contemplated; if multifidus-targeted rehabilitation is pursued, ultrasound can be used to provide biofeedback and document activation, but it should not be used to select patients or predict response, and findings must be interpreted in clinical context and with attention to technique and reliability [^4c872801] [^0afc4151] [^ab2b4e52]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with evidence: yes, it balances the observed associations between multifidus changes and pain with the lack of proven predictive utility for routine imaging-based selection, and it aligns with guideline conservatism while allowing for selective, indication-driven use of imaging where it can change care [^2ed3bfc6] [^e4ef49e5].

---

Multifidus dysfunction is a **recognized contributor** to chronic low back pain, with MRI and ultrasound documenting atrophy and fat infiltration that correlate with pain and disability [^3c2c15b0] [^589ff497]. However, imaging is **not routinely indicated** for nonspecific low back pain without red flags, as it rarely changes management and may detect incidental findings that mislead care [^38e832ce] [^4c872801]. Imaging is most useful when surgery or interventions are planned, or when red flags are present, and should be interpreted alongside clinical findings [^9cfa3633] [^340cbff9]. Motor control exercises can improve multifidus function and reduce pain, but imaging is not required to guide therapy in most cases [^a95ba3bf] [^234b10c1].

---

## Anatomical and functional role of multifidus muscles

The multifidus is a **deep paraspinal muscle** that provides segmental stability, maintains lumbar lordosis, and resists shear forces; its deep fibers are rich in muscle spindles, enabling fine motor control and proprioceptive feedback [^7d73528f]. Dysfunction impairs spinal stability and increases load on passive structures, contributing to pain and disability [^509e6c54].

---

## Evidence of multifidus dysfunction in low back pain

Multiple studies show that patients with chronic low back pain have **smaller cross-sectional area**, **greater fat infiltration**, and **reduced activation** of the multifidus compared with asymptomatic individuals [^3c2c15b0] [^589ff497]. These changes are often bilateral and may persist after pain resolution, suggesting a structural component to dysfunction [^73fb6514].

---

## Imaging modalities for assessing multifidus dysfunction

MRI and ultrasound are the **primary imaging tools** for evaluating multifidus morphology and function:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| MRI | - Gold standard for fat infiltration and atrophy <br/> - Detailed anatomical visualization <br/> - Quantitative fat grading (Goutallier scale) | - Expensive <br/> - Limited availability <br/> - Static assessment |
| Ultrasound | - Dynamic <br/> - Non-invasive <br/> - Cost-effective <br/> - Real-time assessment of muscle activation and thickness changes | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited penetration in obese patients <br/> - Cannot quantify fat infiltration |

---

MRI reliably quantifies fat infiltration and atrophy, whereas ultrasound provides **real-time assessment** of muscle activation and thickness changes during contraction [^6c2efbd5] [^0afc4151].

---

## Correlation between imaging findings and clinical symptoms

Imaging findings correlate with pain and disability, but the relationship is **complex and multifactorial**:

- **Fat infiltration**: Strongly associated with current and past low back pain, and with greater disability and poorer postoperative outcomes [^3c2c15b0] [^28db4265].
- **Atrophy**: Reduced cross-sectional area correlates with pain severity and duration, though findings are inconsistent across studies [^589ff497] [^079d76bf].
- **Activation deficits**: Reduced thickness change during contraction indicates impaired neuromuscular control and correlates with pain and disability [^97041b80].

---

## Clinical utility of imaging in guiding treatment

Imaging can inform prognosis — especially in surgical candidates — but **routine imaging is not recommended** for nonspecific low back pain without red flags, as it rarely alters management and may detect incidental findings that mislead care [^38e832ce] [^4c872801]. Imaging is most useful when:

- **Surgical planning**: Assessing multifidus status before decompression or fusion may predict outcomes [^41f7fb8d] [^28db4265].
- **Interventional procedures**: Identifying targets for facet or multifidus interventions [^9cfa3633].
- **Refractory cases**: Persistent symptoms despite conservative care may benefit from targeted imaging to guide advanced therapies [^659e1aaf].

---

## Impact of treatment on multifidus morphology and function

Conservative treatments, particularly motor control exercises, can **improve multifidus function** and reduce pain, though structural changes are modest and slow:

- **Motor control exercises**: Improve activation, thickness, and reduce pain, but may require prolonged, targeted programs [^a95ba3bf] [^234b10c1].
- **General exercise**: Less specific programs show smaller or inconsistent effects on multifidus morphology [^8d5a48ef].
- **Neurostimulation**: Emerging restorative neurostimulation directly activates multifidus and shows durable pain and function improvements in refractory cases [^eafa5bd6] [^8d5a48ef].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Causality**: Most studies are cross-sectional; longitudinal data are needed to clarify whether multifidus dysfunction causes or results from pain [^25973265].
- **Standardization**: Imaging protocols and measurement methods vary, limiting comparability [^677a46e4].
- **Clinical thresholds**: No universally accepted cutoffs define clinically significant atrophy or fat infiltration [^notfound].
- **Predictive value**: Baseline imaging rarely predicts response to conservative therapy, limiting its use for treatment selection [^ab2b4e52] [^06a036ae].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consistently advise against **routine imaging** for nonspecific low back pain without red flags, emphasizing clinical assessment and conservative care first [^38e832ce] [^4c872801]. Imaging is reserved for persistent symptoms despite optimal management, suspected serious pathology, or pre-intervention planning [^9cfa3633] [^659e1aaf].

---

## Future directions and research needs

- **Longitudinal studies**: To establish causality and temporal relationships between multifidus changes and pain [^22db259d].
- **Standardization**: Develop consensus imaging protocols and measurement standards [^df584082].
- **Personalized medicine**: Identify imaging phenotypes that predict treatment response to targeted therapies [^b9e5561e].
- **Advanced imaging**: Explore functional MRI and elastography to better characterize muscle quality and function [^63ad6a7b] [^97041b80].

---

Multifidus dysfunction is a **validated contributor** to chronic low back pain, and imaging can document atrophy and fat infiltration that correlate with pain and disability. However, routine imaging is not indicated for nonspecific low back pain without red flags, and management should remain primarily clinical and exercise-based, with imaging reserved for specific indications.

Multifidus dysfunction tests in chronic low back pain — multifidus dysfunction is diagnosed mainly based on physical examination, which includes the Prone Instability Test and Multifidus Lift Test. The Prone Instability Test aims to identify chronic low back pain due to lumbar segmental instability related to multifidus muscle dysfunction, and the presence or absence of pain during the test highlights the role of multifidus stabilization. The Multifidus Lift Test is designed to identify multifidus dysfunction through palpation; at the lower lumbar levels the multifidus can be felt just lateral to the spinous process, and electromyography activity during the lift is related to changes in muscle thickness that can be measured by ultrasound imaging or simple palpation; reduced or absent thickness change during the extremity lift procedure is thought to indicate multifidus dysfunction in patients with chronic low back pain, with the contraction felt being a summation of all multifidus fascicles at that level, the deep multifidus expected to contribute the least, and intermediate and superficial muscles possibly activating even if the deep fascicles are completely inhibited.

### Low back pain [^0c1df845]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain with movement coordination impairments — muscle imaging findings include associations of trunk musculature changes with pain and limited clinical application to date. Poor trunk muscle function has been associated with back pain; on imaging, multiple techniques have been used to assess the lumbar muscles, including MRI showing differences in functional activity and signal intensity and multifidus atrophy and posture-related cross-sectional changes. Severe fat infiltration has been strongly associated with a history of low back pain (odds ratio [OR], 9.2) and low back pain within the last year (OR, 4.1). An association has also been established between trunk attenuation on computed tomography (CT) scanning and functional capacity among older adults with low back pain, and although potential exists for imaging to detect muscular control impairments to guide treatment, this has not been extensively explored in common clinical practice.

### Does pre-operative multifidus morphology on MRI predict clinical outcomes in adults following surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spine disease? A systematic review [^41f7fb8d]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Low back pain (LBP) resulting from degenerative lumbar spine disease is a leading contributor to global disability. Changes in the morphology of the lumbar multifidus muscle on magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with worse LBP and disability, but the association between multifidus morphology and post-operative outcomes is not known. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between pre-operative multifidus morphology and post-operative changes in pain and disability.

Methods

We performed a systematic search using the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus databases covering the period from January 1946 to January 2018. The literature was searched and assessed by independent reviewers according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. All relevant papers were assessed for risk of bias according to the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool.

Results

The initial search yielded 436 studies, of which 6 studies were included in the analysis. Four studies were at a low risk of bias. These studies included a total of 873 patients undergoing spinal surgery. An association between low fat infiltration and greater improvement in LBP and disability following surgery was identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify a relationship between cross-sectional area (CSA) and LBP or disability.

Conclusions

This systematic review found evidence for an association between low multifidus fat infiltration on MRI at baseline and greater reductions in measures of LBP and disability following surgical treatment. There is also limited evidence for an association between larger pre-operative multifidus CSA and improvements in disability, but not pain. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small quantity of the available literature.

### Do various baseline characteristics of transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus predict clinical outcomes in nonspecific low back pain? A systematic review [^06a036ae]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Although individual reports suggest that baseline morphometry or activity of transversus abdominis or lumbar multifidus predict clinical outcome of low back pain (LBP), a related systematic review is unavailable. Therefore, this review summarized evidence regarding the predictive value of these muscular characteristics. Candidate publications were identified from 6 electronic medical databases. After review, 5 cohort studies were included. Although this review intended to encompass studies using different muscle assessment methods, all included studies coincidentally used ultrasound imaging. No research investigated the relation between static morphometry and clinical outcomes. Evidence synthesis showed limited evidence supporting poor baseline transversus abdominis contraction thickness ratio as a treatment effect modifier favoring motor control exercise. Limited evidence supported that high baseline transversus abdominis lateral slide was associated with higher pain intensity after various exercise interventions at 1-year follow-up. However, there was limited evidence for the absence of relation between the contraction thickness ratio of transversus abdominis or anticipatory onset of lateral abdominal muscles at baseline and the short- or long-term LBP intensity after exercise interventions. There was conflicting evidence for a relation between baseline percent thickness change of lumbar multifidus during contraction and the clinical outcomes of patients after various conservative treatments. Given study heterogeneity, the small number of included studies and the inability of conventional greyscale B-mode ultrasound imaging to measure muscle activity, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Further large-scale prospective studies that use appropriate technology (ie, electromyography to assess muscle activity) should be conducted to investigate the predictive value of morphometry or activity of these muscles with respect to LBP-related outcomes measures.

### Does motor control exercise restore normal morphology of lumbar multifidus muscle in people with low back pain? – A systematic review [^677a46e4]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Data Synthesis

A meta-analysis was planned to pool relevant data from the included studies. However, given the high clinical heterogeneity among studies (ie, different muscle measurement methods, such as ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, and diverse treatments) a qualitative analysis was conducted.

Since some included studies did not report within- or between-group treatment effects, secondary-analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) to compare within- and between-group differences, as well as the corresponding mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in primary outcomes using methods (ie, calculating mean change in each group by subtracting post-intervention mean from baseline mean or calculating mean differences between two groups using post-intervention measurements) recommended in the Cochrane handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention. To facilitate the comparisons of LMM volume, CSA and pain intensity among studies, the measurement unit in cm 3, cm 2 and cm were converted into mm 3, mm 2 and mm, respectively. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for pain, which means the smallest change in pain that a patient considers clinically meaningful, was set at 20mm on visual analogue scale (VAS). Minimal detectable change at 95% confidence (MDC 95) was used to indicate the post-treatment change in scores that exceeded the measurement error (ie, true change). For patients with LBP, the MDC 95 for LMM CSA, resting and contracted thickness was 100mm 2,3.6mm, and 1.8mm, respectively. The MDC 95 for percent thickness change during contraction was 15.7%.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^5cd4f3bb]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Multifidus dysfunction and chronic low back pain

Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between the duration of LBP symptoms and multifidus dysfunction with or without structural changes such as fat infiltration, atrophy, and diminished cross-sectional area (Figure 3). However, it is critical to note that multifidus fat infiltration and pain can occur independently of atrophy, and the evidence remains mixed. Studies have reported that a high multifidus fat index has been associated with facet joint and intervertebral disc degeneration, spondylolisthesis, and degenerative stenosis. Furthermore, multifidus atrophy has been associated to suboptimal spinal alignment, such as increased lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and sacral angle. Furthermore, basic science, animal and human studies have proposed an interaction between pro-inflammatory cytokines with changes in multifidus architecture. These have reported that a dysregulation of interleukin 1, interleukin 6, transforming growth factor, macrophages, and tumor necrosis factor contribute to differentiation of fibroblasts and pre-adipocytes in multifidus atrophy.

Figure 3.
Magnetic resonance images demonstrating progressive multifidus fat infiltration from normal to moderate to severe.

Overall, the literature seems to favor a positive correlation between multifidus atrophy, muscle dysfunction, and LBP recurrency and chronicity. However, it is important to note that this is variable among individuals and during distinctive functional tasks, as noted by advanced imaging and/or EMG findings. There are studies that have not found a significant association of multifidus atrophy and LBP, suggesting that the evidence is mixed due to heterogenicity, differences in methodology, cofounding variables, and distinctive populations.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^1ce8e0e7]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is multifactorial in nature, with recent research highlighting the role of multifidus dysfunction in a subset of nonspecific CLBP. This review aimed to provide a foundational reference that elucidates the pathophysiological cascade of multifidus dysfunction, how it contrasts with other CLBP etiologies and the role of restorative neurostimulation.

Methods

A scoping review of the literature.

Results

In total, 194 articles were included, and findings were presented to highlight emerging principles related to multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation. Multifidus dysfunction is diagnosed by a history of mechanical, axial, nociceptive CLBP and exam demonstrating functional lumbar instability, which differs from other structural etiologies. Diagnostic images may be used to grade multifidus atrophy and assess other structural pathologies. While various treatments exist for CLBP, restorative neurostimulation distinguishes itself from traditional neurostimulation in a way that treats a different etiology, targets a different anatomical site, and has a distinctive mechanism of action.

Conclusions

Multifidus dysfunction has been proposed to result from loss of neuromuscular control, which may manifest clinically as muscle inhibition resulting in altered movement patterns. Over time, this cycle may result in potential atrophy, degeneration and CLBP. Restorative neurostimulation, a novel implantable neurostimulator system, stimulates the efferent lumbar medial branch nerve to elicit repetitive multifidus contractions. This intervention aims to interrupt the cycle of dysfunction and normalize multifidus activity incrementally, potentially restoring neuromuscular control. Restorative neurostimulation has been shown to reduce pain and disability in CLBP, improve quality of life and reduce health care expenditures.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^1a8f2f53]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As a proposed functional etiology, it is imperative to assess CLBP beyond structural changes on diagnostic images and shift thinking to a functional perspective. Multifidus dysfunction must be diagnosed with a combination of clinical history, physical exam and/or MRI findings A physical exam to evaluate for signs of functional lumbar instability with a positive prone instability test (κ = 0.87) preferably, multifidus lift test (κ = 0.75 to 0.81) and a positive aberrant movement patterns test (κ = 0.60) have demonstrated sustained interrater reliability. Diagnostic ultrasound and EMG can help assess multifidus activity during functional movements, while MRI can help grade multifidus atrophy. However, the finding of muscle atrophy on MRI alone does not establish multifidus dysfunction diagnosis (since this is a functional etiology) and by itself should never be relied upon as a sole criterion for the indication for restorative neurostimulation. Importantly, MRI findings can help correlate physical examination and clinical history to corroborate diagnosis and assure that there are no concomitant structural pathology amenable to traditional spinal surgery. Commonly, these patients are not surgical candidates and a have limited response to conservative management without longitudinal improvement in pain and function. In such settings, restorative neurostimulation therapy could be considered.

Restorative neurostimulation treatment is clinically indicated for patients with CLBP greater than 6 months of duration with diagnostic evidence of multifidus dysfunction seen on physical exam and/or on diagnostic imaging. This is an innovative neurostimulation system that has emerged as a disease-modifying therapy to restore neuromuscular control through a rehabilitative MOA rooted in the previous discussion of the pathophysiology of multifidus dysfunction and loss of neuromuscular control. This therapy is believed to restore this by an efferent neurostimulation of the dorsal rami of the LMNB, which leads to repetitive multifidus contraction that with a gradual and longitudinal accrual time to effect may override underlying AMI and restore mechanonociceptive feedback, which may normalize neuromuscular control and functional spinal stability. Thereby, the therapeutic goal is restorative in nature to first normalize neuromuscular function, and subsequently reduce disability and pain. Hence, the stimulation plan is long-term (months to years) and pain/disability reduction has a longitudinal gradual effect, with numerous studies reinforcing the distinctive MOA based on durable and robust sustained improvement up to 36 months. Because of the MOA and clinical benefits that accumulate over time, it is thought that a short trial period is unlikely to yield optimized patient selection and predict future responders.

### The optimal patient profile and appropriate role of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for patients with persistent spinal pain syndrome-type 1 (PSPS-T1) not suitable for spine surgery: a European modified Delphi consensus [^9dd0a0a8]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Domain D. Role of Imaging

The panel reached consensus on the role of medical imaging for patients presenting with PSPS-T1. Specifically, patients should have access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 6 months of the onset of persistent back pain (S15, 87%). In addition, a physical examination conducted as early as possible, ideally within six weeks, to prevent the development of stiffness and disuse atrophy of the spinal stabilizer multifidus muscles, which triggers a vicious cycle of pain (S16, 80%). MRI is the imaging modality of choice if infection is suspected (S22, 87%). Patients presenting with PSPS-T1 should have access to a full spine X-ray in cases of obvious mechanical LBP (S19, 81%). Lumbar instability can also be assessed via imaging, eg, comparing standing and dynamic X-rays or comparing standing X-rays with lying-position MRI (S20, 88%).

A range of imaging is required to discuss the indications for treatment options (S21, 90%). MRI is the preferred imaging modality to assess the suitability of either spine surgery or SCS (S18, 90%). To determine SCS suitability (in conjunction with clinical presentation), and to rule out possible surgical targets and specific causative factors (such as tumors, fractures, infections), imaging is required within six months prior to SCS (S17, 85%). The panel agreed that those patients with persistent CLBP with no structural pain generator identified after thorough diagnostic workup, may be candidates for SCS provided CMM has been followed (S23, 79%). Respondents also agreed that Modic changes on MRI are not a contraindication for SCS if six months of CMM has been trialed (S14, 84%). It is important that all patients with SCS have MRI diagnostic access preserved.

### Changes in structure and function of the back muscles in low back pain: different time points, observations, and mechanisms [^509e6c54]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Spinal health depends on optimal back muscle performance, and this is determined by muscle structure and function. There has been substantial research evaluating the differences in structure and function of many back muscles, including the multifidus and erector spinae, but with considerable variation in results. Many studies have shown atrophy, fat infiltration, and connective tissue accumulation in back muscles, particularly deep fibers of the multifidus, but the results are not uniform. In terms of function, results are also somewhat inconsistent, often reporting lower multifidus activation and augmented recruitment of more superficial components of the multifidus and erector spinae, but, again, with variation between studies. A major recent observation has been the identification of time-dependent differences in features of back muscle adaptation, from acute to subacute/recurrent to chronic states of the condition. Further, these adaptations have been shown to be explained by different time-dependent mechanisms. This has substantial impact on the rationale for rehabilitation approaches. The aim of this commentary was to review and consolidate the breadth of research investigating adaptation in back muscle structure and function, to consider explanations for some of the variation between studies, and to propose how this model can be used to guide rehabilitation in a manner that is tailored to individual patients and to underlying mechanisms.

Diagnostic imaging criteria for selective medial branch stimulation — multifidus atrophy grading: Both ultrasound and MRI can be used to assess multifidus atrophy; ultrasound measures cross-sectional area, whereas MRI also measures fatty infiltration grade defined as Grade 0 with up to 10% of the cross-sectional area affected, Grade 1 10–50% and considered mild-to-moderate atrophy, and Grade 2 more than 50% indicating moderate-to-severe atrophy; there is debate about correlations with pain, disability, or function.

### Relationship between low back pain and lumbar multifidus size at different postures [^40246b20]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective study of multifidus images. OBJECTIVE.: To compare the change of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of multifidus in subjects with and without chronic low back pain (LBP) at different postures.

Summary Of Background Data

Ultrasound imaging was shown to be useful in assessing acute LBP patients at rest only.

Methods and Measures

Thirty-five male adults participated, including 19 normal and 16 chronic LBP patients. The CSAs of multifidus were assessed on ultrasound images acquired on both sides of the L4 and L5 levels with the subjects in prone lying, upright standing, and 25 degrees and 45 degrees forward stooping.

Results

In the control group, the CSA of multifidus increased from prone lying to upright standing and then gradually decreased from 25 degrees to 45 degrees forward stooping. However, a reverse pattern of the CSA changes was identified in patients with chronic LBP.

Conclusion

Multifidus contracts maximally at upright standing in the normal group, while maximum contraction of the muscle occurs at 25 degrees forward stooping in the patient group. The role of multifidus may be altered in the stabilization of the lumbar spine of chronic LBP patients. Assessment of the change in muscle size reacting to different postures is found to be helpful.

### An evidence-based consensus for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of non-surgical low back pain: the NEURON group [^64b9e35d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Work-up for the Implementation of Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for the Treatment of Non-Surgical Low Back Pain

Numerous PNS techniques have been described for the treatment of CLBP. At present, two emerging techniques are at the forefront of PNS for NSLBP. One is the permanent implantation of a neurostimulator device to target the multifidus muscles. This technique is considered restorative neurostimulation targeting the multifidus muscle by placement of leads at the lumbar medial branches of L2. The other is a 60-day temporary PNS system targeting the lumbar medial branch nerves. This technique is considered palliative neuromodulation targeting the medial branch nerves corresponding to primary area(s) of pain anywhere from L1-5. Physician knowledge of diagnostic criteria and use of appropriate imaging/diagnostic modalities is imperative for the use of PNS.

While CLBP is often nonspecific and multifactorial, multifidus muscle dysfunction and inhibition is believed to play a role in its development. Proper diagnosis of multifidus dysfunction prior to utilization of the restorative neurostimulation device is critical. The prone instability test (PIT) is considered the preferred test for evaluation of multifidus dysfunction as a source of CLBP. The multifidus lift test also serves to identify multifidus dysfunction as a source of CLBP, although it is considered less specific and to have less interrater reliability compared to the PIT. Lumbar MRI for the identification of multifidus atrophy and grading (grade 0–2) is also a useful adjunct; however, such findings must always be correlated to patient history and examination, including the aforementioned tests.

The use of the 60-day temporary PNS system targeting the lumbar medial branch nerve has a broader diagnostic criterion for its use in NSLBP. In the prospective study by Deer et al, enrolled patients had MRI findings of facet arthrosis, degenerative disc disease, disc protrusion, and/or foraminal narrowing.

### Intrarater and interrater reliability of assessment of lumbar multifidus muscle thickness using rehabilitative ultrasound imaging [^0afc4151]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Within-session intrarater and interrater reliability study.

Objective

To establish the intrarater and interrater reliability of thickness measurements of the multifidus muscle in a parasagittal plane, conducted by an experienced ultrasound operator and a novice assessor.

Background

There is considerable evidence for the important role of the multifidus muscle in segmental stabilization of the lumbar spine. The cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle has been assessed in healthy subjects and patients with low back pain using real-time ultrasound imaging. However, few studies have measured the thickness of the multifidus muscle using a parasagittal view.

Methods and Measures

The thickness of the multifidus muscle was measured at rest, using real-time ultrasound imaging, in 10 subjects without a history of low back pain, at the levels of the L2-3 and L4-5 zygapophyseal joints. The measure was carried out 3 times at each level by 2 assessors (1 experienced, 1 novice). Intrarater (model 3) and interrater (model 2) reliability was assessed by calculation of an F statistic (analysis of variance), the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the standard error of measurement (SEM).

Results

On the basis of an average of 3 trials, the 2 operators showed very high interrater agreement on the measurement of thicknesses at the L2-3 level (ICC2,3 = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.99) and the L4-5 vertebral level (ICC2,3 = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across operators (P > .05). Interrater reliability was relatively lower for the L2-3 level (ICC2,1 = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.96) than the L4-5 level (ICC2,1 = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.97) when a single trial per rater was used, but these values still indicated a high level of agreement. In addition, the novice and experienced operator produced reliable intrarater measurements at L2-3 (ICC3,1 = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.97 and 0.94; 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.99) and at L4-5 (ICC3,1 = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97 and 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across trials (P > .05). The consistently low SEM values also indicate low measurement error.

Conclusion

A novice and an experienced assessor were both able to reliably perform this measure at rest for 2 vertebral levels using real-time ultrasound imaging. An average of 3 trials produced higher interrater reliability scores, though using a single trial per rater was also reliable.

### Low back pain in older adults-the need for specific outcome and psychometric tools [^dbd8d0f5]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, performance-based examinations and falls risk assessments are extremely important for seniors with LBP. For example, the Short Physical Performance Battery can be adopted to determine functional deficits in seniors through evaluating their walking speed, standing balance, and sit-to-stand ability. Performance-based falls risk assessments can also be used to identify high-risk individuals for fall prevention interventions.

As it is common to find degenerative changes/anomalies on lumbar medical images of asymptomatic seniors, imaging is not indicated at the initial assessments of seniors with LBP except for those with acute trauma or symptoms of suspected pathology. If patients fail to respond to conservative treatments, imaging may be indicated to exclude serious pathology. Generally, it is necessary to consider imaging findings, clinical presentations, and other clinical test results together to make a diagnosis.

While an increasing number of geriatric studies have evaluated the effectiveness of various LBP treatments for seniors, the psychometric properties of many self-reported LBP outcome measures have not been validated in the older population. To effectively monitor LBP progression in these patients, validated LBP outcome measures with good psychometric properties should be developed/used.

Although research has shown that working-age patients with LBP may be characterized by reduced static or dynamic morphometry of lumbar multifidus as measured by ultrasonography or axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),–it remains unclear whether geriatric patients with LBP display similar characteristics. Since sarcopenia increases with advancing age, seniors with LBP may be affected by both age- and LBP-related changes in lumbar multifidus. Therefore, future research is warranted to examine if ultrasonography or MRI can detect lumbar multifidus deficits in older patients with LBP, which may guide treatments.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### Does motor control exercise restore normal morphology of lumbar multifidus muscle in people with low back pain? – A systematic review [^c269fa1f]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP), defined as pain or discomfort between the twelfth ribs and buttocks, is the leading cause of disability worldwide. It affects up to 84% of people at least once in their lifetime. The prevalence of LBP is anticipated to increase with an aging global population. Since LBP can lead to tremendous medical burdens and work disability, the overall cost of LBP is expected to increase over time. Although LBP is ubiquitous, approximately 85% of LBP cases have unclear etiology. Biomechanical research suggests that the occurrence/maintenance of LBP may be related to the suboptimal motor control of deep trunk muscles. Specifically, lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) is a major paraspinal muscle that provides intersegmental control of the spineand withstands the compressive loading of the lumbar spine. Therefore, structural/functional deficits of LMM may be related to the onset or maintenance of chronic LBP (CLBP).

### Does motor control exercise restore normal morphology of lumbar multifidus muscle in people with low back pain? – A systematic review [^a95ba3bf]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is preliminary evidence that MCE may change LMM morphology, although it may be dose dependent. Specifically, 36 or more sessions of MCE may increase LMM CSA in patients with CLBP. However, existing evidence does not support that MCE is more effective than other exercises in treating acute/chronic LBP. That said, future research is warranted to determine the effects of MCE on segmental or global morphometry (including intramuscular fatty infiltration) of LMM and clinical outcomes, as well as to quantify the causal relationships between changes in LMM morphology and LBP/LBP-related disability.

### Restorative neurostimulation: a clinical guide for therapy adoption [^4feead61]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria and Patient Identification

Sources of CLBP comprise of discs, joints, fascia, muscles, ligaments, the vertebral endplate or a combination of these. These are pain sources and not etiologies. Each of these sources may have pain as a result of impaired neuromuscular control. This is separate from pain symptoms in the extremities, which suggests a neuropathic source of pain (ie, lumbosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy). The patient history and physical examination may assist with diagnosing the source of low back pain, however no conclusive pathognomonic signs presently exist. Similarly, radiographic or advanced imaging is not necessarily diagnostic – with radiographic findings possibly being incidental in nature. Imaging may assist in ruling out certain causes of back pain, such as traumatic causes or tumors. The combination of history and multiple provocative maneuvers has allowed for increased accuracy in diagnosis (ie, sacroiliac joint dysfunction).

MF dysfunction is a likely mechanism underlying development and/or maintenance of pain, at least initially as a result of suboptimal tissue loading. Diagnosing of MF dysfunction is mainly based on physical examination, which includes two well-reported provocative maneuvers: the prone instability test (PIT) and the multifidus lift test (MLT).

### Long-term lumbar multifidus muscle atrophy changes documented with magnetic resonance imaging: a case series [^bb76fb17]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A retrospective case series of three patients with chronic low back pain who received baseline MRI scans revealing multifidus muscle atrophy with fatty replacement is provided. Each patient received spinal manipulative therapy, and two were compliant with low back exercises targeting the multifidus. A follow-up scan performed > 1 year later was compared to the baseline scan revealing a decrease in atrophy with fatty replacement in the two patients who performed multifidus-focused low back exercises (15% and 39% on the left and 7% and 32% on the right respectively), and an increase in the patient who underwent spinal manipulation alone (41% and 53%). Interestingly, the decrease in atrophy in the two patients that performed the exercises correlated to functional improvements. Though limited, these results highlight the utility of MRI in quantifying positive and negative long-term changes in multifidus atrophy, which may be an indicator of recovery in chronic low back pain patients.

### Lumbar multifidus muscle thickness does not predict patients with low back pain who improve with trunk stabilization exercises [^ab2b4e52]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To understand lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle activation as a clinical feature to predict patients with low back pain (LBP) who are likely to benefit from stabilization (STB) exercises.

Design

Prospective, cohort study.

Setting

Outpatient physical therapy clinics.

Participants

Persons with LBP were recruited for this study. Subjects (N = 25) were classified as either eligible to receive STB exercises or ineligible on the basis of current clinical prediction rules.

Interventions

Six weeks of STB treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Before and after treatment, subjects underwent rehabilitative ultrasound imaging to quantify LM-muscle activation and completed disability and pain questionnaires. Analyses were performed to examine the (1) relation between LM-muscle activation and current clinical features used to predict patients with LBP likely to benefit from STB exercises, (2) LM-muscle activation between the STB-eligible and STB-ineligible groups before and after STB treatment, and (3) relation between LM-muscle activation before STB treatment and (a) disability and (b) pain outcomes after treatment for both groups.

Results

No relation was found between LM-muscle activation and the number of clinical features. Before STB treatment, LM-muscle activation between the STB-eligible and STB-ineligible groups did not differ. After STB treatment, LM-muscle activation differed between the groups; however, this interaction was because the LM-muscle activation for the STB-eligible group decreased after treatment while that for the STB-ineligible group increased after treatment. Finally, only the STB-eligible group had a significant reduction in disability following treatment; however, no relation was found between LM-muscle activation before treatment and (a) disability or (b) pain outcomes after treatment in the STB-eligible group.

Conclusions

LM-muscle activation does not appear to be a clinical feature that predicts patients with LBP likely to benefit from STB exercises.

### Differentiation between deep and superficial fibers of the lumbar multifidus by magnetic resonance imaging [^a1fb8dad]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the differentiation in muscle tissue characteristics and recruitment between the deep and superficial multifidus muscle by magnetic resonance imaging. The multifidus is a very complex muscle in which a superficial and deep component can be differentiated from an anatomical, biomechanical, histological and neuromotorial point of view. To date, the histological evidence is limited to low back pain patients undergoing surgery and cadavers. The multifidus muscles of 15 healthy subjects were investigated with muscle functional MRI. Images were taken under three different conditions: (1) rest, (2) activity without pain and (3) activity after experimentally induced low back muscle pain. The T2 relaxation time in rest and the shift in T2 relaxation time after activity were compared for the deep and superficial samples of the multifidus. At rest, the T2 relaxation time of the deep portion was significantly higher compared to the superficial portion. Following exercise, there was no significant difference in shift in T2 relaxation time between the deep and superficial portions, and in the pain or in the non-pain condition. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a higher T2 relaxation time in the deep portion, which supports the current assumption that the deep multifidus has a higher percentage of slow twitch fibers compared to the superficial multifidus. No differential recruitment has been found following trunk extension with and without pain induction. For further research, it would be interesting to investigate a clinical LBP population, using this non-invasive muscle functional MRI approach.

### Does paraspinal muscle morphometry predict functional status and re-operation after lumbar spinal surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^ffe3c358]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to structure this systematic review and meta-analysis. To retrieve interrelated articles, we conducted a search in the following three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases through September 2022. All fields were searched for these terms: "paraspinal muscle", "paravertebral muscle", "multifidus", "erector spinae", or "psoas major"; and "surgery", "operative", "clinical outcome", or "functional status"; and "lumbar" or "lumbosacral". Two authors assessed all abstracts and titles to rate adherence to review criteria. Inclusion criteria consisted of the following: (1) articles including adults with degenerative lumbar diseases; (2) assessment of any lumbar paraspinal muscle characteristic on MRI or computed tomography preoperatively; (3) assessment of any clinical outcomes after lumbar surgery; (4) analyzed the relationship between preoperative imaging data and postoperative outcomes; (5) articles were published in English. Studies were excluded if they included subjects < 18 years of age; assessed lumbar muscle through nonconventional MRI (such as functional MRI, MRS, and chemical-shift MRI) and ultrasonography; included only postsurgical subjects. Studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case–control studies, and case series.

Assessment of risk of bias

We used Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS), a widely accepted tool for evaluating the risk of bias in prognostic studies. All articles meeting review criteria were evaluated independently for risk of bias by two authors, with any differences in assessment resolved by discussions until consensus was reached. The QUIPS contained 6 separate domains: study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. Each domain was judged as low, moderate, or high risk of bias, according to published criteria. The overall risk of bias for an included study was defined as low risk with ≥ 4 low- and no high-risk domains, moderate risk with < 4 low- and no high-risk domains, and high risk with ≥ 1 high-risk domain.

Data extraction

Two authors independently extracted the following information from included studies: study design, participant characteristics, details of assessments of preoperative lumbar muscle characteristics, and study results that were relevant to our research question. Any disagreement would be adjudicated by a third author.

### Are MRI-defined fat infiltrations in the multifidus muscles associated with low back pain? [^97208ed5]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally believed that muscular insufficiency and low back pain (LBP) are linked, even though the main direction of this link is unclear. Does insufficient muscular strength or control cause LBP or does LBP affect the muscles and their function?

There are other uncertainties. Although several authors have suggested that in some people, specific training involving specific muscles can reduce the symptoms and prevent recurrence, the mechanism through which these effects are mediated is unknown. It would therefore be valuable to discover whether there really is a link between certain muscles and LBP, and to determine the nature of this link.

Histological studies have shown a change in distribution of fiber types and a reduction of muscle size in patients with chronic LBP and intervertebral disc herniation. In several imaging studies, back pain has been investigated in relation to muscle size, perfusion, and fat infiltration Although the results point towards an association between LBP and morphological muscle changes, further studies using larger and unbiased study samples with a clear definition of the muscular observations are necessary.

Based on our understanding of the scientific literature in this area, we hypothesised that LBP leads to altered neuromuscular functioning, which in turn results in changes in muscle histology, seen as atrophy. However, the cross-sectional area of the muscle may not decrease, due to fatty infiltration in the muscle bundle. Fat infiltration can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in human cadaver studies, MRI has been shown to be a valid method of identifying muscle volume and the amount of fat in human skeletal muscle.

Therefore, the aims of this study were: (i) to determine the prevalence of fat in the LMM at the three lower lumbar levels in 13-year-old and 40-year-old participants; and (ii) to investigate whether there is an association between such fat infiltration and LBP, taking into account the possible effects of sex, body mass and leisure time activity in both groups, and physical workload (adults only) or bicycling (adolescents only).

Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for Low Back Pain–Multifidus Activation via Medial Branch Nerve Stimulation

The majority of CLBP patients suffer from mechanical (musculoskeletal) pain that is predominantly nociceptive in nature; however, neuropathic or mixed patterns are also commonly seen. Patients with CLBP often endure impaired quality of life, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Patients suffering from CLBP learn to balance activity with pain on an individual level. Some will tolerate a certain amount of pain to increase their activity level. Others are less tolerant to pain and will minimize any perceived activity that may aggravate their pain, initially leading to inactivity, guarding, and kinesiophobia. Persistent back pain-induced inhibition and disruption of proprioceptive signaling has also been correlated with long-term motor cortex reorganization. Ultimately, this results in impaired neuromuscular control and functional instability from degeneration and atrophy of the lumbar multifidus muscle, the most important stabilizer muscle of the lumbar spine.

Recently, interest has been drawn to incorporating peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) for CLBP. These treatments have been demonstrated not only to improve pain and function but also to decrease the need for multiple interventions to treat CLBP, many of which are unsuccessful. Targeting the medial branch nerve of the dorsal rami of the lumbar spine, which innervates the fascicles of the multifidus muscles, results in activation. These muscles originate at the posterior sacrum, superior iliac spine, and mammillary processes of the lumbar vertebrae. They insert on the spinous processes of the vertebrae in the lumbar spine, 2–4 bones above the origin. This muscle group plays a critical role in providing segmental stability in response to changes in posture and protection against sudden movements.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^7d73528f]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We found 671 citations through our initial online database search. After removal of duplicates, 420 records remained and were screened as per our selection criteria. Of these, 218 were excluded because of lack of relevance to the topic of interest to answer the proposed research questions and study objectives. An additional 8 studies were excluded due to language other than English and unable to retrieve full text. The remaining 194 full-text articles were included, comprising of meta-analysis, systematic reviews, clinical and narrative reviews, randomized clinical trials, prospective, retrospective, observational clinical studies, population based and basic science studies. Key findings were presented along the results section in a thematic organization with figures and in a descriptive format contrasting the literature to highlight critical and emerging principles related to multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation.

Definition of concepts

The multifidus muscle

The role of the lumbar multifidus muscle (MM) is well established as the strongest spine stabilizer, accounting for more than two-thirds of spinal stiffness, providing intersegmental spinal stability, withstanding compressive loading and preventing shear forces of the lumbar spine. The deep multifidus is a group of medially oriented, short fibers that provide compression to maintain intersegmental spinal control by attaching superiorly to the laminae of L1–L5 and inferiorly to the mamillary process of vertebrae one level below. The intermediate multifidus fascicle is longer, spanning across three to four spinal segments and carries mixed stabilizing and mobilizing functions. Finally, the superficial multifidus is progressively longer with fibers crossing up to five segments and is responsible for generating end-range spinal extension in concert with the erector spinae group (longissimus and iliocostalis). The middle branches of the dorsal ramus of the LMBN are found deep into the lumbar intertransversarii muscles and are responsible to innervate the MM, however there is debate if the muscle is segmentally or polysegmentally innervated. Importantly, a unique feature of MM architecture is that it possesses a greater cross-sectional area than the other spinal muscles. As such, the bilateral multifidi exert large compressive force over a small excursion, yielding stabilization of spinal segments rather than gross spinal movement. Additionally, deep MM architecture contains a dense number of muscle spindles, which are strategically positioned combined with joint mechanoreceptors to provide proprioceptive feedback to the central nervous system, playing a critical role in neuromuscular control and spinal stability.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^63ad6a7b]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Another novel MRI-based approach that may provide important information related to LBP is CSE-MRI for assessment of paraspinal muscle quality, which may not be well characterized on routine MRI. This approach permits spatial measurements of fat fraction within the paraspinal muscles (e.g. erector spinae or multifidus muscles). Paraspinal muscle fat fractions showed significant correlations to isometric muscle strength as well as vertebral BM fat fractions, hence potentially reflecting the actual (patho)physiological muscle status. Furthermore, in a study investigating the interplay between vertebral endplate pathology and paraspinal muscle quality in patients with chronic LBP, cartilage endplate defects at the lower lumbar spine were predictive of pain when adjacent to paraspinal musculature with increased fat fractions. Yet the distinct role of paraspinal musculature and particularly the fat fraction as a quantitative parameter remain largely unclear to date in patients with LBP.

While the efforts of the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group focus on the spine with distinct SOPs for spinal MRI protocols, it has to be acknowledged that particularly in patients suffering from chronic LBP, perceived pain may not only relate to the level of the spine. Thus, novel conceptualizations and mechanistic descriptors that involve interactions and structures beyond the lumbar spine might play an important role as well. Specifically, besides nociceptive pain (arising from ongoing input from tissue injury) and neuropathic pain (arising from injury to the peripheral or central nervous system), the concept of nociplastic pain has been described for chronic pain states that are not related to obvious nociceptor activation or neuropathy, whereas clinical and psychophysical findings suggest alterations in nociceptive function. As such, nociplastic pain can stem from altered pain-related sensory pathways that relate to enhanced sensitivity, and thus nociplastic pain may exist either as a comorbid or isolated state in patients with chronic pain that has been predominantly characterized as nociceptive or neuropathic. Particularly patients suffering from non-specific chronic LBP may show a continuum of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic components, with related increased activation of brain regions that contribute to the processing of pain and other sensory functions. Concerning patients with such mixed pain, lumbar MRI may contribute to the detection of the site that initiated pain, but imaging of central mechanisms (e.g. by functional MRI of the brain) might be needed to provide a more complete picture of the complex individual pain states.

### Multifidus muscle contractility deficit was not specific to the painful side in patients with chronic low back pain during remission: a cross-sectional study [^73fb6514]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is one of the leading causes of musculoskeletal problems with a great negative impact on society because of its global burden of disability. It affects nearly 60% to 80% of all populations throughout their lifetime. Once individuals suffer from low back pain, the recurrence rate throughout their lifetime will be approximately between 60% and 70% per year. Several studies have suggested lumbar multifidus muscle (LM) impairment might be a key factor contributing to low back pain. Studies also found that LM cannot be automatically recovered even after remission stage; therefore, it should be responsible for persistent/recurrent symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).

LM is one of the deep trunk muscles responsible for static and dynamic stability of the lumbar spine.LM controls stability of the lumbar spine by stiffening the spine and takes part in more than two-thirds of the stiffness of the lumbar spine. Morphology studies using magnetic resonance image (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated reduction in LM cross-sectional area (CSA) bilaterally regardless of the side of pain. Functional studies using electromyography (EMG) demonstrated reduction in LM activation in both painful and non-painful sides in patients with CLBP. Recently, rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) has been commonly used in clinical settings to evaluate LM contractility in patients with CLBP. Several studies demonstrated bilateral changes in LM morphology and activation regardless of side of pain. These changes are also related to muscle contractility. Therefore, questions remain whether any difference in LM contractility exists between left and right sides in healthy individuals, as well as painful and non-painful sides in patients with CLBP when using RUSI.

### Integrating ultrasound-guided multifidus injections with repeated peripheral magnetic stimulation for low back pain: a feasibility study [^ff85e0e2]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the rationale for administering the injection before rPMS is based on the promptness of treatment effects and the number of sessions required. US-guided injections for affected muscles can result in significant pain reduction after just one session, as shown by a recent narrative review on the use of US imaging and guidance in managing myofascial pain syndrome. In contrast, rPMS requires multiple sessions to achieve significant benefits for patients with LBP, as demonstrated by the meta-analysis by Diao et al. Therefore, to provide patients with rapid and sustained pain relief, we first administer US-guided injections for the multifidus muscle, followed by rPMS.

The current investigation is constrained by several limitations. First, the retrospective design had been applied on the present research, whereas recall bias and participant self-selection might be a potential source of bias. Second, the inclusion of only three cases limits the study's representativeness, so the data should be interpreted with caution. Third, the study only includes one treatment (and no control) arm, therefore it cannot exclude pain relief solely to natural recovery. Moving forward, there is a critical need for a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing intervention with a control (or placebo) arm to provide clearer insights. Furthermore, if a randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the future, a sample size calculation is necessary to ensure the adequate power to detect the difference between our developed combination therapy and the controlled treatment.

### The relationship of lumbar multifidus muscle morphology to previous, current, and future low back pain: a 9-year population-based prospective cohort study [^25973265]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Population based prospective cohort study.

Objective

We explored the cross-sectional relationships between lumbar multifidus (LM) intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) infiltration and low back pain (LBP) at 3 successive time points and investigated the role of IMAT in predicting the occurrence of LBP after 5 and 9 years.

Summary Of Background Data

Although LBP is a major source of disease burden, the biological determinants of LBP are poorly understood.

Methods

Participants were 40-year-old adults randomly sampled from a Danish population and followed up at 45 and 49 years of age. At each time point, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and reported ever having had LBP, LBP in the previous year, nontrivial LBP in the previous year, or a history of pain radiating into the legs. Pixel intensity and frequencies from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images identified the greatest proportion of LM IMAT at the L4 and L5 spinal levels. IMAT infiltration was categorized as normal/mild, moderate, or severe based on tertile divisions. Associations were explored with crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) from logistic regression models. Model covariates included sex, body mass index, and occupational and leisure time physical activity.

Results

A total of 401 participants were enrolled, with 331 (83%) and 286 (71%) participants followed up at 5 and 9 years, respectively. The cross-sectional analyses demonstrated that at the age of 40 years, participants with severe IMAT infiltration demonstrated increased odds of ever experiencing LBP (aOR [95% confidence interval, 95% CI] = 3.16 [1.45–6.89]), nontrivial LBP (aOR [95% CI] = 2.82 [1.36–5.81]), LBP in the past year (aOR [95% CI] = 1.95 [1.07–3.53]), and leg pain (aOR [95% CI] = 2.08 [1.19–3.62]). There were no consistent cross-sectional associations between LBP/leg pain and LM IMAT at 45 or 49 years of age and LM IMAT did not predict future LBP or leg pain.

Conclusion

The relationship between LM IMAT and LBP/leg pain is inconsistent and may be modified by age.

### Changes in the cross-sectional area of multifidus and psoas in patients with unilateral back pain: the relationship to pain and disability [^079d76bf]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, cross-sectional observational study.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine if there was an association between wasting of psoas and multifidus as observed on MRI scans and the presenting symptoms, reported pathology, pain, or disability of a cohort of patients presenting with unilateral low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Current physiotherapy practice is often based on localized spine stabilizing muscle exercises; most attention has been focused on transversus abdominus and multifidus with relatively little on psoas.

Method

Fifty consecutive patients presenting to a back pain triage clinic with unilateral low back pain lasting more than 12 weeks were recruited. The cross-sectional surface area (CSA) of the muscles was measured. Duration of symptoms, rating of pain, self-reported function, and the presence of neural compression were recorded.

Results

Data analysis compared the CSA between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides. There was a statistically significant difference in CSA between the sides (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the percentage decrease in CSA of psoas on the affected side and with the rating of pain (rho = 0.608, P < 0.01), reported nerve root compression (rho = 0.812, P < 0.01), and the duration of symptoms (rho = 0.886, P < 0.01). There was an association between decrease in the CSA of multifidus and duration of symptoms.

Conclusions

Atrophy of multifidus has been used as one of the rationales for spine stabilization exercises. The evidence of coexisting atrophy of psoas and multifidus suggests that a future area for study should be selective exercise training of psoas, which is less commonly used in clinical practice.

### Does motor control exercise restore normal morphology of lumbar multifidus muscle in people with low back pain? – A systematic review [^234b10c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared to asymptomatic individuals, some patients with acute or chronic LBP demonstrate morphometric and/or functional changes in LMM (eg, reduced cross-sectional area (CSA), increased intramuscular fatty infiltration, decreased resting thickness, and percentage thickness changes during maximum voluntary isometric contractionor contralateral arm lift). However, no significant relation between CSA/fatty infiltration of LMM and LBP has also been reported. Although LMM atrophy may be specific to the location and the side of symptoms, prolonged immobilization may also result in general LMM atrophy. Given the close association between LMM and LBP, one rehabilitation approach is to improve the function and morphology of LMM. Of various physiotherapy interventions, motor control exercise (MCE) is thought to be able to restore LMM morphology and function in patients with LBP. Multiple studies have investigated the effectiveness of MCE in restoring normal LMM morphometry, or decreasing LBP among patients with CLBP. Some found that MCE increased LMM sizes in these patients, Although a recent Cochrane review found low- to moderate-quality evidence to support MCE in inducing clinically meaningful pain reduction in patients with CLBP as compared to different kinds of controls including sham intervention and education, no review has summarized the effectiveness of MCE in concomitantly restoring LMM morphology and reducing LBP. Further, temporal relations between post-MCE changes in LMM morphology and changes in pain intensity/LBP-related disability among patients with LBP have not been summarized. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence regarding (1) the effectiveness of MCE in restoring normal LMM morphometry and decreasing LBP; and (2) whether the post-treatment changes in morphology were associated with changes in pain and/or function of patients with LBP.

### The morphology and composition of paravertebral muscles evaluated by MRI technology are used to predict low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c2c15b0]. Academic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The socioeconomic burden of low back pain (LBP) is increasing, and two potential triggers of LBP (disc degeneration and paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration) have attracted significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have proposed that LBP is related to the morphology and composition of paraspinal muscles. However, the results remain conflicting and controversial.

Purpose

This study aims to review and analyze the imaging findings of paraspinal muscle (Multifidus[MF], erector spinae [ES], psoas major[PM], quadratus lumborum[QL]) morphology (functional cross-sectional area[FCSA] = total cross-sectional area[TCSA]-fatty infiltration[FI]) and compositional alterations (FI) in individuals with and without LBP, to investigate the relationship between these changes and LBP, and to investigate the value of the morphology and composition of the paraspinal muscles in predicting pain and dysfunction in patients with LBP.

Methods

A comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify eligible studies up to 31st August 2024. This search was restricted to English-language articles investigating the association between the FCSA and FI of paraspinal muscle in people with LBP compared with a control group without LBP. A total of 2366 articles were identified, of which 50 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Literature quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and 17 of the eligible articles were included in the Meta-analysis.

Results

This meta-analysis included 17 studies investigating paraspinal muscle alterations in patients with low back pain (LBP). The pooled analysis revealed a significant reduction in the functional cross-sectional area (FCSA) of the multifidus muscle (SMD = -0.369, 95% CI = -0.581 to -0.156, P = 0.001), accompanied by increased fat infiltration in both the multifidus (SMD = 0.583, 95% CI = 0.259 to 0.908, P < 0.001) and erector spinae muscles (SMD = 0.235, 95% CI = 0.103 to 0.367, P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the FCSA of the erector spinae, psoas major, or quadratus lumborum muscles, nor in the fat infiltration of the psoas major. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a pronounced reduction in multifidus FCSA at the L 4–5 level (SMD = -0.505, 95% CI = -0.722 to -0.287, P < 0.001), indicating significant muscle quality deterioration in LBP patients.

Conclusion

The morphology and composition of the MF muscle are altered in individuals with LBP, characterized by reduced MF muscles, particularly at the L 4–5 level, and increased FI compared to healthy controls. Additionally, a slight increase in fatty infiltration is observed in the erector spinae muscles of low back pain patients.

### Imaging strategies for low-back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis [^38e832ce]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Some clinicians do lumbar imaging routinely or in the absence of historical or clinical features suggestive of serious low-back problems. We investigated the effects of routine, immediate lumbar imaging versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging on clinical outcomes in patients with low-back pain and no indication of serious underlying conditions.

Methods

We analysed randomised controlled trials that compared immediate lumbar imaging (radiography, MRI, or CT) versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging for low-back pain. These trials reported pain or function (primary outcomes), quality of life, mental health, overall patient-reported improvement (based on various scales), and patient satisfaction in care received. Six trials (n = 1804) met inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers with criteria adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Meta-analyses were done with a random effects model.

Findings

We did not record significant differences between immediate lumbar imaging and usual care without immediate imaging for primary outcomes at either short-term (up to 3 months, standardised mean difference 0.19, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.39 for pain and 0.11, -0.29 to 0.50 for function, negative values favour routine imaging) or long-term (6–12 months, -0.04, -0.15 to 0.07 for pain and 0.01, -0.17 to 0.19 for function) follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Trial quality, use of different imaging methods, and duration of low-back pain did not affect the results, but analyses were limited by small numbers of trials. Results are most applicable to acute or subacute low-back pain assessed in primary-care settings.

Interpretation

Lumbar imaging for low-back pain without indications of serious underlying conditions does not improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should refrain from routine, immediate lumbar imaging in patients with acute or subacute low-back pain and without features suggesting a serious underlying condition.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^df584082]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Restorative neurostimulation for patients with mechanical chronic low back pain and impaired neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine | A new treatment paradigm [^461aa5a2]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a symptom of an underlying pathology. There are distinct phenotypes of CLBP, including neuropathic, nociplastic and nociceptive, or mechanical CLBP. We present a comprehensive clinical overview of restorative neurostimulation for refractory, disabling, mechanical CLBP. Impaired neuromuscular control and consequent degeneration of the multifidus muscles are implicated in the development and persistence of mechanical low back pain. Restorative neurostimulation targets these processes and aims to reverse these degenerative changes in the muscles and mechanoreceptor in the muscle spindles and, therefore, restore motor control of the multifidus muscles, playing an important role for functional stability of the lumbar spine. We detail the theory and rationale of the technology as well as appropriate patient identification and current trial evidence in this comprehensive overview of restorative neurostimulation.

Future Landscape and Indication Expansion

Presently, there are limited therapeutic options to address this specific etiology of lower back pain. Therapeutic options for low back pain involve corticosteroid injections or ablation of nerves, which transmit nociceptive pain signals. These traditionally involve repeated procedures with temporary and palliative pain relief. Furthermore, the use of palliative treatments may often lead to further weakening of the multifidi muscles resulting in motor dysfunction and sagittal imbalance, and as a result, worsened functional instability. This not only worsens the debility of the patient but also strains the medical system. Multifidi stimulation dramatically changes the treatment paradigm, focusing on restoration of function and potentially ending the need for ongoing procedures.

With evidence supporting the use of restorative neurostimulation in the lumbosacral spine, application to address various other chronic pain etiologies is a natural evolution. For example, future studies in axial neck and thoracic spine pain may also demonstrate meaningful treatment effects.

In the original Reactiv8-A and B studies, patients with prior history of spine surgeries were excluded. The purpose of those original studies was to study the effectiveness of restorative therapy for low back pain without the addition of confounding variables. Post-laminectomy syndrome (also called failed back surgery syndrome, FBSS), used to describe patients that present with persistent or recurring low back pain, with or without referred pain to the lower extremities, is quite common. The incidence of FBSS, depending on the type of surgery performed, is estimated to be between 10% and 40%. The pathogenesis of FBSS is primarily structural. Myofascial pain can also be a pain generator, secondary to intraoperative insult to the muscles, and compounded by postural changes in the postoperative period. Clinically, multifidus atrophy as a result of underlying inhibition and functional instability may be observed in these patients at the unfused segmental levels. In patients where the innervation and musculature near the painful level remain intact, restorative neurostimulation may potentially provide clinical benefits. This may be another subject of a future clinical trial.

A common sequela of fusion is adjacent segment disease. This occurs secondary to the displacement of physiologic stresses placed above and below previously fused levels. The use of neurostimulation to improve functional stability may potentially deter or postpone the onset of this issue.

Restorative neurostimulation may be applied to non-spinal anatomical targets where there are radiographic or clinical findings of muscle atrophy and/or functional instability. Examples of targets include peripheral joints – where both radiofrequency ablation and peripheral nerve stimulation have been used with increased frequency.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1e7886e2]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Lumbar multifidus dysfunction — exercise and stimulation considerations are described as follows: Core stabilization exercises have traditionally been recommended for managing generalized low back pain symptoms and are suitable for patients with spinal instability due to muscle weakness or imbalance, yet many patients find it challenging to perform targeted multifidus exercises due to pain and arthrogenic muscle inhibition can further impede contractions. Researchers have explored transcutaneous stimulation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles in older adults with chronic low back pain, but selective transcutaneous stimulation of the multifidus muscle is not possible because directly stimulating muscle mass requires significantly more energy than stimulating the motor nerve, and many participants find the energy required to transcutaneously activate the deeper multifidus fascicles to be painful.

### Does paraspinal muscle morphometry predict functional status and re-operation after lumbar spinal surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^28db4265]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Whether paraspinal muscle degeneration is related to poor clinical outcomes after lumbar surgery is still indistinct, which limits its clinical application. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of paraspinal muscle morphology on functional status and re-operation after lumbar spinal surgery.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted using a total of 6917 articles identified from a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases through September 2022. A full-text review of 140 studies was conducted based on criteria including an objective assessment of preoperative paraspinal muscle morphology including multifidus (MF), erector spinae (ES), and psoas major (PS) in addition to measuring its relationship to clinical outcomes including Oswestry disability index (ODI), pain and revision surgery. Meta-analysis was performed when required metrics could be calculated in ≥ three studies, otherwise vote counting model was a good alternative to show the effect direction of evidence. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

Results

A total of 10 studies were included in this review. Of them, five studies with required metrics were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis suggested that higher preoperative fat infiltration (FI) of MF could predict higher postoperative ODI scores (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.50, p = 0.0001). For postoperative pain, MF FI could also be an effective predictor for persistent low back pain after surgery (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.02–0.31, p = 0.03). However, in the vote count model, limited evidence was presented for the prognostic effects of ES and PS on postoperative functional status and symptoms. In terms of revision surgery, there was conflicting evidence that FI of MF and ES could predict the incidence of revision surgery in the vote count model.

Conclusion

The assessment of MF FI could be a viable method to stratify patients with lumbar surgery by the risk of severe functional disability and low back pain.

Key Points

- The fat infiltration of multifidus can predict postoperative functional status and low back pain after lumbar spinal surgery.

- The preoperative evaluation of paraspinal muscle morphology is conducive for surgeons.

### Are MRI-defined fat infiltrations in the multifidus muscles associated with low back pain? [^7c2d598a]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study provide the first convincing evidence from a large population sample that fat infiltration in the LMM is strongly associated with LBP in adults. This association was not affected by body mass index, type of work, or the level of physical activity during leisure time. However, the associations seem to be more pronounced in women. It will be necessary to investigate in prospective studies whether there is also a causal link, and if so, whether the fat infiltration is the cause of LBP or vice versa. Furthermore, it would be useful to confirm whether fat infiltration in the LMM is reversible, as indicated in two previous studies, and if so, whether this reversibility coincides with improvement of symptoms.

Fat infiltration was identified in 81% of the adult study sample but in only 14% of the adolescents. High prevalence rates have also been reported in previous studies including patients and controls, and fat infiltration has previously been noted to be more common in older people. The fact that fat infiltration is more common in adults does suggest that it is the LBP that causes muscle degeneration and that in adolescents, the LBP has not yet lasted sufficiently long to produce such changes. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the extent to which age and LBP contribute to the development of fat in the LMM.

The marked differences in fat in the LMM in males and females may be a result of the well-documented differences in body composition. It appears that the higher proportion of body fat in females is also reflected in the proportion of fat in the LMM. This raises the question as to whether grading should be different for males and females. Furthermore, the high prevalence rate of slight fat infiltration in the LMM indicates a need to change the cut-off point used for grading.

Not only was fat infiltration uncommon in adolescents but there was also no significant association between it and LBP. These results should be interpreted with caution: the intra-observer and interobserver reliability for the adolescents' MRI scans were unsatisfactory, and the validity of the LBP variables debatable. Reasons for the poor reliability in reading MRI may be the long time span between the readings in the intra-observer section and poor consensus in the interobserver section. The observed discrepancies in reporting LBP from interviews and questionnaires probably originates from a lack of understanding of the anatomic area of interest, and from difficulties in defining LBP in each individual. Future studies should carefully address these methodological issues.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Twenty-five healthy individuals (NoLBP group; 10 males and 15 females) and 35 with CLBP (CLBP group; 16 males and 19 females; 23 unilateral pain and 12 bilateral pain) aged between 20 and 40 years were recruited. The inclusion criteria for NoLBP group were no previous episodes of LBP, while inclusion criteria for CLBP were having LBP greater than three months, but currently pain-free, or a recurrent pattern of low back symptoms at least two episodes that interfered with activities of daily living or required treatment. The exclusion criteria were 1) clinical signs of systemic disease, 2) definitive neurological signs including pain, weakness, or numbness in the lower extremity, 3) previous spinal surgery, 4) diagnosed osteoporosis, severe spinal stenosis, or inflammatory joint disease, 5) body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2 and 6) active treatment of another medical illness that would preclude participation in any aspect of the study. This study was a part of an intervention study; therefore, we did not calculate sample size.

Instruments and Measures

A B-mode rehabilitative ultrasound imaging device (RUSI; model CX50, Philips, NV, USA) with a broadband linear array (model L12-3) transducer was used to measure bilateral LM thickness at L4-5 facet joint (2 cm lateral to the lower half of the L4 spinous process) under three conditions including resting, maximum voluntary isometric contraction and combined MVIC with electrical stimulation. The tip of the L4-5 facet joint and thoracolumbar fascia in the RUSI image were used to measure LM thickness. Our previous work demonstrated that RUSI was valid and reliable to measure LM thickness.

### Effect of ultrasound-guided hydrorelease of the multifidus muscle on acute low back pain [^f2eb8d2a]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is more common in men than in women. As per the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions in Japan (June 2013), most patients with LBP who visit outpatient orthopedic clinics are men. The cause of LBP may be multifactorial (e.g. related to muscles, fascia, intervertebral discs, facet joints, metastatic bone disease, degenerative bone disease, and nerve roots). LBP has various phases: acute, which lasts up to 4 weeks after onset; subacute, lasting for 4 to 12 weeks; and chronic, lasting for more than 12 weeks. 1 Moreover, 85% of the cases present with nonspecific LBP, which is related to the muscles, fascia, intervertebral discs, facet joints, and nerve roots among others; diagnosis is often difficult. 2, 3

Muscular LBP, a form of acute LBP, is experienced by 85% of people during their lifetime. Several muscles in the lumbar muscle group, including the multifidus, longissimus, iliocostalis, and quadratus lumborum muscles, can be cited as causes; however, the multifidus muscle, being greatly involved in the stability of the lumbar vertebra, plays an important role. 4, 5, 6, 7

Although many reports have evaluated the limb trunk muscles for fatty degeneration, muscle mass, signs of infection, and other abnormal findings using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 these tests are expensive, time‐consuming, and present only a static evaluation. Ultrasound examination is useful because it is rapid and noninvasive compared with other examinations. 7, 11 It also presents a dynamic evaluation of the lesion site. Ultrasound is not inferior to CT or MRI in terms of diagnostic accuracy, depending on the site, but diagnostic accuracy requires optimization of the technique and good understanding of anatomic characteristics. 13, 14, 15

### Predictors of clinical success with stabilization exercise are associated with lower levels of lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue in patients with low back pain [^b9e5561e]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose: Investigate the construct validity of prognostic factors purported to predict clinical success with stabilization exercise for low back pain by exploring their associations with lumbar multifidus composition. Methods: Patients with low back pain were recruited from a hospital imaging department. The presence of fivepredictors (age < 40years, positive prone instability test, aberrant trunk flexion movements, straight leg raise range of motion > 91°, spinal hypermobility) were identified by standardized physical examination. Predictors were grouped by total positive findings and status on a clinical prediction rule. The proportion of lower lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue was measured with 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging. Univariate and multivariate associations were examined with linear regression and reported with standardized beta coefficients (β) and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Data from 62 patients (11 female) with mean (SD) age of 45.2 (11.8) years were included. Total number of predictors (β[95% CI] = -0.37[-0.61,-0.12]; R2 = 0.12), positive prediction rule status (β[95% CI] = -0.57[-0.79,-0.35]; R2 = 0.30), and age < 40years were associated with lower intramuscular adipose tissue (β[95% CI] = -0.55[-0.77,-0.33]; R2 = 0.27). No other individual factors were associated with lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue. Conclusions: These findings support the construct validity of the grouped prognostic criteria. Future research should examine the clinical utility of these criteria. Implications for RehabilitationLow back pain is the single largest cause of disability worldwide and exercise therapy is recommended by international low back pain treatment guidelines. Lower levels of lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue were associated with predictors of clinical success with stabilization exercise. Higher proportions of lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue may help identify patients who require longer duration exercise training, or those who are unlikely to respond to stabilization exercise.

### Morphology versus function: the relationship between lumbar multifidus intramuscular adipose tissue and muscle function among patients with low back pain [^d44de1f9]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the bivariate and multivariate relations between fatty degeneration of the lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM) and LMM function among patients with low back pain (LBP).

Design

Cross-sectional clinical study.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

Patients with LBP (N = 70) referred for lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

LMM morphology and function were measured at the L4/L5 and L5/S1 spinal levels bilaterally. Quantitative measures of LMM intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Function was assessed with ultrasound imaging by measuring change in LMM thickness during a submaximal contraction task. The study participants self-reported their level of LBP-related disability (Modified Oswestry Index), pain intensity (numerical pain rating scale), and physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire). Bivariate and multivariate relations between LMM morphology and function were explored with correlational and hierarchical linear regression analyses, respectively. Additionally, we explored for possible covariates with potential to modify the relation between LMM IMAT and function.

Results

There were 70 participants (12 women) enrolled in the study (mean age, 45.4 ± 11.9y). A high level of physical activity was reported by 45.5% of participates. Age, sex, and physical activity level demonstrated variable relations with LMM IMAT and LMM function. There were no significant bivariate or multivariate relations between LMM IMAT and LMM function.

Conclusions

We observed higher levels of physical activity and LMM function and less LMM IMAT than previous studies involving patients with LBP. There was no relation between LMM morphology and function in this cohort of patients with LBP. Issues specific to LMM measurement and recommendations for future research are discussed.

### Improved activation of lumbar multifidus following spinal manipulation: a case report applying rehabilitative ultrasound imaging [^f46520eb]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

The use of spinal manipulation as a treatment to facilitate neuromuscular control of the paraspinal musculature is not well described in the literature. The use of rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) may offer a convenient way to investigate and document possible changes occurring in the lumbar multifidus associated with manipulation intervention.

Case Description

The patient was a 33-year-old male with a 21-year history of low back pain and left posterior thigh pain who presented with lumbar hypomobility and met a previously published clinical prediction rule for spinal manipulation. During examination, the patient was asked to perform a prone upper extremity lifting task to assess activation in the lumbar multifidus during an automatic task. Through palpation the examiner noted a decreased contraction of the left multifidus between L4-S1 compared to the right. To explore this further, a decision was made to assess the multifidus with RUSI, which confirmed the activation deficit noted during palpation. A lumbar regional manipulation was performed with the intention of reducing spinal hypomobility and of assessing changes in multifidus activation. Imaging of the multifidus muscles at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels were obtained premanipulation, immediately postmanipulation, and 1 day after manipulation.

Outcomes

An increased ability to thicken the multifidus during a prone upper extremity lifting task was noted immediately and 1 day after manipulation. Average percent change in thickness at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels with the prone arm lift was 3.6% premanipulation, 17.2% immediately postmanipulation, and 20.6% approximately 24 hours postmanipulation. Improvements in the thickening of the multifidus muscle during the upper extremity lifting task were greater than 3 standard errors of the measurement. Other changes included immediate palpable improvement in the contraction of the multifidus during the upper extremity lifting task, along with the patient report of increased ease of lifting.

Discussion

In this case report we quantified the short-term influence of spinal manipulation on multifidus muscular activation using RUSI. No cause-and-effect claims can be made; however, the results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation may influence multifidus muscle function. RUSI offers a convenient way to investigate and document these changes.

### Changes in multifidus and abdominal muscle size in response to microgravity: possible implications for low back pain research [^f96fde63]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

In microgravity, muscle atrophy occurs in the intrinsic muscles of the spine, with changes also observed in the abdominal muscles. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station and on Earth following space flight to remediate these effects. Similar effects have been seen on Earth in prolonged bed rest studies and in people with low back pain (LBP). The aim of this case report was to examine the effects of microgravity, exercise in microgravity and post-flight rehabilitation on the size of the multifidus and antero-lateral abdominal muscles.

Methods

Ultrasound imaging was used to assess size of the multifidus, transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles at four time points: pre-flight and after daily rehabilitation on day one (R + 1), day 8 (R + 8) and day 14 (R + 14) after return to Earth (following 6 months in microgravity).

Results

Exercises in microgravity maintained multifidus size at L2-L4, however, after spaceflight, size of the multifidus muscle at L5 was reduced, size of the internal oblique muscle was increased and size of transversus abdominis was reduced. Rehabilitation post-space flight resulted in hypertrophy of the multifidus muscle to pre-mission size at the L5 vertebral level and restoration of antero-lateral abdominal muscle size.

Conclusions

Exercise in space can prevent loss of spinal intrinsic muscle size. For the multifidus muscles, effectiveness varied at different levels of the spine. Post-mission rehabilitation targeting specific motor control restored muscle balance between the antero-lateral abdominal and multifidus muscles, similar to results from intervention trials for people with LBP. A limitation of the current investigation is that only one astronaut was studied, however, the microgravity model could be valuable as predictable effects on trunk muscles can be induced and interventions evaluated.

This study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center, retrospective study with limited size. Ideally, a prospective and multi-center comparison would have been required. Second, the results are not representative of all ages and races, as data on young and middle-aged patients are lacking. Third, we did not include the psoas major muscle, considering that it is not significantly altered in LBP and lumbar degenerative disease, since multifidus and erector play a more decisive role. Fourth, the samples enrolled were of less advanced stage with fewer Modic changes (only 8 cases). Therefore, to reduce bias, these factors were not included in the risk factor analysis.

### An implantable restorative-neurostimulator for refractory mechanical chronic low back pain: a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial [^eafa5bd6]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide and often a determinant for chronic opioid use. In the United States, direct healthcare spending on low back and neck pain is estimated at $87.6 billion and growing at a rate of 6.5% annually, and indirect costs including disability benefits and days of work missed are estimated to be as high as $624.8 billion. Most cases of acute low back pain (LBP) resolve spontaneously without treatment, but chronic LBP (CLBP) is far less likely to resolve on its own. Patients with CLBP often endure impaired quality of life, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance.

The majority of patients with CLBP have no indication for spine surgery but are suffering from mechanical (musculoskeletal) pain that is predominantly nociceptive. Although nonsurgical treatments, including physical therapy, chiropractic care, nonopioid and opioid medications, injections, and medial branch rhizotomy, provide modest relief and improved function for some, they are ineffective or provide only transient relief for many. Although spinal cord stimulation is an option to be considered for individuals who have failed multiple other treatments and have disabling symptoms related to neuropathic leg and LBP, it is not considered appropriate for the treatment of mechanical CLBP.

Mechanical CLBP is often associated with impaired motor control and degeneration of the multifidus muscles, which play an important role in providing segmental control of functional lumbar spine stability. Acute back pain–induced disruption of proprioceptive signaling is believed to facilitate long-term motor control changes via cortical reorganization. This hypothesis is supported by experimental and clinical findings. For example, experimentally induced disk or nerve root injury reduces multifidus neural drive, and in patients with mechanical CLBP, electromyographic activity and ability to recruit the multifidus muscle is diminished.

Although motor control exercises for mechanical CLBP seem to be more effective in the short-term than other exercises, their long-term effectiveness is limited. One possible explanation for this is that isolated muscle activation, which is required to reverse impaired motor control, is difficult to achieve voluntarily, especially in the presence of underlying inhibition of the multifidus muscle. Furthermore, the structural changes in the muscle and cortical remodeling observed in patients with mechanical CLBP are likely to require longer treatment duration.

### Quality of lumbar paraspinal muscles in patients with chronic low back pain and its relationship to pain duration, pain intensity, and quality of life [^589ff497]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the relationship between the quality of paraspinal muscles and pain intensity, duration, and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP).

Methods

Between January 2022 and December 2023, 119 individuals with no-back pain (no-BP) and 136 cLBP patients were enrolled. Both groups underwent health surveys and magnetic resonance imaging. Cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and fat infiltration (FI) of multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES) were measured. Data were analyzed using multiple linear and binary logistic regression.

Results

Compared to the cLBP group, the no-BP group had smaller CSA influenced by FI of ES at L5/S1 (p = 0.01), higher FCSA of ES (p < 0.01) at L4/L5, and lower FI of ES and MF at L4/L5 and L5/S1 (p < 0.01). CSA, FCSA, and FI showed no significant correlation with cLBP intensity except for the CSA (p = 0.02) and FCSA (p = 0.03) of the L2/3 MF. Pain duration positively correlated with FI at L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5 of MF and ES (p < 0.05) and CSA of the L1/2 MF (p = 0.02). CSA (L3/4, L4/5, and L5/S1) and FCSA (L4/5, L5/S1) of MF correlated positively with SF36 scores (p < 0.05), while ES muscles did not (p > 0.05). FI of MF and ES showed no correlation with SF36 scores.

Conclusion

CSA and FI were significantly higher, and FCSA significantly lower in paraspinal muscles of cLBP patients compared to asymptomatic participants. Increased FI correlated with prolonged cLBP duration, indicating FI and FCSA alterations may play a significant role in cLBP development and duration.

Key Points

Question What is the relationship between paraspinal muscle quality and cLBP, including its intensity, duration, and impact on quality of life? Findings cLBP patients had increased FI and reduced functional muscle area in paraspinal muscles, with FI correlating with prolonged pain duration. Clinical relevance Understanding the changes in lumbar paraspinal muscles provides insight into cLBP progression, guiding personalized interventions to improve pain management and patient quality of life.

### Effect of opioid vs nonopioid medications on pain-related function… [^730db1f2]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was pain-related function over 12 months and the main secondary outcome was pain intensity. For both BPI scales, a 1-point improvement was clinically important. The primary adverse outcome was medication-related symptoms. Pain intensity was significantly better in the nonopioid group over 12 months; mean 12-month BPI severity was 4. 0 for the opioid group and
3. 5 for the nonopioid group. The primary outcome was pain-related function, assessed with the 7-item Brief Pain Inventory interference scale. 14 Pain intensity, the main secondary outcome, was assessed with the 4-item BPI severity scale. Both BPI scales yield 0 to 10 scores.

A prior study of chronic pain in primary care estimated a minimal clinically important difference of 0. 7 points for both BPI interference and BPI severity. 15 Following consensus guidelines, this trial used a 1-point difference as the MCID for BPI interference and BPI severity, and used a 30% reduction from baseline as MCID for moderate improvement. 16 The primary adverse outcome was a patient-reported checklist of 19 medication-related symptoms, 17 modified from the original version by adding common analgesic adverse effects.
18. Pain intensity was significantly better in the nonopioid group over 12 months. At 12 months, mean BPI severity was 4. 0 in the opioid group vs
3. 5 in the nonopioid group; difference, 0.
5. Functional response occurred in 69 patients in the opioid group vs 71 patients in the nonopioid group; difference, −1. 7%; P = 0. 79.

### Theoretical schemas to guide back pain consortium (BACPAC) chronic low back pain clinical research [^002d9a0b]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Peripheral Stimulus

Structural abnormalities of several different anatomic structures can be responsible for lumbar spine pain. Symptoms are typically associated with pathological alterations in the intervertebral disc, facet joints, sacroiliac joints, vertebral endplates, vertebral bodies, or the paraspinal muscles, although the reverse — that those pathological alterations regularly predict pain — is not necessarily true. Painful pathological features typically include matrix damage, neovascularization, neoinnervation, and inflammation. Some of these features can be detectable with advanced imaging techniques.

Four studies described data for peripheral tissue dysfunction, including discs (two RPFs with little SOE confidence), vertebra (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and facets (one RPF with little SOE confidence), in relation to cLBP classification, pain severity, and disability, as assessed by questionnaire. Local inflammatory changes and loading of sensitized nociceptors are potential mechanisms.

Anatomy

Anatomy refers to the shape and size of lumbosacral and brain structures. The shape and size of spinal structures (vertebrae, facets, intervertebral discs, sacroiliac joints, muscles, ligaments, and pelvis) influence the capacity of the spine to support loads and maintain the biomechanical stability of the spine. Also important are the brain areas involved in nociceptive processing (prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor areas, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem). Abnormalities of these spine and brain structures can increase risk.

Three studies compared transverse abdominis morphology or activity with clinical outcomes (one RFA with substantial non-association SOE confidence) and lumbar multifidi size and ultrasound characteristics with fat area, pain, motor control exercises, and electromyography findings (two RPFs with some SOE confidence).

Composite Factors

Three studies reported on the SOE for aggregate of measures that incorporate multiple domains. Consequently, these were organized separately.

### Integrating ultrasound-guided multifidus injections with repeated peripheral magnetic stimulation for low back pain: a feasibility study [^bf971879]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this preliminary investigation showed that the integration of US-guided facet and multifidus muscle injections with 12 sessions of rPMS significantly decreased LBP and increased the functional performance - without any adverse effects.

In 2023, Diao et alconducted a comprehensive meta-analysis investigating the effects of rPMS on pain intensity, functional mobility, and kinesiophobia in individuals affected by LBP. Employing a meticulous approach, they systematically scoured databases such as PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Eligible randomized controlled trials meeting specific criteria regarding the population suffering from low back pain, the intervention of rPMS, and outcomes associated with pain intensity, functional mobility, and kinesiophobia were considered for inclusion. Comparisons were drawn between participants subjected to rPMS and those in sham or alternative control groups pertaining to six randomized controlled trials (out of 733 studies) encompassing 139 participants. The findings revealed that rPMS exhibited noteworthy effectiveness in reducing both pain intensity and functional disability when contrasted with sham rPMS or other therapeutic approaches. However, the analysis did not discern any significant variance in kinesiophobia between the studied groups. The authors cautiously concluded that while rPMS may offer promise in alleviating pain intensity and enhancing functional disability among individuals with LBP, the evidence supporting this assertion ranged from very low to low quality. Nonetheless, the impact of rPMS on kinesiophobia remains uncertain based on the available data.

### Restorative neurostimulation: a clinical guide for therapy adoption [^977fcc58]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Imaging Criteria

Multifidus muscle atrophy often develops if inhibition goes untreated. Both ultrasound and MRI may be used to assess MF atrophy. Ultrasound may be used to measure the cross-sectional area of the muscle, while MRI allows for the measurement of the cross-sectional area, as well as the grade of fatty infiltration, of the multifidus muscle (Figure 4). Specifically, Grade 0 is a normal muscle with up to 10% of the cross-sectional area of the MF, Grade 1 is 10–50% and is considered a mild-to-moderate MF atrophy, Grade 2 is > 50% is considered moderate-severe MF atrophy. There is some dispute as to whether MF atrophy can be correlated with disability and function, There is, however, value when imaging is available to visualize the MF directly. MF atrophy itself should never be relied upon as a criterion for motor dysfunction. Rather, it is a direct indication of the level of degeneration present, which when correlated with history and physical examination, may prompt further evaluation of the MF.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^8d5a48ef]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for multifidus dysfunction and loss of neuromuscular control

Similar to other etiologies, CLBP associated with multifidus dysfunction should follow an evidence-based treatment algorithm focused on conservative methods first. These include activity modifications, concurrent medication management to provide temporary symptom relief to facilitate participation in an active physical therapy program. When conservative therapies are insufficient to offer durable symptom relief, restorative neurostimulation of the LMBN may be considered.

Motor control exercises and patient education

General spinal stabilization exercises have demonstrated inconsistent effects on the lumbar multifidus muscle structure and function in patients with CLBP. Motor control exercises may help reduce LBP disability and severity at short-term, particularly when combined with patient education. However, the general consensus is that there is limited evidence to support that motor control exercises is superior to other therapeutic exercises, which may be due to the difficulty in voluntary isolation of the multifidus, particularly in longstanding pain states with altered movement behaviors and cortical remodeling.

Restorative neurostimulation of the lumbar medial branch nerve

Restorative neurostimulation is a novel permanently implanted peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system that targets the motor fibers of the dorsal rami of the L2 LMBN, which through efferent neurostimulation results in bilateral multifidus muscle contractions. Currently, this is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved device to treat CLBP in the setting of multifidus dysfunction (ReActiv8 system; Mainstay Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). Several high-quality clinical studies have been published reporting long-term durable improvements (up to three years) in pain, disability, better quality of life, with individual studies also reporting decreased opioid use and health care utilization reduction.

### Are MRI-defined fat infiltrations in the multifidus muscles associated with low back pain? [^225f9007]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

MRI methods

In a pilot study, we investigated several methods and MRI protocols in order to achieve optimal distinction between the different muscles in the lumbar spine. An axial T1-weighted spin echo (300/26 repetition time/echo time, 120 × 256 matrix, 280-mm field of view, and 4-mm section thickness) was decided for this part of the study. The MRI system was an open low-field 0.2 T MR unit (Magnetom Open Viva, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany), and a body spine surface coil was used. The lumbar spine was imaged at the five lumbar levels. Slices were positioned from T1 (and in adolescents T2) median sagittal images tangentially to the posterior caudal corner of the upper vertebral body and perpendicularly to the surface of the lumbar muscles as illustrated in Figure 1. For the purposes of this study, only the three lower segments were evaluated.

Although several authors have used MRI to evaluate the erector spinae group, only one study focused specifically on the LMM. Our method varies from that study in terms of the positioning of images.

### Restorative neurostimulation: a clinical guide for therapy adoption [^7bdc9952]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Arthrogenic inhibition of the MF muscle is theorized to lead to impaired motor control, particularly of the deep fascicles that provide functional segmental stability. Electromyographic (EMG) studies have demonstrated altered timing of deep fascicle MF recruitment in patients with CLBP. Furthermore, CLBP may result in patient behavioral modifications that lead to further disuse, degeneration, and atrophy of the MF. A cycle of reduced neural drive and decreased lumbar spine stability results (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Illustration showing the three subsystems. Nociceptive pain signals leads decreased neural drive from the neuromuscular control unit. This lends to decrease in feedback and stability/movement of the multifidi.

Diagnostic tests and studies to evaluate the MF include MRI or ultrasound imaging, EMG studies and physical exam maneuvers, such as the prone instability test (PIT) and the multifidus lift test (MLT). Although EMG may be used to evaluate MF recruitment in patients with CLBP, the use of EMG for the evaluation of MF dysfunction has several limitations. Surface EMG is not sufficient to record activity from the deeper MF layers, thus necessitating the use of deep needle electrodes or fine wires. Even with the use of more invasive EMG approaches, it is difficult to definitively isolate deep fascicle MF activity from that of the surrounding deep lumbar back muscles. MRI and ultrasound imaging can provide further anatomic information, particularly to the size and make-up of the MF, but ultimately has little clinical utility in proving motor control dysfunction. Ultrasound imaging may demonstrate decreased changes in MF thickness after muscle activation in patients with low back pain, but it is unclear if these imaging results can be reliably used to predict treatment outcomes. Additionally, any pathological findings in imaging studies may have been pre-existing and not pain-related. Therefore, a neuromuscular physical examination is essential to diagnosing MF dysfunction as the etiology of CLBP.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^28b3009f]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

RFA-related degeneration of spinal anatomy and musculature

The multifidus muscle, the most medial of the deep intrinsic spinal muscles, contributes to segmental stability in the lumbar spine.RFA of the medial branches innervating the lumbar facet joints results in denervation of this muscle, but the physiological implications of this phenomenon are unclear. Dreyfuss et al conducted a study on five patients who had undergone unilateral lumbar RFA. MRI of the lumbar spine was performed 17–26 months after denervation. Diffuse atrophy of the lumbar multifidus was noted in all patients, but was not limited to the levels of RFA even though post-RFA electromyography indicated denervation of multifidus muscles only at the levels where RFA was performed. None of the patients had recurrence of pain or evidence of spinal instability. In a larger case series of 27 patients, MRI was done prior to and following lumbar RFA to assess the bulk of the multifidus, and for evidence of disc and facet joint degeneration. No change in muscle mass or degeneration of the facet joints was observed, although a greater amount of disc degeneration was noted compared with unaffected levels (14.9% vs 4.6%).

It is important to note that at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, it is the dorsal ramus itself that is targeted. Based on characteristic innervation patterns, this should result in segmental denervation of the iliocostalis (a component of the erector spinae muscle), which is involved in back extension through lateral branch innervation, and the longissimus muscle (another component of the erector spinae muscle), which helps maintain an erect spine and contributes to lateral flexion, and is innervated by the intermediate branch. However, the stronger contractions that are typically observed at the second to the fourth lumbar vertebral levels suggest that, at least in some people, the iliocostalis and longissimus muscles may also be stimulated during motor testing, and denervated during ablation. This hypothesis is supported by unpublished data showing that it is the contraction of the longissimus and iliocostalis muscles during facet joint nerve motor stimulation that is most prominent (unpublished data from Avanos, personal communication from Jeffrey Petersohn), and a case report demonstrating denervation of both the multifidus muscle and erector spinae muscle groups after lumbar facet RFA. Finally, loss of paraspinal extensor muscle action has been reported following multilevel, unilateral RFA for denervation of the upper cervical facet joints. This patient required surgical stabilization of the cervical spine.

### Effects of low-load motor control exercises and a high-load lifting exercise on lumbar multifidus thickness: a randomized controlled trial [^78799e84]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-load motor control (LMC) exercises and a high-load lifting (HLL) exercise, on lumbar multifidus (LM) thickness on either side of the spine and whether the effects were affected by pain intensity or change in pain intensity.

Summary Of Background Data

There is evidence that patients with low back pain (LBP) may have a decreased size of the LM muscles with an asymmetry between sides in the lower back. It has also been shown that LMC training can affect this asymmetry. It is, however, not known whether a high-load exercise has the same effect.

Methods

Sixty-five participants diagnosed with nociceptive mechanical LBP were included and randomized into LMC exercises or a HLL exercise, the deadlift. The LM thickness was measured using rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI), at baseline and after a 2-month training period.

Results

There were no differences between interventions regarding effect on LM muscle thickness. However, the analysis showed a significant effect for asymmetry. The thickness of the LM muscle on the small side increased significantly compared with the large side in both intervention groups, without influence of pain at baseline, or change in pain intensity.

Conclusion

At baseline, there was a difference in thickness of the LM muscles between sides. It seems that exercises focusing on spinal alignment may increase the thickness of the LM muscles on the small side, irrespective of exercise load. The increase in LM thickness does not appear to be mediated by either current pain intensity or the magnitude of change in pain intensity.

### Ultrasound and MRI-based evaluation of relationships between morphological and mechanical properties of the lower lumbar multifidus muscle in chronic low back pain [^97041b80]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purposes

While lumbar multifidus (MF) muscle alterations are linked to low back pain (LBP), the structure-function relationship is not fully understood. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between fatty degeneration of the lumbar MF muscle and its function in individuals with and without LBP.

Methods

The study included 25 participants with chronic nonspecific LBP and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent MRI assessment for MF fat infiltration, utilizing IDEAL fat-water images. Ultrasound measures evaluated MF function, including shear-wave elastography (SWE) for stiffness/elasticity and thickness ratio from rest to submaximal contraction. All measurements were acquired at L4/L5 and L5/S1 spinal levels, bilaterally. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between morphology and function, while age, sex, body max index (BMI), physical activity levels, and LBP status were considered as covariates.

Results

Fifty participants (26 females) were included (mean age: 39.22 ± 11.67). Greater % MF fat at L4/L5 was significantly associated with greater MF SWE ratio (p = 0.002). No significant bivariate or multivariable relationships were found between MF fat infiltration and MF thickness ratio. Participants with LBP exhibited lower contraction ratios (p = 0.017) and higher SWE during contraction (p = 0.03) at L4/L5 compared to controls.

Conclusion

This study highlights a positive association between MF fat infiltration and SWE-based stiffness measures at L4/L5, suggesting altered muscle composition may impacts MF function. However, no relationship was found between MF fat infiltration and contraction. Participants with LBP demonstrated distinct deficits in muscle activation, supporting the need for targeted rehabilitation strategies addressing these functional impairments.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^659e1aaf]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, NASS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining advanced imaging in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes failed medical/interventional treatment.
