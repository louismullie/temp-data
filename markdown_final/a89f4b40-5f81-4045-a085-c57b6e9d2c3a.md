## Question

step by step approach to hemoptysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to hemoptysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway control. Then, I should verify how to classify severity and define massive hemoptysis. Next, I will consider the initial history and examination to distinguish true hemoptysis from pseudohemoptysis and identify red flags. After that, I need to check the initial diagnostic tests, including chest radiography and when to escalate to CT or CTA. Then, I will examine the role and timing of bronchoscopy. Next, I should review definitive hemostatic strategies, especially bronchial artery embolization, and when to involve surgery. Finally, I will consider etiologic management, special populations, and follow-up planning, making sure each step aligns with current evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation, because patients with massive hemoptysis often die from asphyxiation rather than exsanguination, so securing the airway and stabilizing hemodynamics come before diagnostics or definitive therapy [^114JCqo2] [^114U4E2X] [^1131Yu3B]. I need to ensure early multidisciplinary activation of pulmonology, interventional radiology, and thoracic surgery, and I should be ready to intubate with lung isolation strategies if needed, ideally with a large-bore endotracheal tube and consideration of a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker to protect the non-bleeding lung [^114U4E2X] [^1131Yu3B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what constitutes "massive" hemoptysis. I should verify the definitions because they vary and are often functional rather than purely volumetric. Many sources define massive hemoptysis as bleeding that threatens airway patency, gas exchange, or hemodynamic stability, with some citing thresholds around 200–500 mL in 24 hours, but the unifying principle is that it is life-threatening and requires urgent intervention rather than a strict volume cutoff [^114JCqo2] [^114U4E2X] [^113YWGsH]. I should double-check that any patient with altered mental status, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or hemodynamic instability is treated as massive regardless of the reported volume [^114JCqo2].

> Next, I should review the focused history and examination to confirm true hemoptysis versus pseudohemoptysis or hematemesis, quantify the volume and frequency, and identify risk factors such as smoking, COPD, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis exposure, anticoagulant use, and recent procedures, while also screening for red flags that mandate expedited workup and inpatient care [^1138ajFd] [^111AWm5i]. Wait, let me verify the red flags: hemoptysis in smokers older than 45–50 years, persistent or recurrent bleeding, systemic symptoms, abnormal exam or chest radiograph, and high-risk populations for TB should all prompt urgent evaluation and often admission [^112cKeqV] [^1175Tb97] [^114GtqpE].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic tests for stable patients. Chest radiography is appropriate first-line to screen for obvious masses, infection, bronchiectasis, or cavities, but I need to remember its limited sensitivity and be prepared to escalate if the film is normal or non-diagnostic, especially in patients with malignancy risk factors [^1138ajFd] [^111AWm5i]. Let me consider the ACR Appropriateness Criteria: for nonmassive hemoptysis, both CXR and contrast-enhanced CT or CTA are recommended, and for massive hemoptysis, both CXR and CTA are indicated to localize bleeding and plan intervention, which supports early CT-based vascular mapping in higher-risk presentations [^1137DAqD].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is severe and I'm debating bronchoscopy versus CT first? I should confirm that in unstable patients, airway control and CTA are prioritized because CTA delineates bronchial and nonbronchial feeders and directly informs embolization, whereas bronchoscopy may not localize bleeding reliably during active hemorrhage and can delay definitive therapy [^114U4E2X] [^1134M5Ux]. Hold on, I should verify that MDCTA not only improves etiologic diagnosis but also changes management by identifying systemic arterial sources amenable to embolization, reinforcing CT/CTA as the early imaging of choice when the patient can tolerate it [^113TH5tW] [^115PszVh].

> Next, I should review bronchoscopy timing and indications. Early bronchoscopy within 48 hours improves localization of the bleeding source in moderate-to-severe hemoptysis, but it does not consistently increase diagnostic yield for etiology; moreover, CT often outperforms bronchoscopy for site localization and etiologic diagnosis, so bronchoscopy is best used when it will change management, such as for tissue diagnosis, endobronchial therapy, or when CT is unavailable or non-diagnostic [^114MvgFW] [^114shBDA] [^114vG4mt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said bronchoscopy should always precede embolization; I should correct that because in life-threatening bleeding, CTA-driven embolization is prioritized and bronchoscopy can be deferred or used adjunctively once the airway is secure [^114U4E2X] [^1134M5Ux].

> I need to ensure I address the question of whether bronchoscopy adds value after a negative CT. High-quality meta-analyses suggest that in nonmassive hemoptysis with suspected lung cancer, CT has higher sensitivity than fiberoptic bronchoscopy for detecting malignancy, and routine bronchoscopy after a negative CT may not offer significant additional diagnostic benefit, though it remains useful for tissue sampling or endobronchial therapy when clinically indicated [^1151XqH9] [^111dgopv] [^117NvMxJ]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: central airway lesions, persistent unexplained bleeding, or the need for endobronchial intervention still justify bronchoscopy despite a negative CT [^1138ajFd].

> Now, I will consider definitive hemostasis. Bronchial artery embolization has become first-line for massive and recurrent hemoptysis because it achieves high rates of immediate control with lower acute mortality than surgery, and pre-embolization CTA is crucial to map abnormal bronchial and nonbronchial feeders to reduce recurrence and guide selective embolization [^114U4E2X] [^1134M5Ux] [^1137DAqD]. I should double-check that even in non-severe hemoptysis with systemic hypervascularization, early BAE improved short-term bleeding control compared with medical therapy alone, albeit with more in-hospital complications, so patient selection matters [^116ioJEr].

> Let me think about surgical options and when they fit. Surgery is generally reserved for refractory cases or when embolization fails or is unavailable, and in the acute setting carries high operative mortality; therefore, if possible, surgery should be delayed until after hemostasis and stabilization, with lobectomy or segmentectomy tailored to the identified source and patient reserve [^114U4E2X] [^114JCqo2]. I should confirm that in selected lung cancer patients with localized, resectable disease and persistent bleeding, surgical resection may be appropriate once the patient is optimized, recognizing the elevated perioperative risk in this population [^113YWGsH].

> Next, I should review etiologic management and recurrence prevention. Treating the underlying cause — such as antibiotics for infection, TB therapy where indicated, cancer-directed therapy, and optimization of coagulopathy — reduces recurrence, and I need to ensure close follow-up because diagnoses can evolve and recurrences are common, particularly in bronchiectasis and initially labeled "idiopathic" cases [^1138ajFd] [^112UKSkV] [^113FsNXw]. Hold on, I should verify that antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy per se does not independently increase recurrence or mortality after hemostasis, though the underlying disease drives risk, which informs counseling rather than blanket cessation of necessary therapies [^112UKSkV] [^1127kzKD].

> I will now examine special populations. In cystic fibrosis, even mild hemoptysis warrants contact with a clinician, antibiotics are recommended, and massive bleeding should prompt admission with BAE as first-line. Importantly, rigid bronchoscopy or intubation may be needed for airway control, and lung resection is a last resort after embolization failure [^111qa4QD] [^115i6cj2] [^114SipdS] [^113y37cB] [^1131Yu3B] [^115nbVe5]. For pediatrics, I should confirm that most cases are infectious and mild, but life-threatening hemoptysis is often defined around greater than 8 mL/kg in 24 hours and requires the same airway-first, CTA-guided, multidisciplinary approach adapted to size and comorbidities [^116coFfG].

> Let me reconsider the imaging sequence to avoid a common pitfall. I initially thought bronchoscopy should always precede embolization, but in massive hemoptysis, securing the airway and obtaining CTA to guide embolization should not be delayed by diagnostic bronchoscopy; bronchoscopy can follow for diagnosis and local therapy once the patient is stabilized, which aligns with modern emergency protocols and interventional radiology workflows [^114U4E2X] [^1134M5Ux] [^1131Yu3B].

> Finally, I should confirm disposition and follow-up. Patients with massive hemoptysis require ICU-level care with early multidisciplinary involvement, those with moderate bleeding and risk factors generally warrant inpatient evaluation, and carefully selected patients with mild, self-limited bleeding and reassuring findings may be managed outpatient with strict return precautions and close follow-up to reassess for recurrence or evolving diagnoses [^114U4E2X] [^1138ajFd]. I need to ensure that patients with persistent or unexplained hemoptysis, smokers, and those with bronchiectasis or malignancy risk have structured follow-up with repeat imaging or bronchoscopy as indicated, because delayed diagnoses, including lung cancer, can emerge after an initially negative workup [^112UKSkV] [^114gEQrt].

A stepwise approach to hemoptysis begins with **immediate stabilization** (airway, breathing, circulation) and rapid **severity assessment** to distinguish massive from non-massive bleeding [^114JCqo2] [^114U4E2X]. For massive hemoptysis, secure the airway, reverse coagulopathy, and obtain urgent CTA to guide embolization or surgery [^1131Yu3B] [^1134M5Ux]. For non-massive hemoptysis, obtain a focused history and exam, chest radiograph, and labs; if the CXR is abnormal or the patient is high risk, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT or CTA, then bronchoscopy for localization and tissue diagnosis [^1138ajFd] [^1137DAqD]. Management is etiology-specific, with bronchial artery embolization for refractory or recurrent bleeding and surgery reserved for failure of conservative measures [^1137DAqD] [^1138ajFd]. Always address the underlying cause and arrange close follow-up to monitor for recurrence or malignancy [^1138ajFd] [^113FsNXw].

## Initial assessment and stabilization

### Immediate evaluation (ABCs)

- **Airway**: Ensure patency; intubate early if massive hemoptysis or respiratory compromise [^114JCqo2] [^1131Yu3B].
- **Breathing**: Provide supplemental oxygen; ventilate as needed [^114mURD9] [^117FR8bK].
- **Circulation**: Establish IV access, start fluids, and transfuse if indicated [^115Tuxdc] [^114mURD9] [^1111XNNL].

---

### Severity assessment

Severity is categorized as **mild (< 20 mL/24 h)**, **moderate (20–500 mL/24 h)**, or **severe (> 500 mL/24 h)** [^116gwAPH]. Massive hemoptysis is bleeding that threatens airway, ventilation, or hemodynamics and requires urgent intervention [^114JCqo2] [^114U4E2X].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should document the amount, duration, frequency, and associated symptoms (cough, fever, weight loss, chest pain, dyspnea), as well as smoking, TB exposure, anticoagulant use, and comorbidities [^1158u3Df]. The physical examination should assess vital signs, respiratory effort, clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, and signs of coagulopathy [^114mURD9].

---

### Initial diagnostic tests

- **Chest radiograph (CXR)**: First-line to detect masses, infection, bronchiectasis, or cardiomegaly [^1137DAqD].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, type and crossmatch [^notfound].
- **Sputum analysis**: Gram stain, culture, AFB smear/culture if TB suspected [^114GtqpE].

---

### Advanced imaging

- **CT angiography (CTA)**: Preferred for massive hemoptysis; identifies bronchial/nonbronchial feeders and guides embolization [^1134M5Ux] [^1137DAqD].
- **Contrast-enhanced CT**: For non-massive hemoptysis; detects tumors, bronchiectasis, infection, vascular anomalies [^1137DAqD] [^116Pxccg].
- **Bronchoscopy**: For localization, hemostasis, and tissue diagnosis; early bronchoscopy (≤ 48 h) improves localization in moderate–severe cases [^114MvgFW] [^116x1c7e].

---

## Management strategies

### Massive hemoptysis

- **Airway control**: Intubation with lung isolation (double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker) [^114mURD9].
- **Reversal of coagulopathy**: Vitamin K, PCC, FFP, platelets as indicated [^notfound].
- **Bronchoscopic hemostasis**: Balloon tamponade, topical vasoconstrictors, APC, laser [^111scPPi].
- **Bronchial artery embolization (BAE)**: First-line definitive therapy; high success, recurrence 10–57% [^1137DAqD] [^1156JCX5].
- **Surgery**: Reserve for refractory cases or surgically correctable lesions [^1138ajFd].

---

### Non-massive hemoptysis

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, rest, cough suppression, antibiotics if infection suspected [^115Tuxdc].
- **Bronchoscopy**: For persistent bleeding, suspected malignancy, or unclear etiology [^114mURD9].
- **BAE**: For recurrent or refractory bleeding [^1137DAqD].
- **Surgery**: For localized lesions failing conservative therapy [^1138ajFd].

---

## Etiology-specific management

| **Etiology** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Bronchiectasis | - Antibiotics <br/> - Macrolides <br/> - BAE if recurrent [^1156JCX5] |
| Lung cancer | - Oncologic therapy <br/> - Endobronchial interventions <br/> - BAE <br/> - Surgery if resectable [^111scPPi] |
| Tuberculosis | - Anti-TB therapy <br/> - BAE if massive [^1137DAqD] |
| Coagulopathy | - Reverse anticoagulation <br/> - Correct underlying disorder [^1138ajFd] |
| Pulmonary embolism | - Anticoagulation <br/> - Thrombolysis if indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Follow-up and recurrence prevention

Follow-up should include regular visits to monitor for **recurrence** and new symptoms [^113FsNXw]. Address modifiable risks — smoking, **anticoagulation**, and infections — to reduce recurrence [^notfound]. Educate patients on **warning signs** and when to seek care [^114vDBiZ].

---

A structured approach to hemoptysis — stabilize, assess severity, localize the source, and treat the cause — optimizes outcomes. Massive hemoptysis requires **urgent airway control and CTA-guided embolization**, whereas non-massive cases rely on imaging and bronchoscopy to direct therapy [^114U4E2X] [^1137DAqD].

Introduction

Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (hereafter referred to as "bronchiectasis") is a chronic suppurative lung disease characterized by chronic productive cough and episodic infectious exacerbations. Though formerly classified as an orphan disease, its prevalence has steadily increased by ~ 8% per year in the United States (US). In 2013, an estimated 340, 000 people in the US were receiving active treatments for this disease. Hospitalizations can be frequent and account for most of the economic burden. Numerous clinical trials and guidelines have been published over the past decade and therapies like macrolides are now recommended to prevent bronchiectasis exacerbations. There are contraindications to chronic macrolide use though, such as infection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which can develop resistance if macrolide monotherapy is used.

Hemoptysis is a well-known and feared complication of bronchiectasis, ranging from chronic small volumes to massive hemoptysis that can be life-threatening. Chronic airway inflammation and infection can lead to hemoptysis but life-threatening hemoptysis may be due to a rupture of a tortuous blood vessel. Bronchiectasis is a common etiology in hemoptysis presentations. In a French cohort of bronchiectasis patients, 1 in 5 patients had a history of hemoptysis. Hemoptysis was a symptom in 23% of patients in a US bronchiectasis research registry.

Therapeutic approaches to managing bronchiectasis-related hemoptysis depend on the clinical severity but include supportive management such as suspension of certain airway clearance techniques, treatment of pulmonary infection, bronchoscopic techniques, bronchial artery embolization (BAE), and surgical resection. BAE has emerged as a first-line treatment for the control of hemoptysis from a variety of causes, including tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and aspergilloma. Major complication from BAE are reportedly rare, but the recurrence of hemoptysis is common varying between 10 to 57%.

The published literature demonstrates a significant economic burden with bronchiectasis management, but there is scarce data on the burden of hospitalizations or mortality rates from hemoptysis or the utilization rates of BAE among the bronchiectasis population in the US. In order to gain a better understanding of the resource and economic impacts of this serious complication, we used a national public database to determine the hospitalization incidence and outcomes of hemoptysis presentations including in-hospital mortality among those with bronchiectasis.

### Is there a role for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in patients presenting with haemoptysis and negative CT? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hmneE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Bronchoscopy is an essential skill in respiratory medicine with both diagnostic and therapeutic application. From a diagnostic perspective, it permits visualisation and tissue sampling for histological and molecular assessment from central airways using a flexible bronchoscope. The diagnostic yield is, however, variable and significantly influenced by characteristics such as location with Rivera et al reporting a high sensitivity for endobronchial disease in comparison to peripheral lesions. Other predictors of diagnostic yield also include size of lesion (< 2 cm) with multivariate logistic regression demonstrating a statistically significant association. To enhance the diagnostic yield of early cancers and precancerous lesions, bronchoscopic techniques such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy were introduced but with limited application to the proximal bronchial tree predominantly. There have been advances in bronchoscopy detection rates for lung cancer over the years. This along with other interventional technologies has expanded the sampling procedures that clinicians can use to diagnose and stage lung cancer, however, is not associated with a higher diagnostic yield when prior CT scans were negative. Furthermore, FOB introduces a degree of risk for complications such as bronchospasms, haemorrhage, infection, oropharyngeal trauma and pneumothorax along with risks from sedative agents. It is, however, a generally safe procedure with a very low incidence of mortality and has seen a progressively reducing frequency of adverse events since its initial decade which is likely attributed to improved monitoring, intervention and patient selection. Nonetheless, as an invasive diagnostic approach, it exposes the patient to a greater degree of risk in comparison to receiving a CT scan and patients are also likely to exhibit a greater tolerability for the latter. Lastly, from a logistical perspective, it is comparatively more straightforward to implement an infrastructure supporting CT scans as opposed to performing FOB.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11552WaB]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Subacute cough in adults — The updated management algorithm includes the suggestions that history should be sought for hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptoms and, if present, should be immediately addressed and evaluated; a validated cough severity or quality of life tool be routinely used to assess the outcome of therapy; environmental and occupational exposures be considered and addressed if present; and patients be routinely followed up in the clinic or by telephone within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial evaluation. If cough persists, a follow-up appointment should be arranged.

### Hemoptysis: evaluation and management [^1138ajFd]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the lower respiratory tract, usually from bronchial arteries. The most common causes are acute respiratory infections, cancer, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No cause is identified in 20% to 50% of cases. Hemoptysis must be differentiated from pseudohemoptysis, which is blood that originates from nasopharyngeal or gastrointestinal sources. The initial evaluation includes determining the severity of bleeding and stability of the patient and may require bronchoscopy for airway protection. Mild hemoptysis comprises more than 90% of cases and has a good prognosis, whereas massive hemoptysis has a high mortality rate. A history and physical examination can assist in identifying an etiology, but diagnostic testing is often required. Chest radiography is a good initial test, but it has limited sensitivity for determining the site and etiology of the bleeding. Computed tomography and computed tomography angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast are the preferred modalities to determine the etiology of bleeding; however, bronchoscopy may also be needed. In addition to supportive medical treatment, management should include treatment of the underlying etiology because recurrence often takes place in the absence of treatment of the identified cause. Bronchial arterial embolization is used to treat massive hemoptysis, particularly when an involved artery is noted on computed tomography angiography. Surgery is reserved for patients whose medical treatment and embolization are not effective.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^116o15AL]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Haemoptysis is a valuable diagnostic clue to resectable lung cancer. More frequently haemoptysis is likely to be secondary to benign pulmonary pathology. Bronchoscopy is invasive; radiation is a safety concern of CT, particularly in young people. CT has the advantage of being more sensitive in diagnosing distant bronchial and parenchymal abnormalities, but FOB is better in evaluating mucosal abnormalities and providing material for pathological diagnosis. CT or bronchoscopy could fail to detect abnormalities when the other modality did, as seen in this study. Even though CT and bronchoscopy are complementary, CT is more likely to detect abnormalities to explain the cause of haemoptysis.

We conclude that further investigation of haemoptysis in smokers with a normal CXR is justified regardless of the amount or frequency of haemoptysis based on a 9.6% rate of malignancy in our consecutive series. We recommend that these patients are investigated with CT followed by bronchoscopy.

Case Presentation

A 33-year-old man with a medical history of childhood exercise-induced asthma presented to the ED with 2 days of hemoptysis. He described the hemoptysis as bright red blood with clots, approximately 100 cm 3 in total. He denied prior hemoptysis, pulmonary infections, or exposure to TB. Years ago he had an episode of gross hematuria, but a urologic workup was unrevealing.

### Establishing the diagnosis of lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1139bknq]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Sputum cytology — clinical use and patient selection notes that sputum cytology is the least invasive means of obtaining a diagnosis in a patient suspected of having lung cancer and is particularly useful in patients with centrally located tumors or in those who present with hemoptysis; sampling of sputum specimens should certainly be the first step for a patient with a central lesion ± radiographic evidence of metastatic disease when semi-invasive procedures may pose higher risk. Institutional capability influences performance because many institutions do not have an established program for sputum collection and processing and therefore show much lower sensitivity than well-established programs. Patient characteristics associated with positive cytologic diagnosis on sputum include bloody sputum, low FEV1 values, large lung tumors, centrally located tumors, and squamous cell cancers.

### Triage risk stratification in emergency department hemoptysis: associations of hemoglobin and malignancy with in-hospital mortality [^111DjcfC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A clinically important subset of emergency department (ED) patients with hemoptysis deteriorates rapidly due to airway obstruction, hypoxemia, or hemodynamic compromise. Practical, ED-available variables are needed to prompt CT angiography (CTA) and appropriate interventional radiology (IR) notifications.

Objectives

To identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with hemoptysis and to describe early bronchial artery embolization (BAE) as a process-of-care marker.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary teaching ED in Türkiye (June 2020-June 2025). Adults with hemoptysis were included, while those with pseudohemoptysis/hematemesis, trauma, pregnancy, incomplete outcome data, and repeat encounters were excluded. The variables captured included demographics, comorbidities (malignancy/bronchiectasis/tuberculosis/COPD), British Thoracic Society (BTS) hemoptysis severity, first 6-h hemoglobin (g/dL), imaging, and interventions (bronchoscopy; BAE recorded descriptively as planned/performed within 24 h). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rate. We fitted a Firth-penalized logistic regression and assessed discrimination and calibration using bootstrap internal validation.

Results

Among 391 encounters (mean age 56.7; 76.7% male), the mortality rate was 4.1%. Non-survivors had lower hemoglobin levels and more malignancies, and BAE clustered in sicker patients. In the multivariable analysis (with BAE excluded as a predictor), mortality was associated with malignancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–13.74) and hemoglobin (per 1 g/dL) (aOR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62–0.94). Model discrimination was strong (AUC 0.884) with acceptable calibration (intercept, -0.03; slope, 1.07). The sensitivity analyses were consistent.

Conclusions

Two triage-available variables, malignancy and lower hemoglobin levels, identified a higher-risk subgroup of ED patients with hemoptysis in our cohort. These findings support early risk stratification at presentation and warrant prospective multicenter validation.

### Is there a role for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in patients presenting with haemoptysis and negative CT? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EZ78z]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Meta-regression demonstrated a greater diagnostic profile for CT in studies conducted after 2010 in comparison to FOB. This could be explained by the ongoing development and improvement of CT scanner technology across the last few decades. Meta-regression also evaluated the effect of age on the diagnostic efficacy of CT and FOB. While CT demonstrated a similar sensitivity to FOB in ages above 55, sensitivity was superior to FOB in populations under the age of 55. Explanations for this could include location, size and histology of the malignancies for the under 55 population. A population based study conducted by Shi et al conveyed that adenocarcinoma was the most prevalent histological subtype in the younger population. This finding could provide some explanation into our study's age group meta-regression finding as lung adenocarcinoma is associated with peripheral lesion presentation for which FOB has well-documented limitations. Furthermore, older patient groups may expectedly present with larger lesions in comparison to younger patient groupsand thus be better suited for FOB as lesion size is a well-documented predictor of diagnostic efficacy. Overall, CT demonstrated a reliable diagnostic profile irrespective of ages groups. Of the studies available, there was generally a paucity of information corresponding to lesion localisation. One study reported this information, however, due to substantial methodological heterogeneity, sensitivity meta-analysis could not be pursued for any meaningful outcomes.

### Symptoms and other factors associated with time to diagnosis and stage of lung cancer: a prospective cohort study [^116dJpXw]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, identifying symptoms and other factors that should prompt an individual to seek help or a GP to perform the appropriate diagnostic test or refer appropriately remains challenging. Haemoptysis is the most important symptom associated with lung cancer, but this is reported as the first symptom in less than 5% of cases. Despite conducting such a large prospective cohort study, we failed to identify any other strong signals of lung cancer diagnosis. This is an important finding while we await the revised National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for early detection of lung cancer. This study suggests that lung cancer awareness campaigns that currently concentrate on a single symptom should instead consider messages that reflect the multi-symptom nature of its presentation. It may also be that targeted interventions at high-risk populations aimed at symptom monitoring could be more effective at recognising symptom evolution. Policy initiatives such as prompt chest X-rays for high-risk groups, and the increasingly widespread use of clinical decision support, can be informed by our findings. The next step is to understand the potentially subtle differences in impact of symptoms and patient factors on the patient, GP and specialist intervals. These data will provide support for more targeted evaluation of suspicious symptoms in an attempt to identify lung cancer at an earlier and more amenable stage.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112cKeqV]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^116x1c7e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Bronchoscopy can be crucial for patients with hemoptysis. An examination performed within 48 hemoptysis stopped can help detect the bleeding source (particularly in moderate-severe hemoptysis cases), without increasing its diagnostic accuracy and regardless of the definitive diagnosis. An endoscopic examination performed within 24 h the symptom subsided does not further improve the detection rate of bleeding sources than a bronchoscopy performed within 48 h.

On the basis of these findings, in case of moderate-severe hemoptysis, if bronchoscopy is deemed crucial or CT imaging is not available or not useful to detect the bleeding source, early endoscopy could be recommended. In this context, an accurate localization of the bleeding focus is needed to rapidly administer the most adequate therapy. In case of mild bleeding, a delayed examination may be considered; the ability of bronchoscopy to diagnose underlying diseases and to localize the bleeding source are not influenced by the timing of the investigation.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^114vG4mt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemoptysis is a challenging symptom associated with potentially life-threatening medical conditions. A recent European, observational study showed that malignancies were the most frequent etiology. On this basis, diagnostic work-up should be as comprehensive as possible.

Detection of bleeding sites is key for a successful clinical management, particularly in patients with life-threatening bleeding.

Computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy are accurate techniques for diagnosis and localization of bleeding sources. However, in comparison with CT, which is more accurate for the diagnosis of vascular and parenchymal disorders, bronchoscopy could better assess upper airways and endobronchial abnormalities (e.g. endobronchial malignancies), as well as it can provide histopathological and microbiological samples from central and peripheral lung lesions. Furthermore, it may be useful in patients requiring endobronchial interventions, and in case of bilateral lung abnormalities where radiographic localization of a bleeding source might be challenging.

No guidelines exist on the optimal timing of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with hemoptysis. Only a few studies assessed whether the timing of endoscopy may affect the identification and the diagnosis of bleeding sources. Their findings were controversial and, consequently, the ideal timing continues to remain a matter of debate.

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether an early bronchoscopy (i.e. performed during active bleeding/ ≤ 48 h after hemoptysis stopped) helps detect bleeding sources and increase diagnostic yield (i.e. ability to provide histopathological and/or microbiological specimens useful for an etiological diagnosis) in comparison with a delayed (i.e. performed after 48 h hemoptysis subsided) examination.

We also investigated whether symptom's severity might influence the ability of the endoscopic examination to localize bleeding focus.

### Managing massive hemoptysis [^114U4E2X]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a medical emergency with high mortality presenting several difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The origin of bleeding and underlying etiology often is not immediately apparent, and techniques for management of this dangerous condition necessitate an expedient response. Unlike hemorrhage in other circumstances, a small amount of blood can rapidly flood the airways, thereby impairing oxygenation and ventilation, leading to asphyxia and consequent cardiovascular collapse. Of paramount importance is early control of the patient's airway and immediate isolation of hemorrhage in an attempt to localize and control bleeding. A coordinated team response is essential to guarantee the best chances of patient survival. Prompt control of the airway and steps to limit the spread of hemorrhage take precedence. Bronchial artery embolization, rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, and surgery all serve as potential treatment options to provide definitive control of hemorrhage. Several adjunctive therapies described in recent years may also assist in the control of bleeding; however, their role is less defined in life-threatening hemoptysis and warrants additional studies. In this concise review, we emphasize the steps necessary for a systematic approach in the management of life-threatening hemoptysis.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^117XQ7Kd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Notably, the optimal timing of bronchoscopy may have less clinical relevance nowadays than in the past, given the availability of highly sensitive imaging techniques. Indeed, as suggested by our findings and by recent studies, CT imaging and bronchoscopy may have similar accuracy in the identification of the location of the bleeding, while CT may show higher sensitivity in the etiologic diagnosis and is key for bronchial artery embolization, which remains the cornerstone for the management of severe hemoptysis cases.

### Impact of multidetector CT-angiography on the emergency management of severe hemoptysis [^113TH5tW]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Multidetector CT-angiography (MDCTA) is commonly used in patients with severe haemoptysis requiring admission to intensive care unit. However, the impact of MDCTA on the management of severe haemoptysis in emergency setting is poorly evaluated.

Methods

We prospectively compared data provided by clinical bedside evaluation (clinical examination, chest-X-ray and fiberoptic bronchoscopy) to MDCTA data in terms of lateralization, location of the bleeding site, etiology as well as impact on the treatment choice.

Results

Over a 13-month period, 87 patients (men n = 58, median age = 61 years, median haemoptysis expectorated volume = 180 mL) were included. Etiology was mainly (67%) bronchiectasis, tuberculosis sequelae and tumor. MDCTA and clinical bedside evaluation were equally effective in determining lateralization (87.4% and 93.1%, respectively, p = 0.23) and location (85% and 82.7%, respectively, p = 0.82) of the bleeding site. MDCTA was significantly more accurate than the clinical bedside strategy in determining the haemoptysis cause (86% and 70%, respectively, p = 0.007). Moreover, MDCTA suggested the involvement of systemic arteries as bleeding mechanism in 92% of cases, leading to the modification of the treatment initially considered after bedside evaluation in 21.8% of patients.

Conclusion

MDCTA provides useful information for the management of patients with severe haemoptysis, especially in the treatment choice. Thus, in the absence of emergency fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) requirement for airways management, MDCTA should be the first-line procedure performed in emergency clinical setting.

### Role of bronchoscopy in massive hemoptysis [^117FR8bK]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Airway hemorrhage is a potentially rapidly fatal condition. Death may occur within minutes from asphyxiation before control can be achieved. The primary prognostic factors are the rate of bleeding and the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient. Bronchoscopy is central in management, but the goals differ, depending on circumstances. In stable patients who have minimal hemoptysis, bronchoscopy can diagnose the cause specifically and be used as the primary treatment modality. In the setting of massive or life-threatening bleeding, bronchoscopy primarily is performed to maintain ventilation and to direct endobronchial blockade. Although flexible bronchoscopy is an acceptable mode initially, there should be no delay in performing rigid bronchoscopy when it becomes apparent that bleeding is too vigorous to permit [figure: see text] successful airway exploration with the smaller flexible instrument. Once isolation of bleeding has been achieved, the choice must be made between embolization, surgical resection, or both of these procedures.

### Hemoptysis: evaluation and management [^111AWm5i]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the lung parenchyma or airways. The initial step in the evaluation is determining the origin of bleeding. Pseudohemoptysis is identified through the history and physical examination. In adults, acute respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia), bronchiectasis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy are the most common causes. Tuberculosis is a major cause of hemoptysis in endemic regions of the world. Although tuberculosis rates are low in the United States, they are increased in persons who are homeless or who were born in other countries; consideration for testing should be made on an individual basis. Hemodynamic instability, abnormal gas exchange, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and lesions at high risk of massive bleeding warrant inpatient evaluation. Chest radiography is recommended as the initial diagnostic test for hemodynamically stable patients with hemoptysis. Further evaluation with computed tomography with or without bronchoscopy is recommended in patients with massive hemoptysis, those with abnormal radiographic findings, and those with risk factors for malignancy despite normal radiographic findings.

### An integrated approach to diagnosis and management of severe haemoptysis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a case series from a referral centre [^114C5Fuz]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Haemoptysis may present as a life-threatening condition, with a mortality rate reaching 80% in the absence of adequate and prompt management. The criteria used to characterize severe haemoptysis are heterogeneous and ill-defined. They are usually limited to the amount of blood expectorated within 24–48 hrs and its clinical consequences, or to the interventions used. A more 'functional' definition accounting for the respiratory reserve has also been proposed. Recent surveys suggest a shift from surgery to bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) as a first-line procedure in severe haemoptysis. Defining a better standardized management would be useful to physicians in charge of patients with severe haemoptysis to improve outcomes and should preferably take place in or nearby the intensive care unit (ICU).

In this study, we analyzed a large series of unselected patients with severe haemoptysis referred to a single respiratory intensive care unit with an affiliated intermediate care ward. Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of the patients managed using one of the three main initial therapeutic options (conservative measures, BAE or surgery) and to help better define the role of BAE, according to the severity of haemoptysis. The study was conducted in accordance with French law, which does not require approval of an IRB or the consent of patients for such retrospective analysis of medical records.

### CT and CT angiography in massive haemoptysis with emphasis on pre-embolization assessment [^114LMLvJ]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Massive haemoptysis is a respiratory emergency. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) can play a crucial role in assessing the cause and origin of the haemoptysis and directing the interventional radiologist prior to treatment. The bronchial arterial supply and to a lesser extent the non-bronchial systemic arterial supply are responsible for the majority of cases of massive haemoptysis, but uncommon causes of massive haemoptysis should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Failure to assess the imaging appropriately prior to endovascular treatment may result in early recurrent massive haemoptysis or patient death.

### Management of life-threatening haemoptysis [^111fkv6X]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Massive haemoptysis represents a major medical emergency that is associated with a high mortality. Here we present two cases of life-threatening haemoptysis, the first caused by rupture of an aortic aneurysm into the lung in a 37-yr-old woman with polyarteritis nodosa and the second caused by massive bleeding from an angiectatic vascular malformation in the right main bronchus in a 21-yr-old woman. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy played an essential role in the diagnostic process and management of the respiratory tract. Diagnosis in the first case was obtained by CT scan and the aneurysm was treated surgically. In the second case, bronchial arteriography contributed to both definitive diagnosis and treatment. Initial cardiorespiratory management, diagnostic procedures and definitive therapy are described and reviewed. Adequate early management of the cardiorespiratory system is essential to the outcome. Aggressive measures to elucidate the cause of haemoptysis and prompt therapy are warranted because of the high risk of recurrence.

### Evaluation and treatment of massive hemoptysis [^114JCqo2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is appropriately defined as life-threatening hemoptysis that causes airway obstruction, respiratory failure, and/or hypotension. Patients with this condition die from asphyxiation, not hemorrhagic shock. Any patient who presents with life-threatening hemoptysis requires immediate treatment to secure the airway and stabilize hemodynamics. Early activation and coordinated response from a multidisciplinary team is critical. Once the airway is secure and appropriate resuscitation is initiated, priorities are to localize the source of the bleeding and gain hemorrhage control. Nonsurgical control of hemorrhage is superior to surgery in the acute situation.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old man, never smoker, with no medical or surgical history, not currently on medications, presented to the ED with a second episode of gross hemoptysis, 4 months after an initial episode that had not previously been evaluated. He described the current episode of hemoptysis as "enough to fill the sink"; however, he did not further quantify. He has no history of recurrent epistaxis, hematemesis, or other evidence of clotting disorder. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, or recent travel. He denied any sick contacts and has no history of TB exposure or risk factors. The patient denied any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain. He had no lower extremity pain or swelling. He routinely exercises and generally lives a healthy lifestyle. He is a health care worker who has not routinely worked with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he received his second (of two) COVID-19 vaccines 4 days before presentation.

### Causes… [^115Tuxdc]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

These findings require a transfer to an emergent or intensive care setting where workup can immediately follow airway and hemodynamic stabilization. In cases of non–life-threatening hemoptysis where the clinical timeline and coexistent symptoms allow for a complete history and physical examination, goals of the initial evaluation include confirming the hemoptysis, locating the site of bleeding, and determining the etiology of the bleeding. Flexible bronchoscopy can be performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit, and can access lower airways, but intubation beforehand is needed if airway management is required. 3, 14 A therapeutic scope also allows for the removal of blood or foreign bodies. To determine the site of bleeding, active bleeding must be visualized. This is more likely to occur during or within 24 to 48 hours of active hemoptysis.

4 Bronchoscopy performed in addition to CT may increase sensitivity for the site of bleeding and may also identify etiology of bleeding when none is found on CT.
22. 4 Outpatient treatment may be considered in patients who are in stable condition, and a suspected cause can be followed up in an outpatient setting, provided the bleeding has stopped. Antitussive medications can assist in controlling coughing, which may trigger continued hemoptysis, and etiology-specific treatment should be administered, with repeat evaluation in 24 to 48 hours.
4. 4, 7 Patients should have their vital signs, including oxygenation, monitored closely and intravenous access maintained. If needed, patients should be given supplemental oxygen. 4, 7 Airway protection, with intubation and bronchial blockage by rigid bronchoscopy, and hemodynamic stabilization are important.

Peripheral bleeding, pulmonary isolation by selective bronchial blockage, tamponade, or a balloon catheter prevents blood from the affected area from flowing into other airways. Arterial embolization is the treatment of choice for massive or recurrent hemoptysis and is increasingly being used for nonmassive hemoptysis because it is effective and minimally invasive. 2, 4, 7, 8 To prevent a recurrence, all pathologic arteries must be embolized. 4 Bronchial arterial embolization is most commonly performed because bronchial arteries are the most common source of bleeding and most amenable to treatment. 8.

### Hemoptysis: diagnosis and management [^1158u3Df]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is the spitting of blood that originated in the lungs or bronchial tubes. The patient's history should help determine the amount of blood and differentiate between hemoptysis, pseudohemoptysis, and hematemesis. A focused physical examination can lead to the diagnosis in most cases. In children, lower respiratory tract infection and foreign body aspiration are common causes. In adults, bronchitis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pneumonia are the major causes. Chest radiographs often aid in diagnosis and assist in using two complementary diagnostic procedures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and high-resolution computed tomography, which are useful in difficult cases and when malignancy is suspected. The goals of management are threefold: bleeding cessation, aspiration prevention, and treatment of the underlying cause. Mild hemoptysis often is caused by an infection that can be managed on an outpatient basis with dose monitoring. If hemoptysis persists, consulting with a pulmonologist should be considered. Patients with risk factors for malignancy or recurrent hemoptysis also require further evaluation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy or high-resolution computed tomography. In up to 34 percent of patients, no cause of hemoptysis can be found.

### CT for evaluation of hemoptysis [^115PszVh]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis, which is defined as expectoration of blood from the alveoli or airways of the lower respiratory tract, is an alarming clinical symptom with an extensive differential diagnosis. CT has emerged as an important noninvasive tool in the evaluation of patients with hemoptysis, and the authors present a systematic but flexible approach to CT interpretation. The first step in this approach involves identifying findings of parenchymal and airway hemorrhage. The second step is aimed at determining the mechanism of hemoptysis and whether a specific vascular supply can be implicated. Hemoptysis can have primary vascular and secondary vascular causes. Primary vascular mechanisms include chronic systemic vascular hypertrophy, focally damaged vessels, a dysplastic lung parenchyma with systemic arterial supply, arteriovenous malformations and fistulas, and bleeding at the capillary level. Evaluating vascular mechanisms of hemoptysis at CT also entails determining if a specific vascular source can be implicated. Although the bronchial arteries are responsible for most cases of hemoptysis, nonbronchial systemic arteries and the pulmonary arteries are important potential sources of hemoptysis that must be recognized. Secondary vascular mechanisms of hemoptysis include processes that directly destroy the lung parenchyma and processes that directly invade the airway. Understanding and employing this approach allow the diagnostic radiologist to interpret CT examinations accurately in patients with hemoptysis and provide information that is best suited to directing subsequent treatment. © RSNA, 2021.

### Long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis [^111aoQvZ]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Few recent retrospective data on this topic are available in the scientific literature. In keeping with our findings, Fidan et al. and Ryuge et al. found bronchiectasis as the most frequent diagnosis in recurrent hemoptysis. Abdulmalak et al. described recurrence rates of 16.6% and 16.1% during a three-year follow-up period in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Cryptogenic haemoptysis, lower respiratory tract infection, and lung cancer were the most common aetiologies of recurrences, with cryptogenic haemoptysis representing 50% of all causes.

Choi et al. who described a recurrence rate of 19.1%, demonstrated that aspergillosis, active bleeding, and blood clots during bronchoscopy during the first evaluation were significantly associated with the risk of recurrence; however, they analysed only patients with mild hemoptysis. Similar findings were described by Lee et al. who found that active bleeding during bronchoscopy, smoking history > 40 years, and hypertension were the main predictors of recurrence. Notably, the aetiology was not evaluated in this study.

As suggested by Lee et al. recurrences should alert physicians to undetected pathological findings.

In seven patients of our cohort, a recurrence was associated with a new clinical and radiological assessment and to an aetiological change. Three patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic bleeding or pneumonia were subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer, in contrast to the study by Tsoumakidou et al. where lung cancer was not diagnosed in any patients with an initial aetiology other than lung cancer. On the contrary, Abdulmalak et al. described the highest rate of lung cancer detection during the follow-up of patients with a diagnosis of respiratory infection (10.4%) at the baseline evaluation.

In our study, four patients initially diagnosed with acute bronchitis and COPD exacerbation based on clinical and chest X-ray findings were subsequently diagnosed with bronchiectasis.

### Long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis [^1127kzKD]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The present scientific evidence suggests the importance of a clinical and radiological follow-up in patients with bleeding of unknown origin and related to an acute lower respiratory tract infection, as well as a more accurate radiological assessment (i.e. chest CT) in patients with haemoptysis and risk factors for bronchiectasis.

Very little data could be retrieved on the impact of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies on long-term prognostic outcomes. In a large retrospective cohort study, Lee et al. failed to demonstrate a potential role of aspirin on recurrence. Similar findings were shown by Ryuge et al. who studied the mechanism of haemoptysis relapse in patients who underwent BAE; they demonstrated that antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy did not increase recanalisation, i.e. the most frequent mechanism underlying re-hemoptysis. We have prospectively demonstrated that these drugs, individually or in combination, did not change the risk of death and recurrence.

Some study limitations can be found. The observational nature cannot help discriminate the role played by some medical conditions for the background noise of confounders. However, for ethical reasons, it is currently the best methodological approach. Differences in some standard operating procedures in the recruited centres could affect some results in terms of diagnostic accuracy. However, the recruited hospitals were national reference centres, and thus, operational variability should be not relevant. Subgroup analyses by aetiology could have affected the statistical power of some findings; future studies focused on specific aetiologies could confirm our novel results.

### Long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis [^112UKSkV]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Haemoptysis is a challenging symptom that can be associated with potentially life-threatening medical conditions. Follow-up is key in these patients to promptly detect new or misdiagnosed pathologic findings. Few prospective studies have evaluated long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis. Furthermore, the role played by antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs on mortality and recurrence rates is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess mortality after 18 months of follow-up. Furthermore, the incidence of recurrence and the risk factors for recurrence and death were evaluated (including the role played by anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs).

Methods

Observational, prospective, multicentre, Italian study.

Results

451/606 (74.4%) recruited patients with haemoptysis completed the 18 months follow-up. 22/604 (3.6%) diagnoses changed from baseline to the end of the follow-up. 83/604 (13.7%) patients died. In 52/83 (62.7%) patients, death was the outcome of the disease which caused haemoptysis at baseline. Only the diagnosis of lung neoplasm was associated with death (OR (95%CI): 38.2 (4.2–347.5); p-value: 0.0001). 166 recurrences were recorded in 103/604 (17%) patients. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis was significantly associated with the occurrence of a recurrence (OR (95% CI): 2.6 (1.5–4.3)); p-value < 0.0001). Anticoagulant, antiaggregant, and anticoagulant plus antiaggregant drugs were not associated with an increased risk of death and recurrence.

Conclusions

Our study showed a low mortality rate in patients with haemoptysis followed-up for 18 months. Pulmonary malignancy was the main aetiology and the main predictor of death, whereas bronchiectasis was the most frequent diagnosis associated with recurrence. Antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy did not change the risk of death or recurrence. Follow-up is recommended in patients initially diagnosed with lower airways infections and idiopathic bleeding.

Tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in high-prevalence settings — screening and diagnostics for patients with cough: For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries or settings, we suggest (a) that they be screened for TB regardless of cough duration (Grade 2C) and (b) the addition of active case finding to passive case finding because it may improve outcomes in patients with pulmonary TB (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, but CXRs should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough suspected to have pulmonary TB and at high risk of drug-resistant TB, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF assay, where available, replace sputum microscopy but sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing and CXRs should be performed when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, and/or weight loss, and who are at risk of pulmonary TB in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that they should have a CXR if resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study shows a low mortality rate in patients with haemoptysis followed-up for a long period. Pulmonary malignancy is the main aetiology and the main predictor of death in these patients, whereas bronchiectasis is the most frequent diagnosis associated with recurrence. Antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy do not change the risk of death or recurrence. Follow-up is recommended in patients initially diagnosed with lower airways infections and those with idiopathic bleeding, in order to detect new or misdiagnosed lung malignancies.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^117NXZDb]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Haemoptysis is a common and worrying clinical symptom. It is potentially life threatening and warrants further investigation. Haemoptysis can be due to varying aetiologies including lung cancer. The optimal strategy for investigating patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph (CXR) is unclear. Doctors tend to investigate these patients differently.

The prognosis for lung cancer remains poor, with 5-year survival figures of 4–12% worldwide. The prospects for changing this are limited by a number of factors including, most notably, the late presentation of patients with advanced disease and the lack of convincing evidence for screening asymptomatic individuals for lung cancer. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is crucial to allow curative resection. Further investigations of patients with haemoptysis and normal CXR may lead to early diagnosis.

In this retrospective study we analysed a group of patients with haemoptysis and normal CXR to see whether further investigations were justified.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113N34KY]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer presenting symptoms and diagnostic cues — cough is the most common presentation and may result from endobronchial irritation, parenchymal infiltration, or postobstructive pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomic distribution or relapsing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should raise concern for neoplasm. Localized or unilateral wheezing may reflect endobronchial obstruction, and pleuritic chest pain should raise concern for invasion of the pleura. Hemoptysis accompanying lung cancer is rarely massive, and hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom of lung cancer even in the setting of a normal or nonlocalizing chest radiograph. Persistent hemoptysis, even in scant amounts, in patients with a history of smoking and COPD should raise concern about the possibility of endobronchial tumor.

### Hemoptysis: diagnosis and management… [^114mURD9]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Physical Examination Historic clues often will narrow the differential diagnosis and help focus the physical examination. Examining the expectoration may help localize the source of bleeding. 4, 17, 18 The physician should record vital signs, including pulse oximetry levels, to document fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, weight changes, and hypoxia. Constitutional signs such as cachexia and level of patient distress also should be noted. The skin and mucous membranes should be inspected for cyanosis, pallor, ecchymoses, telangiectasia, gingivitis, or evidence of bleeding from the oral or nasal mucosa. The examination for lymph node enlargement should include the neck, supraclavicular region, and axillae. The cardiovascular examination includes an evaluation for jugular venous distention, abnormal heart sounds, and edema. The physician should check the chest and lungs for signs of consolidation, wheezing, rales, and trauma.

The abdominal examination should focus on signs of hepatic congestion or masses, with an inspection of the extremities for signs of edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is preferred if neoplasia is suspected; it is diagnostic for central endobronchial disease and allows for direct visualization of the bleeding site. It also permits tissue biopsy, bronchial lavage, or brushings for pathologic diagnosis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy also can provide direct therapy in cases of continued bleeding. Rigid bronchoscopy is the preferred tool for cases of massive bleeding because of its greater suctioning and airway maintenance capabilities. Management NONMASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS The overall goals of management of the patient with hemoptysis are threefold: bleeding cessation, aspiration prevention, and treatment of the underlying cause. As with any potentially serious condition, evaluation of the "ABCs" is the initial step.

30; therefore, massive hemoptysis warrants a more aggressive, expedient approach. These patients require intensive care and early consultation with a pulmonologist. In cases of massive or life-threatening hemoptysis, diagnosis and therapy must occur simultaneously. Airway maintenance is vital because the primary mechanism of death is asphyxiation, not exsanguination. Supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are essential. Assistance by a cardiothoracic surgeon should be considered because emergency surgical intervention may be needed.

### Massive hemoptysis simulation curriculum improves performance [^111jf2Ss]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Massive hemoptysis is a rare, high-acuity presentation, which requires the integration of both cognitive and procedural skills. Simulation has been recommended to improve preparation for high-acuity, low-occurrence procedures; however, the effect of a simulation curriculum for massive hemoptysis management has never been investigated.

Research Question

Does simulation for hemoptysis management improve competence?

Study Design and Methods

Kern's six steps for medical education curriculum design were used iteratively to develop a simulation curriculum for the management of massive hemoptysis. Pulmonary and critical care medicine fellows from the University of Colorado participated in a local needs assessment and a massive hemoptysis simulation curriculum. Using a manikin-based massive hemoptysis simulator developed for this curriculum, the simulation session used repetitive practice, clinical variation, a range of difficulties, and directed feedback in a group practice setting. Time to management and performance were assessed for each management attempt; competence was assessed using a combined metric of management-related priorities and global entrustment.

Results

During the needs assessment, fellows viewed massive hemoptysis management skills as important, while expressing their current confidence as low. Nineteen fellows participated in a 90-min case-based hemoptysis simulation during which each was exposed to five different cases and acted as the primary manager for two cases. There was significant improvement in performance from the first to final simulation attempts measured by time to successful management (14.24 vs 10.26 min, P = .0067) and entrustment (Global Assessment Scale, 1 [should not perform] to 5 [independent]; 4.11 vs 4.61; p = 0.015). Fellow self-assessed knowledge and confidence in hemoptysis management and endobronchial blocker placement improved significantly after the simulation.

Interpretation

Hemoptysis simulation experience improves fellow confidence and skill for management of this high-acuity, low-occurrence presentation.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^114shBDA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Detection rate of the bleeding source (anatomical site, lobe, and lung) in association with the bronchoscopic timing

In the subgroup of patients with mild hemoptysis, an early bronchoscopy did not show a higher ability to detect the source of the bleeding in comparison with a delayed one (site: 33/128, 25.8%, VS. 40/202, 19.8%; p-value = 0.20; lobe: 43/128, 33.6% VS. 52/203, 25.6%; p-value = 0.12; lung: 51/128, 39.8% VS. 60/203, 29.6%; p-value = 0.05).

In patients who underwent both CT and bronchoscopy, CT showed a significantly higher ability to detect the exact site of bleeding than bronchoscopy, both in early (130/252 (51.6%) VS. 73/190 (38.4%), p-value = 0.006) and delayed examinations (111/293 (37.9%) VS. 65/261 (24.9%); p-value = 0.001).

Bronchoscopy showed an overall diagnostic yield of 48.7% (237/487).

The most prevalent definitive clinical diagnosis after complete work-up where bronchoscopy showed positive findings (i.e. provided histopathological and/or microbiological specimens useful for an etiological diagnosis) were pulmonary malignancy (97/112, 86.6%;), pneumonia (31/78, 39.7%), bronchiectasis (25/65, 38.5%), and acute bronchitis (20/65, 30.8%).

In 6/65 (9.2%) patients with a final diagnosis of bronchiectasis, the bleeding source was localized only by bronchoscopy (inconclusive bilateral findings at CT scan). In 59/65 (90.7%) bronchoscopy was performed to collect microbiological/cytological samples, showing positive findings in 25/59 (42.4%) patients.

Cystic fibrosis hemoptysis — panel statements specify actions across severity, adjunct care, and procedures: The patient with massive hemoptysis should contact a health care provider. The patient with mild-to-moderate hemoptysis should always be admitted to the hospital, and the patient with massive hemoptysis should always be admitted to the hospital. The patient with scant hemoptysis, but no other features of an acute pulmonary exacerbation, should always be treated with antibiotics, and the patient with mild-to-moderate hemoptysis should always be treated with antibiotics. The patient with scant hemoptysis should stop NSAIDs; the patient with mild-to-moderate hemoptysis should stop NSAIDs; and the patient with massive hemoptysis should stop NSAIDs. The patient with massive hemoptysis who is clinically unstable should always be treated with BAE (bronchial artery embolization). All patients with hemoptysis should undergo bronchoscopy before BAE, and all patients with hemoptysis should have a CT (computed tomography) of the chest before BAE. For BAE, only the suspected or known bleeding vessel should be embolized. For the patient with massive hemoptysis and who is using BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) as a chronic therapy, the BiPAP should be discontinued as long as there is bleeding. The patient with hemoptysis should never undergo lung resection.

For any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms, of > 2–3 wk duration, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB, collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient with HIV infection and with cough and fever, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 d of treatment, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an abnormal chest radiograph suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal or absent, the recommended evaluation is review of previous chest radiographs if available, three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture.

### Long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis [^115kfsWv]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Haemoptysis is a challenging symptom that can be associated with potentially life-threatening medical conditions. Recent studies have shown that lung cancer, bronchiectasis, and lower respiratory tract infections are the most frequent aetiologies. However, despite an accurate initial work-up, a subgroup of patients with haemoptysis does not have an aetiological diagnosis (i.e. idiopathic or cryptogenic haemoptysis); furthermore, diagnostic changes from the baseline assessment to recurrences have been recently described. In particular, lung cancers and bronchiectasis were subsequently diagnosed in patients with an initial diagnosis of idiopathic haemoptysis and lower respiratory tract infection. In this context, follow-up is key to detecting new or misdiagnosed pathologic findings (e.g. lung malignancy).

Several factors might influence the long-term prognostic outcomes of patients with haemoptysis. Few prospective studies have evaluated the survival rate, the mortality-related risk factors, or the incidence of recurrence and its associated variables. Furthermore, the role played by antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs is still unclear.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the mortality after 18 months of follow-up; furthermore, the incidence of recurrence and the risk factors for recurrence and death were evaluated. The role of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs on these outcomes was also studied.

### Endovascularly treatable causes of hemoptysis: guide for emergency radiologists [^1134M5Ux]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the setting of hemoptysis in the emergency department, the initial step is to identify patients with a life-threatening condition. With endovascular therapy now established as the preferred approach for managing acute bleeding, one of the primary challenges is determining whether there is an underlying cause of hemoptysis associated with treatable vessels. CT angiography has become the diagnostic modality of choice because it provides a comprehensive vascular map in a single acquisition by enabling evaluation of the bronchial arteries, nonbronchial systemic arteries, and pulmonary arteries. The authors review the imaging features of various conditions associated with hemoptysis that are amenable to endovascular treatment, including bronchial and nonbronchial systemic artery hypertrophy, aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts, aortobronchial fistulas, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, systemic artery-to-pulmonary vein malformations and fistulas, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. A structured reporting approach is proposed to aid emergency radiologists in lesion characterization and accurate identification of patients suitable for endovascular treatment. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### An integrated approach to diagnosis and management of severe haemoptysis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a case series from a referral centre [^113CTHPv]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Using a strategy including a routine assessment of the amount of bleeding with a standardized scale, and promoting BAE over surgery, the outcomes of patients were good. The ICU mortality rate was low, as reported in recent series of so-called life-threatening haemoptysis.

The limitations of our study are related to its retrospective nature and to the fact that it was conducted in a referral centre with an extensive experience of severe haemoptysis on a heterogeneous patients' group. Nevertheless, our study reports one of the largest series of medical inpatients over a short time period and may provide a useful framework for the therapeutic management of haemoptysis in this clinical setting.

To summarize, a multidisciplinary approach remains the cornerstone for the management of severe haemoptysis. Bedside clinical evaluation and early fiberoptic bronchoscopy may safely screen patients for initial BAE, including surgical candidates. In the latter, surgery should be postponed as much as possible during active bleeding and performed early after control of bleeding. Otherwise, surgery should be reserved to cases of failure of interventional radiology and/or uncontrolled bleeding despite embolisation. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the safety and the reproducibility of such a therapeutic approach; this approach may also be influenced by the use of the multi detector row helical CT scan, which can depict accurately the bronchial and non bronchial arteries, prior to the embolisation.

### Hemoptysis [^113svQue]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is a common complaint the emergency physician encounters. Most cases are minor and treatable or self-limited. In many cases a cause is never determined. Massive hemoptysis is an occasional occurrence that must be assessed and managed swiftly. The initial approach is no different than that for any bleeding or respiratory or hemodynamically unstable patient. The emergency physician must stabilize, localize, and stop bleeding, and include required specialists to achieve that purpose. The management suggestions presented in this article are simplistic. The emergence of improved CT technology and new bronchoscopic and angiographic techniques has provided safe and effective alternatives to surgery for many causes of hemoptysis. Surgery, however, continues to be the treatment of choice for some. Being familiar with the broad list of causes is imperative to keeping an approach organized.

### Hemoptysis: unilateral pulmonary artery atresia? a case report [^1112eehG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment options for adult patients presenting with congenital absence of a pulmonary artery include pneumonectomy, lobectomy, and ligation and embolization of arteriovenous malformations. Based on our review of the prior literature, there have only been a handful reports to date of pneumonectomy for symptomatic congenital absence of a pulmonary artery in an adult and merely three reports describing surgical treatment of a left sided absence.

The first case was a 35-year-old gentleman with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and exertional dyspnea who presented with hemoptysis and respiratory distress. CT scan demonstrated a left sided pulmonary artery interruption and a right-sided aortic arch. Embolization was performed, with initial cessation of the patient's hemoptysis. However, recurrence of mild hemoptysis occurred within one week and the patient subsequently underwent repeat embolization followed by a left pneumonectomy. The authors reported no repeat hospitalizations or respiratory infections 18 months post-operatively. Another report described a case involving a 70-year-old gentleman who presented with exertional dyspnea and productive cough but no hemoptysis and was found to have an absent left pulmonary artery with a right-sided aortic arch. Collateral arteries arising from the left internal mammary artery were identified. Embolization followed by pneumonectomy was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. The third case was of a 52-year-old lady who had a known congenital absence of the left pulmonary artery and a right-sided aortic arch. Contrary to the patient in our report, this patient had a history of recurrent left-sided pulmonary infections. The patient eventually underwent a pneumonectomy with resolution of her recurrent infections.

Beyond the patient in our report remaining asymptomatic until the age of 55 and our management strategy, the described case was unique as the patient underwent multiple bronchoscopies with no clear etiology behind his hemoptysis until re-evaluation of his vasculature was performed. As mentioned previously, the initial bronchoscopy demonstrated active oozing from the left lower lobe which was managed with topical epinephrine. Two months later, another bronchoscopy was performed after a repeat episode of hemoptysis with no remarkable findings or endobronchial lesions.

### Hemoptysis: a serendipitous discovery [^111MGMWh]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

The etiology of hemoptysis can sometimes be difficult to identify and requires a complete and sequential approach. It is also important to initially maintain a broad differential diagnosis. We present a patient who had an extremely rare adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasopharynx as the cause of hemoptysis. This also highlights the importance of having a uniformly systematic approach to bronchoscopic inspection, with careful attention to areas beyond the actual tracheobronchial tree. Often, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal regions are not as meticulously inspected during bronchoscopy. The fact that careful attention to both nares by bronchoscopic inspection aided the final diagnosis suggests that a thorough examination to these often overlooked areas should be routine.

### Clinical approach to massive hemoptysis: perioperative focus on causes and management [^112cVE5o]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a time critical airway emergency in the perioperative setting, with an associated mortality exceeding 50%. Causes of hemoptysis in the perioperative setting include procedural complication, coagulopathy, malignancy, chronic lung disease, infection, left-sided cardiac disease, pulmonary vascular disease and autoimmune disease. A rapid and coordinated multidisciplinary response is required to secure the airway, isolate the lung, ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, identify the underlying cause and initiate specific systemic, bronchoscopic, endovascular, or surgical treatment. This review examines the etiology, pathophysiology, as well as approach to management and interventions in perioperative massive hemoptysis.

### The emergency department evaluation and management of massive hemoptysis [^1131Yu3B]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening emergency that requires rapid evaluation and management. Recognition of this deadly condition, knowledge of the initial resuscitation and diagnostic evaluation, and communication with consultants capable of definitive management are key to successful treatment.

Objective

The objective of this narrative review is to provide an evidence-based review on the management of massive hemoptysis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Rapid diagnosis and management of life-threatening hemoptysis is key to patient survival. The majority of cases arise from the bronchial arterial system, which is under systemic blood pressure. Initial management includes patient and airway stabilization, reversal of coagulopathy, and identification of the source of bleeding using computed tomography angiogram. Bronchial artery embolization with interventional radiology has become the mainstay of treatment; however, unstable patients may require advanced bronchoscopic procedures to treat or temporize while additional information and treatment can be directed at the underlying pathology.

Conclusion

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening condition that emergency clinicians must be prepared to manage. Emergency clinicians should focus their management on immediate resuscitation, airway preservation often including intubation and isolation of the non-bleeding lung, and coordination of definitive management with available consultants including interventional radiology, interventional pulmonology, and thoracic surgery.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113AuUye]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) considerations for children with cough in high-prevalence settings: For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries or settings, we suggest (a) that they be screened for TB regardless of cough duration (Grade 2C) and (b) the addition of active case finding to passive case finding because it may improve outcomes in patients with pulmonary TB (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, but CXRs should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough suspected to have pulmonary TB and at high risk of drug-resistant TB, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF assay, where available, replace sputum microscopy but sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing and CXRs should be performed when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, and/or weight loss, and who are at risk of pulmonary TB in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that they should have a CXR if resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^114MvgFW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bronchoscopy plays a key role to diagnose the etiology, to localize the site, and to identify the sources of the bleeding in patients with hemoptysis, but the ideal timing of an endoscopic examination is still unclear.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of an observational and multicenter study, aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of hemoptysis in Italy and the diagnostic yield of the most frequently prescribed examinations. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether an early bronchoscopy (i.e. performed during active bleeding/ ≤ 48 h after hemoptysis stopped) helps localize bleeding (i.e. site, lobe, lung) and increase diagnostic yield in comparison with a delayed examination.

Results

Four hundred eighty-six consecutive adult patients (69.2% males; median [IQR] age: 67 [53–76] years) with hemoptysis requiring an etiological diagnosis and undergoing bronchoscopy were recruited.

Bleeding focus could be located more frequently in case of moderate-severe bleedings than in cases of mild hemoptysis (site: 70/154, 45.4%, VS. 73/330, 22.1%; p -value < 0.0001; lobe: 95/155, 61.3%, VS. 95/331, 28.7%; p-value < 0.0001; lung: 101/155, 65.1%, VS. 111/331, 33.5%; p -value < 0.0001). Early bronchoscopy showed a higher detection rate of bleeding source in comparison with delayed examination (site: 76/214, 35.5%, VS. 67/272, 24.6%; p -value = 0.01; lobe: 98/214, 45.8%, VS. 92/272, 33.8%; p-value = 0.007; lung: 110/214, 51.4%, VS. 102/272, 37.5%; p-value = 0.002). Early bronchoscopy did not provide any advantages in terms of increased diagnostic yield, in the total cohort (113/214, 52.8%, VS. 123/272, 45.2%; p-value = 0.10) and in the severity subtypes (mild: 56/128, 43.8%, VS. 88/203, 43.4%; p-value = 0.94; moderate-severe: 57/86, 66.2%, VS. 35/69, 50.7%; p-value = 0.051).

Conclusions

Early bronchoscopy helps detect bleeding sources, particularly in cases of moderate-severe hemoptysis, without increasing diagnostic accuracy.

### Radiological management of hemoptysis: a comprehensive review of diagnostic imaging and bronchial arterial embolization [^115s8qP9]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis can be a life-threatening respiratory emergency and indicates potentially serious underlying intrathoracic disease. Large-volume hemoptysis carries significant mortality and warrants urgent investigation and intervention. Initial assessment by chest radiography, bronchoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) is useful in localizing the bleeding site and identifying the underlying cause. Multidetector CT angiography is a relatively new imaging technique that allows delineation of abnormal bronchial and nonbronchial arteries using reformatted images in multiple projections, which can be used to guide therapeutic arterial embolization procedures. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is now considered to be the most effective procedure for the management of massive and recurrent hemoptysis, either as a first-line therapy or as an adjunct to elective surgery. It is a safe technique in the hands of an experienced operator with knowledge of bronchial artery anatomy and the potential pitfalls of the procedure. Recurrent bleeding is not uncommon, especially if there is progression of the underlying disease process. Prompt repeat embolization is advised in patients with recurrent hemoptysis in order to identify nonbronchial systemic and pulmonary arterial sources of bleeding. This article reviews the pathophysiology and causes of hemoptysis, diagnostic imaging and therapeutic options, and technique and outcomes of BAE.

### High risk and low incidence diseases: massive hemoptysis [^1111XNNL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Massive hemoptysis (MH) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of massive hemoptysis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

MH is a rare but deadly condition. It is defined clinically as any bleeding from the tracheobronchial tree that compromises respiratory or circulatory function. The bronchial artery system is the primary source in the majority of cases of MH. The most common cause is tuberculosis worldwide, but bronchiectasis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and mycetoma are more common causes in the U.S. Patients with MH require rapid assessment and management, as decompensation can be rapid. Patients with altered mental status, inability to clear their sections, respiratory distress, or hemodynamic compromise require emergent airway intervention. The imaging modality of choice is computed tomography angiography with pulmonary arterial phase contrast. A reasonable order or sequence of management includes initial stabilization; assessment for the need for airway intervention; reversal of any coagulopathy; advanced imaging; and emergent consultation of pulmonary, cardiothoracic surgery, and interventional radiology. Ongoing resuscitation including blood products may be required in some patients with MH until definitive hemostasis is achieved.

Conclusions

An understanding of MH can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this dangerous disease. Providing a prompt evaluation, obtaining intravenous access, pursuing advanced imaging, providing reversal of coagulopathy, supporting hemodynamics, and appropriate consultation are key interventions in MH.

### Randomised trial of first-line bronchial artery embolisation for non-severe haemoptysis of mild abundance [^116ioJEr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomised trial, we aimed to investigate whether early first-line BAE had beneficial effects compared with medical therapy alone in the management of non-severe acute haemoptysis of mild abundance related to a systemic bronchial artery hypervascularisation. As compared with the medical strategy alone, the addition of early BAE achieved a higher efficacy in bleeding control at 1 and 3 months, but was associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications.

The most difficult issues in the initial management of haemoptysis is to assess its severity and estimate the risk of bleeding recurrence, which condition the therapeutic decision and the time to its implementation. Life-threatening haemoptysis associated with high bleeding amounts, acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or shock, which involve 10% of the patients with haemoptysis, mandate prompt management in an intensive care setting. In this context, the therapeutic management include the administration of inhaled or systemic vasoconstrictors or antifibrinolytic drugs, and the use of bronchoscopy-guided tamponade by flexible or rigid bronchoscope. The place of emergency surgery has gradually decreased because of high operative mortality rates, whereas interventional radiology has emerged worldwide as the most effective non-surgical first-line treatment, despite the lack of strong evidence from randomised trials. BAE results in immediate bleeding control in most of these severe cases with a satisfactory risk:benefit ratio.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^112LnU9h]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective study 9.6% of patients were diagnosed to have respiratory tract malignancy. In spite of our local policy, all the patients who presented with haemoptysis may not have been referred to us, leading to selection bias. Previous studies found a 0–16% cancer detection rate in patients presenting with haemoptysis and normal CXR.

Haemoptysis is the presenting symptom in up to 19% of the patients with lung cancer. Poe et al found that coughing up > 30 mL of blood increased the diagnostic yield. In our study only 5 patients with lung cancer had a tablespoonful, recurrent haemoptysis, and more than half of the patients had only streak(s) with infrequent episodes of haemoptysis lasting less than a week. Fidan et al reported in a retrospective analysis of patients presenting with haemoptysis that just over 40% of patients with lung cancer presented with mild and non-recurrent haemoptysis.

Some studies looked at whether patients above a particular age should be investigated. Sood et al analysed all the studies published so far and concluded that age above 50, male sex and smokers of 40 pack-years had the highest predictive value for bronchogenic carcinoma. In contrast, Cortese et al reported radiologically occult lung cancer in 5.5% of patients who were < 50 years old. A primary care cohort study reported higher positive predictive value for cancer in patients aged above 55 years when they present with haemoptysis irrespective of CXR appearance. The median age of patients with lung cancer in our study is 69 years with male predominance (85%).

Both FOB and CT have definite important roles in evaluating haemoptysis in patients with abnormal CXR for bronchogenic carcinoma. A lung cancer detection rate of up to 21% with bronchoscopy alone in patients with haemoptysis and normal CXR has been reported. Prospective studies by Tak et al and Haro et al indicate that FOB and CT are complementary, irrespective of CXR findings. Even though FOB is a relatively straightforward procedure it still carries a small risk.

### Executive summary: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111doXv9]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to symptomatic management, hemoptysis, ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend to perform bronchoscopy to identify the source of bleeding in patients with lung cancer and non-large-volume hemoptysis. Offer endobronchial management options for visible central airway lesions. Offer EBRT for distal or parenchymal lesions.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^1175MU6y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our findings, based on a larger prospective and multicenter study, confirmed the results of Gong et al. In comparison with their findings, we detected a higher proportion of focal bleeding sites, probably owing to the higher prevalence of neoplasms (mostly endobronchial) in our cohort. Moreover, as observed by Gong et al. we could not detect active bleeding in the majority of the cases and we could not assess a better endoscopic ability in localizing bleeding sources associated with a very early evaluation.

Several study limitations should be acknowledged.

The observational nature of the study can increase the risk of a selection bias; however, the lack of evidence-based guidelines cannot support the design of an interventional, randomized control study for ethical reasons.

No guidelines exist on symptom severity. As previously reported, we grouped patients on the basis of their daily blood volume loss, without considering hemodynamic consequences and gas exchange impairment/airway obstruction. Life-threatening hemoptysis may depend on wide volume ranges of expectorated blood, as well as it may depend on other clinical variables (i.e. rate of bleeding, airways blood clearance, extent and severity of any underling lung and/or cardiac disease).

In case of life-threatening hemoptysis, airways patency should be immediately preserved; in this context, rigid bronchoscopy or tracheal intubation are better options in comparison with flexible bronchoscopy. Following ventilation recovery, flexible instrument may be used for diagnosis, localization of the bleeding source, and therapy.

We did not evaluate if different endoscopic timing might affect clinical management. This secondary analysis was aimed at the ideal timing of diagnostic endoscopy, without considering its role on long-term outcomes.

We demonstrated that bleeding source detection rate is higher in case of moderate-severe hemoptysis. It should be underscored that in critical cases of moderate-severe hemoptysis (i.e. life-threatening hemoptysis) bronchoscopy was always performed earlier if compared with cases of non-critical bleeding. This issue might have affected the findings of the study.

### Is there a role for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in patients presenting with haemoptysis and negative CT? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151XqH9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Haemoptysis can be a feature of lung cancer and patients are typically fast-tracked for evaluation with chest radiography, contrast-enhanced CT and fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB).

Objective

We aim to explore whether FOB should be conducted as a component of the routine evaluation of non-massive haemoptysis, especially in the context of suspected lung cancer.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for studies comparing FOB with CT in the evaluation of non-massive haemoptysis while reporting at least one of the listed primary outcomes. Primary outcomes include sensitivity of diagnostic modality with respect to lung cancer. Secondary outcomes include detection of other aetiologies such as infection. Results were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed for patient age group and year of study. Risk of bias assessment was carried out with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool.

Results

A total of 2273 citations were screened and 11 studies were included, comprising a total sample size of 2015 patients with 226 confirmed cases of lung cancer. A total of 1816 and 1734 patients received a CT scan and FOB, respectively. The pooled sensitivities for detection of lung cancer using CT scan and bronchoscopy were 98% (95% CI 93.0% to 99.0%) and 86% (95% CI 63.0% to 95.0%), respectively. The sensitivity of CT was higher than that of FOB for both primary and secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

This study suggests that bronchoscopy does not offer significant additional diagnostic benefit in the evaluation of patients presenting with non-massive haemoptysis and a negative CT scan.

### Hemoptysis, a developing world perspective [^116zzofQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoptysis is a significant clinical presentation in respiratory medicine. Often a life threatening emergency, it mandates prompt assessment and intervention. Various investigations and management protocols are proposed globally, to advocate a standardized approach towards patients presenting with hemoptysis. It is the etiology, however, that has been known to influence clinical outcome and prognosis. With marked contrast in geographical patterns of pulmonary pathologies, etiological agents for hemoptysis vary over the world. Studies in West, usually demonstrate neoplastic and non-granulomatous causes to be the leading agents for hemoptysis. The diagnostic accuracy of various investigations and efficacy of management alternatives has been established there. Developing nations differ in their burden of diseases of lung. Lack of health resources and initiative often prevent quality research in critical areas.

Design

This is a retrospective observational study with a cross-sectional design in which charts of all patients admitted with the presentation of haemoptysis in the past ten years will be reviewed, at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A series of variables, based on previous literature on haemoptysis related to the objectives of present study, will be determined in the study. Demographics, co-morbids and etiology will be determined. Findings of various investigation modalities and their accuracy in localizing the bleeding site will be determined. Efficacy of different management strategies will also be observed. Also observed will be any complications and follow-up.

Discussion

Pakistan is a third world nation of over 150 million, established as highly endemic for pulmonary tuberculosis. To date no study has been generated to look into hemoptysis patterns, in this nation. Lack of evidence based medicine poses a major hindrance towards confident decision-making in the approach towards a patient presenting with hemoptysis in this country. This study is devised to obtain the first insight in this direction, from this part of the world. The etiologies, accuracy of various investigations and efficacy of treatment options will be investigated. The results and conclusions will prove to be of value not just for health administrators in this country, but many other regions that share similarities in patterns of pulmonary pathologies.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115LeAdp]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^113RY6Jo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This secondary analysis, which involves a large cohort of patients, was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of bronchoscopy for hemoptysis etiology and for bleeding source detection in relation with endoscopic timing. As previously demonstrated by Hirshberg et al. our results showed that the bleeding source detection rate can be higher in case of moderate-severe hemoptysis. This finding is key in case of life-threatening events, when an accurate localization of the bleeding focus is needed to administer endoscopic therapies and/or to guide angiographic embolization.

We also demonstrated that bronchoscopy can better detect bleeding sources (i.e. anatomical site, lobe, and lung) when it is performed within 48 h from the last hemoptysis episode. This is significantly relevant for patients with moderate and severe bleeding. Indeed, when the mild group is considered alone, we failed to detect any differences between early and delayed examinations.

Notably, an investigation performed within 24 h hemoptysis subsided failed to improve the detection rate in the total cohort in comparison with a bronchoscopy performed within 48 h.

Interestingly, a bronchoscopy performed within 48 h after hemoptysis interruption does not significantly increase the diagnostic yield, regardless of symptom severity and final diagnosis.

Few studies have evaluated the most appropriate timing for diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with hemoptysis.

Gong et al. retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 129 patients with hemoptysis and showed that an early examination (i.e. bleeding subsided less than 48 h prior to the bronchoscopy) provided a higher bleeding detection rate; however, diagnostic yield and patient management did not improve. Hsiao et al. showed in a group of non-cancer patients with moderate-severe hemoptysis that bronchoscopy performed within 24 h from the first bleeding episode was associated with a significantly higher detection rate of the bleeding source.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113YWGsH]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis in lung cancer — Hemoptysis (expectoration of blood) is the presenting symptom in 7% to 10% of patients with lung cancer. Massive hemoptysis, which most commonly requires intervention, has as a broad definition the expectoration of at least 200 mL of blood in 24 h. The mortality rate of massive hemoptysis may be as high as 59% to 100% in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. For patients with significant hemoptysis caused by a surgically resectable tumor, surgical resection of the bleeding lobe or the entire lung may be appropriate.

### Hemoptysis, a developing world perspective [^1117jTNA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoptysis refers to expectoration of blood from respiratory tract. Often lethal, it is a frightening presentation for patient and relatives. A major emergency in pulmonary medicine, it necessitates a timely and apt approach.

While emergency resuscitation protocols may overlap, medical advance is usually directed on basis of severity and etiology of hemoptysis. Apposite clinical assessment and investigations are thus paramount in formulating the management proposal. After adequate airway protection and insurance of ventilatory and cardiovascular stability, in case of gross hemoptysis, imaging is usually resorted to, for indication of the pathology and localization of bleeding site. Chest roentgenography is frequently valuable in illustrating the disease process. Computed tomography has also been established in recent decades as a particularly sensitive diagnostic and localizing tool in hemoptysis. Endoscopic assessment, however, by rigid and/or flexible bronchoscopy is often warranted. Both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, it is aimed to lateralize the bleeding side; localize the bleeding site and identify the cause. In case of rapid and severe hemorrhage making airway visualization impossible, emergent rigid bronchoscopy or arteriography may be employed, for successful isolation and subsequent clogging of the bleeding vessel.

Management approach is prioritized to control ongoing hemoptysis with endotracheal intubation and intensive care monitoring. In cases with lateralized or localized persistent bleeding immediate, albeit transient, control of the airway may be obtained with topical therapy, endobronchial tamponade, or unilateral intubation of the nonbleeding lung. Angioembolization of the pathologic bleeding bronchial arterial vessels is now globally recommended as the treatment of choice in most cases. Apart from being a definitive treatment modality, it provides valuable time and prevents bleeding during operation in patients undergoing subsequent surgical intervention. Conservative management is generally preferred and associated with lesser mortality rates. Surgery is usually advocated in case of failure of embolotherapy, persistent hemodynamic and respiratory compromise and accurate identification of the bleeding site. Lobectomy, pneumectomy, wedge resection, segmentectomy or a combination of these approaches may be adapted. Emergent resection, however, is associated with greater risks in comparison to elective surgery, and should generally be reserved for when general condition and vital organs of the patient would permit surgical therapy.

### Is there a role for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in patients presenting with haemoptysis and negative CT? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NvMxJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis provides evidence to support the potential omission of FOB in the evaluation of patients presenting with haemoptysis in the context of suspected lung cancer, when the CT scan is either normal or reports other benign abnormalities. Future studies evaluating the role of advanced bronchoscopic techniques in diagnosing precancerous mucosal lesions in at-risk populations along with diagnostic modality efficacy based on lesion localisation should be considered.

### An integrated approach to diagnosis and management of severe haemoptysis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a case series from a referral centre [^115WETEF]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

The study was conducted between January 1999 and December 2001 in Tenon hospital, a tertiary university hospital and referral centre for haemoptysis in Paris, France. All consecutive patients admitted to the respiratory intermediate care ward or ICU for severe haemoptysis were eligible. Exclusion criteria were iatrogenic bleeding, bleeding of gastrointestinal and oropharyngeal origin, heart failure, intra alveolar haemorrhage and incomplete data. For each patient, the following information were recorded: baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, initial clinical presentation and vital signs, laboratory tests results, chest radiography, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and CT scan findings when performed, severity of haemoptysis, and pre-ICU and in-ICU management. The persistence or recurrence of bleeding, the patients' ICU and hospital lengths of stay and their vital status at discharge were recorded, as well as the occurrence of long-term rebleeding. Patients with recurrent haemoptysis were included at the first episode only.

Definitions

1. Severity of haemoptysis

The severity of haemoptysis on admission was assessed according to (i) the cumulated amount of bleeding; (ii) the consequences of bleeding; (iii) and the presence of associated severe cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities. The cumulated amount of bleeding on admission was assessed from the onset of bleeding until the first hours of admission to our unit using the following standardized scale: a spoonful (5 ml), a small filled glass (100 ml) and a large filled glass (200 ml). The consequences of bleeding were assessed on the need for administration of local or systemic terlipressin, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs or blood transfusions before referral or within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.

2. Cause of haemoptysis

The cause of haemoptysis was diagnosed on the combination of history, physical examination, chest radiography, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, CT scan, microbiology and histology when available. Definite causes were bronchiectasis (including inactive tuberculosis), active tuberculosis, cancer and mycetoma. Pulmonary venous thrombo-embolic disease, pneumonia and emphysema were classified as probable causes. Haemoptysis was considered cryptogenic when no cause was evidenced.

3. Course of haemoptysis

Immediate control of bleeding was defined as a cessation of bleeding obtained without recurrence until hospital discharge, whatever the therapeutic option used. Rebleeding was defined as the persistence and/or the recurrence of bleeding after treatment. Early-onset rebleeding was defined as occurring within the first 30 days, and late-onset as rebleeding after one month.

### Bronchoscopy to assess patients with hemoptysis: which is the optimal timing? [^116gwAPH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of an observational and multicenter study, aimed at evaluating epidemiology of hemoptysis in Italy and diagnostic yield of the most frequently prescribed diagnostic examinations. The study protocol was approved by ethical committees of five Italian participating hospitals (Milan, Mantua, Lodi, Sassari, Ancona) and registered at(identifier: NCT02045394). Written informed consent was signed by recruited patients.

From July 2013 to September 2015, consecutively recruited adult (i.e. ≥ 18 years old) patients with hemoptysis requiring an etiological diagnosis underwent bronchoscopy. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) etiology of hemoptysis already found; 2) refusal to sign the informed consent.

Severity of hemoptysis was assessed by the attending physician considering the daily amount of expectorated blood: mild (from some drops of blood to 20 mL (ml)/24 h –h-), moderate (20–500 ml/24 h), severe (> 500 ml/24 h).

Bronchoscopic examination was considered positive only if it proved an endobronchial bleeding lesion and/or provided histopathological and/or microbiological specimens, helpful for a definitive etiological diagnosis. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of bronchoscopy to detect the bleeding source (i.e. anatomic site, lobe, and lung). The site of the bleeding was defined as the exact visible hemorrhage source (e.g. a visible bleeding endobronchial malignancy). Direct visualization of active bleeding/oozing was considered suggestive of a bleeding source. During the analysis patients undergoing bronchoscopy were divided into two groups on the basis of the timing of bronchoscopy in relation with hemoptysis interruption. The 48-h cut-off was chosen according to the only available study which evaluated the same topic (i.e. diagnostic yield and ability of bronchoscopy to localize the bleeding source in relation to the time of the intervention).

### Long-term prognostic outcomes in patients with haemoptysis [^1142af3c]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This is a secondary analysis of an observational, prospective, multicentre, Italian study aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of haemoptysis in Italy and the diagnostic yield of the most frequently prescribed diagnostic techniques. It was approved by the ethical committees of five Italian participating hospitals and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02045394). Written informed consent was provided by all recruited patients, who were followed-up for 18 months.

One month after the recruitment and the first initial assessment, a hospital clinical re-evaluation was scheduled. After three, six, nine, twelve, and eighteen months, a phone call was planned for every patient. At each follow-up visit, information on the occurrence, timing, and severity of recurrences was collected.

In case of a recurrence, a new clinical assessment was performed; data on clinical, radiological, and endoscopic examinations, as well as on symptom management were recorded.

Patients and interventions

From July 2013 to September 2015, adult (i.e. ≥ 18 years old) patients with haemoptysis requiring an aetiological diagnosis were considered eligible for recruitment and consecutively enrolled. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) aetiology of haemoptysis already known; 2) refusal to sign the informed consent. The follow-up period lasted from December 2015 to February 2018.

The severity of haemoptysis was graded by the first attending physician. Patients were divided into three groups based on the total amount of blood expectorated in 24 h (h): mild (i.e. drops of blood to 20 millilitres (ml)/24 h), moderate (i.e. 20–500 ml/24 h), severe (i.e. > 500 ml/24 h).

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the survival rate of patients with haemoptysis. Furthermore, the incidence of recurrence was calculated, and the main factors associated with recurrence and mortality were determined. The effectiveness of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs on these outcomes was specifically investigated. Changes in the diagnosis of haemoptysis from baseline to the end of follow-up were recorded.

### Long-term outcome and lung cancer incidence in patients with hemoptysis of unknown origin [^114gEQrt]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To provide current data on the long-term outcome and incidence of lung cancer in a large cohort of patients with hemoptysis of unknown origin.

Design

A retrospective chart review followed by a telephone interview for follow-up.

Setting

A university-affiliated tertiary referral center for pulmonary diseases.

Patients

Seven hundred twenty-two patients who presented with hemoptysis from January 1990 to December 1993. One hundred thirty-five patients were identified as having hemoptysis of unknown origin.

Results

One hundred thirty-five patients (19%) had hemoptysis of unknown origin; follow-up data were obtained in 115 patients, of whom 100 were still alive. The mean time of observation was 6.6 years after initial presentation. Lung cancer developed in 7 of 115 patients (6%) and was unresectable once detected; all of these patients were smokers > 40 years old, and malignancy developed within 3 years after first presentation.

Conclusions

Hemoptysis of unknown origin is present in a minority of patients presenting with hemoptysis if evaluated at a referral center for pulmonary diseases. Lung cancer seems to be increasing in these patients compared to previous studies, and closer follow-up or additional testing may be indicated in the defined population at risk.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114vDBiZ]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough in adults — The updated management algorithm includes the suggestions that history should be sought for hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptom and, if present, should be immediately addressed and evaluated; a validated cough severity tool be routinely used to assess outcome of therapy; environmental and occupational exposures be considered and addressed if present; recognition that acid suppression alone is no longer recommended for treating cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease; sitagliptin, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, be discontinued to see if the drug is responsible for the cough; patients be routinely followed in the clinic within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial evaluation; and referral to a well-recognized cough clinic should be considered for the refractory unexplained chronic cough.

### Pediatric hemoptysis: diagnostic and interventional challenges [^116coFfG]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis in the pediatric population, while infrequent, poses significant challenges for both the family and healthcare practitioners. The severity of hemoptysis dictates management decisions. Most cases being mild and self-limiting are treated conservatively. However, "life-threatening hemoptysis" may occur, and is defined as any degree of blood loss that endangers the airway and is arbitrarily considered to be > 8 ml/kg in 24 h in children. It requires prompt airway management and resuscitation followed by a tailored approach consisting of bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), interventional radiology, and/or surgery depending on the patient 's clinical status and cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Bronchial arteries are hypertrophied in myriad conditions and account for 90–95% cases of hemoptysis due to their systemic pressure levels; the rest being contributed by pulmonary artery pathologies. Despite similar pathogenic mechanisms, the etiologies of pediatric hemoptysis differ from those in adults, with acute lower respiratory tract infections being the predominant cause. Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying the source and cause of hemorrhage. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has emerged as a prime modality in the diagnostic evaluation of hemoptysis and provides a roadmap for potential interventional procedures. This article discusses the etiopathogenesis of hemoptysis along with a brief mention of the diagnostic modalities. It provides a structured reporting format and uses it to illustrate the imaging features in hemoptysis, with emphasis on CT angiography. The key findings in the lung parenchyma, airways, bronchial and non-bronchial systemic collaterals, and pulmonary arteries are elaborated upon. It further addresses the nuances of interventional management, particularly emphasizing the applications of bronchial artery embolization and pulmonary artery embolization in the pediatric population. The article also underscores the potential complications and factors influencing recurrence rates.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hemoptysis [^1137DAqD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemoptysis, the expectoration of blood, ranges in severity from nonmassive to massive. This publication reviews the literature on the imaging and treatment of hemoptysis. Based on the literature, the imaging recommendations for massive hemoptysis are both a chest radiograph and CT with contrast or CTA with contrast. Bronchial artery embolization is also recommended in the majority of cases. In nonmassive hemoptysis, both a chest radiograph and CT with contrast or CTA with contrast is recommended. Bronchial artery embolization is becoming more commonly utilized, typically in the setting of failed medical therapy. Recurrent hemoptysis, defined as hemoptysis that recurs following initially successful cessation of hemoptysis, is best reassessed with a chest radiograph and either CT with contrast or CTA with contrast. Bronchial artery embolization is increasingly becoming the treatment of choice in recurrent hemoptysis, with the exception of infectious causes such as in cystic fibrosis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Is investigation of patients with haemoptysis and normal chest radiograph justified? [^114hPeTQ]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

In a long-term outcome study of patients with haemoptysis of unknown aetiology Herth et al reported that 6% of patients developed lung cancer over a mean follow-up period of 6.6 years. Santiago et al reported 4% of patients developing lung cancer over a 6-year period when the initial investigations were inconclusive. All these patients were smokers and > 40 years of age. In our study, one patient developed lung cancer after a follow-up period of 20 months. The mean follow-up period in our study population was 36 months.

As far as we are aware, this study reports the largest group of consecutive patients with haemoptysis and normal CXR who were investigated with CT and FOB. Our study demonstrates the importance of investigating such patients. However, our study is retrospective and the characteristics of the patient population prevent us from making recommendations with respect to non-smokers, females or younger people.

### Is there a role for fibreoptic bronchoscopy in patients presenting with haemoptysis and negative CT? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zQ5vt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

As a result, early detection is a key focus in lung cancer management with a drive towards efficient and standardised lung cancer care. The National Optimal Lung Cancer Pathway in collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence developed a set of recommendations to facilitate standardised care from the point of referral to multidisciplinary team discussion for treatment discussion and recommendations. Furthermore, several clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of low-dose CT screening in reducing mortality from lung cancer among high-risk populations. They have demonstrated promising results reporting a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality rates in the screened population. On this basis, the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) has recommended a national screening programme for people aged 55–74 identified as being at high risk of lung cancer, in an effort to facilitate detection at an earlier stage.

Haemoptysis is a common clinical finding responsible for 6%–11% of all respiratory consultations. It is noted to exhibit a positive predictive value of 2.4%–17% and a prevalence of 2%–6% as an index presenting symptom for patients with lung cancer. Currently, lung cancer is diagnosed with the aid of a variety of modalities including chest X-rays, CT scans, positron-emission tomography CT) and fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB). British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines advice bronchoscopy for persistent haemoptysis despite a negative CT scan. Tissue sampling via processes such as endobronchial ultrasound or CT or ultrasound-guided percutaneous procedures also form an integral component as they enable ascertainment of pathological diagnosis, disease staging, tumour subtyping, molecular profiling and assessment of predictive markers. Advancement in multidetector CT has enabled high-resolution volumetric imaging for lung-specific applications at acceptable levels of radiation exposure.

### Multi-detector row CT of hemoptysis [^116Pxccg]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Hemoptysis is symptomatic of a potentially life-threatening condition and warrants urgent and comprehensive evaluation of the lung parenchyma, airways, and thoracic vasculature. Multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography is a very useful noninvasive imaging modality for initial assessment of hemoptysis. The combined use of thin-section axial scans and more complex reformatted images allows clear depiction of the origins and trajectories of abnormally dilated systemic arteries that may be the source of hemorrhage and that may require embolization. Conditions such as bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, lung malignancy, tuberculosis, and chronic fungal infection are some of the most common underlying causes of hemoptysis and are easily detected with CT. "Cryptogenic" hemoptysis is common among smokers and warrants subsequent follow-up imaging to exclude possible underlying malignancy. The bronchial arteries are the source of bleeding in most cases of hemoptysis. Contributions from the non-bronchial systemic arterial system represent an important cause of recurrent hemoptysis following apparently successful bronchial artery embolization. Vascular anomalies such as pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and bronchial artery aneurysms are other important causes of hemoptysis. Multi-detector row CT angiography permits noninvasive, rapid, and accurate assessment of the cause and consequences of hemorrhage into the airways and helps guide subsequent management.

Patients were not involved in the design of this systematic review and meta-analysis as it is not a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product.

Data sources and searches

PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1983 to 31 December 2022. The complete search strategies are fully described in the online supplemental file 1. The bibliographies of similar and related systematic reviewers also searched along with the reference sections of included studies. Only articles written in English were considered.

Study selection

Randomised control trials, non-randomised control trials, case–control studies, cohort studies, retrospective studies and cross-sectional studies that included patients with haemoptysis that underwent evaluation with CT and FOB were eligible for this review. Studies that conveyed primary and/or secondary outcome variables in addition to the above were included. Four reviewers (SM, TW, AM and NK) independently screened the retrieved articles for eligibility following deduplication by title and abstract. Any conflicts were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (GT).

Primary and secondary outcomes

The primary outcome was diagnostic test accuracy for lung cancer by the evaluated diagnostic modality. Secondary outcomes included detection of abnormalities, and potential explanatory aetiologies of haemoptysis such as infection or bronchiectasis.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Three reviewers (SM, TW and AM) independently extracted data from the included studies. Study characteristics collated included authors, year of study, country of study, study design, number and specific diagnostic modalities and presence of randomisation. Sample population characteristics included sample size, mean age (SD), gender composition, smoking history and associated smoking pack-years and described severity of haemoptysis according to the scale used by the respective studies. Primary outcomes collated included total number of confirmed lung cancer cases in each study, number of lung cancers detected as per diagnostic modality and number of false negatives (FN) from each diagnostic arm. Secondary outcome data included number of confirmed alternate aetiologies including infection and bronchiectasis according to diagnostic modality. Any discrepancies between two reviewers were arbitrated by a third reviewer and resolved by consensus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess individual study methodological quality.

### Executive summary: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114TyT58]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for non-small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to symptomatic management, hemoptysis, ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend to perform bronchoscopy to identify the source of bleeding in patients with lung cancer and non-large-volume hemoptysis. Offer endobronchial management options for visible central airway lesions. Offer EBRT for distal or parenchymal lesions.

Case Presentation

A 78-year-old Chinese man presented in March 2019 with a 2-day history of small-volume hemoptysis. He did not report any associated chronic cough, sputum production, epistaxis, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, or fever. He was an ex-smoker of 10 pack years. His medical history was significant for ischemic heart disease on aspirin, as well as hospitalizations in 2016 and 2017 for hemoptysis. The patient's evaluation for hemoptysis was only notable for a right middle lobe nodule on chest CT imaging and Klebsiella pneumoniae on sputum cultures, for which he was treated with antibiotics.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tracheobronchial disease [^114VDBBk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain chest CT for the assessment of complications of bronchiectasis and to detect changes in extent or severity of bronchiectasis and associated parenchymal disease. Obtain CXR as a first step in assessing thoracic diseases that can complicate bronchiectasis, such as infection, or in excluding other diseases that can cause worsening symptoms.
Consider obtaining contrast-enhanced chest CT in patients with suspected acute infection and associated complications. Consider obtaining CTA in cases of suspected bleeding as a cause of hemoptysis.

Results

A total of 486 adult patients (69.2% males; median [IQR] age: 67 [53–76] years) with hemoptysis were enrolled.

Hemoptysis volume was self-reported in 416/606 (68.6%) cases, whereas it was estimated by healthcare professionals in 190/606 (31.4%).

In moderate-severe hemoptysis 87/486 (17.9%) bronchoscopy was performed within 48 h hemoptysis stopped, while 69/486 (14.2%) after 48 h. In mild hemoptysis 128/486 (26.3%) endoscopic examinations were performed within 48 h, while 202/486 (41.6%) were performed after 48 h.

471/486 (96.9%) bronchoscopies were performed with a flexible bronchoscope, 2/486 (0.4%) with a flexible bronchoscope during endotracheal intubation (moderate bleedings), and 13/486 (2.7%) with a rigid scope. Flexible bronchoscope was used in 7/12 (58.3%) severe, 134/144 (93.0%) moderate, and 330/330 (100%) mild bleedings. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed in 5/12 (41.6%) severe and 8/144 (5.5%) moderate hemoptysis. In 20/486 (4.1%) patients, hemoptysis was considered potentially life-threatening. In case of life-threatening hemoptysis all bronchoscopies were performed as soon as possible (all during active hemoptysis - within 24 h hemoptysis subsided).
