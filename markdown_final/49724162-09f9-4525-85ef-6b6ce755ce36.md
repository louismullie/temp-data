## Question

Treatment allergic conjunctivitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the allergic conjunctivitis phenotype. Then, I should stratify severity and map treatment to severity tiers. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic options, followed by second-line and advanced therapies, and then nonpharmacologic measures. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities, and finally, I should outline monitoring, safety, and follow-up, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype because management hinges on getting this right. Itching is the hallmark symptom that helps distinguish allergic from infectious etiologies, and I should verify laterality, chronicity, and triggers to classify seasonal versus perennial versus vernal or atopic disease, while also remembering that allergic conjunctivitis is common and often underrecognized, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion and avoid anchoring on infection when itching predominates [^115mqPVn] [^116DcWjy] [^113eJ6MH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also consider the differential, especially viral and bacterial conjunctivitis, and I need to check for mucopurulent discharge with lid matting that suggests bacterial disease versus watery discharge with itching that favors allergy, while remembering that clinical features alone can misclassify cases and that overprescription of antibiotics is common, so I should double-check the history and exam before committing to antibiotics or steroids [^115mqPVn] [^112gCnTG] [^117E7fSP].

> Next, I should review severity stratification to guide therapy. Mild disease is intermittent with minimal impact on activities, moderate has frequent symptoms with functional impairment, and severe or chronic forms like vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis cause persistent symptoms with risk of corneal involvement and vision threat, so I need to ensure I escalate therapy appropriately when disease is moderate to severe or sight-threatening [^117YCyuQ] [^1154By8B] [^117JAgZU].

> For first-line pharmacotherapy in mild disease, I will now examine topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity as the standard of care. Dual-action agents such as olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, bepotastine, and azelastine provide rapid itch relief and prophylaxis against the late-phase response, and I should confirm that these are safe and effective in short-term trials, noting that once-daily olopatadine 0.77% offers 24-hour control in challenge models, which can improve adherence [^1154NSKo] [^117YCyuQ] [^115XUFL2] [^111YWj7q].

> Wait, let me verify onset and duration claims. Bepotastine shows clinically meaningful reductions in itching within 15 minutes with an 8-hour duration in CAC studies, and cetirizine ophthalmic 0.24% demonstrates a 15-minute onset with 8-hour duration, which aligns with real-world needs for rapid relief, though I should remember that CAC models are controlled and may not fully reflect natural exposure variability [^1177EYTq] [^114yLcWL] [^112avBPu].

> For patients with frequent recurrences or persistent symptoms, I should consider mast cell stabilizers such as cromolyn or nedocromil, recognizing they require a loading period and are best used proactively. I need to ensure patients understand the delayed onset so they do not stop prematurely, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse their use in recurrent disease alongside or instead of dual-action agents [^117YCyuQ] [^1172DvFC].

> If symptoms are not controlled with first-line therapy, I should double-check whether a short, carefully monitored course of topical corticosteroid is indicated. Loteprednol or fluorometholone for 1 to 2 weeks can suppress inflammation while minimizing steroid-related risks, but I must screen for contraindications such as active herpetic keratitis and plan IOP checks if treatment extends beyond a week or is repeated, as per preferred practice patterns [^1177Mb4o] [^116ccxXX] [^116HaZ8M].

> But wait, what if steroid exposure needs to be minimized or the disease is steroid dependent? In that case, I should review calcineurin inhibitors such as topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus, which are guideline-supported for severe vernal or atopic disease and can reduce steroid burden, and I should confirm that meta-analytic data support cyclosporine's efficacy and that tacrolimus is a reasonable alternative when cyclosporine is unavailable or poorly tolerated [^115V8ctM] [^116XvM4c] [^1129mRzK] [^117JAgZU].

> I need to check emerging steroid-sparing options. The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert provides sustained local steroid delivery for about 30 days with favorable safety in phase 3 CAC trials and may be preferred by some patients over drops, though I should acknowledge that real-world comparative data are still maturing and that IOP monitoring remains prudent even with sustained-release steroids [^112TpYBE] [^113A7zsK] [^115mBKDb].

> Let me consider systemic and biologic therapies for refractory disease. Allergen immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and is particularly impactful in children, so I should confirm sensitizations and discuss SCIT or SLIT when topical therapy fails or as disease-modifying therapy, while remembering that SLIT tablets are FDA approved for select allergens and that shared decision-making is essential [^113QTJnB] [^115D33mv] [^112ARc8H] [^112jkK3C].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of novel biologics. Lirentelimab, an anti–siglec-8 antibody, showed substantial improvements in severe chronic allergic conjunctivitis in an open-label phase 1b study, suggesting a promising steroid-sparing path, but I need to emphasize that this remains investigational and not standard of care pending larger trials [^113deVtK].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic measures because they meaningfully augment pharmacotherapy. Cold compresses, refrigerated preservative-free artificial tears, strict avoidance of eye rubbing, and environmental controls such as hypoallergenic bedding, frequent laundering, and evening showers reduce allergen load and symptoms, and I need to ensure I tailor these to the patient's exposures and habits [^1112uF8z] [^115N4ftS] [^112eXWpp].

> I will now examine special populations and comorbidities. In children, immunotherapy is more effective and should be prioritized when appropriate, and for patients with atopic dermatitis on dupilumab, conjunctivitis incidence is higher, so I should coordinate with dermatology, consider baseline eye care, lubrication, and escalate to ophthalmic steroids or calcineurin inhibitors if needed, while monitoring for HSV risk with topical immunomodulators [^115D33mv] [^117MSeZ4] [^114bu1QN] [^1154By8B].

> Let me think about monitoring and safety. If topical corticosteroids are used, I should confirm baseline and periodic IOP checks and dilated exams to screen for glaucoma and cataract, counsel on risks with repeated short courses, and document informed consent, aligning with preferred practice patterns and patient education benchmarks [^116HaZ8M] [^112eXWpp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought topical NSAIDs were a routine option for allergic conjunctivitis, but I should double-check their role. While NSAIDs can reduce inflammation, they are not first-line for allergic disease and are more commonly reserved for postoperative inflammation or specific scenarios, so I should correct that assumption and prioritize antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers, steroids for flares, and calcineurin inhibitors for steroid-sparing in severe disease [^115mqPVn] [^1154NSKo] [^116XvM4c].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up is aligned with severity and treatment. Patients on steroids or calcineurin inhibitors should have close ophthalmic follow-up, and for all patients I should reassess control, adherence, and ocular surface health, adjusting therapy and considering immunotherapy referral when control remains suboptimal or disease is chronic and burdensome [^116HaZ8M] [^111Vnyf4].

The cornerstone of allergic conjunctivitis management is **topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity** (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, epinastine, bepotastine) for rapid itch relief and prevention of late-phase inflammation [^1154NSKo] [^117YCyuQ]. For mild symptoms, **OTC antihistamine/vasoconstrictor combinations** or second-generation H1 antagonists are appropriate; for moderate disease, use dual-action drops; and for severe or chronic cases, add short-course topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) [^116ccxXX] [^115V8ctM]. Nonpharmacologic measures include cold compresses, preservative-free artificial tears, allergen avoidance, and **allergen immunotherapy** for persistent symptoms or coexisting allergic disease [^1112uF8z] [^113QTJnB]. Monitor for steroid-related adverse effects and taper to the lowest effective dose, and refer to ophthalmology for refractory disease or corneal involvement [^116HaZ8M].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are foundational and should be initiated in all patients to reduce allergen exposure and symptom burden [^115N4ftS].

- **Allergen avoidance**: Identify and minimize exposure to triggers (pollen, dust mites, pet dander) [^115M9FTR]; use hypoallergenic bedding, frequent laundering, and evening showers [^112eXWpp].

- **Environmental modifications**: Use air purifiers, keep windows closed during high pollen seasons, and use sunglasses outdoors to reduce allergen contact [^115N4ftS].

- **Cold compresses and lubrication**: Apply cold compresses and use preservative-free artificial tears to alleviate irritation and reduce allergen load on the ocular surface [^1112uF8z].

- **Eyelid hygiene**: Regular eyelid cleansing to remove allergens and reduce inflammation [^112eXWpp].

---

## Pharmacologic management

Pharmacologic therapy is tailored to symptom severity, chronicity, and patient preference [^notfound].

---

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers

First-line therapy consists of **topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity**, which provide rapid relief and prevent late-phase inflammation [^1154NSKo].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dual-action antihistamines | - Olopatadine <br/> - Ketotifen <br/> - Alcaftadine <br/> - Epinastine <br/> - Bepotastine | - H1 antagonism <br/> - Mast cell stabilization | - Rapid onset <br/> - Once-daily dosing <br/> - Minimal adverse effects [^111YWj7q] |
| Mast cell stabilizers | - Cromolyn sodium <br/> - Nedocromil | Prevent mast cell degranulation | Useful for prophylaxis; slower onset [^1172DvFC] |

---

### Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are indicated for **moderate-to-severe disease** or acute exacerbations unresponsive to first-line therapy [^1177Mb4o]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration (typically 1–2 weeks) with close monitoring for **intraocular pressure elevation, cataract formation, and secondary infections** [^116HaZ8M].

---

### Calcineurin inhibitors

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) are steroid-sparing options for **chronic or severe disease**, particularly vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis [^115V8ctM]. They reduce inflammation with fewer steroid-related adverse effects but may cause transient burning or stinging [^1129mRzK].

---

### Systemic antihistamines

Oral antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine) are useful for **coexisting allergic rhinitis** but may cause dry eye and should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting dry eye disease [^1177Mb4o].

---

## Advanced therapies

For refractory or chronic allergic conjunctivitis, **advanced therapies** may be considered:

- **Allergen immunotherapy**: Subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy is effective in reducing symptoms and medication use, particularly in pediatric patients or those with persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy [^113QTJnB] [^112ARc8H].

- **Biologic agents**: Emerging biologics targeting eosinophils and mast cells (e.g. lirentelimab) show promise in severe, chronic forms but remain investigational [^113deVtK].

- **Intracanalicular dexamethasone insert**: A sustained-release dexamethasone insert (DEXTENZA) provides steroid delivery for up to 30 days, reducing the need for frequent dosing and improving adherence [^112R1Y3c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Immunotherapy is particularly effective in children, and topical antihistamines are safe and effective in pediatric populations [^113QTJnB].

- **Contact lens wearers**: Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) requires lens hygiene optimization, temporary lens discontinuation, and topical antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers [^117YHkXb].

- **Dry eye comorbidity**: Preservative-free artificial tears and cautious use of systemic antihistamines are recommended [^1177Mb4o].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment efficacy, monitor for adverse effects — particularly with corticosteroids — and adjust therapy as needed. Patients should be educated about **medication adherence, allergen avoidance, and recognition of worsening symptoms** requiring urgent care [^112eXWpp].

---

Allergic conjunctivitis management is **stepwise**, beginning with allergen avoidance and lubrication, then escalating to topical antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers, short-course corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors for severe disease, with immunotherapy for persistent cases. Careful monitoring and patient education are critical to optimal outcomes.

### Efficacy of medical treatments for vernal keratoconjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JAgZU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a severe type of allergic conjunctivitis for which treatment strategies are still under debate.

Objectives

This study sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of medical treatments for VKC.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases were searched to assess the efficacy of treatments for VKC. Random-effect meta-analyses on changes in clinical scores of symptoms and signs between baseline and after treatment, stratified on treatment classes, were computed. Meta-regressions were searched for potential influencing parameters.

Results

Included were 45 studies (27 randomized controlled trials and 18 prospective cohort studies), 1749 patients (78% were men; mean age, 11.2 years), and 12 different treatment classes. Mast cell stabilizers (MCSs; usually considered as first-line therapy), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus were the most studied drugs (in three-quarters of studies). Overall, all clinical scores improved. Total symptom and sign score decreased for MCSs (effect size, -3.19; 95% CI, -4.26 to -2.13), cyclosporine (effect size, -2.06; 95% CI, -2.72 to -1.40), and tacrolimus (effect size, -2.39; 95% CI, -3.36 to -1.43). No significant differences were shown depending on treatment classes, concentration, age, sex, baseline activity scores, and atopy. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar results.

Conclusions

This study confirms the efficacy of MCSs in the treatment of VKC. Efficacy of cyclosporine and tacrolimus did not differ, suggesting that tacrolimus is a good alternative to cyclosporine for severe cases of VKC. Further studies are needed to compare other drugs and their precise place in treatment strategy.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^112CU2ER]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

All randomized patients who received study medication or had potential exposure were included in the safety population. The intent-to-treat population included all randomized patients who received at least one administration of study drug. Pair-wise treatment comparisons at each postchallenge time point were based on the mean derived from a statistical model for repeated measures. The model included fixed-effect terms for investigator, treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction. A separate model was used for each CAC (at visits 3B, 4B, and 5). Superiority of olopatadine 0.77% compared with vehicle was demonstrated if at least two of the three post-CAC time points were in favor of olopatadine 0.77% at the 5% level of significance (two-sided) for the onset-of-action and 16-hour duration-of-action primary comparisons on ocular itching.

### Allergic conjunctivitis [^117Q72Zb]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is common, especially during the allergy season. Consultation with the allergist to perform skin tests or in vitro tests may be useful and confirmatory in the diagnosis of ocular allergy. If treatment is necessary, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are safe and reasonably effective. Corticosteroids are an order of magnitude more potent than noncorticosteroids; however, they have attendant side effects that are best monitored by the ophthalmologist. The development of "modified" corticosteroids has been a boon to the treatment of ocular allergy because these drugs may reduce potential side effects without sacrificing potency.

Challenges of Acute Infectious Conjunctivitis Management and Diagnosis

Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (~80%) for infectious conjunctivitis, despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be < 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, current resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols. In addition to the risk of antibiotic resistance, misdiagnosis can result in recurrent cases of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly among pediatric patients, or in cases that progress to serious ocular and extra-ocular complications.

There are several challenges to accurately diagnosing acute infectious conjunctivitis. First, clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms, such as type of discharge, is difficult and not supported by evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Routine bacteriologic examinations are neither typically performed nor practical in the management of clinically suspected acute bacterial conjunctivitis, except in neonates. Culturing should also be considered for immunocompromised patients or for patients with hyperacute cases of infectious conjunctivitis. The misdiagnosis of infectious conjunctivitis is compounded by the view that all cases should be treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics, even though most are self-limiting. Social factors, such as school policies or pressure to reduce absence from work, may also influence general practitioners to prescribe topical antibiotics. Lastly, the level at which patients enter the health care system can impact the accuracy of the diagnosis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1177Mb4o]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis — if symptoms are not adequately controlled, a brief course (1 to 2 weeks) of topical corticosteroids with a low side effect profile can be added to the regimen. Oral antihistamines are commonly used but may induce or worsen dry eye syndrome and impair the tear film's protective barrier. Concomitant use of cooled preservative-free artificial tears may alleviate coexisting tear deficiency and dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators on the ocular surface. In severe cases, topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus can be considered.

---

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112avBPu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The dexamethasone insert is a preservative-free steroid treatment. Exposure to preservatives in topical ocular therapies may be associated with a compromised ocular surface due to dry eye disease and inflammatory irritation. The most common ophthalmic antimicrobial preservative utilized is benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which is associated with discomfort and pain following instillation as well as ocular surface toxicity, conjunctival hyperemia, decreased tear production, tear film instability, and superficial punctate keratitis. There are currently no other commercially available preservative-free ophthalmic steroid therapy options for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Untreated allergic conjunctivitis can result in ocular complications, underscoring the need for safe, effective treatments for allergic conjunctivitis. Eye rubbing due to ocular itching is associated with corneal ectasia, including keratoconus, which can lead to acute corneal hydrops, corneal perforation, corneal scarring, and vision loss. Potential complications associated with untreated allergic conjunctivitis are detrimental to quality of life, especially for individuals who have concomitant dry eye disease. Concomitant dry eye disease is common in individuals with allergic conjunctivitis, and future studies in this population are needed. The 2 conditions interact with each other, and the symptoms of dry eye disease may exacerbate the itching, redness, and chemosis experienced during allergen challenge in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis.

The population in this study exhibited a moderate to severe ocular reaction across various concentrations of allergens and types of allergens, evaluating subjects with both seasonal and perennial allergens. The wide variety of allergens used in the study support the use of the dexamethasone insert as a possible treatment for all allergen-induced allergic conjunctivitis and further support the insert's mechanism of action.

Although there are several advantages to using the CAC model, the controlled allergen exposure in the model reduces variability and does not replicate the real-world environmental conditions in which an allergen would be encountered by patients and therefore is a potential limitation of this study. Another limitation is the comparator selected for the control arm. The use of placebo vehicle inserts aligns with regulatory requirements for clinical trial design, but additional studies should be performed using an active control, such as topical corticosteroids, to compare efficacy and safety with a currently available treatment option. Furthermore, allergic conjunctivitis can burden patients by adversely impacting sleep, activities of daily living and work productivity. Future study designs might consider including patient-reported outcome questionnaires to assess potential treatment effects on quality of life.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^114xyAho]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEX) for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis (AC).

Patients and Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, adults (≥ 18 years) with AC were randomized 1:1 to DEX or placebo insert (PBO) placed bilaterally. Subjects underwent repetitive conjunctival allergen challenges (CAC) across 30 days and were assessed for changes in AC signs and symptoms. The primary endpoint was ocular itching score at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC at Day 8 (7 days post-insertion). This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04050865).

Results

Ninety-six subjects were randomized (n = 48 DEX, n = 48 PBO). Compared to PBO, there were statistically significant treatment differences favoring DEX for the primary endpoint of mean ocular itching score at Day 8 (−0.86, −0.98, −0.96 at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). Treatment differences favored DEX for all 24 time points across 6 visits and were statistically significant (P < 0.05) except for the first post-insertion (Day 7, 3 minutes). For the 18 time points at which conjunctival redness was assessed, DEX had lower scores than PBO (P < 0.05 for all). The most common ocular adverse events (AEs) in DEX subjects were eye discharge and irritation. No serious AEs, elevated intraocular pressure, dacryocanaliculitis, or use of rescue medications were reported.

Conclusion

Results of this study support the potential use of dexamethasone insert as a physician-administered, preservative-free treatment for AC, with significant improvements in ocular itching and conjunctival redness compared with placebo. The dexamethasone insert was generally safe with a favorable safety profile.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^116W8CtG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin ‐4 and‐13. It is approved in the U.S. A. for patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severeuncontrolled by topical prescription medicines or who cannot use topical medicines, for patients in Japan whoseis uncontrolled with existing therapies, for patients with moderate‐to‐severein Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy and for patients aged ≥ 12 years for maintenance treatment of moderate‐to‐severe asthma uncontrolled with their current medicines.trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs. placebo.

Objectives

To characterize further the occurrence and risk factors of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials.

Methods

We evaluated randomized placebo‐controlled trials of dupilumab in(n = 2629), asthma (n = 2876), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (w) (n = 60) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) (n = 47).

Results

In mosttrials, dupilumab‐treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than placebo controls. Higher baselineseverity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence. Conjunctivitis was mostly mild to moderate. Most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period; two patients permanently discontinued dupilumab due to conjunctivitis or keratitis. Common treatments included ophthalmic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators. In asthma andwtrials, the incidence of conjunctivitis was lower for both dupilumab and placebo than intrials; dupilumab did not increase the incidence compared with placebo. In the EoE trial, no patients had conjunctivitis.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab treatment in mosttrials. In dupilumab trials in other type 2 diseases, incidence of conjunctivitis was overall very low, and was similar for dupilumab and placebo. In, the incidence of conjunctivitis was associated withseverity and prior history of conjunctivitis. The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients require further study.

What's already known about this topic?

Ocular disorders, including allergic conjunctivitis, are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).
In most dupilumab AD trials, dupilumab‐treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than those receiving placebo.
Most cases were mild to moderate and recovered or were recovering during study treatment; study treatment discontinuation due to conjunctivitis was rare.
Conjunctivitis incidence was very low and similar for dupilumab and placebo in clinical trials in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitis.

What does this study add?

This analysis confirms and extends the results of the individual clinical trials.
Baseline disease‐related factors, including AD severity, prior conjunctivitis history and certain biomarkers (thymus and activation‐regulated chemokine, IgE, eosinophils), were associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis.
Patients who responded well to dupilumab had reduced incidence of conjunctivitis.
Further study is needed to elucidate the aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients with AD.

### The phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of reproxalap in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^111BPdah]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, given the significant incidence of allergic conjunctivitis, new mechanisms of action for treatment have not been introduced in decades. Although topical antihistamines are considered standard of care for allergic conjunctivitis, the most common reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database for topical antihistamine monotherapy (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, epinastine, and bepotastine) are "treatment failure" (45%) and "drug ineffective" (17%), which may partially explain why polypharmacy is common in allergic conjunctivitis. Histamine is rapidly metabolized and likely peaks soon after allergen exposure, thereby limiting the duration of activity of antihistamines. Furthermore, many non-histaminic mediators likely contribute to the clinical presentation of ocular allergy. Because of toxicity concerns, corticosteroids can only be safely used on a short-term basis. Therefore, novel treatments are needed. The data reported herein suggest that use of the novel RASP modulator reproxalap may be an effective treatment for the symptoms and signs of allergic conjunctivitis. By extension, based on the activity reported herein, RASP modulation may represent a potential therapeutic approach for other allergic diseases.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117YHkXb]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis prevention — protective measures and immunotherapy note that individuals can protect against some chemical and toxin exposures by using adequate eye protection, contact lens wearers can be instructed in appropriate lens care and frequent lens replacement to reduce the risk or severity of giant papillary conjunctivitis, allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis and is more so in children than adults, both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy have been found to reduce symptoms and medication requirements in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and a multidisciplinary approach with pediatricians, internists, and allergists is essential in managing ocular hypersensitivity disorders.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Dupilumab — conjunctivitis risk and management: Conjunctivitis can be an adverse effect of dupilumab, and prior history of conjunctivitis and more severe AD before start of dupilumab may be risk factors for conjunctivitis with dupilumab treatment. Some protocols suggest a baseline eye examination by an ophthalmologist and the use of lubricant eye drops (artificial tears) twice daily when dupilumab is initiated, but practice varies, and mild conjunctivitis may respond to warm compresses, lubricant eye drops, and if there is concomitant allergen exposure, antihistamine eye drops. Patients with symptoms of severe ocular disease, such as blurred vision, decrease in visual acuity, purulent eye discharge, photophobia, or eye pain, should be urgently or emergently evaluated by ophthalmology. Treatment with ophthalmic topical corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, lifitegrast) eye drops may be needed to treat the conjunctivitis and prevent its potential complications, and treatment of any eczema around the eyes with topical cortisone ointment or pimecrolimus cream may help with reducing ocular itching and rubbing.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1154By8B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic conjunctivitis management — Conservative strategies to reduce allergen exposure and improve hygiene and lubrication are combined with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers; next-line therapies for moderate disease include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus targeted at T-cell activity. Tacrolimus is available as a 0.03% and 0.1% topical ointment for dermatologic use in the United States and has been used off label for ophthalmic disease. In patients 2 years old or older, eyelid involvement can be treated with pimecrolimus cream 1% or topical tacrolimus; tacrolimus drops/ointment 0.03% is used for children 2 to 15 years, and either 0.03% or 0.1% is used for patients 16 years and older. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.1% applied conjunctivally in patients who failed therapy with topical corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and/or antiallergy medications. These agents may make patients more susceptible to herpes simplex keratitis. Systemic therapies are rarely warranted; options include montelukast, aspirin, and oral T‑cell inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, but "the efficacy of these systemic treatments are inconclusive as there are no randomized trials" (Insufficient, Discretionary). Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus are rarely associated with development of skin cancer or lymphoma. For all allergic conjunctivitis, which may require repeat short‑term topical corticosteroids, patients should be informed about potential complications of corticosteroid therapy, and general strategies to minimize corticosteroid use should be employed.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^112Esdik]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy — algorithm-based evaluation begins when a patient presents with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma or insect allergy; proceed only with evidence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and test results that correlate with clinical symptoms and exposure, otherwise the patient is not a candidate for immunotherapy. With positive evidence, assess risks, benefits and costs of appropriate management options — immunotherapy, allergen exposure reduction, medications, patient preferences, response to prior treatment, and severity of disease — and decide whether immunotherapy is recommended for this patient; if not, immunotherapy not given. If recommended, obtain informed consent, counsel and educate the patient about the benefits and risks of immunotherapy including anticipated duration and onset of efficacy, then identify specific allergenic extracts, the starting dose and immunotherapy schedule, and the maintenance dose.

### Oral immunotherapy for allergic conjunctivitis [^116DfSSE]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Antigen-specific immunotherapy is expected to be a desirable treatment for allergic diseases. Currently, antigen-specific immunotherapy is performed by administering disease-causing antigens subcutaneously or sublingually. These approaches induce long-term remission in patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma. The oral route is an alternative to subcutaneous and sublingual routes, and can also induce long-term remission, a phenomenon known as "oral tolerance". The effectiveness of oral tolerance has been reported in the context of autoimmune diseases, food allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis in both human patients and animal models. However, few studies have examined its efficacy in animal models of allergic conjunctivitis. Previously, we showed that ovalbumin feeding suppressed ovalbumin-induced experimental allergic conjunctivitis, indicating the induction of oral tolerance is effective in treating experimental allergic conjunctivitis. In recent years, transgenic rice has been developed that can induce oral tolerance and reduce the severity of anaphylaxis. The major Japanese cedar pollen antigens in transgenic rice, Cryptomeria japonica 1 and C. japonica 2, were deconstructed by molecular shuffling, fragmentation, and changes in the oligomeric structure. Thus, transgenic rice may be an effective treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Practical management of ocular surface disease in patients with atopic dermatitis, with a focus on conjunctivitis: a review [^1177aF6U]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can significantly decrease quality of life. AD is commonly associated with comorbidities including ocular surface disease (OSD). Conjunctivitis is the most common OSD associated with AD and can increase in incidence with use of monoclonal antibody biologics that target the type 2 inflammatory pathway. The objective of this review is to raise awareness of comorbid OSD in AD patients that dermatologists may encounter, with a focus on conjunctivitis, and equip dermatologists to address mild ocular concerns. We provide background on the subtypes and pathogenesis of comorbid OSD in AD patients and describe OSD associated with type 2 inflammation-inhibiting AD biologics. We also discuss screening and diagnosis, recommended treatment options for dermatologists, and when to refer to an eye care specialist. This multispecialty approach aims to support the overall health of AD patients and provide optimal patient care.

### Use of topical steroids in conjunctivitis: a review of the evidence [^117JkdqQ]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the conjunctiva, is a common condition that can be caused by infectious (eg, bacterial or viral infections) and noninfectious (eg, allergy) etiologies. Treatment involves diagnosis of the underlying cause and use of appropriate therapies. A broad-spectrum therapy that can address multiple etiologies, and also the accompanying inflammation, would be very useful. In this review, we discuss the usefulness of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids and ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with anti-infectives/antibiotics for treating acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Methods

A review of the published literature and relevant treatment guidelines.

Results

Topical corticosteroids are useful in treating ocular inflammation, but most treatment guidelines recommend steroid use generally in severe cases of conjunctivitis. This is partly due to risks associated with steroid use. These risks include potential for prolonging adenoviral infections and potentiating/worsening herpes simplex virus infections, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts. Most of these perceived risks are not, however, supported by high-quality clinical data. They are also associated with long-term steroid uses that are dissimilar to applications for infectious conjunctivitis. Clinical data show that ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with broad-spectrum anti-infectives could be effective and well tolerated when used for short-term treatment (≤ 2 weeks).

Conclusions

Corticosteroids, in combination with anti-infectives, could be a promising treatment option for acute conjunctivitis subject to development of further evidence on their effectiveness and safety in conjunctivitis treatment.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conjunctivitis is a common problem.

Objective

To examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis and use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

Evidence Review

A search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Eligible articles were selected after review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Findings

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help; itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The majority of cases in bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and no treatment is necessary in uncomplicated cases. However, conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers should be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive. Treatment with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers alleviates the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113eJ6MH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

### Ophthalmic drugs for patients with allergic conjunctivitis… [^1172DvFC]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

New ophthalmic formulations of ketotifen fumarate, pemirolast potassium and nedocromil sodium have recently received labeling approval from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults and children with itchy eyes resulting from allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast and nedocromil are mast-cell stabilizers; ketotifen, in addition to this property, also has H. 1-receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Like ketotifen, olopatadine is a mast-cell stabilizer and a selective H 1-receptor antagonist and has been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with allergic conjunctivitis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Neither ketotifen, pemirolast or nedocromil result in significant absorption or accumulation of drug.

Results of one four-week clinical trial revealed that ketotifen 0. 05 percent was as effective as cromolyn 2 percent in decreasing the signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence from another clinical trial revealed that pemirolast 0. 1 percent used four times daily was more effective than placebo in preventing signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence from another trial involving patients with allergic conjunctivitis who took pemirolast 0. 1 percent for four months revealed that pemirolast was more effective than placebo after six to eight weeks of treatment. Results from several double-blind studies showed that nedocromil 2 percent was more effective than placebo in the treatment of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

As with other mast-cell stabilizers, response to treatment with pemirolast or nedocromil may require weeks of treatment, although some patients detect a reduction of symptoms in a few days. The consultants conclude that ketotifen, pemirolast and nedocromil appear to be effective in the treatment of itching caused by allergic conjunctivitis. Whether these drugs are more effective than the existing drugs in their class has not been determined.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^115XXExF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Frequently associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy, resulting in a condition better known as "allergic rhinoconjunctivitis". Itchy eyes and nasal congestion are the main symptoms, often accompanied by irritability and fatigue. Despite the efficacy of the current available products to treat allergic conjunctivitis, patients experiencing incomplete symptom relief are likely to benefit from using a product that provides symptom relief over the course of an entire day with the convenience of once-daily dosing.

Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when allergens such as grass or ragweed pollen, dust mites, and animal dander cause an immune reaction in the eye mediated by IgE. A cascade of events leads to mast-cell degranulation and release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators at the site of allergen invasion. The inflammatory reaction results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocyte chemotaxis, and emigration of inflammatory cells into the surrounding tissue spaces, thus causing ocular inflammation, ocular itching, redness, tearing, swelling of the conjunctiva (chemosis), and eyelid swelling. Ocular symptoms in particular – itchy eyes, puffers, and watering – can have a significant impact on patients' daily activities, leading to poorer quality of life and increased resource utilization, irrespective of the severity of nasal symptoms.

The prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis is difficult to ascertain; however, 30% of the US population report nasal and ocular symptoms for at least 1 week of the year, and approximately 70%–80% of seasonal allergic patients have severe ocular symptoms. An estimated 14% of the US population are thought to suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and 15%–20% of the Japanese population are thought to suffer from allergic conjunctival diseases.

Available treatment options for the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Among antihistaminic drugs, olopatadine is a selective antagonist of histamine H 1 receptors, causing mast-cell stabilization and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production. Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol ® and Pataday ®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) are effective for the management of allergic conjunctivitis, including reducing ocular itching.–

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113xz4Ea]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale and discussion

The 2014–2015 needs assessment report by the NHLBAC Asthma Expert Working Groupincluded both aqueous and tablet formulations in the research questions on the efficacy and safety of SLIT. For these questions, the systematic review report combined studies of the two types of SLIT, thereby increasing the sample sizes and precision of results for many of the outcomes evaluated. However, the designs and methodologies of RCTs that used aqueous and drop preparations of SLIT were not as rigorous or standardized as they were for studies that used tablet formulations. In evaluating the data on aqueous or drop and tablet formulations combined, the Expert Panel did not find that SLIT reduced asthma symptoms or improved asthma control or asthma quality of life. Although systemic side effects were common (80% of participants), they were also common in the placebo groups. In addition, the limited number of FDA-approved antigens, the costs of SLIT, and the variability in access to this treatment promote health inequities.

Overall summary for SCIT and SLIT

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends SCIT as an adjunct treatment to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals aged 5 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who show clear evidence of a relationship between symptoms and exposure to an allergen to which the individual is sensitive. The Expert Panel conditionally recommends against the use of SLIT as a treatment specifically for asthma.

The Expert Panel's immunotherapy recommendations call for shared decision making between the clinician and the individual with asthma. The recommendations also highlight SLIT's potential to reduce the symptoms of comorbid conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, and this potential improvement may be an important consideration for individuals with allergic asthma.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel identified the following opportunities for additional research:
Investigate the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy in individuals with severe asthma, particularly those whose asthma is under control but who want to reduce their medication burden
Include only children aged 5 to 11 years in studies of children, or, if a study includes a broader age group, report findings separately for children aged 5 to 11 years and those aged 12 years and older
Study more diverse populations to determine whether race or ethnicity influences the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy
Study the efficacy and safety of multiple-allergen SCIT or SLIT regimens to assess compliance, adherence, and the effect of these factors on asthma management
Standardize methods to report SCIT and SLIT doses used in studies and use validated outcome measurement instruments, such as asthma symptoms and adverse events

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^116zdcr8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting up to 60 million Americans annually. The hallmarks of AC include a combination of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia (redness), which are often accompanied by chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing, as well as rhinorrhea and other nasal symptoms.–The most common instigators of this allergic condition are either seasonal pollens or perennial allergens, including, but not limited to, dust mites, molds, or animal dander. Allergic responses generally occur in two phases. The early or immediate (acute) phase occurs within minutes of allergen exposure, and results from antigen-evoked mast cell degranulation and subsequent histamine release. This is followed by a late or delayed (chronic) phase, hours or days after exposure, that is manifested by proinflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells including eosinophils and neutrophils.

### Conjunctival allergen provocation test: guidelines for daily practice [^113FaDvv]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Conjunctival allergen provocation test (CAPT) reproduces the events occurring by instilling an allergen on the ocular surface. This paper is the compilation of a task force focussed on practical aspects of this technique based on the analysis of 131 papers. Main mechanisms involved are reviewed. Indications are diagnosing the allergen(s)-triggering symptoms in IgE-mediated ocular allergy in seasonal, acute or perennial forms of allergic conjunctivitis, especially when the relevance of the allergen is not obvious or in polysensitized patients. Contraindications are limited to ongoing systemic severe pathology, asthma and eye diseases. CAPT should be delayed if receiving systemic steroids or antihistamines. Local treatment should be interrupted according to the half-life of each drug. Prerequisites are as follows: obtaining informed consent; evidencing of an allergen by skin prick tests and/or serum-specific IgE dosages; being able to deal with an unlikely event such as acute asthma exacerbation, urticaria or anaphylaxis, or an exacerbation of allergic conjunctivitis. Allergen extracts should be diluted locally prior to administration. Positive criteria are based on itching or quoted according to a composite score. An alternative scoring is based on itching. CAPT remains underused in daily practice, although it is a safe and simple procedure which can provide valuable clinical information.

### The phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of reproxalap in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^115Qei3u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite an increasing prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis that includes more than 20% of the US population, drugs to treat allergic conjunctivitis with novel mechanisms of action have not been introduced in decades. Furthermore, although most patients with allergic conjunctivitis are treated at least initially with topical antihistamines, the need for adjunctive therapy is common. For example, in one study, up to 60% of patients required non-antihistaminic medication, which often includes topical corticosteroids, a class of drugs associated with potentially serious ocular toxicity including elevation of intraocular pressure and development of glaucoma.

Topical conjunctival allergen challenge has typically been used in development of allergic conjunctivitis drugs. However, the clinical relevance of applying concentrated allergen to the ocular surface can be questioned, and the assessment of duration of drug activity after challenge is often limited to less than 10 minutes, possibly due to waning drug effect resulting from rapidly declining histamine levels, which peak within 5 to 10 minutes of allergen exposure. Investigational allergic conjunctivitis drugs may also be tested in field trials, but exposure to pollen is variable, unpredictable, and depends heavily on weather and patient behaviors. Allergen chambers, on the other hand, represent a combination of direct conjunctival challenge and field trials, allowing for a controlled exposure to allergens in a simulated real-world setting. In a small, proof-of-concept clinical trial using an allergen chamber, reproxalap demonstrated preliminary activity in patient-reported symptoms and investigator-assessed ocular redness. Accordingly, the Phase 3 INVIGORATE Trial was performed to assess the activity of reproxalap in a real-world model of seasonal allergen exposure. Based on published clinical relevance thresholds for patient-reported ocular itching and redness, two different within-patient responder analysis methods were used to confirm the clinical relevance of the results.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^114B9aSW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctival allergen challenge — procedure and applications involve exposing the eyes to increasing concentrations of a specific allergen that previously elicited a positive skin test reaction until a reaction is induced on the ocular surface, with subjects evaluating ocular itching and trained clinicians evaluating redness; because the challenge reproduces signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, it can be used to test the duration and activity of pharmacologic therapies and may be useful in predicting the impact of preseasonal immunotherapy on symptoms.

### Diagnosis of allergy syndromes: do symptoms always mean allergy? [^113ZfNZr]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic disease has become a major burden in westernized societies because of a recent rise in its prevalence. Approximately one-third of children suffer from an allergic disease, with the prevalence varying from 15 to 20% for atopic dermatitis, 7 to 10% for asthma and 15 to 20% for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Despite the increase, it is important not to assume a diagnosis of allergy on the basis of symptoms alone, because allergic and nonallergic conditions may present with similar symptoms. An accurate allergy diagnosis is important in order to treat the patient most appropriately and to potentially prevent or delay the development of allergic disease. A good clinical history is the starting point for accurate allergy diagnosis but is not unequivocal. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology has recognized the importance of allergy testing and therefore developed evidence-based recommendations on allergy testing in children. Widespread adherence to these recommendations should improve the quality of care for allergy patients. Cooperation between all healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of allergy patients is also a key to improve our response to the allergy epidemic.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: a cross-sectional study [^111iVNSt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ocular allergy is a common disease in daily practice.

Objectives

A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate clinical aspects of and therapeutic approaches to ocular allergy in Italy.

Methods

Of the 3685 patients affected by ocular allergy and enrolled by 304 ophthalmologists nationally, 3545 were eligible to be included in the statistical analysis. A questionnaire was administered in office to record demographic data, comorbidities, trigger factors, number of conjunctivitis episodes, and past treatments. Signs and symptoms were graded according to their severity, frequency, and duration.

Results

Mean age of enrolled patients was 38 ± 19 years. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (55% of patients) was equally distributed among the different age groups, while perennial allergic conjunctivitis (18%) increased with age and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (9%) was more frequent under the age of 18. Itching and redness were reported in 90% and 85%, respectively; lid skin involvement was observed in 22% of cases and keratitis in 11%. Pollen sensitivities were indicated as the most frequent triggers; however, exposure to non-specific environmental conditions, pollutants, and cigarette smoke was frequently reported. Only 35% of patients underwent a diagnostic evaluation of specific allergic sensitization, with positive allergy tests found in 82% of this subset. With regard to treatment, topical decongestants were used in 43% of patients, corticosteroids in 41%, antihistamines in 29%, systemic antihistamines in 27%, and mast cell stabilizers in 15%.

Conclusion

This survey provided useful epidemiological information regarding the clinical characteristics and treatment options of a large cohort of patients affected by different forms of ocular allergy.

Clinical Relevance

An understanding of ocular allergic disease, its incidence, demographics, and treatment paradigms provides important information towards understanding its pharmacoeconomics and burden on the national health system.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^111YWj7q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two individual phase 3 conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) studies of similar design have assessed the efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride (HCl) 0.77% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety of olopatadine HCl 0.77% from a larger dataset by pooling data from the two individual CAC studies.

Methods

Data were pooled from two phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active- and vehicle-controlled CAC studies. The primary comparison was on ocular itching scores between olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle (at onset and 24 hours) and olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus olopatadine 0.2% (at 24 hours). Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and proportion of itching responders at onset and 24-hour duration of CAC. For both primary and secondary analysis, mixed model repeated measures analysis was used, except for proportion of ocular itching responders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using a two-sample t -test.

Results

This analysis included 448 patients. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to vehicle (P < 0.0001) at onset and 24-hour duration of action (difference in means: -1.14 to -1.52) and to olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.0009) at 24-hour duration of action in relieving ocular itch. Additionally, olopatadine HCl 0.77% substantially reduced conjunctival redness and total redness over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset and 24-hour duration of action. At 24 hours CAC, there were a higher proportion of itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0.77% compared to vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% (difference in proportion of responders: 43.17%, P < 0.0001, and 17.25%, P = 0.0012, respectively). No safety concerns were identified.

Conclusion

This analysis confirms the findings from the individual studies. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (for 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% supports once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112jkK3C]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

The evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed did not support the use of SLIT specifically for the treatment of allergic asthma. However, the FDA has approved SLIT tablets (but not aqueous preparations) for the treatment of allergic rhino conjunctivitis. Individuals with this condition who also have asthma might benefit from SLIT and, if so, this benefit is most likely to be in the form of a reduction in the use of quick-relief and/or long-term control medications.

On the basis of the currently available data, the Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for allergic asthma. SLIT is beneficial for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In an individual with comorbid allergic asthma, SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis might reduce the symptoms of allergic asthma as well (and this potential provides the rationale for making the recommendation conditional). For individuals whose allergic asthma symptoms benefit from SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions.

The clinician should administer the first dose of SLIT in the office, and the individual with asthma should wait in the office for at least 30 minutes after receiving the dose. If no problems develop, the individual may continue the SLIT dosing at home. Individuals receiving SLIT should ideally have an injectable epinephrine prescription and receive education on how to administer this medication.
Currently, only tablet SLIT formulations for short ragweed and dust mite mixture and for northern grass have FDA approval for treatment of allergic rhinitis with and without conjunctivitis. SLIT is not FDA approved specifically for asthma treatment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: The Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for the treatment of allergic asthma, but this treatment may benefit individuals with certain comorbid conditions, such as allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis. The FDA has approved the use of SLIT to treat allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis in response to only a few allergens at this time for individuals aged 5 years and older (for sensitization to northern grass) and in individuals aged 18 years and older (for sensitization to a short ragweed and dust mite mixture).

### The spectrum of allergic ocular diseases [^116YMQtk]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiologic mechanisms, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of the various manifestations of ocular allergy, with an especial focus on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was performed to include articles, using the search terms ocular allergy and allergic conjunctivitis.

Study Selections

Recent and relevant human studies in the English language pertaining to our topic of study were selected. Animal studies pertaining to pathophysiology of ocular allergy were also reviewed. We focused on clinical trials, practice guidelines, reviews, and systematic reviews. In addition, case reports were reviewed if they described rare clinical presentations, disease mechanisms, or novel therapies.

Results

Ocular allergy encompasses both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disease, and the clinical severity may range from mild to sight-threatening inflammation. A comprehensive treatment regimen including education, lifestyle measures, topical therapies, and even systemic interventions may be necessary for the effective management of ocular allergies, tailored according to symptom severity.

Conclusion

Ocular allergy is frequently encountered by allergists and eye-care specialists, and despite progressively increasing incidence, it often remains underdiagnosed and, hence, untreated.

### Allergen testing: a review of the indications, procedures, and limitations in ocular allergy [^114Mcp7V]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allergen-based diagnostics are essential in the management algorithm of allergic diseases. Unlike systemic allergy, where the indications and interpretation of these diagnostic modalities are well established, their utility in ocular allergy is not well-defined. With the rising prevalence of ocular allergies and the need for personalized treatment strategies, there is a growing demand for precision allergen diagnostics. This review describes the commonly used tests with their indications, procedures, and limitations. A review of the literature was carried out on articles on allergen diagnostics in ocular allergy, and after excluding articles that were not relevant, 82 papers were included in the current review. IgE-mediated pathways contribute significantly to seasonal and perennial ocular allergy and partly to vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Most diagnostic techniques aim to detect IgE sensitization. In vivo tests include skin prick (SPT), intradermal, and patch tests. SPT is considered the gold standard and directly evaluates the presence of allergen-specific IgE in the skin. In vitro tests measure total and specific IgE from either tears or sera. Tear IgE measurement is relatively specific for allergic conjunctivitis and can provide insight into the potential allergens responsible for local sensitization. The conjunctival provocation test can help establish true allergy, especially in patients with polysensitization. This review also provides an overview of evidence in literature segregated based on the test employed. This includes 17 studies on only SPT; 42 studies on IgE measured in serum, tears, or both; and 20 studies which have evaluated both SPT and IgE. The pattern of allergen sensitization can guide recommendations for avoidance measures and immunotherapy. Thus, this could create a corticosteroid-sparing therapy avenue in these patients, reducing disease severity and resulting visual morbidity.

### Clinical practice of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: an expert panel report [^114rmRjQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) reduces symptoms and medication use associated with allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and allergic asthma. Although several AIT guidelines exist, there remain unanswered questions about AIT that are relevant to everyday practice. Our objective was to prepare an evidence-based overview addressing the practical aspects of AIT in clinical practice based on published evidence and the experience of international experts in the field. Topics covered include interpretation and translation of clinical trial data into everyday clinical practice (eg, allergen doses and treatment duration), assessment of risk and treatment of local and systemic allergic reactions, recommendations for improvement of AIT guidelines, and identification of appropriate data for seeking regulatory approval, to name a few. Many informational gaps in AIT practice need further evaluation as products and practices evolve.

### Pharmacist compliance with therapeutic guidelines on diagnosis and treatment provision [^112gCnTG]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^115XUFL2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common allergic conjunctivitis, usually with acute manifestations when a person is exposed to allergens and with typical signs and symptoms including itching, redness, and tearing. The clinical signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines) inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonising the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers inhibit degranulation and consequently the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. Topical treatments include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of the previous treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment is based on topical antihistamines alone or topical mast cell stabilisers alone or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of topical treatment.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for use in treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 July 2014. We also searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trial reports for details of further relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, with placebo, no treatment or to any other antihistamine or mast cell stabiliser, or both, that examined people with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, or both. The primary outcome was any participant-reported evaluation (by questionnaire) of severity of four main ocular symptoms: itching, irritation, watering eye (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light), both separately and, if possible, by an overall symptom score. We considered any follow-up time between one week and one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among review authors and the involvement of a third review author. We followed standard methodological approaches used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.

### Time to onset and duration of action of the antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5% in allergic conjunctivitis: a phase III, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, conjunctival allergen challenge assessment in adults and children [^1177EYTq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Bepotastine besilate is a highly selective histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist with antihistaminic, mast cell stabilizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Based on a history of clinical effectiveness and tolerability of oral bepotastine besilate in the treatment of allergic symptoms, bepotastine besilate is being tested as a potential ophthalmic medication for allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0% and 1.5% for the treatment of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia in a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model in adults and children.

Methods

This Phase III, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, CAC clinical trial enrolled patients ≥ 10 years of age with a history of allergic conjunctivitis, skin-test reaction, and CAC response. Patients received bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, or placebo, 1 drop on each eye on days 14 ± 3 and 28 ± 3. The primary efficacy end points, patient-assessed ocular itching (at 3, 5, and 7 minutes) and investigator-assessed conjunctival hyperemia (at 7, 15, and 20 minutes), were determined after CAC according to standardized 5-point scales (0 = none to 4 = severe). Clinical significance was defined in the protocol as ≥ 1.0-U between-group difference in mean ocular itching scores at the majority of time points at a study visit and also a ≥ 0.5-U difference at all time points. Tolerability of the test agent was assessed by visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, dilated funduscopy, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 107 patients (male, 54%; age range, 11–73 years; white race/ethnicity, 93%) received investigational product and comprised the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, 36 patients; bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, 35; and placebo, 36). All 107 patients received investigational product at visit 3A (day 0) and were included in the ITT population. Of the 107 patients who were enrolled, 103 completed the study without a protocol deviation or violation. The 1.0% and 1.5% solutions were associated with clinically and statistically significant reductions in mean ocular itching scores compared with placebo on the 15-minute onset-of-action and 8-hour duration-of-action CAC tests (reductions, 1.3–1.5 U and 1.0–1.7 U respectively; all, P < 0.001). Statistically significant reductions in conjunctival hyperemia were achieved with both bepotastine besilate concentrations. Overall, 13 patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event considered related to the study drug (bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.0%, 6 patients; bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5%, 4; and placebo, 3).

Conclusions

In this CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis in adults and children, bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5% were associated with clinically and statistically significant reductions in ocular itching, but not conjunctival hyperemia, within 15 minutes that were maintained for at least 8 hours after administration. Both solutions were well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00424398.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115M9FTR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE-medicated and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the ocular surface, including the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Ocular allergies are usually categorized into acute or chronic allergic disorders based on their pathological mechanism and clinical expression of the allergic response on the ocular surface. The acute form includes seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC). Chronic forms are vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis.

Allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent form of ocular allergy. It is predominantly an IgE-mediated ocular allergy that occurs when airborne allergens induce allergic expression on the ocular surface.SAC is a seasonal variant of allergic conjunctivitis due to outdoor aeroallergens, whereas PAC is the perennial variant of allergic conjunctivitis due to indoor airborne allergens. Pollen is the major aeroallergen that is associated with SAC with increased incidence of SAC from tree pollen and grass pollen in the spring and summer months, respectively. Dust mites, pet dander, feathers, and mold are aeroallergens associated with PAC. Patients with allergic conjunctivitis may complain of ocular pruritus and redness following exposure to outdoor and indoor aeroallergens. Approximately 40% of individuals in the developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis. In the United States, allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy that constitutes over 90% of all ocular allergies. Allergic conjunctivitis affects the ocular surface impacting the quality of life of patients. It affects the school performance of symptomatic students and work productivity through lost workman days.

The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. The magnitude of the allergic expression is dependent on the allergen load, allergic mediators expressed by immune and nonimmune cells, and other physiological factors. Histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and proteases are produced by activated mast cells in allergen-induced conjunctival inflammation in SAC and PAC. This article reviews the chemical compound, including pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety, of alcaftadine. The pathological mechanism of ocular allergy, histamine, and histamine receptors will be briefly reviewed with the intent of providing a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine.

### Allergic and immunologic disorders of the eye. part II: ocular allergy [^1145ieU5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Allergy affects more than 15% of the world population, and some studies have shown that up 30% of the US population has some form of allergy. Most of these patients have various target organs for their allergies, and most have ocular involvement. The ocular component may be the most prominent and sometimes disabling feature of their allergy. Some are affected for only a few weeks to months, whereas others have symptoms that last throughout the year. The seasonal forms may present to clinical allergists, whereas the more chronic forms may present to ophthalmologists. Thus, in the second of this 2-part review series (Part I: Ocular Immunology appeared in the November issue of the Journal), an overview is provided of the spectrum of ocular allergy that ranges from acute seasonal allergic conjunctivitis to chronic variants of atopic keratoconjunctivitis. With a better understanding of the immunologic mechanisms, we now can develop better treatment approaches and design further research in intervention of allergic eye diseases.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^116XyFjM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis, olopatadine HCl 0.77% demonstrated superiority over vehicle (P < 0.0001) both at onset of action and after 24 hours and over olopatadine 0.2% at 24 hours in relieving ocular itch. The differences in means for ocular itching between olopatadine HCl 0.77% and vehicle were > 1 unit at all post-CAC time points. A 1-unit difference compared with vehicle is considered clinically relevant by the FDA.

Prior to the US approval of olopatadine HCl 0.77%, the available treatment options for the management of allergic conjunctivitis included dual-acting antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and nonpharmacological agents, such as cold compresses or eye lubricants. Olopatadine at a lower concentration of 0.1% (Patanol ®), given twice daily, and 0.2% (Pataday ®), given once daily, is effective in relieving symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis with a good safety profile.–The once-daily olopatadine 0.2%, the active comparator in this study, was found to be better than many other available antiallergic treatments in terms of its efficacy and tolerability. However, none of these medications provided relief over 24 hours from ocular itching; the coverage lasted only for 16 hours post-dosing. Therefore, there is a medical need for a treatment that is effective for at least 24 hours without necessitating a second dose, particularly in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe symptoms or those with incomplete relief from symptoms. Availability of a once-daily dosing regimen would help maintain efficacy through a full 24-hour period, improve treatment compliance, and reduce exposure to preservatives, which may lower the risk of developing dry eye symptoms in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

### Lirentelimab for severe and chronic forms of allergic conjunctivitis [^113deVtK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is an ocular inflammatory disease with symptoms driven by eosinophils and mast cells. Allergic comorbidities are common. Current treatments are often ineffective in severe AC and limited by potential side effects. Lirentelimab is an anti-sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-8 mAb that depletes eosinophils and inhibits mast cells.

Objective

We sought to determine safety and preliminary efficacy of lirentelimab in an open-label, phase 1b study.

Methods

Patients with chronic, severely symptomatic atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and perennial AC, and who had history of topical or systemic corticosteroid use, were enrolled to receive up to 6 monthly lirentelimab infusions (dose 1: 0.3 mg/kg, dose 2: 1 mg/kg, subsequent doses: 1 or 3 mg/kg). Changes from baseline in peripheral blood eosinophils, changes in patient-reported symptoms (measured by daily Allergic Conjunctivitis Symptom Questionnaire, including atopic comorbidities), changes in investigator-reported ocular signs and symptoms (Ocular Symptom Scores), changes in quality of life, and changes in tear cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed.

Results

Thirty patients were enrolled (atopic keratoconjunctivitis n = 13, vernal keratoconjunctivitis n = 1, perennial AC n = 16), 87% of whom had atopic comorbidities. After lirentelimab treatment, mean improvement was observed in Allergic Conjunctivitis Symptom Questionnaire score (-61%; 95% CI, -75% to -48%) and Ocular Symptom Scores (-53%; 95% CI, -76% to -31%), consistent across atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and perennial AC groups. There was substantial improvement in atopic comorbidities, with -55% (95% CI, -78% to -31%), -50% (95% CI, -82% to -19%), and -63% (95% CI, -87% and -38%) reduction in symptoms of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis, respectively. Levels of key mediators of inflammation were reduced in patient tears after lirentelimab treatment. The most common adverse effects were mild to moderate infusion-related reactions.

Conclusions

Lirentelimab was well tolerated, improved severe AC and concomitant atopic symptoms, and reduced inflammatory mediators in patient tears.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112dFymp]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115N4ftS]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis — management — Nonpharmacologic measures include that "Recommendations often include wearing sunglasses as a barrier to airborne allergens, cold compresses, refrigerated artificial tears, avoiding eye rubbing, and avoiding allergens", with additional measures such as "Hypoallergenic bedding, eyelid cleansers to remove allergens, frequent clothes washing, and bathing/showering before bedtime may also be helpful". Pharmacologic therapy notes that "Mild allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with an over-the-counter topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or with more effective second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists", many drops "can be stored in the refrigerator" for symptomatic relief, and chronic vasoconstrictor use "can be associated with rebound vasodilation once the agent is stopped". For recurrent or persistent disease, "mast-cell stabilizers can be used", and "Many new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties and can be used for either acute or chronic disease". Related comorbidity relief is described: "The use of topical mast-cell inhibitors can also be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis", including nasal spray or aerosols, while as a general precaution, "Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided because antibiotics can induce toxicity, and corticosteroids can potentially prolong adenoviral infections and worsen HSV infections".

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112R1Y3c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, and watering and can be triggered by both seasonal and perennial allergens. Its prevalence has been estimated at up to 40%. The condition negatively impacts quality of life and work productivity.

The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves immune responses mediated by histamine and mast cells. Treatment consists of antihistamines for immediate relief and mast-cell stabilizers for long-term control. Corticosteroids can be used for short periods to manage acute flares but safety issues such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation limit long-term use. Recently, Dextenza, a 0.4 mg dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA) has been approved for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis; it is also approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert is a rod-shaped depot of 0.4 mg preservative-free dexamethasone encapsulated within polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel that expands after contact with fluid to occlude the punctum and secure its placement. Fluorescein is conjugated to the hydrogel to enable visualization. The insert delivers a sustained and tapered dose of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days and resorbs completely.

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the dexamethasone insert relieved ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis more effectively than placebo when evaluated using a modified conjunctival allergen challenge model. To date, no real-world studies have evaluated the insert's effectiveness in managing signs and symptoms of clinical allergic conjunctivitis, nor have any studies included comparisons to other treatments for allergic eye disease. We have conducted a randomized trial comparing the dexamethasone insert to loteprednol — a topical corticosteroid — and to olopatadine — a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer — in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### The therapeutic effect of IPL on children with refractory seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^1147QQWJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To sum up, the results of our research indicate that IPL treatment is effective in ameliorating the ocular surface symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis in children, particularly in suppressing eye itching, with favorable outcomes. For children who respond poorly to anti-allergic drug treatment, IPL can be chosen as an adjunctive therapy.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^1125Tr5A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone insert when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis using a modified version of the CAC model. The primary efficacy endpoint of lower mean ocular itching scores at Day 8 was met. The dexamethasone insert group had a statistically significant treatment difference over the placebo group at the 1 week post-insertion series of challenges, demonstrating an early onset of action. Additionally, the dexamethasone insert group showed significant treatment differences compared to the placebo group at 23 of 24 time points evaluated, demonstrating duration of action for at least 2 weeks in this study. Together these findings support the use of the dexamethasone insert to reduce ocular itching quickly (within the first 7 days following insertion) and to maintain this benefit for at least 2 weeks after insertion. The dexamethasone insert also showed efficacy in reducing conjunctival redness, with significant improvements in conjunctival redness scores at all 18 post-CAC time points. The results of this study are consistent with previously reported phase 2 and phase 3 studies of the dexamethasone insert in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis using a similar repeat CAC model, despite differing slightly in study visit schedule.

In addition to showing a benefit in itching and redness, which are 2 of the most common patient complaints related to allergic conjunctivitis, the dexamethasone insert showed a directional benefit in eyelid swelling, tearing/watery eyes, and nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and nasal congestion). Nasal congestion may be the primary complaint in individuals with rhinoconjunctivitis, followed by ocular symptoms.

The dexamethasone insert was generally safe and well tolerated with no serious or severe ocular or non-ocular AEs observed. In the dexamethasone insert arm, 2 subjects experienced ocular AEs that were considered related to treatment: eye discharge and eye irritation. This safety profile is in line with prior phase 2 and 3 studies in allergic conjunctivitis and clinical studies with the same insert following cataract surgery. Moreover, there have been few treatment-related AEs with the dexamethasone insert: 2 in the current study and 14 in prior phase 2 and 3 allergic conjunctivitis and cataract surgery studies (N = 632).

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^117JRUJh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Safety analysis

A total of 202 patients were exposed to the study medication for 3 nonconsecutive days, with one dose per visit over a 3-week period. Based on the review of incidence and individual characteristics (onset, intensity, duration, and outcome) of treatment-emergent AEs (Table 2), none of which were serious, no safety concerns were identified for olopatadine 0.77% or 0.2%. Analysis of the safety parameters measured over the course of the study demonstrated no discernable trends or clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### Topical cyclosporine in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis: a meta-analysis [^1129mRzK]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical cyclosporine versus placebo in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Participants

Seven qualified studies incorporating 306 eyes of 153 patients were analyzed.

Methods

Searches of randomized controlled trials were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Main Outcome Measures

We assessed the methodologic quality of individual included trials and performed meta-analyses using the random effects model if P < 0.1 in the test for heterogeneity, or otherwise used the fixed effects model. We assessed scores of composite signs and symptoms, reduction in steroid eye drop use in steroid-dependent patients, and safety outcomes (i.e., stinging or burning sensation).

Results

At 2 weeks of follow-up or longer, evidence suggests a statistically significant improvement in the composite signs (standardized mean difference [SMD], -1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.80 to -0.62; I(2) = 71%) and symptoms (SMD, -0.84; 95% CI, -1.51 to -0.16; I(2) = 80%) after topical cyclosporine treatment for allergic conjunctivitis regardless of the dosage of treatment. There was a significant reduction (mean difference, -61.16; 95% CI, -101.61 to -20.72; I(2) = 58%) in the use of steroid eye drops in patients with steroid-dependent allergic conjunctivitis. Stinging or burning sensation (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 0.19–35.06; I(2) = 73%) was common in both the cyclosporine and placebo groups.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests topical cyclosporine could be an effective and safe treatment method for allergic conjunctivitis. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and standardized outcome measurements, follow-up periods, and cyclosporine concentrations are warranted to determine the short- and long-term efficacy and safety and the minimal effective dosage of topical cyclosporine for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EN65h]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis and asthma — clinical features, diagnosis, and management are summarized as follows: Evidence clearly supports a link between diseases of the upper and lower airways, with most patients with asthma having concurrent rhinitis and 10–40% of patients with allergic rhinitis having asthma; depending on sensitization and exposure, allergic rhinitis may be seasonal (e.g., ragweed or grass pollen), perennial (e.g., house dust mite [HDM] allergens, furred pets in the home), or intermittent (e.g., furred pets at other locations). Rhinitis is defined as irritation and inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose, and allergic rhinitis may be accompanied by ocular symptoms (conjunctivitis). Diagnosis can classify rhinitis as either allergic or non-allergic depending on whether allergic sensitization is demonstrated; variation in symptoms by season or with environmental and/or occupational exposure suggests allergic rhinitis, and examination of the upper airway should be arranged for patients with severe asthma. For management, international evidence-based guidelines recommend intranasal corticosteroids for treatment of allergic rhinitis, and in a case-control study, treatment of rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids was associated with less need for asthma-related hospitalization and emergency department visits.

### Registration trials for specific immunotherapy in Europe: advanced guidance from the new European medical agency guideline [^116b6nbd]. Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Marketing authorization of medicinal products is granted based on results of registration trials. The European Medical Agency (EMA) has issued general and disease state-specific guidelines for the conduct of such trials. In the area of allergic diseases, there are basically two general therapeutic approaches: Drugs that mitigate the symptoms and an approach that is targeted to the root cause of the disease, the allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT). While the 'Guideline on the Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Allergic Rhino-Conjunctivitis' (CHMP/EWP/2455/02) and the 'Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Asthma' (CPMP/EWP/2922/01) focuses exclusively on the development of medicinal products to treat allergic symptoms, there was no guideline for SIT in the past. In consequence, the conduct of clinical trials for SIT was widely lacking a standardized approach. This created difficulties when comparing drugs and outcomes and also uncertainty to predict marketing authorization. In 2009, the EMA has issued a new guideline on the clinical development of products for SIT. Despite some white spots in some areas, the new guideline constitutes a breakthrough with regard to guidance, harmonization and transparency in the conduct of clinical trials in SIT.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^116HaZ8M]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis follow-up and corticosteroid monitoring — Follow-up frequency is based on disease severity, etiology, and treatment, and timing of visits during symptomatic periods should be considered; a follow-up visit should include an interval history, measurement of visual acuity, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. If topical corticosteroids are used in chronic or recurrent conjunctivitis, baseline and periodic measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupillary dilation should be performed to evaluate for glaucoma and cataract. Allergic conjunctivitis and atopic disease are associated with keratoconus, and adequate control of allergy and eye rubbing are important to decrease progression of ectasia. Intralymphatic immunotherapy appears to provide short-term benefits but has unclear efficacy beyond a year.

### Ocular allergy: implications for the clinical immunologist [^115bbaRv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic diseases of the eye are the most common conditions affecting the external ocular adnexa. The most common forms are primarily IgE-mediated and share features in common with other atopic conditions. Mast cell activation and release of mediators, particularly histamine, are central to the pathogenesis of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. These conditions are self-limited without the occurrence of ocular surface damage. In contrast, vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis are complex diseases, involving both early- and late-phase allergic responses. They are characterized by severe chronic immune inflammation with T cell infiltration in the conjunctiva and may be sight-threatening.

Objectives

To provide a brief overview of the ocular allergic conditions and summarize the current knowledge of immunopathogenetic mechanisms involved in initiating and driving these conditions.

Data Sources

English-language articles were sought from a MEDLINE search from 1995. This yielded a number of scientific and review papers exploring recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the ocular allergic conditions.

Conclusions

Recent advances in knowledge about the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in ocular allergy have led to a better understanding of treatment options and to the development of new treatment modalities, resulting in improved control of symptoms for patients.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115mBKDb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was preferred over topical therapy and was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Larger head-to-head trials of therapies for allergic conjunctivitis can further clarify the roles of these agents in disease management.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^114ASAZp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Study population

A total of 202 patients were randomized in the study between December 2011 and March 2012; all were available for the safety analysis. Two patients discontinued after randomization but before the scheduled CAC; therefore, 200 patients were available for the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis.

Reasons for study discontinuation were similar across treatment groups, with 16 patients discontinuing the study early after visit 3A (Figure 1). Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups, except that different proportions of participants were allergic to different types of allergens causing allergic conjunctivitis (Table 1).

### Sublingual immunotherapy for treating allergic conjunctivitis [^1127AmKB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic ocular symptoms, although frequently trivialised, are common and represent an important comorbidity of allergic rhinitis. Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis, but its effects on symptoms of ocular allergy have not been well established.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of SLIT compared with placebo for reductions in ocular symptoms, topical ocular medication requirements and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2011), Web of Science (January 1970 to January 2011), Biosis Previews, (January 1979 to January 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (January 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (January 2011), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (www.actr.org.au) (July 2010), SCOPUS (November 2008) and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (January 2010). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. All electronic databases except for SCOPUS, the UK Clinical Trials Gateway and ANZCTR were last searched on 19 January 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), double-masked and placebo controlled, which evaluated the efficacy of SLIT in patients with symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) or allergic conjunctivitis (AC).

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was the total ocular symptom scores. Secondary endpoints included individual ocular symptom scores (such as itchy eyes, red eyes, watery eyes, swollen eyes), ocular medication scores (eye drops) and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity (CIAS). Data were analysed and reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) using Review Manager software.

Main Results

Forty-two trials (n = 3958 total participants; n = 2011 SLIT and n = 1947 placebo) had available data to evaluate the efficacy of SLIT on AC and were included in the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity among studies (I(2) statistic) was around 50% or below for all endpoints. Sublingual immunotherapy induced a significant reduction in both total ocular symptom scores (SMD -0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.28; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 59%) and individual ocular symptom scores for red eyes (SMD -0.33; 95% CI -0.45 to -0.22; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 27%), itchy eyes (SMD -0.31; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.20; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 46%) and watery eyes (SMD -0.23; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.11; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 42%) compared to placebo. Those participants having active treatment showed an increase in the threshold dose for the conjunctival allergen provocation test (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.69; P = 0.05; I(2) = 43%). No significant reduction was observed in ocular eye drops use (SMD -0.10; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.03; P = 0.13; I(2) = 34%).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, SLIT is moderately effective in reducing total and individual ocular symptom scores in participants with ARC and AC. There were however some concerns about the overall quality of the evidence-base, this relating to inadequate descriptions of allocation concealment in some studies, statistical heterogeneity and the possibility of publication bias. There is a need for further large rigorously designed studies that study long-term effectiveness after discontinuation of treatment and establish the cost-effectiveness of SLIT.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^115LQAtj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis reinforces the findings from the two individual CAC studies demonstrating superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% provided superior and longer duration of relief from itching that persisted over a period of 24 hours. No safety concerns were identified with once-daily olopatadine HCl 0.77%. The safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to that of olopatadine 0.2%. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (at least 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% further support its once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

The prevalence of ocular allergy clearly is underappreciated and has been under diagnosed and undertreated. The ocular symptoms associated with the most common ocular allergy conditions, such as seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, are twice as likely to affect the allergy sufferer rather than nasal symptoms alone. The differential diagnosis of conjunctivitis is quite broad, with the most common forms associated with allergies, infections, and hormones. There are common features and some discerning features that, with a good history and examination, may provide a more focused and appropriate management.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^1178eonN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE- and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Approximately 40% of individuals in the developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis, and as such, it is the most common form of ocular allergy. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent type of allergic conjunctivitis that impacts the quality of life of patients. This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety of alcaftadine. Histamine and the pathological mechanism of ocular allergy will be briefly reviewed with the intent of providing a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine in allergic conjunctivitis. The Medline PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were used to search for evidence-based literature on histamine and immunopathological mechanism of allergic conjunctivitis, as well as on pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical efficacy of alcaftadine. The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. It is of note that activation of histamine receptors on immune and nonimmune cells are associated with allergen-induced inflammation of the conjunctiva and its associated ocular allergic manifestations, including itching, edema, hyperemia, and tearing. Alcaftadine is an efficacious multiple action antiallergic therapeutic agent with inverse agonist activity on H1, H2, and H4 receptors, as well as anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing effects that could provide therapeutic benefits to patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

### The therapeutic effect of IPL on children with refractory seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^113ER18X]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most common type among allergic conjunctivitis, and the principal treatment modality is anti-allergic drug therapy. At present, there are a wide variety of anti-allergy drugs available for the eyes. Many scholars have repeatedly compared the therapeutic effects of various anti-allergy eye drops on SAC, and although there are slight differences, all can achieve good results. In order to control allergic conjunctivitis more effectively, An increasing number of new drugs are being developed, for example, 0.5% epinastine topical eyelid cream may be considered an effective drug to prevent the onset of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis; Bilastine 0.6% ophthalmic solution was effective in reducing ocular symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. However, in clinical practice, we still encounter patients who respond poorly to drug treatment from time to time. Especially for pediatric patients, although the symptoms such as redness and swelling of the eyes can be alleviated after medication, the symptoms such as eye rubbing and squinting caused by itching are still very obvious. The main characteristic of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, especially refractory SAC, is the symptom of eye itching, and the main objective of the treatment is also to alleviate the discomfort in the eyes. Our research found that IPL combined with drug therapy can effectively ameliorate the subjective ocular surface symptoms of patients, especially for a series of ocular surface symptoms caused by itching. At the same time, it can also ameliorate ocular congestion and edema. The reason for this result may be related to the unique mechanism of action of IPL treatment.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112KecqA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory-mediated disorder induced by seasonal or perennial allergens and affects up to approximately 40% of the general United States (US) population. However, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to its association with other disorders such as dry eye disease and allergic rhinitis. Two of the most common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are itching and redness. For patients with moderate to severe symptoms, there is a detrimental impact on quality of life. Several studies have examined the impact of allergic conjunctivitis on patients' quality of life. In a study of 220 patients with ocular allergy, nearly half rated their disease severity of at least 6 on a scale of 1 to 10; moreover, patient-reported quality of life significantly declined during allergic conjunctivitis episodes (P < 0.001). A study of more than 1000 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis found that allergic conjunctivitis was associated with a decrease in productivity, illustrated by an impairment while working and an increase in hours of work missed.

Current treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include topical antihistamines, which have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and topical mast-cell stabilizers, which require a long loading period. Topical corticosteroids are effective in both the early and late phases of the allergic response but are generally limited to a short course (1–2 weeks) for patients with more severe or persistent symptoms due to the potential for misuse or abuse of steroids, which can lead to complications associated with long-term use. All topical corticosteroid eye drops commercially available in the US contain preservatives, which can cause patient discomfort and corneal toxicity. Topical corticosteroids also have a complex dosing regimen, which can result in poor patient compliance and difficulty with self-administration. An additional limitation with the application of topical drops includes frequent touching of the face, which potentially increases the risk for infection.

### Phase 3 randomized study of efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112TpYBE]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone intracanalicular ocular insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial.

Methods

Subjects with allergic conjunctivitis were randomized 1:1 to receive a dexamethasone insert or a placebo insert in both eyes and were evaluated using a modified version of the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. After inserts were placed in office, a series of 4 closely spaced post-insertion CACs were conducted at weeks 1, 2, and 4 across approximately 30 days. Primary efficacy endpoints, assessed at week-1 CAC-day 8, were reported by subjects of ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post CAC and investigator-evaluated conjunctival redness at 7, 15, and 20 minutes post CAC.

Results

For the primary endpoints, dexamethasone inserts showed statistically significantly lower mean ocular itching scores than placebo at all time points (P < .001), with differences favoring dexamethasone inserts over placebo (0.86, 0.98, and 0.96 units at 3, 5, and 7 minutes, respectively) and statistically significantly lower conjunctival redness scores at 20 minutes (P < .05) but not at 7 or 15 minutes (P ≥ .05). Results also showed statistically significantly less itching and conjunctival redness at 31 and 29 of 33 other time points, respectively (P < .05). There were no serious adverse events; 1 subject had elevated intraocular pressure in both eyes.

Conclusions

Data presented in this study demonstrate the potential for a single, physician-administered dexamethasone intracanalicular insert to provide relief of ocular itching for up to 4 weeks in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis, while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

### Management of ocular allergy [^111wZqCy]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment and management of ocular allergy (OA) remain a major concern for different specialties, including allergists, ophthalmologists, primary care physicians, rhinologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, clinical immunologists, and pharmacists. We performed a systematic review of all relevant publications in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web Science including systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Publications were considered relevant if they addressed treatments, or management strategies of OA. A further wider systematic literature search was performed if no evidence or good quality evidence was found. There are effective drugs for the treatment of OA; however, there is a lack an optimal treatment for the perennial and severe forms. Topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or double-action drugs are the first choice of treatment. All of them are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of OA. The safety and optimal dosing regimen of the most effective topical anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, are still a major concern. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used in steroid-dependent/resistant cases of severe allergic keratoconjunctivitis. Allergen-specific immunotherapy may be considered in cases of failure of first-line treatments or to modify the natural course of OA disease. Based on the current wealth of publications and on the collective experience, recommendations on management of OA have been proposed.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal / perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115C487g]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of allergic conjunctivitis necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Initial measures focus on the avoidance of environmental irritants to minimize exposure and subsequent allergic reactions. Pharmacological management includes both prophylactic and therapeutic medications, administered via topical ocular drops or systemic routes. Prophylactic drugs, such as sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil, function as mast cell stabilizers, exerting their effect by blocking the release of inflammatory mediators and thereby preventing the onset of symptoms. Symptomatic relief is achieved through the use of decongestants, including astringents (eg, silver nitrate or zinc sulfate), vessel vasoconstrictors (alpha and beta sympathomimetics), or antihistamines (eg, astemizole or cetirizine). These medications work by a reduction in conjunctival congestion, constriction of blood vessels, and inhibition of histamine-mediated allergic responses. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids play a key role in reducing inflammation and suppressing immune-mediated responses. These agents act by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and modulating the immune response, thereby alleviating symptoms and promoting ocular comfort.

Corticosteroids are effective for allergic reactions by inhibiting the production of inflammatory substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing inflammatory cells, and suppressing mast cell proliferation. These pleiotropic actions make corticosteroids effective in both the early and late stages of the allergic response. Consequently, patients who are more prone to experiencing the late-phase inflammatory response, eg, those with moderate to severe symptoms, prolonged or recurrent allergen exposure, or inadequate symptom management with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, often receive topical corticosteroid treatment. It is important to note, however, that prolonged use of corticosteroids may cause significant adverse effects, including increased intraocular pressure and the development of glaucoma, cataracts, and an elevated risk of infection. Despite the frequent use of topical therapies for allergic conjunctivitis, there are still several needs unmet by the current treatment options. These inadequacies include inconsistent efficacy, short duration of action, delayed onset of action, and safety concerns associated with side effects, particularly those induced by steroids and preservatives. Consequently, there remains a demand for long-acting therapies that consistently demonstrate efficacy, require lower dosages, and effectively inhibit the late-phase inflammatory response without major adverse effects.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^1156jb7Y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis severity, treatment and resolution

Conjunctivitis AEs were mostly mild to moderate. Severe conjunctivitis was reported in ≤ 0·5% of dupilumab‐treated (dupilumab combined) and ≤ 0·3% of placebo‐treated patients (Fig. 1). One patient in the 300‐mg qw group in the monotherapy pool permanently discontinued the study drug due to conjunctivitis, and one patient in the 300‐mg qw + TCS group in CHRONOS permanently discontinued the study drug due to allergic keratitis (MedDRA PT; the verbatim term was 'worsening of allergic keratoconjunctivitis').

### Decoding allergic conjunctivitis: latest perspectives on etiological drivers and immunopathological mechanisms [^115QmahX]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Research on allergic conjunctivitis is currently in an era of increased knowledge and technological innovation. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of AC has deepened to include epigenetic regulation, the heterogeneity of cell subpopulations, and fine-tuned interactions within molecular networks, with increasing attention being given to the driving roles of environmental factors (Fig. 3). Therapeutically, precisely targeted biologics and JAK inhibitors have led to revolutionary changes in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AC, but the scientific exploration of complementary therapies such as traditional Chinese medicine and dietary supplements is also flourishing. The future direction lies in integrating multidimensional information to achieve a precise diagnosis, personalized treatment, and effective prevention of AC. Despite numerous challenges, with the continuous deepening and translation of basic and clinical research, we believe that we can provide better solutions for hundreds of millions of AC patients worldwide, significantly improving their visual health and quality of life.

### Epithelial barrier dysfunction in ocular allergy [^1138bJPx]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

3 OCULAR ALLERGY

The term allergic conjunctivitis or OA refers to a collection of hypersensitivity disorders affecting primarily the lid and conjunctiva and includes different phenotypes varying from seasonal (SAC) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), to the chronic vernal (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and contact blepharoconjunctivitis.

Successful management of OA involves preventive, non‐pharmacologic as well as pharmacologic measures. Over the years various therapeutic options have been developed to achieve symptom control in OA including topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and dual acting agents with use of corticosteroids and immunomodulators in severe cases. However, in the chronic forms, none of these completely control the signs and symptoms or prevent the recurrences. Ocular surface inflammation in VKC and AKC often leads to severe suffering and complications such as corneal ulcers, tissue remodeling, scars, and rarely LSC deficiency, characterized by invasion of conjunctival epithelium into the cornea. Further, treatment related complications such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataract arise due to side effects of steroids overuse warranting new and safer therapeutics. Since the eyes are exposed directly to an outer environment, defective barrier must be primarily involved in the pathology of OA. Epithelial barrier integrity is known to be compromised in dry eye pathologies suggesting that barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in different ocular surface disorders.

### Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivits: a systematic review [^115XneoP]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ocular allergy represents one of the most common conditions encountered by allergists and ophthalmologists. However, there is wide variability of study designs in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis, which results in conflicting evidence on their optimal management. We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials to critically evaluate their quality and to highlight biases to be avoided in future clinical research in ocular allergy.

Methods

Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis performed since 1965 were retrieved, and data on patients, interventions, comparison of interventions, and outcomes were extracted. Four authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the systematic review and assessed trials' quality using the Jadad scale.

Results

Three hundred and sixty-two trials were included in the study. Only a minority of trials fulfilled all the criteria of proper clinical trial design. In most of the studies, there was a very limited use of objective (quantifiable) parameters for both patients' selection and evaluation of drug efficacy and safety. Several outcomes of primary importance, such as disease relapses and recurrence rate, were omitted in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis.

Conclusions

Evidence coming out of clinical trials in ocular allergy is limited, and this affects the strength of recommendations to health care providers and policy makers for optimal management. Standardized diagnostic criteria for patient selection and quantifiable primary outcomes are recommended to improve the design of future clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: update on pathophysiology and prospects for future treatment [^116njrWC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is in actuality a group of diseases affecting the ocular surface and is usually associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Two acute disorders, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, exist, as do 3 chronic diseases, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis. The ocular surface inflammation (usually mast cell driven) results in itching, tearing, lid and conjunctival edema-redness, and photophobia during the acute phase and can lead to a classic late-phase response (with associated eosinophilia and neutrophilia) in a subset of individuals. As is the case in other allergic diseases, a chronic disease can also develop, accompanied by remodeling of the ocular surface tissues. In severe cases the patient experiences extreme discomfort and sustains damage to the ocular surface. For such cases, there is no highly effective and safe treatment regimen. Topical administration of corticosteroids is used in severe cases but is associated with an increased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Thus there is a worldwide search for new biotargets for the treatment of these diseases. Here we provide a brief update of the clinical symptoms associated with these diseases, the rationale for disease classification, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the diseases, and an update on both preclinical and clinical advances toward refined therapies for these diseases.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^116NC5or]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

To ensure symptom relief over a longer duration, we assessed olopatadine administered once daily at a higher strength. This new formulation contains olopatadine HCl at a concentration of 0.77% (7.76 mg/mL), which is equivalent to 0.7% olopatadine as a free base. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was developed with the rationale of expanding the benefits offered by olopatadine 0.2%, particularly superior and long-lasting relief over a period of 24 hours with once-daily dosing, while maintaining its safety and patient comfort.

Two phase 3 studies were conducted using the CAC model to assess the safety and efficacy of olopatadine HCl 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–The outcomes of these two studies supported the recent approval (January 30, 2015) of olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution 0.77% (olopatadine HCl 0.77%) by the FDA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The results from these two CAC studies demonstrated superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle at onset and 24 hours post-dosing and over olopatadine 0.2% at 24 hours post-dosing for the treatment of ocular itching in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–In the current article, we report the pooled analysis of these two randomized phase 3 studies to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety findings from a larger dataset.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^117MSeZ4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. It is approved in the U.S. A. for patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) uncontrolled by topical prescription medicines or who cannot use topical medicines, for patients in Japan whose AD is uncontrolled with existing therapies, for patients with moderate-to-severe AD in Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy and for patients aged ≥ 12 years for maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma uncontrolled with their current medicines. AD trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs. placebo.

Objectives

To characterize further the occurrence and risk factors of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials.

Methods

We evaluated randomized placebo-controlled trials of dupilumab in AD (n = 2629), asthma (n = 2876), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) (n = 60) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) (n = 47).

Results

In most AD trials, dupilumab-treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than placebo controls. Higher baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence. Conjunctivitis was mostly mild to moderate. Most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period; two patients permanently discontinued dupilumab due to conjunctivitis or keratitis. Common treatments included ophthalmic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators. In asthma and CRSwNP trials, the incidence of conjunctivitis was lower for both dupilumab and placebo than in AD trials; dupilumab did not increase the incidence compared with placebo. In the EoE trial, no patients had conjunctivitis.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab treatment in most AD trials. In dupilumab trials in other type 2 diseases, incidence of conjunctivitis was overall very low, and was similar for dupilumab and placebo. In AD, the incidence of conjunctivitis was associated with AD severity and prior history of conjunctivitis. The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients require further study. What's already known about this topic? Ocular disorders, including allergic conjunctivitis, are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). In most dupilumab AD trials, dupilumab-treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than those receiving placebo. Most cases were mild to moderate and recovered or were recovering during study treatment; study treatment discontinuation due to conjunctivitis was rare. Conjunctivitis incidence was very low and similar for dupilumab and placebo in clinical trials in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitis. What does this study add? This analysis confirms and extends the results of the individual clinical trials. Baseline disease-related factors, including AD severity, prior conjunctivitis history and certain biomarkers (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, IgE, eosinophils), were associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis. Patients who responded well to dupilumab had reduced incidence of conjunctivitis. Further study is needed to elucidate the aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients with AD.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^114yLcWL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the approved treatments for ocular allergies are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, or both, and act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early-phase reaction. Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec ®; Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc; New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is the number one oral antihistamine allergy treatment recommended by allergists. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). Cetirizine hydrochloride selectively inhibits H1 histamine receptors to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, idiopathic urticaria, and itching due to chronic hivesand has a long-standing record of approval in different formulations. Cetirizine hydrochloride is safe and well tolerated and was approved in tablet form (5 and 10 mg) in USA in 1995, as a syrup formulation in 1996, for children aged 2–5 years in 1998, for children aged 6 months and older in 2002, and for nonprescription use as a chewable tablet and syrup in 2007. The long-standing therapeutic success and safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in different formulations and pronounced ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitissupported the development of cetirizine hydrochloride as an ophthalmic solution to combat the ocular effects of allergic conjunctivitis.

In 2018, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate™) was approved by the Food and Drug Agency for the treatment of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Here, we report two Phase III efficacy studies that were the basis of this approval. These two studies show strong and similar anti-itch efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared with vehicle using the CAC model. Study 2 expanded the efficacy assessment in Study 1 to subjects with more severe allergic conjunctivitis symptoms including eyelid swelling. Together these studies show reproducible success of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of ocular and nasal signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in diverse patient populations. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated with a 15-minute onset of action and añ8-hour duration of action.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117AZnVZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis classification and targeted types — conjunctivitis can be classified as noninfectious or infectious and as acute, chronic, or recurrent. Noninfectious types of conjunctivitis include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic, and these types may overlap, while the causes of infectious conjunctivitis include viruses and bacteria. It is important to differentiate between primary conjunctival disease and conditions in which conjunctival inflammation is secondary to systemic or ocular diseases; for example, dry eye and blepharitis are the most frequent causes of conjunctival inflammation and the treatment for each of these entities should be directed at correcting the underlying problems. Systemic conditions such as atopy or acute infections such as gonorrhea may also cause conjunctival inflammation, and treatment of conjunctivitis must include addressing the underlying systemic disease. This preferred practice pattern addresses types that are either most common or are particularly important to detect and treat, including allergic types — seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and atopic conjunctivitis — and mechanical/irritative/toxic types — superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK), blepharoconjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), rosacea conjunctivitis, contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), floppy eyelid syndrome, giant fornix syndrome, and medication-induced/preservative-induced keratoconjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^116gnHhN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the higher incidence of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients with AD appears to be associated with several disease‐based factors, including baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis. Dupilumab treatment was not associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE trials. In most cases, conjunctivitis AEs were mild to moderate. Most cases resolved or were resolving while patients continued their dupilumab treatment, but the data do not allow for determination of the proportion of patients who required continued or intermittent ongoing therapy for conjunctivitis. For timely appropriate intervention, we recommend referral for a detailed eye examination in patients who develop this complication while on dupilumab treatment. Further studies, including mechanistic investigations of ocular or conjunctival samples, are needed to characterize clinical phenotypes and understand the aetiology of the observed conjunctivitis AEs in the setting of dupilumab treatment, and to develop guidance for prevention and management.

### ICON: diagnosis and management of allergic conjunctivitis [^116DcWjy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes. This would significantly improve OA management and overcome the unmet needs in global health.

### Azelastine hydrochloride, a dual-acting anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solution, for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^117RJTUH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Over 50% of patients who seek treatment for allergies present with ocular symptoms. Our current ability to control ocular allergic symptoms is greater than ever before. Newer dual-acting topical eyedrops attack multiple facets of the allergic cascade. Azelastine has antihistaminic effects providing immediate relief, mast cell stabilization providing early-phase intervention, and inhibition of expression and activation of anti-inflammatory mediators which characterize the late phase of the immune reaction. The ophthalmic eyedrop formulation is approved for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adults and children aged over 3 years. In clinical trials comparing azelastine with other dual-acting eyedrops, such as levocabastine and olopatadine, azelastine was reported to be slightly less efficacious and to sting briefly upon administration. Even so, many patients experienced the full benefit of symptom relief, and preferred azelastine. As a broad-spectrum drug, azelastine offers many desirable properties for management of ocular allergies. Because it can often produce maximal effect with just twice-daily dosing, azelastine is a particularly good choice for the allergic population in whom minimizing exposure to topical products and preservatives is a key concern.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112Yewb6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, olopatadine HCl 0.77% had lower mean scores compared with vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for all other measured signs and symptoms post-CAC at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action. This data support the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, lasting for 24 hours. The similarities in study population and study design justify this pooled analysis, and the consistency of the results across multiple measures supports the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis lasting for 24 hours.

No serious AEs were reported with olopatadine HCl 0.77% regardless of the treatment duration (onset of action and 24 hours). Overall, the safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to the vehicle and the well-established safety profile of olopatadine 0.2%.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^112ARc8H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and stinging insect hypersensitivity — Summary Statement 6 states "Immunotherapy is effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and stinging insect hypersensitivity. Therefore immunotherapy merits consideration in patients with these disorders as a possible treatment option. A". Randomized evidence indicates immunotherapy is effective for allergic rhinitis (including ocular symptoms), allergic asthma, and stinging insect hypersensitivity and "is effective in both adults and children", with efficacy confirmed for inhalant allergens caused by pollens, fungi, animal allergens, dust mites, and cockroaches. Outcomes used include symptom and medication scores, organ challenge, immunologic changes, and quality-of-life improvements. For dust mite, reported effect sizes range "from a 2.7-fold improvement in symptoms to a 13.7-fold reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity". In a systematic review of "88 trials" involving "3,459" asthmatic patients, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) reduced symptoms and medication use; the meta-analysis estimated it "would have been necessary to treat 3 patients (95% CI, 3–5)… to avoid 1 deterioration in asthma symptom and 4 patients (95% CI, 3–6)… to avoid 1 patient requiring increased medication". Meta-analyses "strongly support the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy", and for allergic rhinitis, immunotherapy "might have persistent benefits after immunotherapy is discontinued… and reduce the risk for the future development of asthma", and "might also prevent the development of new allergen sensitivities in monosensitized patients".
