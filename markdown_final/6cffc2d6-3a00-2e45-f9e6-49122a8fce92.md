## Question

what's a neurogenic abdominal wall

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a "neurogenic abdominal wall" means and how to interpret the term in clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the phrase is used as a diagnosis or a descriptor. Then, I should verify the relevant neuroanatomy of the abdominal wall and its innervation. Next, I will examine common neurogenic pathologies that affect the abdominal wall, including pain syndromes, motor neuropathies, and functional dyssynergias. After that, I should review diagnostic approaches, including bedside maneuvers and electrodiagnostics. Finally, I will consider treatment implications and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition anchored to the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting a vague phrase. "Neurogenic abdominal wall" is not a standardized diagnosis; rather, it is a descriptive umbrella indicating that neurological mechanisms underlie abdominal wall symptoms or dysfunction, encompassing pain, motor weakness, or paradoxical movement patterns, and it is used across pain, surgical, and neuro-urologic literature to signal a nerve-mediated process rather than primary visceral disease or structural hernia alone [^c40b9c2e] [^7c6068be] [^31db1b51].

> I will now examine the neuroanatomy to anchor the concept. The anterior and lateral abdominal wall receives somatic innervation from the ventral rami of T6–T12 and L1, forming the thoracoabdominal nerves and the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves, with motor branches to the rectus abdominis and oblique muscles; sympathetic fibers from T1–L2 also contribute to autonomic regulation of abdominal wall smooth muscle and glands, which explains how both somatic and autonomic pathways can be implicated in "neurogenic" presentations [^91f13046] [^384653f5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize the clinical entities that clinicians label as "neurogenic abdominal wall". The most common is chronic abdominal wall pain from anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment or related somatic neuropathies, often confirmed by a positive Carnett sign and responsive to diagnostic local anesthetic injection, with estimates suggesting 10–30% of chronic abdominal pain is abdominal wall in origin and frequently missed without targeted examination [^c40b9c2e] [^187157ea] [^7c6068be].

> Next, I should review motor neuropathies that present as abdominal wall weakness or pseudohernia. Segmental paresis can follow thoracic radiculopathy from disc herniation or post-herpetic motor involvement, producing focal bulging and measurable denervation on EMG; MRI may show increased T2/STIR signal in denervated muscles, and recovery can occur with conservative care or nerve repair in select cases [^6f99e16d] [^1e4493d1] [^d07ab6ca].

> Wait, let me verify the functional dyssynergia category, because it is easy to conflate with primary visceral disease. Abdominophrenic dyssynergia is a paradoxical viscerosomatic reflex with diaphragmatic descent coupled to anterior abdominal wall relaxation, producing visible distension often meal-related; CT and EMG demonstrate the pattern, and it is mechanistically linked to gut–brain axis dysregulation rather than structural wall failure, which is a prototypical "neurogenic" abdominal wall phenomenon even if the pain is viscerally triggered [^31db1b51] [^26de0345] [^385ce5dd].

> I need to check diagnostic strategies that separate neurogenic wall pain from visceral sources. The Carnett test remains a practical bedside discriminator: focal tenderness that persists or worsens with tensing the abdominal muscles supports a wall source, whereas tenderness that improves with tensing suggests visceral pain; confirmatory trigger-point injection of local anesthetic yielding at least 50% pain reduction supports a neurogenic wall diagnosis and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic [^187157ea] [^36ba99d8] [^91f13046].

> Let me consider electrodiagnostics and imaging when motor signs are present. EMG can document acute denervation and reinnervation in radiculopathy or post-herpetic paresis, while MRI can show muscle signal changes from denervation; in suspected APD, dynamic CT or EMG can capture the paradoxical diaphragmatic–abdominal wall pattern, though these are typically reserved for refractory or diagnostically uncertain cases rather than routine use [^6f99e16d] [^d07ab6ca] [^26de0345].

> I should double-check treatment implications because they differ by mechanism. For anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment and related neuropathic wall pain, trigger-point injections with local anesthetic and corticosteroid are effective in 70–99% of cases, with surgical neurectomy reserved for refractory symptoms; for abdominophrenic dyssynergia, biofeedback and diaphragmatic retraining are first-line, with central neuromodulators considered when bloating/distension are prominent; for motor neuropathies, conservative management, physical therapy, and selective nerve repair or reconstruction may be indicated depending on etiology and chronicity [^187157ea] [^320bcb39] [^6f99e16d].

> But wait, what if the "neurogenic abdominal wall" phrase is being used in surgical reconstruction contexts. In complex abdominal wall reconstruction, surgeons increasingly emphasize restoration of innervated, functional muscle to preserve core stability; techniques that preserve or restore motor innervation, and even experimental neurotization of flaps or allotransplants, reflect recognition that a truly functional abdominal wall is neurogenic in the sense of requiring intact motor supply, not just structural coverage [^d5b9c77c] [^0f6704de] [^dffcfb74].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful definition, and I should confirm it aligns with the evidence. A neurogenic abdominal wall refers to a clinical state in which symptoms or dysfunction of the abdominal wall arise from disorders of its nerve supply, manifesting as neuropathic pain from somatic nerve entrapment or injury, motor weakness or pseudohernia from segmental neuropathy, or paradoxical movement patterns such as abdominophrenic dyssynergia; diagnosis relies on targeted examination, selective use of confirmatory blocks or electrodiagnostics, and judicious imaging to exclude structural mimics, with management tailored to the specific neurogenic mechanism [^c40b9c2e] [^31db1b51] [^7c6068be].

A neurogenic abdominal wall refers to **nerve-related dysfunction** of the abdominal wall muscles, most often due to **intercostal or thoracoabdominal nerve injury** [^91f13046] [^82189c06]. This can cause focal pain, muscle weakness, or pseudohernia (bulge without hernia) [^c40b9c2e] [^d07ab6ca]. Common causes include **surgical trauma** (hernia repair, laparoscopy, thoracic surgery) [^82189c06] [^4e54b80e], **trauma**, or **compressive neuropathies** (thoracic radiculopathy, herpes zoster) [^6f99e16d] [^1e4493d1]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical examination** (positive Carnett's sign) [^187157ea], **ultrasound** to exclude hernia, and **EMG** to confirm denervation [^7801665c]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, including physical therapy, neuromodulation, and surgical options such as nerve repair or mesh reinforcement for persistent deficits [^85e32325] [^85ef9a5f].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Neurogenic abdominal wall dysfunction presents with **characteristic features**:

- **Pain**: Chronic, focal abdominal wall pain, often sharp or burning, localized to a specific quadrant [^c40b9c2e].

- **Weakness**: Segmental muscle weakness causing visible bulging or pseudohernia, typically unilateral [^d07ab6ca].

- **Sensory disturbances**: Numbness or paresthesia in the corresponding dermatomal distribution [^notfound].

- **Functional impairment**: Difficulty with core stability, posture, and activities of daily living [^0a18426d].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Several factors contribute to **neurogenic abdominal wall dysfunction**:

| **Etiology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Surgical trauma | - Hernia repairs <br/> - Laparoscopic procedures <br/> - Thoracic surgeries <br/> - Abdominal wall reconstruction [^82189c06] [^4e54b80e] [^b5af18cd] |
| Trauma | - Blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma <br/> - Rib fractures [^notfound] |
| Compressive neuropathies | - Thoracic radiculopathy <br/> - Intercostal neuralgia <br/> - Herpes zoster (shingles) [^6f99e16d] [^1e4493d1] |
| Systemic conditions | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Autoimmune neuropathies <br/> - Neurofibromatosis [^323fc951] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Clinical examination**: Positive Carnett's sign (pain persists or worsens with tensing of abdominal muscles) suggests abdominal wall pain [^187157ea] [^36ba99d8].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI to exclude hernias, masses, or structural abnormalities [^08339db1].

- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Confirms denervation and identifies the affected nerve(s) [^7801665c].

- **Nerve blocks**: Diagnostic injections of local anesthetics can confirm the nerve-related pain source [^187157ea].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **tailored to the underlying cause and severity**:

- **Conservative management**: Physical therapy, neuromodulation, and pharmacological agents (gabapentin, pregabalin, NSAIDs) [^cb2b4a98].

- **Interventional procedures**: Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks, radiofrequency ablation, and trigger point injections [^187157ea].

- **Surgical interventions**: Nerve repair, neurectomy, or mesh reinforcement for persistent deficits or pseudohernia [^85ef9a5f] [^468a1265].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involvement of pain specialists, neurologists, surgeons, and physical therapists [^a232af31].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **cause and extent of nerve injury**. Mild cases often improve with conservative therapy, whereas severe or chronic cases may require ongoing management and can result in persistent functional impairment [^6f99e16d].

---

A neurogenic abdominal wall results from **nerve injury to the abdominal wall muscles**, causing pain, weakness, or pseudohernia. Accurate diagnosis and **multidisciplinary management** are essential for optimal outcomes [^7c6068be].

### Chronic abdominal wall pain: an under-recognized diagnosis leading to unnecessary testing [^c40b9c2e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal wall pain (CAWP) refers to a condition wherein pain originates from the abdominal wall itself rather than the underlying viscera. According to various estimates, 10% to 30% of patients with chronic abdominal pain are eventually diagnosed with CAWP, usually after expensive testing has failed to uncover another etiology. The most common cause of CAWP is anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. The diagnosis of CAWP is made using an oft-forgotten physical examination finding known as Carnett's sign, where focal abdominal tenderness is either the same or worsened during contraction of the abdominal musculature. CAWP can be confirmed by response to trigger point injection of local anesthetic. Once diagnosis is made, treatment ranges from conservative management to trigger point injection and in refractory cases, even surgery. This review provides an overview of CAWP, discusses the cost and implications of a missed diagnosis, compares somatic versus visceral innervation, describes the pathophysiology of nerve entrapment, and reviews the evidence behind available treatment modalities.

Abdominal wall, chest wall, or paraspinal regional anesthetic techniques—consensus scope and future directions are outlined, noting that “Abdominal wall, chest wall, or paraspinal regional anesthetic techniques that have names warranting further research” are highlighted, the Delphi approach is acknowledged as “a recognized method for achieving consensus,” yet “there are no clear methodological guidelines for the use of the Delphi method.” The authors state that “This project did not seek to examine the clinical utility of any of the regional approaches,” and that it “should not be viewed as definitive, but rather a starting point and template for future developments.” Guidance for innovation is provided as “Moving forward, clinicians developing novel regional anesthetic approaches should consider fundamental principles,” and regarding nomenclature bases “it remains unclear whether this should be based on fascial planes, related muscles, other anatomical landmarks, or indeed target neural structures. This should be an area of future investigation.” The collaboration also notes “we would also aim for a similar process to be undertaken to achieve consensus in nomenclature and descriptions for upper and lower extremity regional anesthetic techniques,” and concludes that “harmonization and standardization of nomenclature will potentially improve teaching and the research of the regional anesthetic techniques.”

### Abdominal wall pain: clinical evaluation, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^187157ea]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall pain is often mistaken for intra-abdominal visceral pain, resulting in expensive and unnecessary laboratory tests, imaging studies, consultations, and invasive procedures. Those evaluations generally are nondiagnostic, and lingering pain can become frustrating to the patient and clinician. Common causes of abdominal wall pain include nerve entrapment, hernia, and surgical or procedural complications. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is the most common and frequently missed type of abdominal wall pain. This condition typically presents with acute or chronic localized pain at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis that worsens with position changes or increased abdominal muscle tension. Abdominal wall pain should be suspected in patients with no symptoms or signs of visceral etiology and a localized small tender spot. A positive Carnett test, in which tenderness stays the same or worsens when the patient tenses the abdominal muscles, suggests abdominal wall pain. A local anesthetic injection can confirm the diagnosis when there is 50% postprocedural pain improvement. Point-of-care ultrasonography may help rule out other abdominal wall pathologies and guide injections. The management of abdominal wall pain depends on the etiology. Reassurance and patient education can be helpful. Local injection with an anesthetic and a corticosteroid is an effective treatment for anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome, with an overall response rate of 70% to 99%. For refractory cases that require more than two injections, surgical neurectomy generally resolves the pain.

### The abdominal wall: an overlooked source of pain [^13dcf348]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

When abdominal pain is chronic and unremitting, with minimal or no relationship to eating or bowel function but often a relationship to posture (i.e., lying, sitting, standing), the abdominal wall should be suspected as the source of pain. Frequently, a localized, tender trigger point can be identified, although the pain may radiate over a diffuse area of the abdomen. If tenderness is unchanged or increased when abdominal muscles are tensed (positive Carnett's sign), the abdominal wall is the likely origin of pain. Most commonly, abdominal wall pain is related to cutaneous nerve root irritation or myofascial irritation. The pain can also result from structural conditions, such as localized endometriosis or rectus sheath hematoma, or from incisional or other abdominal wall hernias. If hernia or structural disease is excluded, injection of a local anesthetic with or without a corticosteroid into the pain trigger point can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^9e34d9de]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The bladder may be pressurized directly by detrusor contraction, or indirectly by transmitted abdominal pressure. As the bladder fills, increasing activity on pelvic afferents in response to increasing wall stress triggers efferent firing with resultant detrusor contraction, and bladder pressure begins to rise. Shortly thereafter, the abdominal wall is activated and concurrently the IPHFO/flow phase begins, possibly in response to urine being forced into the proximal urethra at a threshold bladder pressure against the closed rhabdosphincter. This timing suggests that abdominal pressure due to the voiding-associated abdominal response may thus play a part in initiating and supporting the IPHFO/flow phase of micturition.

It has been demonstrated that the voiding-associated EMG activity depends upon pelvic nerve afferents. Bladder pelvic nerve activity decreases during the IPHFO phase, possibly in response to decreasing volume, with a change in efferent activity to a bursting pattern, and thus detrusor-generated bladder pressure may decrease. The persistence of the abdominal activity throughout the IPHFO/flow phase despite decreasing bladder afferent activity is consistent with afferent signalling leading to the abdominal response arising in the urethra rather than the bladder. The voiding-associated abdominal wall response may therefore provide an important self-sustaining quantum of driving pressure at a moment when detrusor-generated pressure is declining, and thus maintain urine flow during EUS relaxation. According to this hypothesis, failure of abdominal pressurization (as in the BTX group) results in a degradation of the IPHFO phase as the bladder empties, decreasing per-void volume and impairing flow. Our findings are consistent with such a functional role of abdominal wall contraction as part of normal voiding. Removing the supplemental pressure supplied by the abdominal wall without disturbing the rhabdosphincter activity decreased voiding efficiency as evidenced by a decreased per-void volume and flow rate.

True neurogenic neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract

Abdominal neurogenic neoplasms usually follow the distribution of the sympathetic ganglia along paraspinal areas or arise from the adrenal medulla or the organ of Zuckerkandl. Other abdominal sites can be involved including the urinary bladder, bowel wall, abdominal wall and gallbladder.

Neurogenic neoplasms associated with NF1 include neurofibromas, ganglioneuromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs).

### Distribution of nerve fibers in abdominal wall endometriosis and their clinical significance [^a7306910]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first time to observe the distribution of nerve fiber in abdominal wall endometriotic lesions. The increased innervation of AWE gives us another explanation of the typical experience a palpable mass with cyclic or noncyclic pain. Besides the mechanical and thermal irritation caused by cyclic congestion, they may also combine with hyperalgesia, which is an exacerbation of pain or initiation of painful sensation to a non-painful stimulus. In fact, EMs have been proposed to be a consequence of neurological dysfunction, and possibly involved in a process of denervation and reinnervation.The infiltrating of endometrium in abdominal wall subcutaneous tissue might impair the local nerve fiber and lead to a series of denervation and reinnervation process.

Our study has limitations. The sample size was modest, pain severity assessments were subjective, and we only considered certain immunoreactive nerve fibers. It is essential to understand that pain in EMs may result from a combination of factors, including hormonal interactions, angiogenesis, neurotransmitters, inflammation, and others. Further comprehensive studies could provide a more nuanced understanding of these mechanisms.

### Chronic abdominal discomfort syndrome (CADS): a narrative review of treatment strategies [^896665f4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome (CADS) is a diagnostic subclassification of Chronic Abdominal Pain that was proposed in the article “Chronic Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome (CADS): Defining and Discussing a Novel Diagnosis”.Approximately, 1–2% of adults live with some form of chronic abdominal discomfort.The diagnosis is supported by signs or symptoms across three domains (clinical criteria, diagnostic criteria and functional criteria) having greater than fifty percent positive clinical criteria and one-hundred percent positive diagnostic and functional criteria. Clinical criteria include items such as abdominal bloating, nausea and vomiting. Diagnostic criteria include no findings of acute pathology and good response to anesthetic blocks. Functional criteria are measured through the Short-Form 36 survey showing decrease in daily function (Figure 1). Individuals suffering from CADS often endorse histories of previous abdominal surgery with or without potential neuronal injury secondary to entrapment, adhesions or neuroma formation. These patients may concomitantly carry additional gastrointestinal diagnosis comorbidities and report symptoms consistent with those of chronic pancreatitis, suffer from abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting or dyspepsia.

Figure 1 
A proposed neuromodulatory approach to visceral pain predominant patient presentation.

In this review, we explore treatment modalities and propose a treatment algorithm for CADS. As outlined in the first paper, “Chronic Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome (CADS): Defining and Discussing a Novel Diagnosis”,the nerves involved in the pathophysiology of CADS include the visceral sympathetic, parasympathetic and spinal nerves that ascend via the spinal cord up to the brain.

It is important to recognize the sympathetic ganglia as a collection of sympathetic fibers arranged in a chain on either side of the vertebral column.This network of fibers extends the region of sympathetic fibers beyond spinal cord levels T1-L2. These fibers can merge together to form prevertebral ganglia which are located along the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta, eventually extending to innervate structures such as smooth muscle and glands.

It is also important to note the phenomenon of referred pain, which occurs secondary to the close proximity of the visceral and somatic fibers within the abdomen. Clinically, this manifests as pain from internal organs referring to sites on the body wall and elsewhere.Understanding the basic neural pathway of the abdomen and its contents is imperative, as this provides therapeutic targets. Viscero-visceral, viscero-somatic, viscero-cutaneous chronic pain convergence may be confusing for the patients, and frequently, discovering the source of abdominal pain may difficult for clinicians. Furthermore, approximately 50% of abdominal pains remains to be of unknown source.

### Paradoxical abdominal wall movement in bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [^d0388886]. Practical Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man gave a 6-month history of progressive dyspnoea and orthopnoea. During breathing, his abdominal muscles showed paradoxical movement and he rapidly and reproducibly developed difficulty breathing when lying supine. The most likely explanation was severe weakness or paralysis of both hemidiaphragms. This was confirmed with electrophysiology and ultrasonography. Extensive investigation identified no underlying cause, suggesting this is a case of bilateral isolated phrenic neuropathy. We present a video showing how easily bilateral diaphragmatic palsy can be detected clinically through identifying paradoxical abdominal wall movement.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: a narrative review [^ced9f16a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic bloating and abdominal distension are common and highly bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the differential diagnoses for bloating and distension are broad, these symptoms are frequently associated with disorders of the gut-brain interaction. Functional abdominal bloating may be a result of visceral hypersensitivity, whereas abdominal distension seems to be a somatic behavioral response associated with abdominophrenic dyssynergia, featuring diaphragmatic contraction and abdominal wall relaxation. We review the available literature regarding abdominophrenic dyssynergia and comment on its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and avenues to address in the near future.

### Novel implantation technique for thoracoabdominal peripheral nerve stimulation via a transversus abdominal plane approach for treatment of chronic abdominal pain [^85e32325]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A non-tined lead would theoretically allow for easier revisions if revisions are needed, without extensive abdominal wall dissection secondary to scar tissue development. This is particularly pertinent in the subset of CAP patients who have thinning of the muscles in the abdominal wall secondary to surgery or nutritional issues related to their gastrointestinal pathology. An additional consideration is that current tined leads are mostly four contact leads, decreasing potential nerve catchment with stimulation. A tined lead could be considered for use with the potential benefit of greater lead securement with less incidence of lead migration though it would make lead revisions more challenging. However, this would be a risk benefit decision individualized per patient made by the implanting physician.

CAP is a common and difficult to treat entity that affects many individuals globally. Treatment depends on the diagnosis, and often the etiology of the pain cannot be defined. Even with a diagnosis and optimal management of the disease state, there may not be an effective treatment for the pain. When conservative medical management fails, interventions may be an option to address the patient’s pain. However, the efficacy of these interventions varies and may carry a risk profile that may preclude their use in some patients. In these patient populations with neuropathic characteristics, thoracoabdominal nerve peripheral neuromodulation via a TAP approach may represent an option.

### Spine injury [^72bcbcba]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Neurogenic bowel dysfunction after acute spinal cord injury (SCI)—in the first few days after acute SCI, patients are at risk for ileus because the gut wall is hypotonic and unresponsive to stimuli, colonic transit time is severely prolonged during the initial weeks post injury, and more than 80 percent of individuals with SCI experience some degree of bowel dysfunction. The most commonly reported symptoms include constipation (32 to 56 percent), fecal incontinence (27 to 86 percent), abdominal distension or discomfort (22 to 33 percent), and the need for digital stimulation or manual disimpaction (66 percent), with symptoms more severe in complete SCI than incomplete SCI. Constipation due to neurogenic bowel dysfunction can contribute to autonomic dysreflexia when SCI is at or above T6. Level-specific patterns include increased external anal sphincter tone and increased rectal tone and contractility from injuries above the S2 level that lead to reflex defecation, whereas injuries at or below the S2 level can cause reduced external anal sphincter tone and reduced rectal tone and contractility leading to fecal impaction and incontinence; the physiological terms reflexic and areflexic bowel are commonly used, and individuals with injuries above S2 may show no sign of reflexive bowel function while others with injuries at the conus medullaris or cauda equina may demonstrate some residual reflexive bowel function.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^b8aa52bd]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Rat voiding may thus be considered as a pressurized vessel releasing its contents against an intermittently relaxing resistance. Abdominal pressurization caused by the voiding-associated abdominal wall contraction may be required in this process. We therefore hypothesized that the abdominal wall activity observed during physiologic voiding is a necessary component of normal voiding in the rat.

Cystometric study either via transurethral or suprapubic catheter potentially alters the micturition reflex by direct stimulation of bladder or urethral afferents by the catheter or its placement, by supraphysiologic bladder filling rates, or by urothelial stimulation by non-urine infusion fluids. Our aim was to investigate the occurrence and necessity of voiding-associated abdominal wall activity during physiologic voiding in anesthetized rats. First, we proposed to design a free voiding model which would allow quantification of the abdominal wall EMG response and uroflow parameters during physiologic voiding in urethane-anesthetized rats with an uninstrumented lower urinary tract. Second, the necessity of the voiding-associated abdominal wall response for a normal uroflow response would be assessed by selective paralysis of the abdominal wall using botulinum toxin-A (BTX), thus removing the abdominal pressure contribution to voiding.

### Consensus guidelines for the use of peripheral nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic pain and neurological diseases: a neuron project from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^2d5c872a]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Transverse Abdominal Plane (TAP)

The transverse abdominal plane (TAP) is located between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles,and contains the thoracoabdominal nerves (arising from the seventh to eleventh intercostal, subcostal and first lumbar nerves)and ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves in the lower abdominal quadrants.The thoracoabdominal nerves have been implicated as providing somatic sensation to the abdominal wall (between the T5-T12 dermatome).As such, nerves within the TAP have been targeted by nerve blocks to treat chronic somatic and neuropathic abdominal pain.Similarly, the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves have been targeted in the past for nerve blocks to treat somatic and neuropathic pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy.Recently, utilization of a percutaneous, ultrasound-guided technique has been explored to place peripheral nerve stimulation leads in this region for the management of chronic abdominal pain. However, further investigation is needed to validate the safety and efficacy of this modality.(Level II-3 evidence, Grade C)

Low Back Pain

When considering modern PNS devices, chronic low back pain is probably the most well-studied PNS indication in the literature. Permanent devices targeting the multifidus muscle directly at the lumbar spine provide functional improvement in disability and prolonged pain relief in 5-year, longitudinal randomized trial data, Level I-A, Grade A.Furthermore, a direct target of the medial branch nerves innervating the multifidus muscle with temporary 60-day systems has shown efficacy beyond the treatment time. Prospective data supports that 60-day PNS treatment may lead to 12 months of 30–50% pain relief in patients with and without a previous thermal ablation.Current literature suggests Level I-B, Grade B moderate evidence for PNS and low back pain syndromes, primarily related to heterogenicity of technique, device, and study population.In a health economic study, PNS provides significant cost savings compared to conventional interventional therapies for chronic low back pain over a year of treatment.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^cb456f0c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathological factors—mechanosensitive primary sensory afferents in digestive tract walls detect contraction and distension via structures arranged in series with smooth muscle fibers so sensors are activated by either contraction or distension; neuronal cell bodies are in vagal nodose ganglia and dorsal root spinal ganglia, with mechanosensory information carried via dorsal root and vagal pathways; conscious pain and discomfort from the digestive tract reflect transmission in spinal afferents, vagal signals do not reach conscious sensation, and conscious perception persists after surgical vagotomy, presumably via spinal afferents to spinal cord and brain.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: a narrative review [^dd1a5435]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Central to the pathophysiology of APD is the abnormal coordination of the diaphragm and abdominal wall musculature. EMG obtained during abdominal distension, either spontaneous episodes of distension or induced distension, consistently demonstrates increased activity of the diaphragm (causing diaphragmatic descent) coupled with decreased postural tone of the anterior abdominal wall, as compared with basal conditions. Under normal conditions, the activity of the diaphragm is counterbalanced by the costal wall to preserve pulmonary function (i.e. diaphragmatic descent is compensated by the descent of the costal wall). By contrast, diaphragmatic descent during conditions of abdominal distension is associated with paradoxical elevation of the costal wall, driven by intercostal contraction, and resulting in hyperinflation of the chest. This condition functionally mimics status asthmaticus, explaining the shortness of breath characteristic of episodes of severe abdominal distension. Presumably, there is dysregulation along the gut-brain axis, which executes this abnormal response. Although the exact neurologic mechanism is not known, it has been hypothesized that APD develops as a maladaptive response to gastrointestinal pain or discomfort. Mechanosensors in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract feed information about luminal contents and distension to the brain, which processes the information and in turn influences viscerosomatic physiology, such as by regulating neural and muscular activity and coordinating chest and abdominal wall musculature. DGBIs commonly feature central sensitization and visceral hypersensitivity, and so it is possible that APD arises as a reaction to pain derived from the gastrointestinal tract. Dysautonomia or abnormal autonomic responses have also been documented in DGBIs and associated with psychopathology and trauma and additionally supported by the fact that diaphragmatic breathing can improve symptoms.

The pathophysiology of abdominal pain is important to consider as this can allude to therapeutic targets. Spinal nerves are the key conduction entity in the circuitry that informs the abdominal wall and its contents. Input from the posterior body wall is communicated via the posterior ramus, input from the anterior lateral regions of the body wall is communicated by the anterior ramus of the spinal nerve. The posterior and anterior ramus come together to form the spinal nerve which feeds into the sensory (spinal) ganglion, making its way to the posterior root and into the posterior horn of gray matter within the spinal cord. The signals are then transmitted to the brain.

Within the abdominal body wall lie important structures such as smooth muscle and glands, which require sympathetic innervation to function. The sympathetic system operates in a distinct pathway; their cell bodies reside in the lateral great horn of the spinal cord. These fibers exit the spinal cord via the anterior root, converge into the spinal nerve and course into the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia – A collection of sympathetic fibers arranged in a chain on either side of the vertebral column.Within the ganglion, sympathetic fibers can pass along – unmyelinated – back to the spinal nerve where they are then distributed to the anterior and posterior rami residing with somatic motor and sensory fibers. It is important to note that sympathetic innervation is limited to spinal cord levels T1-L2 therefore, some fibers within the ganglion run up-and-down the sympathetic trunk to spinal cord level beyond T1-L2.

Innervation inside of the abdominal cavity is primary to the viscera. Pain arising from the viscera is generally triggered by distention, ischemia and inflammation. It is relatively insensitive to stimuli such as cutting or burning.Often the pain is described as a diffuse, dull ache accompanied by occasional nausea, vomiting and transient changes in vital signs.

Sympathetic fibers coming off the spinal cord can also enter another collection of nerves known as the prevertebral ganglia. The course of those fibers is as follows: exit the spinal cord, pass through the paravertebral ganglion at the same level (without synapsing) and into the splanchnic nerves (sympathetic). The splanchnics then synapse in the prevertebral ganglia found along the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta. The three prevertebral ganglia are: the celiac ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion and inferior mesenteric ganglion.

### Central autonomic innervation of the kidney. what can we learn from a transneuronal tracing study in an animal model? [^ccab08ad]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Renal sympathetic innervation is involved in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis, modulation of renal secretion from juxtaglomerular cells, sodium resorption from renal tubular cells and renal hemodynamics. The understanding of central innervation and neuronal connections is important for studying the consequences of renal disease and surgical interventions compromising renal nerves.

Materials and Methods

A total of 38 individual adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for retrograde transneuronal mapping of the spinal cord and brain stem after pseudorabies virus (PRV) injection into the left kidney in 30 and control experiments in 8. After a survival time of 72, 96 or 120 hours the animals were sacrificed. Exploration of the abdominal and pelvic visceral organs was done, and the brain and spinal cord were harvested via dorsal laminectomy. After cutting on a freezing microtome the tissue was immunostained for PRV.

Results

After kidney injection inspection of the abdominal and pelvic cavity revealed an enlarged bladder with hemic urine. The urine was sterile and the bladder wall showed signs of neurogenic inflammation. Other organs were not affected. PRV positive cells were primarily found within the ipsilateral nucleus intermediolateralis of thoracic spinal cord segments T6 to T13. At the supraspinal level PRV positive cells were found within certain regions, namely the nuclei raphes, rostral ventromedial and ventrolateral medulla, A5 noradrenergic cell region, locus coeruleus and nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus.

Conclusions

This investigation demonstrates the anatomical basis for broad central sympathetic innervation of the kidney. The neurogenic inflammation within the spinal cord inherent to the PRV tracing method causes an inflammatory reaction within the bladder. This can be due to increased sympathetic nerve activity, followed by peripheral, neurogenically mediated inflammation.

### Muscle atrophy and preferential loss of myosin in prolonged critically ill patients [^755e0a89]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Muscle weakness contributes to prolonged rehabilitation and adverse outcome of critically ill patients. Distinction between a neurogenic and/or myogenic underlying problem is difficult using routine diagnostic tools. Preferential loss of myosin has been suggested to point to a myogenic component. We evaluated markers of muscle atrophy and denervation, and the myosin/actin ratio in limb and abdominal wall skeletal muscle of prolonged critically ill patients and matched controls in relation to insulin therapy and known risk factors for intensive care unit-acquired weakness.

Design

Secondary analysis of two large, prospective, single-center randomized clinical studies.

Setting

University hospital surgical and medical intensive care unit.

Patients

Critically ill patients and matched controls.

Interventions

Intensive care unit patients had been randomized to blood glucose control to 80-110 mg/dL with insulin infusion or conventional glucose management, where insulin was only administered when glucose levels rose above 215 mg/dL.

Measurements and Main Results

As compared with controls, rectus abdominis and vastus lateralis muscle of critically ill patients showed smaller myofiber size, decreased mRNA levels for myofibrillar proteins, increased proteolytic enzyme activities, and a lower myosin/actin ratio, virtually irrespective of insulin therapy. Increased forkhead box O1 action may have played a role. Most alterations were more severe in patients treated with corticosteroids. Duration of corticosteroid treatment, independent of duration of intensive care unit stay or other risk factors, was a dominant risk factor for a low myosin/actin ratio. The immature acetylcholine receptor subunit γ messenger RNA expression was elevated in vastus lateralis, independent of the myosin/actin ratio.

Conclusions

Both limb and abdominal wall skeletal muscles of prolonged critically ill patients showed downregulation of protein synthesis at the gene expression level as well as increased proteolysis. This affected myosin to a greater extent than actin, resulting in a decreased myosin/actin ratio. Muscle atrophy was not ameliorated by intensive insulin therapy, but possibly aggravated by corticosteroids.

### Limiting the fascia incision length in a DIEP flap: repercussion on abdominal wall morbidity [^b5af18cd]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The evolution from free muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap to deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap leads to less donor-site morbidity. However, rectus fascia is usually incised longitudinally from perforator(s) to iliac vessels, often exceeding 15 cm when including longitudinal muscle spreading. By using a limited fascia incisional (LFI-) technique, we try to diminish abdominal wall functional decrease.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients who underwent unilateral breast reconstructions using free DIEP-flap with limited fascia incision between December 2014 and October 2017 were included in the study. Each patient received a periumbilical electromyogram (EMG) preoperatively, at 6 and 14 weeks postoperatively. They were compared with 27 patients having unilateral breast reconstructions using classic free DIEP-flap, performed at the same department between November 2009 and May 2011.

Results

In our LFI-technique, one vertical (4 cm) incision is made where the pedicle exits the muscle. A second, oblique (3 cm) incision is made more distally where the pedicle runs into the iliac vessels. After release, the pedicle is tunneled through the incisions, leaving all fascia, and therefore muscle, intact. In the LFI-group small neurogenic changes were noticed in only 26% and 11% of the patients at, respectively, 6 and 14 weeks postoperatively. By contrast, in the control group, postoperative neurogenic deviations remained in 37% of the patients at 14 weeks postoperatively; significant different compared to the LFI-group.

Conclusion

This study shows the importance of preserving anterior rectus fascia. Nerve supply and abdominal rectus muscle function are less endangered using small segmental fascia incisions. We believe that our technique diminishes donor-site morbidity significantly and improves the postoperative recovery.

Breast reconstruction with either a pedicled or microvascular transfer of the transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous flap, whether with or without the muscle, is now the standard of care when patients choose an autologous form of reconstruction. Complications related to flap loss and abdominal wall weakness have been well described. Complications related to painful neuromas of the intercostal nerves, ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves have not been described previously. The diagnosis and treatment of pain related to neuromas of the abdominal wall is discussed in this paper.

### A pictorial essay of thoracic wall diseases: multiple pathologies in the same anatomical site [^6a317035]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Paragangliomas are rare tumors that arise from the paraganglia, small collections of neuroendocrine cells associated with the autonomic nervous system. When they occur in the chest wall, they are usually associated with the sympathetic chain. Functional paragangliomas can cause symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and headaches due to excess hormone secretion. On CT, paragangliomas usually appear as well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing soft-tissue masses. They may have a lobulated appearance a small calcification within. Bone erosion could be assessed. On MRI, their behavior is very similar to other neurogenic tumors, and after gadolinium administration, they show a significant enhancement due to their vascularity (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10 
Magnetic resonance is a promising imaging modality to confirm neurogenic tumors (like paragangliomas)—the internal fluid produces a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted MRI images (a). b A typical hypointense aspect on the T1-weighted image

Neuroblastoma is more frequent intra-abdominally than thoracic (retroperitoneal, paravertebral), in the chest wall often arises from the sympathetic chain, typically in the posterior mediastinum (the area behind the heart and between the lungs). It can extend into the chest wall muscles or adjacent structures. Typically, it is found in pediatric age or early adulthood. This tumor manifests itself as a mass in the chest cavity or within the chest wall, potentially involving the ribs, spinal column, or paraspinal region, and may or may not be accompanied by pain or other symptoms related to its activity. It presents a heterogeneous appearance with calcifications and necrosis in 80–90% of cases; on MRI images, it shows heterogeneous signal intensity (but usually low on T1 imaging and high on T2 sequences). The extent and localization of tumors originating from nerves are easily studied with MRI; sometimes it can involve pleural space.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are neoplasms of nerve that both infiltrate locally and metastasize. The mean age of incidence is 42 years old and it is related to type 1 neurofibromatosis. The internal architecture of the tumor may be heterogeneous. On T2-MRI imaging, it shows signal intensity markedly increased ; malignant transformation usually is associated with loss of target-like appearance on T2 images.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^9eb5dd10]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The perineal electrodes were not specifically placed into the rhabdosphincter, in order to minimize experimental impact on lower urinary tract afferent signalling. The lack of enhanced perineal muscle EMG activity during voiding may signify a lack of specific muscle activation during voiding as might be expected in the rhabdosphincter, although the change in waveform to a bursting activity with a frequency of approximately 5 Hz is consistent with IPHFO activity. This is consistent with voiding-associated perineal muscle activity observed previously. The slight decrease in voiding-associated EMG activity observed in the BTX prepared animals may be artifactual, representing a diminished signal intensity as the EMG electrodes were slightly pulled apart as the intact abdominal wall muscles contracted, or be the result of the altered waveform during voiding signifying a qualitative change in muscle activity rather than an quantitative increase in muscle activation.

Bladder pressurization against intermittent urethral resistance appears to be essential for efficient voiding in the rat. Rhabdosphincter EMG activity increases during bladder filling. The tonic resistance to urine flow against bladder pressurization persists until the intermittent pulsatile high frequency oscillatory (IPHFO) activity of the rhabdosphincter commences after initial bladder pressurization during a void. In female rats, urine flow is intermittently reduced (but not stopped) by the IPHFO contractions, producing momentary increases in bladder pressure and decreases in urethral pressure distal to the EUS. Elimination of this pressure differential at the EUS by proximal urethral restriction by ligature impairs voiding, suggesting that transmission of bladder pressure to the proximal urethra is important for the generation of urine flow. Elimination of rhabdosphincter function via lumbosacral motor nerve transection decreases voiding efficiency, an effect more pronounced in male rats (45% decrease) than in female rats (24% decrease). Intravenous d-tubocurarine also impairs voiding efficiency, and this effect has been ascribed solely to the resultant paralysis of rhabdosphincter and therefore elimination of the pulsatile phase of voiding, even though the additional paralysis of the abdominal wall may have contributed to these findings. All these findings suggest that normal voiding requires that the EUS generate resistance to urine flow and thus allow pressurization of the more proximal urethra and bladder.

### Twenty years of abdominal wall allotransplantation: a systematic review of the short-and long-term outcomes [^dffcfb74]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal wall allotransplantation following intestinal and multivisceral transplant procedures has proven to be successful in achieving adequate closure in patients in whom other techniques have proven inadequate. Thus far, the focus of these abdominal wall allotransplants has been on graft and overall patient survival following surgery and the implementation of immunosuppression. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of abdominal wall allotransplantation reported in the literature.

Methods

The PubMed database was queried, and 2595 articles were found. Search criteria used were "abdominal wall transplant" and "abdominal wall allotransplant." Of these, eight met inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Results

In the present study, eight publications were identified reporting abdominal wall allotransplants, for a total of 38 full-thickness abdominal wall allotransplantations performed worldwide. All studies reported abdominal wall allotransplantation in combination with visceral organ allotransplantation. Abdominal wall allotransplantations reported thus far have been nonneurotized. Abdominal wall allotransplantations have proven to be beneficial both in terms of abdominal wall closure and acting as a sentinel marker for rejection for underlying visceral organ allotransplantation. The success of abdominal wall allotransplants and their long-term survival has introduced the question of functionality and long-term durability. Cadaveric studies have shown that it is possible to neurotize abdominal wall allotransplants, and future direction toward neurotized abdominal wall allotransplantation requires tools to assess functional outcomes of these transplants.

Conclusions

Abdominal wall allotransplantation is an important reconstructive option when abdominal wall closure is challenging and should be considered in combination with visceral organ allotransplantations. There may be potential benefit in neurotizing the abdominal wall allotransplant for functional use, and future studies should aim to include functional outcomes.

### Robotic-assisted ileovesicostomy: initial results [^0230dbf2]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted ileovesicostomy in treating patients with a neurogenic bladder that is unsuitable for clean intermittent self-catheterization.

Methods

Robotic-assisted ileovesicostomy was performed using a 5-port approach for patients with a neurogenic bladder unable to tolerate clean intermittent or chronic bladder catheterization. Intraperitoneal operative steps included the creation of a full thickness U-shaped posterior bladder wall flap, intracorporeal harvesting of 15 cm of terminal ileum for use as a urinary conduit, and intracorporeal enterovesical anastomosis. Then, a counter incision was made over the marked stoma site on the abdominal wall, and bowel continuity was restored through an extracorporeal side-side anastomosis by the stomal incision. Ileovesicostomy stoma maturation was then completed.

Results

Eight robotic ileovesicostomies were performed. The median patient age was 53 years, body mass index was 29.0 kg/m(2), and preoperative bladder compliance was 5.7 mL/cm/H(2)O. The median blood loss was 100 mL. The median operative time was 330 minutes (range 240-420). No intraoperative complications occurred. Four patients had postoperative complications, including urethral incontinence (2) and ileus (2). No wound complications occurred. Bowel function returned after a median of 4.8 days after surgery, and median hospital stay was 7.7 days. Over a median 14-month follow-up, all patients had a functioning ileovesicostomy, and median postoperative residual bladder volume was 10 mL.

Conclusions

This study is the first to describe the robotic ileovesicostomy procedure. Robotic ileovesicostomy appears to be safe and effective, with low morbidity.

### Zoster sine herpete with thoracic motor paralysis temporally associated with thoracic epidural steroid injection [^fa73cbec]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus can occur when the immune system is weakened leading to the typical presentation seen with herpes zoster or shingles. In a small percentage of these patients, motor paralysis can be seen in the affected myotomal distribution. Zoster sine herpete, or shingles without the typical vesicular rash, is an uncommon variant of zoster. Systemic steroids are known to weaken the immune response. Two previous case reports have implicated epidural steroid injections as a precipitating cause of zoster. We present a case of serologically verified zoster sine herpete producing an abdominal wall bulge, which occurred 1 wk after thoracic epidural steroid injection. Electromyography documented the presence of abdominal wall denervation. Given the low incidence of serologically proven zoster sine herpete--especially with thoracic motor paralysis--and the equally rarely documented incidence of zoster related to epidural steroids, we present what we believe to be the first reported case of zoster sine herpete with a neuropathic abdominal wall bulge occurring in close temporal association to receiving epidural steroids.

### Use of capsaicin cream for abdominal wall scar pain (...) [^0f360e59]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: Drs. Suleiman and Johnston make a valuable contribution to the literature with their article “The Abdominal Wall: An Overlooked Source of Pain. ” 1 Neuromas forming in postsurgical scars are a common source of abdominal wall pain. The patient does not always correlate this pain with the scar, because the pain may not localize to the scar and because of a lack of temporal correlation with surgery. Scar sensitivity can be tested by applying a digital shearing force to the scar or by irritating it with an open paper clip. Capsaicin cream, available over the counter, offers an alternative for treating patients who fear syringes and trigger point injections. Capsaicin cream is readily absorbed and selectively binds to the vanilloid receptor subtype 1. Capsaicin-sensitive nerves are nociceptors that give rise to small diameter, unmyelinated C fibers.

The signal propagates to dorsal horn ganglia, evoking release of substance P, somatostatin, and calcitonin-gene related peptide. 2 With repeated exposure to painful stimuli, VR1 receptors become desensitized. This phenomenon underlies the seemingly paradoxical use of capsaicin as an analgesic. Capsaicin cream has been used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, interstitial cystitis, and many other forms of hyperalgesia and allodynia.
3. 1 such as rectus nerve entrapment and postherpetic neuralgia. Patients must be carefully instructed on the topical application of capsaicin. Apply a very small amount to the scar (. in reply: We thank Dr. McPartland for sharing his experiences with using capsaicin cream for the treatment of pain in abdominal wall scars. This use of capsaicin has not been reported previously in the medical literature. However, it makes perfect sense to expect capsaicin to be helpful for this indication.

Capsaicin may also be useful in other types of abdominal wall pain in which local irritation of nerve endings may be responsible for the pain. Use of capsaicin is a simple and inexpensive intervention, and there seems little to lose in trying it if other measures fail.

### Avoiding complications in abdominal wall surgery: a mathematical model to predict the course of the motor innervation of the rectus abdominis [^863b1fcf]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Ever since its introduction, the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap has become the mainstay of autologous breast reconstruction. However, concerns regarding donor site morbidity due to the breach of abdominal wall musculature integrity soon followed. Muscle-sparing techniques, eventually eliminating the muscle from the flap all-together with the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap, did not eliminate the problem of abdominal wall weakness. This led to the conclusion that motor innervation might be at fault. Studies have shown that even in the presence of an intact rectus abdominis muscle, and an intact anterior rectus sheath, denervation of the rectus abdominis muscle results in significant abdominal wall weakness leading to superior and inferior abdominal bulges, and abdominal herniation. Our aim was to establish a mathematical model to predict the location of the motor innervation to the rectus abdominis muscle, and thus provide surgeons with a tool that will allow them to reduce abdominal morbidity during deep inferior epigastric artery perforator and free muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous surgery. We dissected 42 cadaveric hemiabdomens and mapped the course of the thoracolumbar nerves. We then standardized and analyzed our findings and presented them as a relative map which can be adjusted to body type and dimensions. Our dissections show that the motor innervation is closely related to the lateral vascular supply. Thus, when possible, we support the preferred utilization of the medial vascular supply, and the preservation of the lateral supply and motor innervation.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^7801665c]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most sensitive diagnostic test to help confirm the diagnosis? 
A. CT abdomen and pelvis
B. Electromyography (EMG)
C. Skin biopsy
D. Herpes serology
E. MRI abdomen

Answers: 
A. CT abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. A CT scan may be done to exclude a true abdominal hernia or other intra-abdominal pathology. However, it is not necessary, and is not the most sensitive test. Our patient’s imaging showed a small incidental umbilical hernia with no evidence of lateral wall defect (Fig 3).
B. Electromyography (EMG) – Correct. Postherpetic pseudohernia is a motor complication of herpes zoster resulting from ventral nerve root denervation, leading to paralysis of the ipsilateral abdominal wall musculatureEMG is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality that can detect this acute denervation, supporting the clinical diagnosis.Nerve conduction studies can also be combined with EMG to rule out other neuropathies; in cases of pseudohernia, nerve conduction studies are often normal. In this case, electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary given the close temporal correlation between rash onset and abdominal protrusion.
C. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A biopsy would reveal patchy epidermal or dermal melanosis consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and not provide additional diagnostic information. Of note, a skin biopsy may be used to aid the diagnosis of a small fiber neuropathy; however, postherpetic pseudohernia is due to motor neuropathy.
D. Herpes serology – Incorrect. Serologic testing is not reliable for diagnosing acute herpes zoster; varicella zoster virus IgM may show delayed or cross-reactive responses, and varicella zoster virus IgG only indicates past exposure.
E. MRI abdomen – Incorrect. Although MRI abdomen may show increased T2/short-tau inversion recovery signal intensity in the abdominal wall muscles suggestive of acute denervation, it is not a first line diagnostic modality.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^7e99909e]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that intra-abdominal pressurization due to the voiding-associated abdominal wall response is a normal and necessary component of voiding in urethane-anesthetized female rats. While the voiding-associated EMG response appears to be similar to a VMR, several differences exist. The abdominal wall activation during voiding is a physiologic response, in contrast to the VMR which by definition is a response to noxious stimulus. We have observed the voiding-associated response to be associated with urine flow rather than bladder pressurization during transurethral cystometry, whereas the VMR is reported to be a response to sudden bladder pressurization.

The increase of abdominal wall EMG intensity during voiding suggests that the voiding-associated abdominal wall contraction produces an increment of intra-abdominal pressure which contributes to the total bladder pressure available to drive urine flow. Cruz et al. demonstrated abdominal wall EMG activation in several points in the abdominal wall during voiding, including the oblique muscle groups and the rectus abdominis. Logic dictates that such universal abdominal wall EMG activity signifying muscle contraction will be accompanied by an elevation of intra-abdominal pressure, and this has been observed. Botulinum toxin eliminates neuromuscular signalling, thus the absence of a voiding-associated EMG response in the BTX-prepared rats signifies a lack of voiding-associated contraction of the rectus abdominis. This longitudinal segment of the abdominal wall thus remains compliant and therefore prevents (or at least minimizes) pressurization resulting from the remaining abdominis oblique contraction. Our methodology sought only to qualitatively evaluate the described voiding-associated abdominal pressure wave and its elimination by BTX preparation. The positive pressure increase observed in all three tested rats in response to abdominal squeeze confirms the ability of the technique to detect the presence of a pressure increase accompanying EMG activity, as a failure of the method (for example, an insufficient fluid column would place the catheter tip against a viscus surface) would eliminate the ability to detect a pressure change. The lack of degradation of hemodynamic parameters in the BTX-prepared animals is consistent with the observed changes in urine flow rate and per-void volume being due to the lack of abdominal pressurization rather than systemic toxicity related to botulinum toxin.

Chronic pelvic pain initial evaluation—A detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal examination, are recommended; physical findings that increase the likelihood of neuromusculoskeletal contributors include pelvic floor muscle tenderness and abdominal wall tenderness that reproduce the patient’s pain. The most critical portions are a detailed medical, surgical, and gynecologic history and a thorough physical examination, and self-administered screening forms completed before the visit can optimize care; a systematic history should include a detailed chronology of symptoms, a review of previous treatments, and information on pain aggravators and alleviators related to sexual activity, menstruation, physical activity, and urinary and gastrointestinal function. The medical history should include specific chronology, triggers, and treatments of pain; a review of all medical diagnoses, surgical procedures and findings, obstetric details, medications, and allergies; and psychosocial factors, with the success or failure of previous treatment attempts noted. Focusing the physical examination on the abdominal and pelvic neuromusculoskeletal system with inclusion of a visceral examination is stated to address most etiologies and is highly likely to yield an accurate diagnosis; evaluation should include palpation of the lower back, sacroiliac joints, pubic symphysis, as well as the abdomen and genitalia.

### The abdominal compartment syndrome: evolving concepts and future directions [^163b2293]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding the subtle implications of modest IAH on all critically ill/injured patients and especially validating potential therapeutic interventions with new sound evidence remain our biggest challenges. A new emphasis will be placed upon embracing those engaged in the emerging surgical subspecialty of abdominal wall reconstruction. Ultimately, complete integration of these findings in the management of patients with relevant abdominal conditions affected by IAH remains the final goal.

In conclusion, IAH and ACS have evolved from poorly understood and inconsistently diagnosed disorders. Overall, ACS is decreasing through early recognition and directed management of IAH. In this context, WSACS – the Abdominal Compartment Society will continue its educational activities, support research, and promote evidence-based guidelines in order to continue to improve outcome in critically ill patients.

### Spectrum of gastrointestinal lesions of neurofibromatosis type 1: a pictorial review [^323fc951]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Overview of NF1 disease

Many of the clinical and neoplastic manifestations of NF1 are related to age. The most common clinical manifestations are “café au lait” spots, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules (defined as pigmented hamartomatous nodular aggregates of dendritic melanocytes affecting the iris) and axillary or inguinal freckling (increased number of freckles, small circular spots on the skin that are darker than the surrounding skin, because of deposits of melanin) (Fig. 1). Abdominopelvic involvement in NF1 is primarily extraperitoneal, mostly detected in the abdomino-pelvic wall and lumbosacral plexus.

Fig. 1 
Different cutaneous manifestations of NF1 including: (a) plexiform neurofibroma in the face; (b, c) neurofibromas; (d) “café au lait” spots

Abdominal neoplasms are frequent in patients with NF1 because of the mutation in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17q11.2. NF1 neurofibromin, a tumour suppressor protein, is involved in the regulation of several cellular signalling pathways responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation. The severity of this disorder ranges from benign (75%) to very aggressive conditions (25%). The localised and plexiform neurofibromas of the paraspinal and sacral region are the most common abdominal manifestations in NF1.

Visceral abdominal neoplasms occurring in patients with NF1 fall into five categories of neoplasms, presented in Table 1 : neurogenic tumours, neuroendocrine tumours, non-neurogenic gastrointestinal stromal tumours, embryonal tumours and miscellanea. Benign and malignant neoplasms may arise in the abdomen in both paediatric and adult patients with NF1.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^f333fd80]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Normal voiding behavior in urethane-anesthetized rats includes contraction of the abdominal wall striated muscle, similar to the visceromotor response (VMR) to noxious bladder distension. Normal rat voiding requires pulsatile release of urine from a pressurized bladder. The abdominal wall contraction accompanying urine flow may provide a necessary pressure increment for normal efficient pulsatile voiding. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and necessity of the voiding-associated abdominal wall activity in urethane-anesthetized female rats

Methods

A free-voiding model was designed to allow assessment of abdominal wall activity during voiding resulting from physiologic bladder filling, in the absence of bladder or urethral instrumentation. Physiologic diuresis was promoted by rapid intravascular hydration. Intercontraction interval (ICI), voided volumes and EMG activity of the rectus abdominis were quantified. The contribution of abdominal wall contraction to voiding was eliminated in a second group of rats by injecting botulinum-A (BTX, 5 U) into each rectus abdominis to induce local paralysis. Uroflow parameters were compared between intact free-voiding and BTX-prepared animals.

Results

Abdominal wall response is present in free voiding. BTX preparation eliminated the voiding-associated EMG activity. Average per-void volume decreased from 1.8 ml to 1.1 ml (p < 0.05), and reduced average flow from 0.17 ml/sec to 0.11 ml/sec (p < 0.05). Intercontraction interval (ICI) was not changed by BTX pretreatment.

Conclusion

The voiding-associated abdominal wall response is a necessary component of normal voiding in urethane anesthetized female rats. As the proximal urethra may be the origin of the afferent signaling which results in the abdominal wall response, the importance of the bladder pressure increment due to this response may be in maintaining a normal duration intermittent pulsatile high frequency oscillatory (IPHFO)/flow phase and thus efficient voiding. We propose the term Voiding-associated Abdominal Response (VAR) for the physiologic voiding-associated EMG/abdominal wall response, to distinguish it from the visceromotor response (VMR) to noxious bladder distension.

### Functional genetic screen to identify interneurons governing behaviorally distinct aspects of drosophila larval motor programs [^8d8d95c5]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We identified a number of distinct behavior phenotypes elicited by activation of sparse subsets of neurons in the larval brain and VNC (Figure 5), but this is by no means an exhaustive exploration of TrpA1-induced larval phenotypes. As noted previously, roughly half of the statistically slow genotypes did not show any of the ‘overt’ phenotypic categories described in this paper. To fully characterize the remaining lines by phenotype would require advanced annotation of crawl dynamics and quantification of additional parameters. For example, upon high magnification observation of the slow hits, many simply appeared slow. Careful analysis by measuring wave duration and frequency may reveal additional phenotypes. Indeed, using refined analysis we investigated a slow line (R11F02), and discovered it was due to a defect in maintaining left-right symmetric muscle contraction amplitude during forward locomotion.

Figure 5 
Summary of phenotypic groups. (A) Control larvae have free range of motion, crawling for bouts of forward or reverse (left, blue box). TrpA1-induced phenotypes bound in red (from left to right): (B) Rigid paralysis: complete loss of mobility with all segments of the larval body wall muscles fully contracted. (C) Immobile: complete loss of mobility with body wall segments often lacking tone, appearing smoothened and the larvae becoming languid and lengthened. (D) Delayed paralysis: gradual slowing of crawl speed over time until finally becoming immobile with tonic contraction of body wall muscles. (E) Head cast: head sweeps back and forth; can occur with thoracic/abdominal paralysis or with normal thoracic/abdominal peristaltic movements. (F) Reverse: only backward peristaltic movements. (G) Feeding: constant digging around with mouth hooks and attempts to ingest substrate. Frequent rhythmic ingestion of gaseous bubbles can be observed. (H) Dorsal contraction: head and tail is raised off substrate. (I) Ventral contraction: head and tail are curled ventrally toward each other.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a safe and effective bridge for enteral nutrition in neurological or non-neurological conditions [^3c5ff3b1]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is one of the most commonly used methods for nutritional support in patients who are unable to take food orally. Traditional surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy, and laparoscopic gastrostomy are the alternatives. The most common indication is neurogenic dysphagia followed by obstructive causes such as head and neck tumors. Ethically justified and clinically comprehensive guidelines should be followed during the decision-making process for PEG tube placement. A limited life expectancy; technical difficulties, such as the inability to bring the anterior gastric wall in apposition to the abdominal wall; or pharyngeal/esophageal obstruction, which compromise tube insertion, peritonitis, and uncorrectable coagulopathy are absolute contraindications. The "pull method" is the first described and still the most performed technique of PEG tube placement. The procedure is simple, safe, and effective and fulfills all requirements to provide an ideal route for nutritional support. This article summarizes the reported experience on PEG in the current literature and discusses its utility in patients with neurological conditions.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat? [^ddaa73dc]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 presents the average values of the assessed parameters for each experimental group. As these animals voided in response to physiologic bladder filling, the data from the intact animals represent normal voiding parameters in urethane-anesthetized female rats.

Figure 1 demonstrates EMG and intraperitoneal pressure changes accompanying voiding in intact and botulinum toxin-A pretreated animals. A significant increase in rectus abdominis EMG activity during voiding in the intact animals was observed. Pretreatment of the rectus abdominis muscle with botulinum toxin-A eliminated EMG evidence of abdominal wall activity, and the EMG activity ratio was significantly less than in the intact free voiding group. A positive abdominal pressure deflection was observed to accompany voiding in the intact rat (total 3 voids), and there was neither visible evidence on the abdominal pressure tracing nor calculated pressure differences in any BTX void (total 13 voids) despite pressure deflections in response to manual squeezing. Per-void volume and average urine flow were significantly decreased by BTX pretreatment.

Perineal EMG intensity level was variable among rats during voiding, with the average integrated value slightly less than unity, and did not differ between groups. While not subjected to more detailed analysis, the waveform of the perineal EMG signal changed during urine flow from a tonic discharge to bursting activity occurring at approximately 0.2 second intervals as shown in Figure 2, in both groups of rats. ICI, blood pressure, and VVR were unchanged following BTX pre-treatment.

### MRI findings of postherpetic abdominal wall pseudohernia: a case report [^d07ab6ca]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. Although infrequent, simultaneous damage to the anterior horn cells or anterior nerve roots at the same level may result in motor neuropathy. When motor involvement is localized in the abdominal wall, a pseudohernia may be the clinical presentation. We report a case of abdominal wall post-herpetic pseudohernia, with clinical, ultrasound and MRI correlation. MRI demonstrated increased T2/STIR signal intensity in the abdominal wall muscles, suggesting acute denervation. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of postherpetic pseudohernia with acute denervation demonstrated on MRI.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^66afa9cd]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics—proposed mechanisms for OAB and DO include neurogenic and myogenic hypotheses and roles for urothelial and afferent pathways. The neurogenic hypothesis attributes DO to nerve-mediated excitation of the detrusor muscle, while the myogenic hypothesis suggests that uninhibited contractions occur from spontaneous excitation within the bladder smooth muscle and propagation through the bladder wall. The afferent Aδ-fibers are thought to convey bladder filling information and respond to passive bladder distention and active detrusor contractions, the C-fibers respond to noxious chemical irritation or thermal stimuli, and inappropriately high activity of any of these fibers may contribute to OAB.

### Bladder perforation in augmentation cystoplasty during urodynamic investigation: a case report and review of the literature [^297bfa60]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bladder rupture is a known complication of augmentation cystoplasty. We report the second case of bladder rupture during filling cystometry many years after bladder augmentation and the first case occurring in a patient with an autoaugmentation cystoplasty. In addition, the management and outcome for a bladder perforation in an autoaugmentation cystoplasty will be discussed.

Case

A 20-year-old male with a history of an L4 myelomeningocele underwent an autoaugmentation cystoplasty for neurogenic bladder dysfunction and decreased bladder wall compliance five years previously. He self catheterized four times daily. During filling cystometry, detrusor pressure increased to 60 cm H(2)O with 300 mL filling. Detrusor pressure then rapidly decreased to 20 cm H(2)O without evidence of external leakage. The infusion was immediately stopped and X-ray showed intraperitoneal leakage of contrast material. Serial abdominal examination demonstrated worsening abdominal distension. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 cm perforation within the autoaugment portion of the bladder.

Conclusion

An autoaugmentation cystoplasty improves bladder compliance and capacity with the use of native urothelial tissue. Although perforation after autoaugmentation has not been previously reported, caution must be used during urodynamic evaluation in patients with decreased bladder wall compliance and augmentation cystoplasty.

### Histologic and functional outcomes of small intestine submucosa-regenerated bladder tissue [^5313c0f6]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder augmentation is used to reduce the high bladder pressure that develops in patients with neurogenic bladder to protect the upper urinary system. Gastrointestinal segment augmentation cystoplasty is associated with a number of complications, such as mucus production, stone formation, leakage and rupture, fibrosis, electrolyte imbalance, and development of bowel obstruction. All of these complications, which adversely affect the quality of life, give patients pause when offered a renal rescue operation. In view of these disadvantages, alternative patches have been investigated. One of the most promising alternative methods is tissue engineering in combination with surgical construction [-].

Small intestine submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, non-immunogenic, biodegradable, xenogeneic, collagen-based material that is derived from the submucosal layer of porcine small intestine. SIS has demonstrated regenerative capacities in multiple organ systems, including the aorta, vena cava, ligaments, tendons, abdominal wall, and skin. The aim of our study was to determine the functional and histologic characteristics of SIS (Cook-SIS Technology, [Indiana, USA]) as bladder wall replacement in a rabbit augmentation model.

### A laparoscopic approach to parastomal hernia repair with Re-siting of urinary stoma [^ac4be075]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Parastomal and ventral hernias are common complications in patients with continent catheterizable channels or incontinent urinary diversions. Patients with neurogenic bladder are at particularly high risk due to weak abdominal wall musculature, and hernia repair often requires resiting of their stoma. While parastomal hernia repair with urinary stoma resiting has acceptable long-term success rates, it often necessitates a laparotomy which is associated with significant morbidity.

Objective

To describe a novel approach to combined laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair with resiting of the urinary stoma in patients with neurogenic bladder. The video will outline the surgical steps and pitfalls.

Materials and Methods

The case begins laparoscopically or robotically with adhesiolysis to dissect out the subfascial portion of the channel and the parastomal hernia. The subfascial portion of the channel is dissected out to the anterior abdominal wall, ensuring to preserve its mesentery. The abdomen is then desufflated and the suprafascial portion of the channel is dissected and the channel dropped into the abdomen. The hernia is then repaired laparoscopically using mesh and the channel is brought out through one of the laparoscopic port sites and matured to the skin.

Results

In our series of 4 patients, this technique was performed for 2 continent catheterizable channels and 2 incontinent diversions. One patient developed a hernia recurrence 7 months later which was repaired laparoscopically. In another, the stoma was successfully resited but the hernia was unable to be repaired laparoscopically due to dense adhesions. Continent and patency outcomes of the urinary stomas were 100% at a mean follow-up of 2 years.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair with resiting of the urinary stoma has similar long-term success rates compared to that of an open repair and avoids the morbidity of a laparotomy. This repair can be performed for catheterizable channels or incontinent diversions.

### Applied anterior abdominal (...) [^91f13046]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The nerves of the anterior abdominal wall are the ventral rami of the T6–L1 spinal nerves. . It was originally thought that the terminal branches of the T7–T12 ventral rami enter the lateral posterior rectus abdominis at a 90-degree angle through a fibrous neurovascular channel, progressing anteriorly through the muscle and anterior rectus sheath to become the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. Once those nerves reach the overlying aponeurosis, the nerves again change course at 90-degree angles beneath the skin. 16 A recent study indicates that their anatomy is far more complex. 17 The L1 nerve bifurcates into the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves; the iliohypogastric nerve pierces the external oblique aponeurosis superior to the superficial inguinal ring, whereas the ilioinguinal nerve passes through the inguinal canal to emerge through the superficial inguinal ring.

EXAMINATION The Carnett test is a validated and crucial tool in the evaluation of abdominal wall pain. Diagnostic trigger point injection with or without ultrasound guidance can help confirm the diagnosis of nerve entrapment. 10, 33–36 Ultrasound guidance is preferred because it provides needle visualization to avoid accidentally entering the abdominal cavity, and it helps the needle infiltrate the entire neurovascular channel in patients with suspected anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. In trigger point injection, 5 to 10 mL of 1% to 2% lidocaine is injected deep into the fascia and muscle at the point of maximal tenderness. Pain improvement of 50% or more confirms the diagnosis of abdominal wall pain. Pain resolution also occurs in about 20% to 30% of patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. 5 Trigger Point Injection. 37 The same is true for local interventions such as icing, massage, and topical analgesics.

As discussed previously, ultrasound-guided trigger point injection can confirm the diagnosis of abdominal wall pain caused by nerve entrapment while also providing symptom relief. Because of the relatively high failure rate of local anesthetic injection, a combination of local anesthetic and other agents such as corticosteroids, onabotulinumtoxinA, and phenol are sometimes used. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used and have a response rate of 70% to 99%.

### Pudendal nerve stimulation: a potential tool for neurogenic bowel dysfunction! [^552d59f7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Neurogenic bowel disease occurs after damage to the spinal cord, which affects the bowel's extrinsic innervation resulting in a lack of control of the colon with incontinence or constipation. To avoid more invasive procedures, sacral and pudendal nerve stimulation (PNS) have been recently considered as emerging treatment for patients with intractable constipation. In particular, PNS effects are thought to be secondary to interactions between the somatic and autonomic pathways within both the spinal cord and higher centers. Thus, PNS may be considered a potential tool in the treatment of neurogenic bowel dysfunction, even after a complete spinal cord damage.

### Neurogenic bowel dysfunction: clinical management recommendations of the neurologic incontinence committee of the fifth international consultation on incontinence 2013 [^e46ffd46]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of neurological disease and lower bowel dysfunction have been produced by the International Consultations on Incontinence (ICI). These are comprehensive guidelines, and were developed to have world-wide relevance.

Aims

To update clinical management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction from the recommendations of the 4th ICI, 2009.

Materials and Methods

A series of evidence reviews and updates were performed by members of the working group. The resulting guidelines were presented at the 2012 meeting of the European Association of Urology for consultation, and modifications applied to deliver evidence based conclusions and recommendations for the scientific report of the 5th edition of the ICI in 2013.

Results

The current review is a synthesis of the conclusions and recommendations, including the algorithms for initial and specialized management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction. The pathophysiology is described in terms of spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Assessment requires detailed history and clinical assessment, general investigations, and specialized testing, if required. Treatment primarily focuses on optimizing stool consistency and regulating bowel evacuation to improve quality of life. Symptom management covers conservative and interventional measures to promote good habits and assist stool evacuation, along with prevention of incontinence. Education is essential to achieving optimal bowel management.

Discussion

The review offers a pragmatic approach to management in the context of complex pathophysiology and varied evidence base.

### Novel implantation technique for thoracoabdominal peripheral nerve stimulation via a transversus abdominal plane approach for treatment of chronic abdominal pain [^cb2b4a98]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) is a diverse, pervasive pain condition affecting individuals globally, with an international prevalence estimated between 22% and 25%.Various diagnoses and etiologies are associated with CAP, including visceral disease, genetic conditions, spine diseases, abdominal wall conditions, cancer, and vascular disease.In the US alone, CAP constituted $10.2 billion dollars in healthcare expenditures attributed to diagnostic workups, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and ambulatory visits.A 2018 United States national survey indicated that 34.5% of all responders reported abdominal pain lasting more than 1 day and required urgent medical attention, while 61.5% of all respondents had discussed their abdominal pain with a healthcare professional. Of those seeking health care, 72.4% had undergone testing and/or imaging to evaluate their pain.Despite exhaustive work ups, the diagnosis in up to 40% of patients remains unknown.

Treatment of CAP is determined by the diagnosis and etiology. Disease state management optimization and surgical intervention in certain conditions may improve CAP. Medication management (oral analgesics, muscle relaxants, and antispasmodic medications) often results in inconsistent improvement.Interventional options have classically included sympathetic nerve blocks and/or neurolysis, intrathecal pump therapy, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation (SCS).The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been popularized for the management of CAP.Indicated conditions have varied from chronic post-operative abdominal pain, anterior cutaneous entrapment syndrome, and chronic neuropathic abdominal pain. Although effective, there exists a patient population for whom repeated blocks are not desired or the efficacy of TAP blocks is short lived, and a more permanent treatment approach, such as neuromodulation, is desired.

DRG or SCS may not be feasible for some patients due to anatomy or coexisting disease. In such patient populations, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) may represent an option. In this report, we detail a novel medial to lateral percutaneous thoracoabdominal nerve PNS via a TAP approach technique for implantation for neuropathic (non-visceral or gynecologic) CAP management, based on our real-world experience, with discussion of relevant anatomic considerations from cadaveric studies.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^f29e4de5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASRA-ESRA Delphi consensus on regional anesthesia nomenclature aimed to produce standardized nomenclature for abdominal wall, paraspinal, and chest wall regional anesthetic techniques and conducted an international consensus study using a three-round Delphi method, with strong consensus defined as ≥75% agreement and weak consensus as ≥70% to <75% agreement. Sixty expert Collaborators participated; after three rounds and clarification, harmonization, and introduction of novel nomenclature, strong consensus was achieved for the names of 16 block names with weak consensus for four names, and for anatomical descriptions, strong consensus was achieved for 19 blocks with weak consensus for one approach. We recommend using the consensus results in academic and clinical practice.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^4d170547]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulum is an outpouching of the intestinal wall, which can occur anywhere throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although majority of SBD can be asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally, it can also be associated with life-threatening complications such as infection, GI bleeding, and perforation. However, small bowel diverticula are often neglected in clinical practice due to its undiscerning location. Previous reports have estimated that the incidence of duodenal diverticula is approximately 7% in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

(ERCP) and up to 20% in an autopsy series. While, jejunoileal diverticula are rare and have a reported incidence of 0.5 to 2.3% based on radiographic series and 7% in autopsy studies. According to the pathogenesis, diverticulum can be divided into congenital diverticulum and acquired diverticulum. The most common congenital diverticulum is Meckel’s diverticulum, which is caused by incomplete atrophy of the vitelline duct during the embryonic period. Acquired diverticulum can be divided into primary and secondary. Primary diverticulum is related to increased intra-abdominal pressure and is often accompanied by visceral and neuropathy. The main formation mechanism is intestinal smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis, intestinal wall cystic dilatation, and weak muscle layer entering submucosa. While secondary diverticulum is often caused by the involvement of adjacent tissue inflammation. Intestinal dysmotility and high intraluminal pressure may also play a role. Familial aggregation have been reported in case series, suggesting a probable genetic disposition.

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^36ba99d8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Neuromusculoskeletal examination—chronic pelvic pain: Pelvic floor muscle tenderness or a positive forced flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) test correctly classified neuromusculoskeletal pain in 85% of patients in a small U.S. study, indicating potential benefit from physical therapy. The Carnett test is highlighted as the abdominal examination finding most associated with chronic pelvic pain; a positive result is defined by tenderness that worsens or does not improve during an abdominal wall muscle contraction, whereas a negative result indicates visceral pain that improves during the muscle contraction when the abdominal wall shields the viscera. A positive Carnett test result is independently associated with severity of chronic pelvic pain to a similar degree as pelvic floor muscle tenderness.

### Segmental abdominal wall paresis caused by lateral low thoracic disc herniation [^6f99e16d]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical, radiologic, and neurophysiologic description of 2 cases.

Objective

To describe 2 cases with spontaneous deep unilateral abdominal pain as the first symptom of thoracic disc herniation at a low thoracic vertebral level, further manifested by unilateral partial paresis of the obliquus abdominis muscle.

Summary Of Background Data

Clinical manifestation of lateral thoracic disc herniation with electrophysiologic results and conservative therapy as treatment of choice when spinal cord functions are preserved.

Methods

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral paramedian disc protrusions at T12-L1 in Patient 1 and foraminal herniation at T10-T11 and paramedian herniation at T11-T12 in Patient 2. Electromyography (EMG) and evoked potentials were investigated in the acute stage and after 6 months.

Results

Spontaneous activity on needle EMG confirmed axonal root impairment. Somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials were within normal limits and excluded spinal cord involvement. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and periradicular injection of steroids and local anesthetics rendered both patients pain-free. Normalization of muscle strength within 3 to 6 months was accompanied by EMG findings of reinnervation.

Conclusion

Lateral disc herniation causing compression of a thoracic root associated with unilateral segmental paresis of the abdominal wall is a rare condition. Despite EMG documentation of axonal root lesion, however, a purely conservative therapeutic approach may be considered treatment of choice in cases without spinal cord involvement.

### Visible abdominal distension in functional gut disorders: objective evaluation [^7463f57f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Abdominal distension is an important issue in clinical practice, because it affects a large proportion of patients with functional gut disorders and constitutes their most bothersome complaint.Frequently, patients complain of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distension (swollen abdomen with increase in girth) that appear as the day goes on and resolve after overnight rest. In between episodes, patients report their abdomen going back to normal (no visible distension) or some residual degree of mild distension.

Visible abdominal distension is frequently, but not necessarily, associated with sensation of increased abdominal pressure/tension (abdominal bloating), but not all sensation of bloating is accompanied by visible distension. The terms distension and bloating are sometimes used indistinctively, but if properly questioned, the patients clearly identify whether they are referring to visible distension, which is the object of the present study, or to sensation of increased abdominal pressure, and this distinction is key to understanding and management of their complaint. Epidemiological studies distinguishing visible distention and bloating are scarce. A large study in the general population reported that that about half of the subjects complaining of bloating also experienced visible distension.Another study found that among 542 IBS patients reporting bloating, 410 also reported distension.

Visible abdominal distension in patients with functional gut disorders has been attributed, without conclusive evidence, to multiple causes, for example, bacterial overgrowth, visceral hypersensitivity, dysbacteriosis, carbohydrate intolerance, abnormal motility. However, regardless of the underlying causes, the claim of self‐limited episodes of visible abdominal distension may originate by three basic mechanisms: distorted interpretation (patients believe their abdomen is visibly distended without objective evidence), transient increases of abdominal content (intestinal gas being the most likely candidate), or abnormal postural tone of the abdominal walls and redistribution of contents.The latter mechanism, termed abdominophrenic dyssynergia,was described by a series of studies, that measured the activity of the abdominal walls by means of abdominal CT imaging and/or abdominothoracic EMG recording and showed that episodes of abdominal distension were associated with a diaphragmatic push (increased tone and descent of the diaphragm), coupled with reduced tone and protrusion of the anterior abdominal wall.

### Visible abdominal distension in functional gut disorders: objective evaluation [^26de0345]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

3.4 Is abdominal distension produced by a diaphragmatic push (abdominophrenic dyssynergia)?

(a) The activity of the diaphragm measured by EMG (n = 35), was more intense (more tone) during episodes of abdominal distension than during basal conditions (by 50 ± 7%) in all patients but one (8% decrease).

(b) The position of the diaphragm measured by CT (n = 103; diaphragmatic dome not visible in 1 scan) was lower during episodes of abdominal distension than in the basal scan in 82 patients (17 ± 2 mm descent) and above in 21 patients (12 ± 3 mm ascent) (Figure 4); to note, in both groups, changes in abdominal perimeter associated with distension (increase by 22 ± 3 vs 30 ± 3 mm, respectively; p = 0.110) and abdominal gas (Figure 4) were similar. This lack of differences also applied to the extreme cases with more pronounced diaphragmatic ascent (group B in Figure 4) or descent (group C in Figure 4).

3.5 Ancillary observation: involvement of the chest

(a) The activity of the intercostal muscles measured by EMG (n = 76) increased during episodes of distension as compared to basal conditions (by 47 ± 5%) in all but 2 patients (<12% decrease; group B in Figure 2); to note, the physiological action of intercostal contraction is elevation of the costal wall and expansion of the chest.

(b) Anteroposterior diameter of the chest measured by CT (in abdominothoracic scans; n = 47), increased during episodes of distension as compared to basal conditions (by 13 ± 3 mm) in all but 4 patients, who nevertheless exhibited a diaphragmatic descent.

(c) Pulmonary air volume measured by CT (n = 47) increased during the distension episodes as compared to basal conditions (by 491 ± 83 ml) in all but 6 patients.

### Gravity and the gut: a hypothesis of irritable bowel syndrome [^4a30de8b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL (THE BOLSTER)

Whereas the spinal column offers posterior support of the abdominal viscera, the anterior abdominal wall bolsters the peritoneal cavity to prevent its contents from spilling forward in the upright stance. In addition, the abdominal wall contributes to gravity-dependent bloating and distension through a mechanism called abdominophrenic dyssynergia (-). Normally, when gas accumulates in the intestines, the diaphragm relaxes and the anterior abdominal wall contracts to maintain the upright visceral stack against gravity. However, in many people with bloating and distension, intraluminal gas causes paradoxical contraction of the diaphragm, leading to gravity-enabled descent of the peritoneal contents and dyssynergic relaxation of the abdominal wall. This sequence of events can lead to abdominal distension (Figure 7), a physical sign common among patients with IBS.

Figure 7. 
Abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Normally, when the intestines fill with gas, the diaphragm relaxes and the anterior abdominal wall contracts to bolster the abdominal cavity. By contrast, abdominal distension results when the diaphragm contracts, the viscera fall with gravity, and the anterior abdominal wall relaxes, leading to outpouching in the upright position (Image from Lacy B et al.).

### Upper rectus abdominis paralysis after robot-assisted thoracic oncology surgery with cryoanalgesia: a rare complication [^4e54b80e]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall muscles and rectus abdominis muscle innervation.

Central Message

Permanent rectus paralysis after lung surgery is rare but with potentially esthetic repercussions. Patients could benefit from early recognition of lesions responsible for postoperative discomfort.

See Commentaries on pagesand.

Intercostal nerve damage resulting in motor dysfunction is more infrequent compared with sensory loss after thoracic surgery. Considering intercostal nerves as mixed-type nerves, chronic pain incidence is up to 50%,and there is a strong discrepancy in the presence of paralysis. Only a few case reports of paralysis after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) have been published. We report the first case of rectus abdominis atrophy after robot-assisted VATS (RA-VATS).

### Anaesthetic injection versus ischemic compression for the pain relief of abdominal wall trigger points in women with chronic pelvic pain [^acd349f1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial demonstrating the superiority of a local anaesthetic for the treatment of the trigger points in the inferior abdominal wall of women with chronic pelvic pain even though this method has been proven to be effective in the treatment of other myofascial syndromes, and is similar to the effects of the lidocaine patch.

The effects of acute anaesthesia that are promoted by local anaesthetics are well known, and are believed to occur by interrupting nerve excitation and conduction by direct interaction with voltage-gated Na channels. Reduction of inflammation and activation TRPV1 e TRPA1 might explain long term effects of lidocaine. However, we observed that, even after the injections were stopped, the pain relief reported by the subjects who received this intervention was significantly progressive. The present study does not permit us to reach precise conclusions about the mechanisms associated with this continued long-term effect. It is likely that this effect can be explained by the affinity of lidocaine with the Na channel, since it is known that the drug has a low affinity for the channels, when they are in the standby mode and demonstrated higher affinity when they are open and/inactivated. The application of anaesthetics may be associated with the occurrence of skeletal muscle tissue or neural damage. Nevertheless, muscle injury is usually reversible and tissue regeneration occurs within 4 to 6 weeks. Although neurotoxicity may justify the progressive effect of local anaesthetic injections, we did not identify other clinical signs during the study period, such as dysesthesia, paresthesia, or sensorimotor deficits that differ from those reported at baseline. Although we tend to associate pain relief to the presence of a local anaesthetic, we cannot overlook the potential effect of dry needling, it has been shown to be capable to evoking antinociceptive effects by segmental modulation. Although this effect seems to be considerable for a few minutes, it could not completely explain our results. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the dry needle seems to depend on the integrity of the afferent and spinal cord circuitry, which may involve supraspinal pain control via midbrain periaqueductal grey activation, among others. Some studies have demonstrated that this is an effective and safe method for the treatment of trigger points, which may present with effects similar to placebo.

### Avoiding abdominal flank bulge after anterolateral approaches to the thoracolumbar spine: cadaveric study and electrophysiological investigation [^82189c06]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Object

The thoracolumbar junction is frequently accessed through an anterolateral approach with the incision and muscle dissection extending from the lower thoracic region to the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. This approach is frequently associated with the subsequent development of an unsightly and uncomfortable relaxation of the ipsilateral abdominal wall, or flank bulge, caused by denervation injury to the intercostal nerves. However, the etiology of this complication is not widely recognized by spine surgeons. The object of this study was to better define the relevant anatomy and innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall musculature.

Methods

The authors performed 32 cadaveric dissections and 6 intraoperative electromyography (EMG) evaluations.

Results

The cadaveric dissection studies and intraoperative EMG evaluations provided detailed anatomy of the anterolateral abdominal wall and its innervation. Cadaveric dissections revealed that the most significant intercostal nerve contributions to the anterolateral abdominal wall arise from T11 and T12. Electrophysiological confirmation of these findings was accomplished through intraoperative stimulation in 6 patients undergoing anterolateral retroperitoneal approaches to the thoracolumbar junction. The authors confirmed T11 and T12 innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall musculature by direct intraoperative EMG recording in all 6 patients.

Conclusions

The authors classified the 3 potential zones of injury that can be affected during an anterolateral approach to the thoracolumbar junction. Modifications to the operative technique are suggested to avoid the complication of flank bulge. The most significant intercostal nerve contributions to the anterolateral abdominal wall arise from T11 and T12.

### Extended mesh repair with external oblique muscle reinforcement for abdominal wall contour abnormalities following TRAM flap [^85ef9a5f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients undergoing reconstructive surgery after mastectomy opt for reconstruction with the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap. Among the morbidities related to TRAM flap reconstruction is the development of abdominal wall contour abnormalities, including bulges or hernias. Several repair techniques at the flap abdominal wall donor site have been described for use at the time of flap harvest in an attempt to reduce the risk of such abdominal wall complications. For patients that develop abdominal wall contour abnormalities, numerous reconstructive options have been reported, with mixed results. Ten patients were identified as having abdominal wall contour abnormalities after a TRAM flap and underwent an extended mesh repair with external oblique muscle reinforcement. The mesh was secured to the bony landmarks of the lower abdomen and the abdominal wall fascia. All patients achieved complete resolution of abdominal wall bulging. In the follow-up period, no recurrences, infections, or seromas were noted. One patient, who failed an earlier repair at the inferior abdominal wall, reported symptoms consistent with a scar neuroma. Symptoms were treated successfully with gabapentin and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. We propose a novel and reliable method of lower abdominal wall reconstruction for patients with post-TRAM flap abdominal wall contour abnormalities. This technique incorporates the use of a large Marlex mesh reinforced with bilateral external oblique muscle flaps. We report a series of 10 patients who have achieved resolution of their symptoms and have regained a natural, flat-appearing abdominal wall contour.

### Laparoscopic assisted modification of the firlit abdominal wall plication [^4d36c829]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We describe a modification of the Firlit abdominal wall plication procedure for abdominal wall reconstruction in the prune-belly syndrome.

Materials and Methods

Five boys with the prune-belly syndrome and 1 with congenital atrophy or hypotrophy of the internal and external oblique muscles underwent laparoscopic assisted abdominal wall reconstruction.

Results

All 6 patients had excellent cosmetic results, with no weakness or sagging of the abdominal wall.

Conclusions

Laparoscopy appears to add to the Firlit procedure an increased measure of safety and a possible decrease in morbidity associated with opening the abdomen, and improved precision that enhances the results achieved with the original procedure and other abdominal wall repairs.

### Dynamic reconstruction of full-thickness abdominal wall defects using free innervated vastus lateralis muscle flap combined with free anterolateral thigh flap [^d5b9c77c]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of full-thickness abdominal wall defects remains a difficult surgical challenge. Although various reconstructive methods, including artificial mesh, pedicled and free flaps, have been reported, most reported reconstruction of only the fascia layer, leaving the resected rectus abdominis muscle unreconstructed. However, recent studies suggested the importance of dynamic reconstruction with functional muscle in preventing abdominal hernia in the long-term. According to the principle of reconstructive surgery, "replace lost tissue with similar tissue," a functionally and aesthetically ideal reconstruction is to reconstruct all components of the abdominal wall structure, including skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, and muscle. We present 2 cases with full-thickness abdominal wall defects in the upper abdominal region, which we reconstructed with a free innervated vastus lateralis muscle flap combined with a free anterolateral thigh flap. The motor nerve of the vastus lateralis muscle was sutured with the intercostal nerve, and reinnervation was confirmed by electromyography. This method allows reconstruction of all components of the abdominal wall with a single flap, and dynamic reconstruction is achieved which will reduce the risk of postoperative hernia. We believe this method can be a good option for reconstruction of full-thickness abdominal wall defects with long-term stability.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^86bf3bac]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Urodynamics Where the Mechanism May Relate to an Undiagnosed Neurological Condition

Including the results of the neuro‐perineal examination in the urodynamic report may improve the interpretation of the results and potentially support a neurological etiology. Thus, specific training of healthcare professionals for neuro‐urological examination in each potential context is likely to be valuable. In addition, it can identify issues that might influence assessments, for example by highlighting whether the rectum is empty, as it needs to be for both reliable abdominal pressure recording during urodynamic testing and because rectal loading may impair detrusor contractility.

Urodynamic tests can reveal abnormalities which may strongly suggest a neurological lesion. Impairment of the proximal urethral sphincter mechanism in men (open bladder neck) is important. Provided there is no history of a relevant surgical procedure (bladder neck operation, retroperitoneal dissection or sympathectomy), this may suggest a lesion affecting the intermediolateral nucleus in the thoracic cord, or the pathways supplying it. Partial detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia may suggest a lesion in the suprasacral pathways, provided dysfunctional voiding is excluded. Abnormalities of the sphincter EMG suggest a neurological mechanism, though this is evaluated in comparatively few centers.

### Innervation of an engineered muscle graft for reconstruction of muscle defects [^0f6704de]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Autologous muscle flaps are commonly used to reconstruct defects that involve muscle impairment. To maintain viability and functionality of these flaps, they must be properly vascularized and innervated. Tissue-engineered muscles could potentially replace autologous muscle tissue, but still require establishment of sufficient innervation to ensure functionality. In this study, we explored the possibility of innervating engineered muscle grafts transplanted to an abdominal wall defect in mice, by transferring the native femoral nerve to the graft. Six weeks posttransplantation, nerve conduction studies and electromyography demonstrated increased innervation in engineered grafts neurotized with the femoral nerve, as compared to non-neurotized grafts. Histologic assessments revealed axonal penetration and formation of neuromuscular junctions within the grafts. The innervation process described here may advance the fabrication of a fully functional engineered muscle graft that will be of utility in clinical settings.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: a narrative review [^b4c170c6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

There are no current diagnostic criteria for APD (although as aforementioned, functional bloating and distension can be diagnosed by symptoms alone by the Rome IV criteria). The literature documenting APD has used various methods to detect its presence. Barba et al. found that the morphological and volumetric differences observed in abdominothoracic CT scans obtained during periods of severe distension and periods with minimal or no distension are related to the functional differences in EMG activity in the abdominal walls. However, CT and EMG should be reserved for use in patients with suspected intestinal dysmotility and luminal pooling. Other studies have used abdominal inductance plethysmography to measure changes in abdominal girth, ultrasound to assess the movement of the diaphragm, and manometry to monitor esophageal and gastric pressures. Because the abnormal contraction of the diaphragm seems to be an important driver of APD, perhaps ultrasound could provide a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and reliable way to help identify paradoxical diaphragmatic movement reflective of APD.

### Visible abdominal distension in functional gut disorders: objective evaluation [^385ce5dd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Visible abdominal distension has been attributed to: (A) distorted perception, (B) intestinal gas accumulation, or (C) abdominophrenic dyssynergia (diaphragmatic push and anterior wall relaxation).

Methods

A pool of consecutive patients with functional gut disorders and visible abdominal distension included in previous studies (n = 139) was analyzed. Patients (61 functional bloating, 74 constipation‐predominant irritable bowel syndrome and 4 with alternating bowel habit) were evaluated twice, under basal conditions and during a self‐reported episode of visible abdominal distension; static abdominal CT images were taken in 104 patients, and dynamic EMG recordings of the abdominal walls in 76, with diaphragmatic activity valid for analysis in 35.

Key Results

(A) Objective evidence of abdominal distension was obtained by tape measure (increase in girth in 138 of 139 patients), by CT imaging (increased abdominal perimeter in 96 of 104 patients) and by abdominal EMG (reduced activity, i.e. relaxation, in 73 of 76 patients). (B) Intestinal gas volume was within ±300 ml from the basal value in 99 patients, and above in 5 patients, who nevertheless exhibited a diaphragmatic descent. (C) Diaphragmatic contraction was detected in 34 of 35 patients by EMG (increased activity) and in 82 of 103 patients by CT (diaphragmatic descent).

Conclusions and Inferences

In most patients complaining of episodes of visible abdominal distention: (A) the subjective claim is substantiated by objective evidence; (B) an increase in intestinal gas does not justify visible abdominal distention; (C) abdominophrenic dyssynergia is consistently evidenced by dynamic EMG recording, but static CT imaging has less sensitivity.

### Successful abdominal wall reconstruction following liposuction catastrophe: a case report and literature review [^dcc3856c]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Devastating abdominal injuries may result from liposuction, which can lead to necrotizing fasciitis and loss of abdominal domain. This may necessitate reconstructing the abdominal wall to improve the patient's quality of life.

Objectives

The study aims to raise awareness among the readers of this catastrophic complication. Guidelines for preoperative assessment, and intraoperative measures to reduce abdominal complications along with the importance of early recognition, diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies were provided.

Methods

We reported a patient who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction following liposuction-inflicted abdominal injury and necrotizing fasciitis. Subsequently, a literature search was conducted to review abdominal wall reconstructive techniques following liposuction-inflicted abdominal injuries. Algorithms for patient safety followed this.

Results

The patient developed necrotizing fasciitis due to liposuction cannula bowel perforation leading to loss of abdominal domain. This was reconstructed with a transversus abdominis release trial with mesh followed by bilateral pedicled neurotized anterolateral thigh flaps with vastus lateralis. The review of the literature included 10 papers describing different techniques of abdominal reconstruction. Common treatment techniques following liposuction-inflicted abdominal injuries were negative pressure wound therapy and skin grafting.

Conclusions

Anterolateral thigh flaps are an excellent option that provides functional and structural repair. Neurotization of the muscle helps protect the muscle from atrophy. The review of the literature showed a lack of abdominal wall reconstruction using musculocutaneous flaps following liposuction-inflicted abdominal injuries.Communicating symptom awareness to patients and the medical team is essential for quickly identifying potential visceral injury after liposuction, ensuring prompt management and improved outcomes.

Third round consensus for abdominal wall, paraspinal, and chest wall blocks noted weak consensus to harmonize the posterior transversus abdominis plane (TAP) and lateral quadratus lumborum blocks (73%) into a single term, with strong consensus for lateral quadratus lumborum block as the unified term (80%). For paraspinal blocks, there was strong consensus to harmonize STIL, MTP, MIC, and CTF techniques (84%) and strong consensus for the unified anatomical description (86%), but only weak consensus to accept ITP (58%) rather than MTP (42%) as the unified name. The rhomboid intercostal plane block had weak consensus for the name (69%) but strong consensus for the anatomical description (81%). For chest wall blocks, deep and superficial SAP blocks achieved strong consensus on names with 91% and 80% agreement, respectively, yet the superficial SAP anatomical description only achieved weak consensus (52%). Interpectoral plane block name reached weak consensus (73%), higher than the alternative superficial pectoralis minor block (56%); pectorointercostal plane block name had weak consensus (53%) and deep pectoralis minor block had no consensus (46%).

### Necrotizing fasciitis: literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^ad35c542]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In the late phase within 4-6 days, symptoms of septic shock or MODS usually appear. Those symptoms may include cardiac shock with tachycardia, hypotension and decreased cardiac minute output, an elevated white blood cell count, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, changes in mental status and weakness. The patient in the late stage of NF appears apathetic and indifferent. If the patient has an accompanying illness like diabetes, obesity, alcoholism, malignancy, malnutrition or immune deficiency, the general status is compromised with additional symptoms of these illnesses.

As early clinical findings, in the course of our clinical cases, we especially emphasize tenderness, swelling, erythema, and pain. Those clinical symptoms and signs are similar to the course of superficial cellulitis, and it is very difficult to establish an early diagnose of NF at that moment. Nevertheless, a high suspicion must be present in all cases of rapidly progressive cellulitis, associated with severe progressive pain. The hallmark symptoms of NF on the perineum, extremities and posterior CW include intense pain and tenderness over the involved skin and underlying muscle. Over the next several hours and days, local pain can progresses to anesthesia because all cutaneous nerves are destroyed, which depends on the extent of tissue necrosis.

### Subcostal nerve injury after laparoscopic lipoma surgery: an unusual culprit for an unusual complication [^468a1265]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic surgery has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. Nerve injury after laparoscopic surgery is presumably rare, with only scarce reports in the literature; however, the use of these techniques for new purposes presents the opportunity for novel complications. The authors report a case of subcostal nerve injury after an anterior laparoscopic approach to a posterior abdominal wall lipoma.A 62-year-old woman presented with a left abdominal flank bulge (pseudohernia) that developed after laparoscopic posterior flank wall lipoma resection. Imaging demonstrated frank ballooning of the oblique muscles; denervation atrophy and thinning of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis muscles; and thinning of the rectus abdominis muscle. The patient underwent subcostal nerve repair and removal of a foreign plastic material from the laparoscopic procedure. At 8 months, she has regained substantial improvement in abdominal wall strength.Although endoscopic procedures have resulted in significant reduction in morbidity, "minimally invasive" approaches should not be confused with "low risk" when approaching novel pathology. The subcostal nerve is at risk of injury in posterior abdominal wall surgery, whether laparoscopic or not. With the pseudohernia and abdominal bulge after this surgery, the cosmetic appeal of laparoscopic incisions was definitively undone. Selecting an approach based on the anatomy of adjacent structures may lead to a better functional result.

Patients requiring abdominal wall reconstruction may have medical comorbidities and/or complex defects. Comorbidities such as smoking, diabetes, obesity, cirrhosis, and frailty have been associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. Prehabilitation strategies are variably associated with improved outcomes. Large hernia defects and loss of domain may present challenges in achieving fascial closure, an important part of restoring abdominal wall function. Prehabilitation of the abdominal wall can be achieved with the use of botulinum toxin A, and preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum.

### Herpes zoster-induced abdominal wall paresis: neurophysiological examination in this unusual complication [^1e4493d1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster affects essentially sensory fibres with segmental distribution. Abdominal wall paresis is a rare complication.

Aims Of The Study

We present the case of a 72 year-old man with herpes zoster infection in T11-T12 left dermatomes and segmental abdominal wall protrusion.

Methods

Electromyography (EMG) and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) were performed 27 days after symptoms onset.

Results

EMG confirmed acute axonal lesion in left external oblique muscle and left paraspinal muscles at T11-T12 level and DSEPs assessed topographic distribution: there was no response in the left side at T12 dermatome. Three months following the onset of shingles, the abdominal wall protrusion had completely resolved.

Conclusions

Neurophysiological examination, including EMG and DSEPs, confirms motor and sensory loss in this unusual post-herpetic complication.

Central Message

Rectus paralysis is a known complication after robotic thoracic surgery, but is not well described. Although often temporary, patients should be informed of this potential postoperative issue.

See Article page.

The infamous rectus bulge: An often seen but rarely reported complication after robotic assisted thoracoscopic surgery.Although a major benefit of thoracoscopy is the lack of rib spreading leading to less nerve trauma, transient neuralgia is often seen from irritation to the intercostal nerves. Any injury to T7 through T12 intercostal nerves can lead to paresthesia of the rectus,but a low assistant or extraction port that aggravates the lower intercostals (usually T9 and 10) can lead to a paralysis and flaccidity of the ipsilateral abdominal rectus muscle. Although often just an aesthetic issue, this bulge can lead to significant anguish in a patient. Wildemeersch and colleaguespresent a case of persistent rectus abdominis paralysis after robotic-assisted lobectomy, and perform a deep dive into this pesky protuberance.

Wildemeersch and colleaguesdescribe a 55-year-old male patient who underwent a robotic-assisted lobectomy. Ipsilateral rectus paralysis was noted within weeks of surgery, and at 1 year postoperatively, was still present. Quantitative measurements were performed including a computed tomography scan showing decreased muscle thickness compared with the contralateral side at the level of T12 (0.52 vs 1.2 cm), along with decreased muscle density (29 vs 66 HU). An electromyography confirmed denervation of the upper two-thirds of the rectus and external oblique abdominal wall muscles.

What are the possibilities for nerve injury in this case? The authors utilize higher-than-normal port sites compared with many other centers,and the accessory port was only in the seventh intercostal space. Rectus paralysis from these port positions specifically would be unusual. The tumor was also fairly small (1.7 cm), so inadvertent rib spreading during extraction is unlikely. One unique aspect of this case was the utilization of cryoanalgesia, with cryoablation of intercostal nerves 6 through 8. Could the cryoanalgesia be the culprit? It's certainly in the differential.

### A model of neural cross-talk and irritation in the pelvis: implications for the overlap of chronic pelvic pain disorders [^53d5c166]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and other chronic pelvic pain (CPP) disorders often occur concomitantly. Neural cross-talk may play a role in the overlap of CPP disorders via the convergence of pelvic afferents. We investigated the hypothesis that afferent irritation of one pelvic organ may adversely influence and sensitize another via neural interactions.

Methods

We measured pelvic organ smooth muscle and striated muscle reflexes during micturition and colorectal distention (CRD) in urethane-anesthetized rats. The effects of acute cystitis on distal colonic sensory thresholds to CRD and the effects of acute colonic irritation on micturition parameters were assessed.

Results

External urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) was typical for the rat, with phasic firing during micturition. External anal sphincter EMG also showed phasic firing during micturition in synchrony with EUS activity but, in addition, showed both tonic bursts and phasic firing independent of EUS activity. Before bladder irritation, graded CRDs to 40 cm H2O produced no notable changes in abdominal wall EMG activity. Following acute bladder irritation, dramatic increases in abdominal wall EMG activity in response to CRD were observed at much lower distention pressures, indicating colonic afferent sensitization. Analogously, following acute colonic irritation, bladder contraction frequency increased 66%, suggesting sensitization of lower urinary tract afferents.

Conclusions

We report compelling evidence of bidirectional cross-sensitization of the colon and lower urinary tract in a novel experimental model. This cross-sensitization may account for the substantial overlap of CPP disorders; however, further studies are needed to fully characterize these pathways.

### Trunk, abdomen, and pressure sore reconstruction [^e72b69f4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe the principles of wound closure, torso reconstruction, and pressure sore reconstruction. 2. Outline standard options to treat defects of the chest, abdomen, and back and pressure ulcers in all anatomical areas. 3. Manage and prevent pressure ulcers.

Summary

Chest wall reconstruction is indicated following tumor resection, radiation wound breakdown, or intrathoracic sepsis. Principles of wound closure and chest wall stabilization, where indicated, are discussed. Principles of abdominal wall reconstruction continue to evolve with the introduction of newer bioprosthetics and the application of functional concepts for wound closure. The authors illustrate these principles using commonly encountered clinical scenarios and guidelines to achieve predictable results. Pressure ulcers continue to be devastating complications to patients' health and a functional hazard when they occur in the bedridden, in patients with spinal cord injuries, and in patients with neuromuscular disease. Management of pressure ulcers is also very expensive. The authors describe standard options to treat defects of the chest, abdomen, and back and pressure ulcers in all anatomical areas. A comprehensive understanding of principles and techniques will allow practitioners to approach difficult issues of torso reconstruction and pressure sores with a rational confidence and an expectation of generally satisfactory outcomes. With pressure ulcers, prevention remains the primary goal. Patient education and compliance coupled with a multidisciplinary team approach can reduce their occurrence significantly. Surgical management includes appropriate patient selection, adequate débridement, soft-tissue coverage, and use of flaps that will not limit future reconstructions if needed. Postoperatively, a strict protocol should be adapted to ensure the success of the flap procedure. Several myocutaneous flaps commonly used for the surgical management of pressure are discussed. Commonly used flaps in chest and abdominal wall reconstruction are discussed and these should be useful for the practicing plastic surgeon.

### Pain control following inguinal herniorrhaphy: current perspectives [^f248fca4]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy may be performed through a transabdominal or extraperitoneal approach.The IIN and IHN can be identified within the retroperitoneal space over the quadratus lumborum muscle and the GFN over the psoas muscle proximal to the scarred operative field. Endoscopic retroperitoneal selective neurectomies of the GFN and IIN have been reported.As with the open experience, laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy has higher efficacy rates.Advantages of the laparoscopic approach are the ability to access the nerves proximal to the mesh material used during the original herniorrhaphy, more consistent neuroanatomy within the retroperitoneum, and its technical simplicity. Disadvantages of laparoscopic approach are not being able to remove plugs, if any, not being able to resect the lamina propria of the vas in case of associated orchialgia, and potential laxity of the abdominal muscles caused from proximal denervation.

It is critical to clearly explain potential benefits and consequences of operative intervention to manage patient expectations. In addition to the usual operative risks, specific considerations include permanent numbness, the inability to access or identify three nerves, abdominal wall laxity from partial denervation of the oblique muscles, testicular atrophy, numbness in the labia in females that can interfere with sexual sensation, and loss of a cremasteric reflex in male patients.–Patients are specifically advised of the potential for ongoing pain and disability despite successful neurectomy due to the nociceptive component of pain, neuroplasticity, afferent hypersensitivity, and centralization of pain. The development and course of deafferentation hypersensitivity is unpredictable but typically diminishes over time. This operation does not address the nociceptive component caused by meshoma or neuropathic testicular pain. These issues require serious consideration and should be discussed with the patient and adequately recorded.

Image-guided visceral nerve interventions may be critical in the management of visceral pain refractory to medical treatments. Abdominal and pelvic pain is mediated by specific nerves involving specific ganglia. The well-defined location of these ganglia provides important targets for percutaneous image-guided interventions to alleviate chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the anatomy, indications, evidence, and technical and clinical considerations and complications for celiac plexus, superior hypogastric, inferior hypogastric, and ganglion impar block and neurolysis.
