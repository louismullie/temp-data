## Question

How would you explain to a patient that TSH is low-normal and does not require a higher dose (TSH 0.46, free T4 1.8) when he is reporting weight gain and higher glucose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to explain to a patient with weight gain and higher glucose why increasing levothyroxine is not appropriate given TSH 0.46 and free T4 1.8, and to outline safer next steps instead of dose escalation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to validate the patient's concerns and translate the thyroid labs into plain language. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and endocrine guidelines say about treatment targets and the risks of overtreatment. Next, I will review evidence on whether small dose increases help with weight or metabolism. After that, I need to check alternative explanations for weight and glucose changes and consider special situations such as central hypothyroidism. Finally, I will propose a monitored plan and reinforce why maintaining the current dose is safest based on the data and assay considerations.

> Let me first acknowledge the patient's experience and frame the conversation clearly while I verify the key issues in play. Weight gain and rising glucose are common and distressing, and they often prompt questions about thyroid dosing, but I need to ensure we interpret the labs correctly and rely on what improves outcomes before making any change to levothyroxine.

> I will now examine the current thyroid results and translate them. TSH at 0.46 sits at the low end of the population reference interval, which in primary hypothyroidism typically indicates adequate replacement, and free T4 at 1.8 is at the higher end of normal, which further supports biochemical euthyroidism on the current dose rather than under-replacement, aligning with FDA labeling that titration in primary hypothyroidism aims for a normal TSH with clinical euthyroidism [^117QfEeg] [^111Wrp1V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about increasing the dose, because pushing levothyroxine higher when TSH is already low-normal will likely suppress TSH and shift the patient into subclinical hyperthyroidism, which is associated with atrial fibrillation, bone loss, and fractures without proven symptomatic benefit, especially in older adults, so the risk profile becomes unfavorable [^111CgtxG] [^116SUZCg] [^116xmsiu].

> Wait, let me verify whether small dose adjustments within the normal TSH range help with weight or metabolism, because that is often the crux of the request. A randomized, double-blind study that deliberately varied levothyroxine doses to span TSH targets both within and just outside the reference range found no meaningful changes in energy expenditure or body composition, even though participants tended to prefer higher doses subjectively, and contemporary European guidance explicitly advises against minute dose adjustments to modulate body weight or quality of life once TSH is in range because they are not useful [^116SQwNu] [^111cpkBq].

> Let me consider the glucose concern carefully and make sure I do not miss a thyroid–diabetes interaction. Thyroid hormone changes can alter insulin requirements, and in patients on diabetes therapy medication adjustments may be needed when thyroid status changes, but in a biochemically euthyroid patient, rising glucose is more often driven by diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, aging, or other medications rather than a need for more levothyroxine, so I should redirect evaluation toward those factors while avoiding overtreatment that could complicate glycemic control [^1176R1S4] [^111oVG6n].

> I need to ensure I am using the right biochemical target for the right pathophysiology, and here is where I should double-check for central hypothyroidism as a special case. Initially, I thought TSH alone suffices to judge replacement, but wait, if the patient has central hypothyroidism from pituitary or hypothalamic disease, TSH is unreliable for dosing and we must titrate to keep free T4 in the mid to upper normal range, and with a free T4 already high normal, increasing the dose would risk iatrogenic hyperthyroidism rather than help symptoms [^117QfEeg] [^113m2fbv] [^114pwFCV].

> Hold on, I should verify that these labs are valid before anchoring decisions, because assay interference and method variability can mislead. Biotin supplementation can artifactually lower TSH or raise free T4 on some immunoassays, and between-method differences for both TSH and free T4 can be substantial, so I should ask about biotin use, confirm method-specific reference intervals, and repeat testing if there is any doubt before changing therapy [^117QfEeg] [^1153v7mV] [^111Wrp1V].

> Next, I should review a safer, constructive plan that addresses the patient's goals without exposing them to overtreatment risks. I will recommend tracking diet, activity, sleep, and weight trends for several weeks, checking fasting glucose and HbA1c to contextualize the glycemic change, considering nutrition referral, reviewing medications that promote weight gain, and scheduling a thyroid recheck after an appropriate interval since peak effect of any dose change takes about 4 to 6 weeks and stability monitoring should be paced accordingly [^117QfEeg] [^111oVG6n].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite non-thyroid optimization, am I missing another endocrine contributor. If persistent fatigue or weight gain continues with stable euthyroid labs, I should broaden the differential to conditions such as sleep apnea, depression, Cushing physiology, or medication effects rather than escalating levothyroxine contrary to evidence that small up-titrations do not improve weight or quality of life when TSH is already in range [^116SQwNu] [^111cpkBq].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the key takeaways with the patient and commit to close follow-up. The current thyroid profile indicates the dose is already appropriate, and increasing levothyroxine would likely suppress TSH and raise the risk of cardiovascular and skeletal harms without improving weight or glucose, so we will focus on modifiable contributors to weight and glycemia while monitoring thyroid function with attention to assay factors and clinical context, consistent with FDA labeling and guideline recommendations [^117QfEeg] [^111CgtxG] [^116SUZCg] [^111cpkBq].

Your thyroid labs show a **TSH of 0.46** and **free T4 of 1.8**, both within the normal range, meaning your thyroid is working properly and does not explain weight gain or higher glucose. Increasing thyroid hormone when TSH is already low-normal can cause harm, including **heart rhythm problems** and **bone loss** [^116SUZCg], without proven benefit for weight or glucose control. Your symptoms are likely due to **other factors** such as diet, activity, or insulin resistance, so we should address those directly.

---

## Interpretation of thyroid function tests

A TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) of 0.46 mIU/L falls within the typical reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) and indicates normal thyroid function. A free T4 (thyroxine) of 1.8 ng/dL is also normal (0.8–2.0 ng/dL), confirming adequate thyroid hormone levels. Together, these results indicate **euthyroidism** — normal thyroid function [^1117izyA].

---

## Relationship between thyroid function and weight gain

- **Thyroid hormones and metabolism**: Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, and hypothyroidism can cause weight gain [^111oVG6n]. However, your normal thyroid levels mean your thyroid is not causing your weight gain.

- **Evidence from clinical studies**: Research shows that in patients with normal thyroid function [^116SQwNu], thyroid hormone therapy does not significantly affect weight or metabolism.

- **Guideline recommendations**: Guidelines advise against using thyroid hormones [^111cpkBq] to treat obesity or weight gain in patients with normal thyroid function [^111HXJkK].

---

## Relationship between thyroid function and glucose metabolism

Although thyroid hormones influence glucose metabolism [^1176R1S4], normal thyroid levels make them an unlikely cause of higher glucose. There is no evidence that thyroid hormone therapy improves glucose control in euthyroid patients, and guidelines **do not recommend** its use for this purpose.

---

## Risks of increasing thyroid hormone dosage unnecessarily

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause heart rhythm problems, including atrial fibrillation and palpitations [^116SUZCg].

- **Bone health risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause bone loss and increase fracture risk [^111CgtxG].

- **Other risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause anxiety, insomnia, and other hyperthyroid symptoms [^1176R1S4].

---

## Alternative explanations for weight gain and higher glucose levels

Diet, physical inactivity, and stress can contribute to weight gain and elevated glucose. **Insulin resistance** is a common underlying driver in patients with normal thyroid function. Certain medications can also promote weight gain and hyperglycemia [^111oVG6n].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Focus on healthy eating, regular physical activity, and weight management [^111oVG6n].

- **Glucose monitoring**: Regularly monitor glucose levels and discuss management strategies with your healthcare provider [^1176R1S4].

- **Further evaluation**: Consider evaluation for insulin resistance or other metabolic conditions that may explain your symptoms [^1117izyA].

---

Your thyroid function is normal, so your symptoms are likely due to other factors. Increasing thyroid hormone is **not recommended** [^111cpkBq] and could cause harm [^116SUZCg]. Let's focus on lifestyle changes and evaluating other causes to address your weight and glucose concerns.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, particularly in relation to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving quality of life or modulating body weight, as they are not useful.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) with free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction remains controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in approximately 2 percent of the population.

Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients; however, screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is strong evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

- **Recommendations**:
	3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed [2|⊕○○].

	3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting [2|⊕⊕○].

- **3.3.6–3.3.7 Evidence**:
	- By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

- **3.4 Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH**:

	- **Recommendations**:
		3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% following a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test [1|⊕○○].

		3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose [1|⊕⊕⊕].

		3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114BKbC3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogeneous disorder. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment, so untreated severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) results in neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and coordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation.

Screening programs, which have been in operation over the last 30 years in most industrialized countries, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment, with about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening compared to about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies. CH can be classified according to site.

### Clinical review: Central hypothyroidism: pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges [^115D3Sp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Central hypothyroidism can be associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms, including diabetes insipidus, sweating, pituitary apoplexy, adrenal insufficiency, decreased serum free T4, weight gain, traumatic brain injury, hypothyroidism, decreased thyrotropin-releasing hormone, muscle cramps, hemochromatosis, stroke, and radiation therapy to the head area. Other associations include hypopituitarism, headaches, Sheehan's syndrome, pituitary tumors, decreased serum TSH, hypogonadism, fatigue, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), acromegaly, cold intolerance, decreased serum free T3, and pituitary mass.

### Hypopituitarism and pregnancy: Clinical characteristics, management and pregnancy outcome [^116FJX7z]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, a strict follow-up is essential to assess and adjust the dosage of every hormonal replacement treatment. Clinical practice guidelines on hypopituitarism management recommend assessing free T4 levels every 4–6 weeks to adjust levothyroxine dosage and maintain free T4 within normal ranges. Levothyroxine requirements during pregnancy may differ depending on the cause of hypothyroidism. Due to the TSH effect of hCG by binding to the TSH receptor, patients with secondary hypothyroidism could require a lower dose increment compared to those with primary hypothyroidism. Alternatively, the thyroid gland may not respond appropriately to hCG due to chronic lack of TSH stimulus.

In this report, the observed average increase in levothyroxine dose during pregnancy in women receiving pre-pregnancy treatment (71.7%) is well above reported values, classically described as 25–30%. The cessation of GH treatment should have little impact considering the progressive appearance of placental GH. If any impact occurs, it should be in the direction of a lower increment. Overall, results do not suggest that women with hypothyroidism due to panhypopituitarism have lower requirements of levothyroxine during pregnancy.

### Reference intervals in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction: Treating patients not numbers [^1117izyA]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on clinical trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomized manner.

Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: A request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^1153v7mV]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

For free thyroxine (fT4), the variability is substantial. Standardization will change results significantly — perhaps as much as 80% at the upper limit of the normal range — for some assays. For thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the alterations introduced by harmonization will be milder, approximately 20%. The Committee, comprising laboratory professionals and manufacturers, has received a positive response for this approach from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), albeit with the caveat to investigate the risks associated with changes in the numerical results for some of the assays.

To this end, we are reaching out to stakeholders to seek views on the benefits and risks arising from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

- **Benefits**: We wish to learn about the benefits that you think would be achieved if all fT4 and TSH assays gave comparable results on patient samples.

- **Risks**: We wish to learn about the risks to patient safety and clinical outcomes that you think may arise as a consequence of a change in the numerical results for patients with thyroid disorders who are being followed, despite appropriate adjustments of the reference intervals. Particular attention should be paid to the question of whether standardization for uncomplicated hypo- and hyperthyroidism may detract from assay differences for important clinical populations, including individuals with nonthyroidal illness, as well as elderly and pregnant individuals.

- **Implementation**: We wish to hear your views on how clinical laboratories can minimize the identified risks from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

### Synthroid [^117QfEeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important considerations for dosing**: The dosage of Synthroid for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on various factors, including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (such as pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food, and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors, and dosage adjustments should be based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Adult patients with primary hypothyroidism**: Titrate Synthroid until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism**: Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of Synthroid dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Instead, use the serum free-T4 level to titrate Synthroid dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Biotin consideration**: Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least two days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.10)].

- **Peak therapeutic effect**: The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of Synthroid may not be attained for four to six weeks.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^114pwFCV]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, and specifically assessing treatment response, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend titrating up the levothyroxine dose under several conditions:

- **Pregnancy**: The dose should be adjusted to meet the increased hormonal demands.
- **Controlled ovarian stimulation**: Medication adjustments may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.
- **Pubertal development**: Changes in hormone levels during puberty may require dose modifications.
- **Weight gain**: Adjustments should address altered metabolic requirements.
- **Retarded psychomotor and cognitive development in infants and children**: Ensure developmental milestones are appropriately supported.
- **Introduction of GH replacement therapy**: Hormonal interactions necessitate careful dose management.
- **Introduction of estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives**: These can affect thyroid hormone levels and absorption.
- **Introduction of treatments impacting levothyroxine absorption or thyroid hormone metabolism**: Monitoring and adjustments ensure effective treatment.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: A review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4), affects up to 10% of the adult population.

- **Observations**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may experience cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^113dyyPY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism patients with different thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a study was conducted at an endocrine clinic.

A total of 116 patients were regularly followed up from January 2010 to December 2020. Patients were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function: Group A with TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L, and Group B with TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L but < 100 mIU/L, among other classifications. The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized according to each patient's TSH level and then adjusted based on thyroid function at every follow-up. The levothyroxine dosage was compared between groups at each time point, along with assessments of thyroid function and physical and neurological development after treatment.

Results showed that after individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), the development remained within the normal range for all groups.

In conclusion, an individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect as the recommended dosage and may also reduce the risk of drug overdose.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges.

This strategy has not remained unchallenged, and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labeled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: Joint British Thyroid Association/Society for Endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomized trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focused on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments.

The statement emphasizes several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement, but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism, should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimized, aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below the reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been evaluated, further adjustments may be necessary to improve their condition.

Regarding medical management for subclinical hypothyroidism, specifically concerning indications for treatment, the BMJ 2019 guidelines recommend not initiating thyroid replacement therapy in adult patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations [^116SUZCg]. Clinical endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). It is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l). We suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys.

There are several causes for this picture, including endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects, and concomitant non-thyroidal illness. Treatments commonly used in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH, but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Effects of altering levothyroxine dose on energy expenditure and body composition in subjects treated with LT4 [^116SQwNu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

It is unclear whether variations in thyroid status within or near the reference range affect energy expenditure, body mass, or body composition.

- **Methods**: 138 subjects treated with levothyroxine (LT4) for hypothyroidism with normal TSH levels underwent measurement of total, resting, and physical activity energy expenditure; thermic effect of food; substrate oxidation; dietary intake; and body composition. They were assigned to receive an unchanged, higher, or lower LT4 dose in a randomized, double-blind fashion, targeting one of three TSH ranges (0.34 to 2.50, 2.51 to 5.60, or 5.61 to 12.0 mU/L). The doses were adjusted every 6 weeks to achieve target TSH levels. Baseline measures were reassessed at 6 months.

- **Results**: At the study end, the mean LT4 doses and TSH levels were 1.50 ± 0.07, 1.32 ± 0.07, and 0.78 ± 0.08 µg/kg (P < 0.001) and 1.85 ± 0.25, 3.93 ± 0.38, and 9.49 ± 0.80 mU/L (P < 0.001), respectively, in the three arms. No substantial metabolic differences in outcome were found among the three arms, although direct correlations were observed between decreases in thyroid status and decreases in resting energy expenditure for all subjects. The subjects could not ascertain how their LT4 dose had been adjusted, but they perceived their preferred LT4 dose to be higher (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Altering LT4 doses in subjects with hypothyroidism to vary TSH levels in and near the reference range did not have major effects on energy expenditure or body composition. Subjects treated with LT4 preferred the perceived higher LT4 doses despite a lack of objective effect.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations with persistently suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake, or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in the release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake.

Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, and increased mortality. They also examine whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves into overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. This report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based on the literature and the authors' experience.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113m2fbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, and specifically concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend adjusting levothyroxine doses to avoid low or elevated free T4 levels to mitigate the potential long-term cardiovascular risks associated with insufficient or excess thyroid hormone treatment. Do not use serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CeH.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115iuzjg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy. The typical starting dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day, with adjustments based on clinical context, age, and free T4 levels, to achieve serum free T4 levels in the mid-to-upper half of the reference range.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114Mf3dw]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Over the past five decades, testing for TSH and TH (T4 and T3) has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays performed in individual assay tubes to nonisotopic IMA tests made on highly automated immunoassay systems that provide substantial clinical utility. Analytes of interest can be quantified if appropriate reference measurement systems and certified standard materials are used. Within- and between-laboratory proficiency testing methods can provide insight into the performance of a particular method, provided commutable samples are used. Unfortunately, these basic prerequisites are not yet implemented or regularly used.

Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement to properly order and interpret thyroid tests. There is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. In most geographic areas, the laboratory receives a test request containing information relating to patient identification that is missing clinical and pharmacological information and the circumstances prompting the test request. It can be critical for the laboratory to have this missing information given the various idiosyncratic analytical interferences that affect thyroid test reliability, discussed in this review. For their part, the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interferences.

Furthermore, given the persistence of between-method differences, the laboratory should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115MVPFW]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests — thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) measurement — is open to question, and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. The ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care.

This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, considering geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated.

### Levothyroxine sodium [^116MejNb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

	- **Mechanism of action**: Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

	- **Pharmacodynamics**: Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.

	- **Pharmacokinetics**:

		- **Distribution**: Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). High credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24-month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers, and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

- **Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication**: If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range), a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care. If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine therapy in patients with pituitary disease and low/normal free T4 levels suspected to have mild CeH if suggestive symptoms are present, or monitoring free T4 levels over time and initiating treatment if the free T4 level decreases by ≥ 20%.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

After excluding confounding causes, such as measurement interference and effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies, genuinely raised, circulating free T4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic condition (RTHβ) or an acquired one (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma). Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (approximately 230 known) heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and the magnitude or pattern of elevation in free thyroid hormones or TSH concentrations, do not distinguish between these disorders. Although a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should theoretically differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to earlier detection, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and associated with a scarcity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ, and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically proven RTHβ cases.

### Patients treated for hyperthyroidism are at increased risk of becoming obese: Findings from a large prospective secondary care cohort [^113YxfFr]. Thyroid (2019). High credibility.

The most commonly reported symptom of hyperthyroidism is weight loss, but successful treatment often leads to weight gain. While weight gain in patients with hyperthyroidism is generally considered a simple reaccumulation of premorbid weight, many patients perceive a significant weight "overshoot" linked to the treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether weight gain following hyperthyroidism treatment reflects merely the replenishment of premorbid weight or an "overshoot" beyond expected regain. Additionally, we investigated whether excessive weight gain is associated with the specific treatment modality applied.

- **Methods**: We calculated the risk of obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m²) following treatment for hyperthyroidism by comparing the BMI of 1,373 patients with overt hyperthyroidism in a secondary care setting to an age- and sex-matched background population (Health Survey for England, 2007–2009). We further examined the effects of treatment with an antithyroid drug (ATD) alone compared to the combination of ATD with radioactive iodine (¹³¹I) therapy. Longitudinal weight data was modeled in relation to the treatment pathway, thyroid function, and the need for long-term thyroxine replacement.

- **Results**: During the treatment of hyperthyroidism, men gained an average of 8.0 kg (standard deviation ± 7.5), while women gained 5.5 kg (± 6.8). At discharge, there was a significant increase in the risk of obesity among both male (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval 1.3–2.2], p < 0.001) and female patients (1.3, 1.2–1.5, p < 0.001) compared to the background population. Treatment with ¹³¹I was associated with…

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: In patients planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including assisted reproduction).

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: During the first trimester of pregnancy.

- **Serum TSH > 3.0 mIU/L**: During the second trimester of pregnancy.

- **Serum TSH > 3.5 mIU/L**: During the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^114shraW]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

In athyreotic or atrophic thyroid patients on LT4 after thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment, patients with normal TSH levels had relatively low serum fT3 levels, whereas patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels. The question arises as to which of such two patient groups is in a euthyroid condition. The extensive literature on "subclinical hyperthyroidism" has demonstrated an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, as well as low bone density and fractures in patients who have low TSH levels while receiving LT4. Moreover, in athyreotic patients with normal TSH and low T3 levels, the relatively higher serum T4 levels that accompany LT4 monotherapy seem to result in normal T3 receptor occupancy and TSH in pituitary thyrotrophs. On the other hand, in peripheral tissues, the relatively higher serum T4 levels could impair intracellular T3 production via downregulation of D2. In fact, an animal study has shown that LT4 alone administered to thyroidectomized rats at doses to normalize plasma TSH levels does not normalize T3 content in some tissues. In another study of rats, Werneck et al. reported that a combination of high serum T4 and low serum T3 levels during T4 monotherapy had consequences for thyroid hormone action, as reflected in the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, all of which exhibited indications of hypothyroidism despite normal serum TSH levels. In a previous study conducted in humans, we compared serum levels of lipoproteins, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and bone metabolic markers before and after thyroidectomy.

### Hypothyroidism: Diagnosis and treatment [^111oVG6n]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening (myxedema coma); more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial.

Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e. take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management. Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than the normal range.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117Uf2Sh]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 ETA guidelines provide directives on follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, particularly emphasizing laboratory follow-up. It is recommended to monitor free T4 and TSH during childhood at least every two years and annually thereafter in patients under follow-up for hypothalamic-pituitary disease. Central hypothyroidism (CeH) should be suspected when serum free T4 falls in the lower quartile of the normal range. This is especially true when there is a decrease of more than 20% in free T4 values compared to previous measurements, provided the variables are measured using the same assay, despite low or normal TSH levels.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114JMDmQ]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

This document aims to provide a state-of-the-art status report on the progress achieved in thyroid testing, including thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). The target audience for this document includes general practitioners, endocrinologists, and laboratory professionals. It is not a systematic review or a guidance document addressing currently encountered diagnostic and clinical challenges related to these three key parameters of thyroid testing. It does not cover the use of thyroid antibodies for investigating the etiology of thyroid dysfunction, or the use of thyroglobulin as a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer or the investigation of primary congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

- **Key clinical points for interpreting thyroid tests**: Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text, if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

### Thyroid function variation in the normal range, energy expenditure, and body composition in L-T4-treated subjects [^1166KHbN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the upper limits of the thyrotropin (TSH) reference range should be lowered. This debate can be better informed by investigating whether variations in thyroid function within the reference range have clinical effects. Thyroid hormone plays a critical role in determining energy expenditure, body mass, and body composition. Therefore, clinically relevant variations in these parameters may occur across the normal range of thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of 140 otherwise healthy hypothyroid subjects receiving chronic replacement therapy with levothyroxine (L-T4) who had TSH levels across the full span of the laboratory reference range (0.34 to 5.6 mU/L). Subjects underwent detailed tests of energy expenditure (total and resting energy expenditure, thermic effect of food, physical activity energy expenditure), substrate oxidation, diet intake, and body composition.

- **Results**: Subjects with low-normal (≤ 2.5 mU/L) and high-normal (> 2.5 mU/L) TSH levels did not differ in any of the outcome measures. However, across the entire group, serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were directly correlated with resting energy expenditure, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, and visceral fat mass, indicating clinically relevant variations in these outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Variations in thyroid function within the laboratory reference range have clinically relevant correlations with resting energy expenditure, BMI, and body composition in L-T4-treated subjects. However, salutary effects of higher fT3 levels on energy expenditure may be observed.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: Which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4 [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

- **Objective**: To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: We analyzed conTSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4,568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

- **Results**: In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115woo8n]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Reverse T3 measurements

Unlike the active T4 metabolite T3, rT3 is an inactive metabolite of T4 as it does not bind or compete with T3 at the T3 receptor. Measurement of rT3 is widely cited in the lay press as a potential marker to guide T4 or T3 therapy; however, there is currently no evidence to support this application. Serum rT3 typically rises as T3 falls during nonthyroidal illness; consequently, measurement of rT3 adds little to this diagnosis unless nonthyroidal illness is confounding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

However, as rT3 assays are not widely available, measurement of T3 is more practical, cheaper, and as effective as measuring rT3 if nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected. Other uses of rT3 analysis and the calculation of the serum rT3/T3 ratio are confined to the diagnosis of rare genetic thyroid conditions and the diagnosis of the rare consumptive hypothyroidism syndrome due to the overexpression of deiodinase enzyme 3. Except for these three uncommon situations, there is no need to measure rT3 in routine clinical practice.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on the appropriate use of thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction, citing a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating thyroid dysfunction, particularly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned this may dissuade physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the nonspecific nature of thyroid-associated symptoms, accurate diagnosis requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to emphasize the distinction between screening and case-based testing in clinical medicine practice. We recommend frequently considering thyroid dysfunction as a potential cause for many nonspecific complaints encountered by physicians. Successful and safe interventions depend on accurate diagnosis. Therefore, we advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, focusing on identifying individuals most likely to benefit from thyroid disease treatment.

### Levothyroxine replacement doses are affected by gender and weight, but not age [^116MHcEx]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight (BW) and age have been shown to affect the dose of levothyroxine (LT(4)) that results in normalization of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients. Our objective was to determine whether gender, menstrual status, and ideal BW (IBW) also affect the LT(4) dose required to achieve a serum TSH within the normal range.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients being treated for primary hypothyroidism who had TSH values within a normal range. We selected patients aged 18–85 years who were taking LT(4) without any confounding medications and who had no serious chronic conditions. Their LT(4) doses, referred to here as LT(4) dose requirements, based on both BW and IBW were documented. The relationship between gender, menstrual status, age, serum TSH concentrations, and the degree of overweight on LT(4) dose requirements were determined using multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Women were significantly more overweight than men (ratio of BW/IBW was 1.35 for women vs. 1.17 for men, p < 0.0001). LT(4) requirements based on BW did not differ by gender when age was included in the model. However, when the degree of overweight was also included, men required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.51 μg/kg, p = 0.038) and menopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.49 μg/kg, p = 0.023). When examining IBW using a model incorporating age, men also required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.92 μg/kg, p = 0.0033) and menopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.90 μg/kg, p = 0.0024).

### Optimal free thyroxine levels for thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroidism [^116VJdoJ]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether a difference exists in the free thyroxine level required to achieve a normal thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level between patients with primary hypothyroidism and euthyroid control subjects, and to compare the free thyroxine levels in patients with primary and secondary hypothyroidism receiving thyroid hormone replacement.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively assessed TSH and free thyroxine values in 58 patients with primary hypothyroidism and 78 euthyroid control subjects for whom screening thyroid function tests had been performed. From the medical records, we also obtained free thyroxine values for 23 patients with central hypothyroidism receiving stable levothyroxine replacement therapy.

- **Results**: The mean free thyroxine level was significantly higher in patients with primary hypothyroidism than in euthyroid control subjects (1.36 ± 0.201 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001), whereas the corresponding mean TSH concentrations did not differ significantly (1.60 ± 1.183 mIU/L versus 1.73 ± 0.792 mIU/L; p = 0.46). The mean free thyroxine value was also significantly higher in the patients with central hypothyroidism in comparison with that in the euthyroid control subjects (1.31 ± 0.278 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001), and no significant difference was noted between the patients with primary and central hypothyroidism (1.36 ng/dL versus 1.31 ng/dL; p = 0.60).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with hypothyroidism require a higher level of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH value.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2023 guidelines outline the medical management of congenital hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine treatment goals. These guidelines recommend maintaining serum TSH within the age-specific reference range after initial normalization. Additionally, serum fT4 levels should be kept in the upper half of the age-specific reference range, unless achieving such a level would result in a TSH level falling below the reference range.

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: A retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible, and prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy is crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose.

The study was retrospective and conducted in a tertiary academic hospital involving 109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism. The interventions compared a rapid versus conventional titration strategy. The main outcome measures were the time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

- **Results**: Patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval, 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile. Predicted LT4 dose at euthyroid state (µg/kg/day) = (-0.016×body weight) + (0.109×baseline TSH lev…

### Growth hormone replacement improves thyroxine biological effects: Implications for management of central hypothyroidism [^114xkWYH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The biological significance of GH-induced changes in serum TH concentrations is unknown. It has been suggested that serum free T(4) (FT(4)) should be targeted at the high-normal range during GH replacement.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to evaluate the effects of GH replacement on T(4) biological effects.

- **Hypothesis**: If GH modulates thyroxine biological effects, serum FT(4) should be targeted accordingly.

- **Design and setting**: We conducted observational (study 1) and interventional (studies 2 and 3)/outpatient studies.

- **Patients**: Thirty-two GH-deficient patients (13 off GH; 22 on l-T(4)) participated in the study.

- **Interventions**: In study 2, levothyroxine was administered to increase FT(4) (> 1.0 ng/dl). In study 3, GH was administered or withdrawn.

- **Main outcome measures**: We measured FT(4), total T(3) (TT(3)), myocardial isovolumic contraction time (ICT), and resting energy expenditure (REE).

Results showed that in study 1, both the off-GH and on-GH groups had similar FT(4) levels. However, the off-GH group displayed lower TT(3) levels (P < 0.01), lower REE (P = 0.02), and higher ICT (P < 0.05) compared to the on-GH group and controls. On GH, ICT and REE correlated only with TT(3) (r = -0.48; r = 0.58; P < 0.05). When off GH, ICT correlated only with FT(4) (P < 0.01).

In study 2, during the off-GH phase, levothyroxine administration increased FT(4) (P = 0.005) and TT(3) (P = 0.012), decreased ICT (P = 0.006), and increased REE (P = 0.013). Changes in ICT and FT(4) were correlated (r = -0.72; P = 0.06). In the on-GH phase, levothyroxine increased FT(4) (P = 0.0002), TT(3) (P = 0.014), and REE (P = 0.10), while decreasing ICT (P = 0.049); changes in REE and TT(3) were correlated (r = 0.60; P < 0.05).

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113AV4mB]. European thyroid journal (2025). High credibility.

In the medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine therapy and maintenance dosing, the ETA 2025 guidelines advise recognizing that altered thyroid function tests in previously well-controlled hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine may be due to transient interference from specific foods or changes in dietary habits. It is recommended to retest thyroid function in non-pregnant patients before increasing the dose of levothyroxine.

The comparability and quality assessment of fT4 and TSH assays is crucial. The results of hormone assays must be reliable due to their significant clinical impact on diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of patients' health and disease. Therefore, ensuring their specificity, accuracy, and precision requires external reference points, standardized and certified reference materials, and regular documented proficiency testing. Compliance with the methods used in each laboratory with the International Guideline ISO 17511:2020 on harmonization should be sought, as this will ensure that the results for patient samples are traceable to the SI units or the highest available standards.

- **The need for standardization and harmonization**: TH laboratory results should ideally be comparable over time and location, and independent of the method used. In 2017, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee of Standardization of Thyroid Function Tests (IFCC C-STFT) documented the comparability status of results for both fT4 and TSH assays from 13 of 15 assay manufacturers. Depending on the selected assay reagents and equipment, laboratory results may differ by up to 50% for both fT4 and TSH. If method-specific reference intervals are not employed, the classification of a numerical test result may vary depending on the assay used.

Regarding medical management for subclinical hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering a daily dose of levothyroxine ranging from 25 to 75 mcg, depending on the degree of thyroid stimulating hormone elevation. Further adjustments should be guided by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations, including thyroid stimulating hormone values.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^114VwJPF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

- **Methods**: With the use of a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (i.e. therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. By using a Cox proportional hazard model, gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

- **Results**: Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not associated significantly with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. Levothyroxine dose > 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < 0.001), indicating a higher risk of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone values with higher dosages.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can, in most cases, be easily diagnosed using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality, cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because a delay in initiating treatment results in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turnaround time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different. Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge. Additionally, newborns between the ages of 3 days and…

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible. A methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115QsyGh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The protocol of the LT4 absorption test involves a simulated alteration of serum total T4 levels. Before conducting the test, a patient's medical history should be reviewed to rule out any conditions that may impair LT4 bioavailability. The process begins with the patient fasting overnight, after which they ingest a high dose of LT4 in tablet form, with water. The standardized dose is determined by the patient's age and body mass index (BMI), specifically 1000 µg for patients aged between 18 and 65 with a BMI under 65.

Blood specimens are collected over a 6-hour period at specific intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours) and tested for total T4 and TSH levels. Throughout the test, the patient is not allowed to consume food or medication. At the end of the test, the patient's vital signs and symptoms are reassessed. The duration of the LT4 absorption test can be extended to 72 hours postdosing without fasting or shortened to 2 hours.

The percentage of LT4 absorption is calculated using the formula: % Absorbed = [Increment TT4 (µg/dL) × 10/total administered LT4 (µg)] × Vd (L) × 100. Increment TT4 is defined as the difference between peak TT4 and baseline TT4 levels, while Vd (volume of distribution) is calculated as 0.442 × BMI. A percentage absorption of 60% indicates a diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption.

Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that replacement therapy is typically taken for life, except in cases of transient hypothyroidism usually associated with thyroiditis or in patients on a therapeutic trial of the drug.

- **Reporting of symptoms**: Patients should immediately report any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity during therapy, such as chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual events.

- **Concomitant diabetes mellitus**: If a patient has both diabetes mellitus and is undergoing thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward adjustment of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent dosage may be necessary to prevent hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.

- **Concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy**: The prothrombin time should be measured frequently, and dosage adjustments of oral anticoagulants may be needed.

- **Thyroid function testing**: Patients should discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before conducting thyroid function tests.

- **Transient hair loss in children**: Partial hair loss may occur in children during the first few months of thyroid therapy, but it is usually a transient phenomenon, with recovery typically being the rule.

### SPL drug information for levothyroxine sodium [^115v7TfK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Levothyroxine sodium IV (also known as Synthroid) is generally acceptable for use in pregnant patients across all trimesters. Clinical experience at the time of writing indicates no adverse fetal effects when thyroid hormones, including levothyroxine, are administered during pregnancy. It is crucial to maintain thyroid replacement therapy for hypothyroid women throughout pregnancy. Thyroid hormones undergo minimal placental transfer.

- **Monitoring during pregnancy**: Measure TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester to gauge the adequacy of thyroid replacement dosage. During pregnancy, thyroid requirements may increase. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range.

- **Postpartum considerations**: Immediately after obstetric delivery, the dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose. Monitor thyroid function tests, specifically TSH, at 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to assess for needed adjustments.

### Serum thyrotropin and triiodothyronine levels in levothyroxine-treated patients [^114z2paj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Small adjustments in levothyroxine (LT4) dose do not appear to provide clinical benefit despite changes in thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range. We hypothesize that the accompanying changes in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) levels do not reflect the magnitude of the changes in serum TSH.

- **Objective**: This work aims to characterize the relationships of serum free thyroxine (FT4) vs. T3, FT4 vs. TSH, and FT4 vs. the T3/FT4 ratio.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional, observational study comprised 9,850 participants aged 18 years and older treated with LT4 from a large clinical database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Patients had been treated with LT4, subdivided by serum FT4 level. Main outcome measures included model fitting of the relationships between serum FT4 vs. TSH, FT4 vs. T3, and FT4 vs. T3/FT4. Mean and median values of TSH, T3, and T3/FT4 were calculated.

- **Results**: The relationships T3 vs. FT4 and TSH vs. FT4 were both complex and best represented by distinct, segmented regression models. Increasing FT4 levels were linearly associated with T3 levels until an inflection point at an FT4 level of 0.7 ng/dL, after which a flattening of the slope was observed following a convex quadratic curve. In contrast, increasing FT4 levels were associated with steep declines in TSH following two negative sigmoid curves. The FT4 vs. T3/FT4 relationship was fit to an asymptotic regression curve supporting less T4 to T3 activation at higher FT4 levels.

- **Conclusion**: In LT4-treated patients, the relationships between serum FT4 vs. TSH and FT4 vs. T3 across a range of values indicate specific patterns in hormone interaction and conversion rates.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity, defined by normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level suppressed below the normal range, usually undetectable. The TSH value is typically measured using a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may exist as a distinct clinical entity, partially related to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter.

Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism typically do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed, and thyroid function tests conducted as part of the assessment for subclinical hyperthyroidism. This evaluation helps in understanding the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs, such as the heart and bone.

A reasonable treatment option for many patients includes a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months, aiming to induce remission. Further research into the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114yH4KX]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests — thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) measurement — is open to question, and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. The ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care.

This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence, and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be developed and implemented to enhance the accuracy and reliability of thyroid function tests.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: A 10-year clinical retrospective study [^115Wxkf1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism patients with different thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a total of 116 patients who were regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020 were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function:

- **Group A**: TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L
- **Group B**: TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L
- **Group C**: TSH between 4.6 mIU/L and 6.6 pmol/L

The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and was then adjusted according to their thyroid function at every follow-up time point. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between the groups. Additionally, thyroid function and physical and neurological development after treatment were also compared.

After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), development was within the normal range for all groups.

An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect compared to the recommended dosage. This strategy may also reduce the risk of a drug overdose.
